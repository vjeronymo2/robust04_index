			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS OXNARD HARBOR DISTRICT;  </P> <P> 3 CHALLENGERS SEEK TO OUST INCUMBENTS FROM COMMISSION  </P> <P> In reading over the last year's minutes of the Oxnard Harbor District  Commission, candidate Faith Cosby said she discovered evidence of an unusual  single-mindedness among its members.  </P> <P> On every vote recorded in the last 12 months, there was absolute unanimity  among the five commissioners who govern the Port of Hueneme and have been  weighing a $90-million port modernization project, Cosby said.  </P> <P> Cosby, 51, an Oxnard real estate broker, charged that the commission is a  "rubber-stamp" for the port's executive director, Anthony Taormina. "There's  been not one dissenting vote on anything in the last year," Cosby said.  </P> <P> In seeking to unseat three incumbents Tuesday, Cosby and fellow challengers  Raymond E. Fosse and William E. Bradley are raising voices of dissent.  </P> <P> But since the district's formation in 1937, voters have never rejected an  incumbent harbor commissioner, according to Ventura County records.  Commissioner Stanley J. Daily, who is seeking reelection, said the incumbents'  success shows that voters have been satisfied with the commission's performance  since its inception.  </P> <P> "The record of the harbor district and the running of the harbor district has  been exemplary and the incumbents, based on that, have not only won but won  handily," said Daily, a 13-year commissioner and former Camarillo mayor who is  also running for the Camarillo City Council.  </P> <P> Fosse, a 52-year-old ship's pilot at the U.S. Naval Station at Port Hueneme,  said incumbents are returned to office because the harbor district elections  generate little attention. Nearly half the county's registered voters are  entitled to cast ballots in the contest, but few are interested in the port,  even though it pours an estimated $200 million into the county's economy each  year, said Fosse, who has lined up endorsements from several labor unions.  </P> <P> Daily and Commissioners Edward J. Millan and Steve W. Stocks -- the other  incumbents seeking to retain their seats -- said the major campaign issue is  whether the district's boundaries should be shrunk, as advocated by the Local  Agency Formation Commission of Ventura County.  </P> <P> The district now includes Camarillo, parts of Thousand Oaks and unincorporated  areas of Ventura County, as well as Port Hueneme and Oxnard. LAFCO, which voted  to condense the boundaries to Oxnard and Port Hueneme, was sued by the  district, Daily and Millan, who as Camarillo residents claimed that their right  to serve as commissioners had been violated.  </P> <P> Millan, 59, the port's general manager for 16 years before retiring and winning  election to the commission in 1986, said residents in the disenfranchised area  should be allowed to vote on breaking from the district. His position is shared  by Stocks, 65, of Oxnard. Stocks, a trustee of the Oxnard Union High School  District and former principal and assistant superintendent in that district,  was appointed to a vacant commission seat earlier this year.  </P> <P> As for unanimity, Daily said commissioners were united in all votes in the last  year not because they are lackeys of the port administration, as his opponents  claim, but because their two-member committees resolved potential conflicts in  meetings with port staff before the commissioners voted in public sessions.  </P> <P> "Many problems are ironed out before things are brought to the board with a  recommendation," said Daily, whose dual candidacy was questioned as a conflict  of interest and later sanctioned in an informal legal opinion from a county  attorney.  </P> <P> The challengers insist that the issue is the commission itself and the "old-boy  network" that has resulted in three former administrators and schoolteachers  from the Oxnard high school district serving on the board, including Daily and  Stocks, who were appointed on the recommendations of present or past  commissioners with whom they worked in the schools.  </P> <P> "When they come into the public meetings, they have pretty much made up their  minds," said Bradley, 65, a retired insurance executive from Oxnard.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK MARK;  </P> <P> COMING OUT UNDER FIRE;  </P> <P> THE U.S. MILITARY'S ACTIVE PERSECUTION OF HOMOSEXUALS DURING WORLD WAR II LAID  THE GROUNDWORK FOR TODAY'S GAY-RIGHTS MOVEMENT. IN HIS BOOK, 'COMING OUT UNDER  FIRE: THE HISTORY OF GAY MEN AND WOMEN IN WORLD WAR II,' ALLAN BERUBE EXPLAINS.  </P> <P> The massive mobilization for World War II propelled gay men and lesbians into  the mainstream of American life. Ironically the screening and discharge  policies, together with the drafting of millions of men, weakened barriers that  had kept gay people trapped and hidden at the margins of society. Discovering  that they shared a common cause, they were more willing and able to defend  themselves, as their ability to work, congregate and lead sexual lives came  under escalating attack in the postwar decade.  </P> <P> Long before the war, a chain of social constraints immobilized many gay men and  women, keeping them invisible, isolated, silent, ignorant and trivialized. As  young people, they learned to hide their homosexual feelings in fear and shame,  helping to perpetuate the myth that people like them didn't exist. Locked in a  closet of lies and deceptions, many people with homosexual desires mistakenly  believed they were the only ones in the world -- often not even knowing what to  call themselves.  </P> <P> When publicly acknowledged, they were caricatured as "fairies" and "mannish"  women, freaks whose lives were trivialized as silly, so that many lesbians and  gay men learned not to take themselves or each other seriously. Such insidious  forms of social control worked below the surface of daily life through unspoken  fears and paralyzing shame, coming into view only in sporadic acts of violence,  arrests, school expulsions, firings or religious condemnations.  </P> <P> Ironically, the mobilization for World War II helped to loosen the constraints  that locked so many gay people in silence and self-contempt. Selective Service  acknowledged the importance of gay men when it drafted hundreds of thousands  and broke the silence when examiners asked millions of selectees about their  homosexual tendencies.  </P> <P> The draft, together with lax recruitment policies allowing lesbians to enter  the military, placed a generation of gay men and women in gender-segregated  bases where they could find each other, form cliques and discover the gay life  in cities. Classification officers assigned even the most "mannish" women and  effeminate men to stereotyped duties, recognizing that these previously  marginal people were useful and even indispensable to the war effort.  </P> <P> Changes in policy brought similarly dramatic effects. Military officials  intensified the significance of homosexuality by building a bureaucratic  apparatus to manage homosexual personnel. In the process, they inadvertently  gave gay inductees and soldiers the option to avoid compulsory military service  by coming out. Psychiatrists gave soldiers, as well as military officials, a  biased but useful new language and set of concepts -- such as the word  homosexual and the idea of a "personality type" -- that some used to categorize  homosexuals, understand homosexuality and even define themselves.  </P> <P> During purges, interrogators terrorized suspects into breaking their protective  silence, forcing them to describe their homosexual lives, make confessions and  name friends and sexual partners. Officers who aggressively rooted out  homosexuals and exposed them further destroyed their ability to hide in the  closet, forcing them to lead new lives as known homosexuals.  </P> <P> As these soldiers were thrown together into psych wards and queer stockades,  they endured the same hardships and were better able to see themselves as  compatriots victimized by the same persecution. When they were discharged as  undesirables -- without benefits and without being charged with any crime --  gay men and women gained a cause, a target to attack and new avenues of appeal  to defend their rights as gay GIs and veterans.  </P> <P> Disrupted and exposed by the war, gay life in the postwar years seemed to  expand at an unprecedented rate. The proliferation of gay bars, the broadening  of public discussion of homosexuality, the formulation of the idea that  homosexuals constituted a minority, the widespread acceptance of the  psychiatric model of homosexuals as sexual psychopaths, the emergence and  growth of federal anti-homosexual policies and the new avenues for gay citizens  to appeal government injustices were some of the many legacies of World War II.  These changes had a powerful impact on how a nation would respond to  homosexuality long after the war.  </P> <P> World War II veterans were the first generation of gay men and women to  experience such rapid, dramatic and widespread changes in their lives as  homosexuals. They felt a growing sense that, as veterans, they were being  treated unfairly when singled out for persecution; they should be able to live  their lives in peace as long as they did their jobs and didn't hurt anyone  else. Under heavy attack during the postwar decade, however, most gay male and  lesbian citizens refrained from publicly standing up for themselves or even  talking about their lives.  </P> <P> But the postwar years were also a period of new possibilities that strengthened  and developed gay culture. Despite the mounting political war against them, the  generation of World War II gay veterans responded to a hostile environment by  expanding their "closet" -- making it a roomier place to live.  </P> <P> Previous generations had invented the closet -- a system of lies, denials,  disguises and double-entendres -- that enabled them to express some  homosexuality by pretending it didn't exist and hiding it from view. A later  generation would "come out of the closet," learning to live as proud and openly  gay men and women and demanding public recognition. But the World War II  generation slowly stretched their closet to its limits, not proclaiming their  homosexuality in public but not willing to live lonely lives.  </P> <P> In increasing numbers, these men and women went to gay and lesbian bars that  proliferated despite new state laws designed to put them out of business. In  the late 1940s, gay bars opened for the first time in such medium-size cities  as Kansas City, Mo.; Richmond, Va.; Worcester, Mass., and San Jose, Calif.  Another gay institution, the bathhouse, also proliferated after the war.  </P> <P> It was in this social climate that the first signs of a continuous gay  political movement and press emerged in the United States. In 1950, the  Mattachine Society was organized in Los Angeles -- primarily by war veterans --  in response to the anti-homosexual campaigns in Washington, police arrests in  Los Angeles, the treatment of homosexuals by the military and the crackdowns on  gay and lesbian bars. In 1955, women in San Francisco started the Daughters of  Bilitis, the first lesbian-rights organization in the United States.  </P> <P> The generation of gay men and women who served in World War II grew into  adulthood fighting one war for their country and another to protect themselves  from their government's escalating mobilization against them. When they  returned to civilian life, some fought for their right to be treated fairly as  patients, veterans and citizens. For others, a quiet sense of belonging was  victory enough, to have the chance to fit into the country they fought for,  leading ordinary but unapologetic lives.  </P> <P> As they grow into old age and once again face death, most still blend into the  world around them, while some have come out -- either under fire or on their  own. Today they witness an expanding public debate over the military's  exclusion of homosexuals. To be serious, that debate must include a sense of  history -- not only of how the military established its anti-gay policy during  World War II, and then suppressed all internal dissent, but also of how the men  and women who were the policy's first targets fought and died for their country  with the rest of their generation.  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW: A review of "Coming Out Under Fire" appears in the Book Review  section.

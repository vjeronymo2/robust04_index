			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining and smelting strike ends ABOUT 1,000 employees of Brunswick Mining &amp; Smelting's big zinc-lead mine in New Brunswick finally voted to end a 10-month strike and the company has begun recalling them. In the region of 400 workers at the nearby smelter accepted a new contract last week. The Noranda subsidiary said average wages will rise from CDollars 15.38 an hour to CDollars 19.38 during three years, and fringe benefits are improved. The smelter will operate at about half capacity until autumn because large custom contracts have been lost.</p>

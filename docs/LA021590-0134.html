			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LOCKOUT: DAY 1;  </P> <P> THE KEY ISSUES  </P> <P> OWNERS  </P> <P>  -- Revenue sharing: Have proposed giving players 48% of their revenue from  ticket sales and from national and local radio and television rights, which  represents 82% of their total revenue. The 48% would cover player salaries and  the benefit plan.  </P> <P> The 26 clubs would share on an equal basis the salaries for all players with  six or fewer years of major league service.  </P> <P>  -- Other issues: It's unclear whether pay-for-performance and participation  payroll levels are still issues. The plan brought forward by Fay Vincent, while  rejected by the players Wednesday, could lead to compromises and lessen the  importance of ancillary issues.  </P> <P> PLAYERS  </P> <P>  -- Minimum salary: Have proposed an increase from $68,000 to between $100,000  and $125,000.  </P> <P>  -- Salary arbitration: Have proposed reducing eligibility requirement from  three years in the major leagues to two.  </P> <P>  -- Roster size: Have proposed return to 25 player limit from 24.  </P> <P>  -- Free agency: Have proposed eliminating the five-year waiting period for  repeat free agents and the compensation system by which a team signing a free  agent has to give amateur draft choices to the team losing the free agents.  Have also proposed offering free agency to players who are removed from 40-man  control rosters and sent to minor leagues outright.  </P> <P>  -- Benefit plan: Have proposed continuing the current formula combining  owners' contributions with revenue from television contracts covering the  All-Star game, league playoffs and World Series, which accounts for about  one-third of the $1.06 billion that CBS will pay baseball over the next four  years.  </P> <P> Collusion: Have proposed that the owners agree to pay treble damages if found  guilty again of conspiring against free agents, as they did in the winters of  1985 and '86.

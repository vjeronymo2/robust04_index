			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTHER-IN-LAW SAYS WIFE-BEATER SHOULD GET MEDAL, NOT JAIL  </P> <P> A New Zealand man convicted of beating his wife found an unusual supporter at  an Auckland court -- his mother-in-law.  </P> <P> "I don't think he deserves a sentence. He deserves a medal," she told Otahuhu  District Judge David Harvey. "He has literally been through hell."  </P> <P> The woman said her daughter had driven the 36-year-old man, whose name was  withheld, to extremes and that if there was any trouble, "she would've asked  for it."  </P> <P> Harvey, who conceded that the defendant was "the recipient of a considerable  amount of verbal and psychological abuse," sentenced him to supervision for one  year and ordered that he have anger and stress management counseling.  </P></p>

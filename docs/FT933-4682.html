			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Sleepy pineapples arrive fresher CANADIAN researchers have devised a way of putting pineapples 'to sleep'. This will prevent the tropical fruit from rotting in transit and means it will be just ripe enough when it reaches supermarkets in Europe. First consumers to taste the drowsy but more succulent produce will be in Scotland, where fruit company Geest is carrying out market trials under the Necta brand name. Pineapples have previously been picked before they were ripe to enable them to withstand damage during shipping. Unlike bananas, which continue to ripen after picking, pineapples simply begin to rot once they are off the bush. The Costa Rican pineapples are peeled and cored in a pilot plant before being packed. Geest is using modified atmospheric packaging, developed at the University of British Columbia. This stops rotting by extracting oxygen from the sealed rigid packing. 'The atmosphere keeps the 'living' fruit fresh, like a cut flower in water,' explained Mr John Dutton, managing director of Geest's Prepared Produce division. When sales trial are launched in Scotland a 500 gram whole cored pineapple will cost Pounds 1.99, 250 grams of pineapple chunks 99p. It will be next summer before shoppers in other regions of Britain can taste the fruit. Mr Dutton, whose company specialises in pre-packed fresh produce, said Necta would eliminate the messy preparations needed to serve whole fresh pineapples. 'They (Necta) taste better than most fresh pineapples and the taste is much more consistent.'</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Prices paid in Australia were steadier this week, with only a few small rises and some types unchanged or barely maintained. Clearances were still good at most of the sales held, however, with Japan and Western Europe buying strongly. In wool using markets some of the recent pressures and sentiment associated with wool's clear reversal in trend have subsided, and price resistance is being mentioned as a feature, but there is no question of weakness replacing strength. The AWC market indicator stood at 504 cents on November 10, compared with 499 a week before.</p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Finance and the Family: Wanted - watchdog with more teeth SELF-regulation is not working, said a man this week who ought to know. The man was Mick Newmarch, chairman of Prudential Corporation, Britain's largest life insurer. The import of his words was 'Let's just scrap self-regulation and replace the system with a single statutory regulatory body, which will supervise everyone in the same business in the same way.' The casual reader of the personal finance pages of any newspaper will realise that the myriad systems of self-regulation have left gaping holes in the consumer protection safety net. From home income plans, to advisers who run off with clients' cash, to the simple and pervasive practice of urging people to buy expensive policies which they really do not need, consumers are not being protected. Indeed, the Securities and Investments Board subtly owned up to shortcomings, in the disclosure area at least, when it said this week it would review its new rules on the topic. To this end, it appointed as a consultant Tim Miller, former marketing director at M&amp;G, the unit trust company, who has been a fierce critic of life insurance industry sales practices. Earlier this year, Miller resigned from the board of Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance and unit trust industry, over its proposed disclosure regime. He felt it did not require companies to offer prospective customers accurate projections of what their own charges were likely to be over a policy's life. Any recommendations from Miller are likely to include a requirement that projections of 'own charges' be disclosed, instead of allowing each company to simply project the industry average - a meaningless number to anyone shopping for insurance. That the SIB has decided to review its disclosure regime at all is an admission that it does not expect the new rules to pass muster with the Office of Fair Trading. The OFT had ruled two years ago that insurance companies tell prospective customers so little about their products and their costs that competition between companies is actually inhibited. The OFT is expected to announce shortly that the latest disclosure regime also falls short of the mark in certain respects. But how will Newmarch's alternative strategy offer consumers more protection? First, Newmarch argues that all companies in the same business should be regulated in the same manner and hints that even bank and building society deposit accounts - savings products like most life policies - should be subject to the same tough disclosure rules as life insurers. He also sets out some proposals for a new investor compensation scheme. The current scheme's finances have been badly strained by large numbers of claims and its solvency is currently dependent upon the willingness of life insurance companies to contribute disproportionately to it. Under Newmarch's plan, the investor compensation scheme would ideally have no fixed ceiling on the amount which could be claimed by any individual. The cost of claims would be met by spreading the losses among those companies selling the same or similar products. Meanwhile, compensation payments should be readily calculated and paid out soon after the event - meeting a common complaint from those who have made claims on the scheme. But perhaps the most startling words from Newmarch were those in which he acknowledged the legitimacy of the rising tide of consumer complaints about life industry sales practices. He urged the industry to open talks directly with the OFT about a disclosure regime which could bear its imprimatur, thus putting an end to headlines such as 'The Life Insurance Racket'. For consumers, an OFT-blessed disclosure regime would allow prospective customers to know how much commission sales agents will receive, how much will be deducted from premiums to cover the seller's costs and exactly what the effects of early surrender would be. And that has to be good news for consumers.</p>

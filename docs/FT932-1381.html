			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Nigeria suffers 'deficit of honour': The annulment of an election THE words of one of Nigeria's elder statesmen took on a prophetic note yesterday as the country's soldiers postponed yet again the advent of civilian rule. 'We have an administration in deficit: deficit budgeting, deficit financing, deficit in honesty, honour and truth,' declared retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, Nigeria's influential former chief of state, last April. The transition programme, which envisaged a handover to a civilian government next August, was 'a charade and a caricature of democracy', continued the man who led Nigeria from 1976 until handing over to an elected civilian government in 1979. Some Nigerians may have de-murred at this scathing assessment of Gen Ibrahim Babangida, the country's military leader since 1985. Events since the presidential poll on June 14 appear to bear Gen Obasanjo out. Gen Babangida's decision to annul the exercise leads most observers to one conclusion: he had no intention of handing over power in the first place - or at least not in this way, at this time. For the fourth time the Babangida regime postponed the transition to democracy and with each successive delay the Nigerian public and the international community have grown more sceptical. Nigerians had continued to tolerate falling living standards and deep-rooted corruption in government in the hope that if they waited patiently until August 27, the Babangida regime might keep its promise to make way for an elected civilian government. That promise now seems to have been broken. Few observers believe it is now possible to keep to the timetable. Why he should wish to stay on is unclear - unless it is simply because he has developed a taste for power. The economy, burdened by a Dollars 30bn external debt, is in severe difficulties and the president's popularity has plummeted. Gen Babangida has yet to disclose his next move. Most observers however rule out an indefinite extension of military rule. Aside from domestic opposition, the climate of international opinion is heavily against it. Since the superpower rapprochement, a democratically elected government is seen as fundamental to good relations between donors and recipients. Sympathetic treatment of Nigeria's debt problem is vital to the its development. If key western governments, notably Britain and the US, do not offer support at World Bank and International Monetary Fund board meetings, further rescheduling of Nigeria's debt is unlikely. Yet Gen Babangida, as shrewd a politician as he is, knows full well that western governments will think carefully before applying too hard a squeeze. Nigeria's stability is fragile. A further decline in the economy could well exacerbate the tensions between the predominantly Moslem north and the largely Christian south and the prospect of serious unrest in Africa's most populous nation is alarming. If Gen Babangida wishes to stay in office, opponents face a formidable task. A veteran of past coups, as well as masterminding his own takeover in 1985, he has gone to great lengths to protect himself. The army has been restructured and key divisions relocated, including the shift of the army HQ to the president's home town of Minna, within easy reach of the capital Abuja. At the same time the army's energies have been depleted or diverted. Last year a military aircraft carrying more than 160 officers crashed near Lagos and all perished. Meanwhile in Liberia, Nigerian armed forces are playing a leading role in an attempt to bring peace to a country racked by civil war. But the unsuccessful and enervating exercise has left the army 'bruised, weakened and diminished', according to Gen Obasanjo. One way out for Gen Babangida lies in the civilian-led transitional council, chaired by Chief Ernest Shonekan. Appointed last December, it was at first seen as a caretaker administration whose main objective was to put the country's lapsed economic recovery programme back on track and secure an early agreement with the IMF. So far it has been an exercise in responsibility without power, with the military obstructing vital reforms. Were Gen Babangida to raise the profile of the transitional council and give it effective power, reduce the number of soldiers in government, and lower his profile by spending more time at his retirement estate at Minna, he might defuse tensions. But in the end he has to accept that the only way out is through the ballot box. It may well be that Gen Babangida would like to emulate Jerry Rawlings, the Ghanaian military leader who won the country's presidential election last December. If annulling this month's presidential poll means there will be a second campaign in a year or two, the general could be among the contenders. But until he shows his cards, his intentions are unfathomable. As Gen Obasanjo put it: 'We have had President Babangida manoeuvring, manipulating, playing the game his own way. . . When you talk of a transition programme I will only believe it when I see it. . . The only programme in town is Babangida's programme as he conceives it.'</p>

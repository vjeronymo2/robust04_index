			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Compromise Bosnia peace deal proposed PEACE mediators in Geneva yesterday presented the three sides in the Bosnian conflict with a compromise plan for the ethnic partition of the country, and warned the Bosnian Moslems that they must accept the proposal or face more war. The mediators also appealed to the European Commission to administer the disputed central Bosnian city of Mostar as part of a peace package to end the 17-month war. The peace talks have now been adjourned for 10 days to allow the three sides to discuss the latest plan with their respective parliaments. The Serb and Croat delegations said they accepted the new map for the partition, and welcomed the proposals as a step towards ending the war. The Moslem-led Bosnian delegation accused the mediators of rewarding Serb and Croat conquests. Its members planned to present the proposals to the Bosnian parliament, but foreign minister Mr Haris Silajdzic later told the BBC he believed they would be rejected. Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic said the plan might help in the pursuit of peace, 'maybe not in such a form but in a corrected form'. The compromise map, broadly similar to previous proposals presented by Serb and Croat leaders, gives the Moslems up to 30 per cent of the land, placing Sarajevo, the capital, under UN administration. Mostar is provisionally labelled as a Commission-controlled city, although Lord Owen, the EC mediator, said the Commission had yet to accept this task. Lord Owen denied he had caved in to Serb and Croat pressures and said there was no ideal solution to the Bosnian conflict. 'It's not as generous as I would have liked but they (the Moslems) got 30 per cent, which was the criterion which we set two months ago,' he said. Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the UN mediator, will fly to New York early next week to report to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general. Implementation of the peace plan would require 40,000 UN peacekeeping troops. The UN high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR) yesterday accused Croats of new atrocities against the Bosnian Moslems 'as brutal as any so far witnessed' during the war. The UNHCR said that in recent weeks the Bosnian Croat forces had conducted a campaign of 'brutal ethnic cleansing' against Moslems in south-western Bosnia. The Croat leadership vehemently denied the allegations. Its protests were discounted by UN officials, who said that up to 15,000 draft-age Moslem men were now being held in detention centres in western Bosnia, after Bosnian Croat forces rounded up men from Mostar.

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Books: Running riot through history DEMANDING THE IMPOSSIBLE: A HISTORY OF ANARCHISM by Peter Marshall HarperCollins Pounds 25, 767 pages IMAGINE the day when advance copies of a volume nearly 800 pages long, its cover handsomely illustrated and its price clearly marked, is delivered to its author fresh off the presses. As he delightedly riffles its pages and dreams of splendid reviews, he forgets the laborious process which has brought this dawn. In particular, he forgets those parts of the process which rest on a fabric of civil laws. His contract with his publisher was honoured, and if it had not been it could have been enforced - in court if necessary. The same contractual discipline kept together a whole army of printers and delivery firms and paper-makers and bookbinders and designers and ink-manufacturers and the entire complex which comes together in transforming an author's ideas into neatly bound pages. Indeed. the author may dream not just of splendid reviews but of royalties: and if these are not paid he will know what to do. But the author will forget all this only because society, in general, works so smoothly within its constitutional framework. This triumphant achievement of civilised democracy, in giving, through a system of laws, peace and assurance to most people in the conduct of most of their lives, is forgotten by the author, as by most of us, because of the very success of its operation. The author in this case is Peter Marshall, and he has written a book about anarchism, apparently without recognising the inconsistency between what his book advocates and the system which ensured its production. If the anarchy which Marshall advocates were to prevail, what would have protected the passage of his book, in the absence of enforceable agreements, from the inside of his head to the bookshop shelf? Marshall would reply: the general good-heartedness which prevails in true anarchies. On this profoundly plausible thesis, more below. Marshall claims that his book is a critical history of anarchist theory, which implies that he sets out to give an impartial assessment both of the arguments in its favour and its achievements. But in fact the book is a sustained polemic on behalf of anarchism, which Marshall presents not by argument but by transcribing an endless number of encyclopaedia articles on any person or group of people in history who found a law irksome or who argued for greater individual liberty. It therefore turns out, according to Marshall, that everyone from the Taoists of ancient China to Mrs Thatcher are really would-be anarchists or their close relatives, libertarians; from which we are further somehow to conclude that anarchism must be right. Only the opening pages, and a few near the end, touch on the theoretical case for anarchism. Most of the rest of the book is devoted to giving a few pages each to a vast array of persons and historical periods. John Stuart Mill gets two pages, Oscar Wilde five, the Marquis de Sade six, half a dozen pages gives us the history of Italian anarchism; and so on. Major figures like Godwin and Bakunin get whole chapters each, but three quarters of the book consists of vignettes, whose brevity makes for superficiality and unacceptable generalisation. Anarchism, on Marshall's definition, is a rejection of the state, conceived as a body which exists to maintain a compulsory legal order. In its place anarchists wish to see society constituted by a 'sum of voluntary associations' unconstrained and unregulated by anything beyond goodwill between individuals. The central weakness in anarchism, thus characterised, is notorious, and Marshall signally fails to address it. It is this: individuals are to some degree self-interested, and not all self-interest is indefensible or irrational. The same applies to groups, such as families or tribes. Sympathies are limited, and so are resources; competition between individuals and groups is therefore inevitable.  Competition can, and often does, lead to conflict. Therefore unless there are rules, enforceable and carrying sanctions, to ensure the regulation of competition and a just resolution of conflicts should they arise, the outcome will be that the strong will trample the weak and injustice will be general. The anarchists' belief that people can live in unregulated mutual harmony is touching but naive. To this inadequate moral psychology they add generalisations about 'freedom', failing to see that the freedoms worth having require protection because of their vulnerability, and that it is precisely in pursuit of genuine liberties that humans congregate into civil society and agree laws. The anarchist's mistake is to think that because tyranny is hateful the state should be abolished. A more rational idea is to abolish not the state but tyranny, by making the state fairer and freer, thus protecting its members from the depredations of the greedy and the vile, who are too numerous among us to make anarchism even a remotely serious option.</p>

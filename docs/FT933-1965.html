			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow drops as oil prices rise and bonds fall Wall Street HIGHER crude oil prices and a falling bond market undermined sentiment in US equities yesterday, leaving blue chip stocks sharply lower, with declines exacerbated by a late rush of computerised sell programs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 37.45 off at 3,575.80. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 shed 3.78 to 455.05. Only the Nasdaq composite, which was sold heavily last week, bucked the trend, closing 0.10 up at 740.21. New York SE volume amounted to 231m shares. After last Friday's session, when a frenzy of trading related to the 'triple-witching' expiry of futures and options contracts sent volume soaring and prices plummeting, investors were glad to return to more normal trading patterns yesterday morning. Although prices eased at the opening in what may have been a hangover from Friday, there was little selling pressure and, within a few minutes, the Dow had clawed back most of its initial loss. Analysts said the lack of activity was partly a reflection of investors' caution ahead of several important events due later this week, including the meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making Open Market Committee and the official unveiling of President Clinton's healthcare reform package. It was not until mid-afternoon that prices turned decisively lower as rising oil prices and a sharp sell-off in the bond market prompted heavy selling of stocks, much of it in the form of programs. Paramount Communications climbed a further Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 69 5/8 in volume of 3.47m shares as speculation mounted that a rival bid to Viacom's Dollars 8.2bn offer for the entertainment group may soon emerge. Over the weekend, there were reports claiming that Turner Broadcasting and QVC, the home-shopping network, were considering bidding for Paramount, possibly in a joint deal, while rumours also suggested that Blockbuster Entertainment or the German media group Berteslmann might enter the fray. QVC shares were hit hardest by the speculation, falling Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 56. Nike dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 46, a 52-week low, in heavy trading after the sports shoemaker announced a fall in fiscal first-quarter earnings and warned that because of the sluggish US and international economies it did not expect full-year 1994 earnings to match the record results of 1993. National Health Laboratories lost Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 15 1/8 in volume of 3.7m shares after the company admitted that it had received a subpoena from the government, which is again investigating its billing practices. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 45 1/2 after brokerage house Smith Barney Shearson upgraded its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'buy'. On the Nasdaq market, Centocor rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 10 1/4 in busy trading as investors reacted to news that the company is forming an oncology alliance with UK group Wellcome to market anti-cancer agents. Canada TORONTO closed lower in moderate trade, dragged down by steep declines in transportation and mining stocks. The TSE 300 index shed 25.5 to 3,952.8. Falls led rises by 435 to 285 after 52.4m share volume.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Travel: Along greenstone paths, through parakeet forests - Angela Wigglesworth treks through the Southern Alps in New Zealand 'That,' said Peter, our guide, pointing to the roof of a hut high up the mountain ahead of us, 'is where we will have lunch.' IT SEEMED unlikely, but Peter was confident. We had set out early one cold summer morning to drive to the start of the 40-kilometre Routeburn Track that crosses New Zealand's Aspiring and Fiordland national parks and was once used by the Maori in their search for greenstone. We were three rather inexperienced trekkers getting the taste of the Routeburn Track in a two-day walk and returning each night to comfortable Homestay (bed and breakfast) accommodation in Queenstown, New Zealand's most popular holiday resort, on South Island. The first day we planned to reach the Routeburn Falls hut at 975 metres and, if energetic enough, continue up to the Harris Saddle, the highest point (1,277m) on the track. Our group consisted of Ben Harris, a Rhode Island lawyer, his wife Anne, fleet of foot and always in the lead, myself and Peter, a knowledgeable and considerate guide who kept us going with coffee breaks, picnic lunches and water from the mountain streams. 'Every day is a good day when it doesn't rain,' said Peter (it is a notoriously rainy area), as we set off alongside the Routeburn Gorge, the river foaming over the rocks, the forest green and lush with giant ferns and thick moss on the trunks of fallen trees. We crossed rivers and streams, one person at a time, on long, swaying wooden bridges, saw a yellow parakeet in the trees and bush robins at our feet. Two hours later the path became rockier and steeper, the sun hotter, but by 12.30 we had reached the Falls hut, where some walkers stay the night. It had 30 bunks and cooking facilities. Pleased with ourselves at having got there, we sat on the verandah, ate lunch and enjoyed the view of mountain peaks covered in mid-summer snow. Did we want to go on to the Harris Saddle? How could we not when we had come so far. White edelweiss, harebells, mountain daisies and snow tussock grass grew by the steep path, the bellbird sang its lovely song and in 90 minutes we reached Lake Harris, glittering blue and silver in the sun. Then it was on and up to the Harris Saddle with its fantastic views across the Hollyford Valley. The following day we took a jet boat up the Dart River. 'This,' said Rod, the boat company manager, 'is the most challenging river in New Zealand. Going up-stream, we give you the history of the area and the names of the mountains and then tell you to put your cameras away as we come down a bit fast (80kph) to a place that will really blow you away.' It's not how fast the boats go, he added, as we put on gloves, hats and life jackets; it's where they take you that makes the trip spectacular. Where Roger, our driver took us, after a spurt of speed to make us gasp, was aground on the dried-up river bed. 'It's good it's not the same as always,' said a cheerful German as Roger, embarrassed at his lack of navigational skills, had to piggy-back his six passengers on to the shingle while he got the boat started again. Then, in 20kms, we climbed 150m, skimming past Mt Alfred and the Routeburn Valley into the heart of the Southern Alps. Black-backed gulls flew over the dark trees on the mountains that rose steeply from the water's edge. We left the boat at a rocky chasm and set off through the bush to Lake Sylvan, which, said Peter, was an hour-and-a-half's easy stroll. It was not my idea of an easy stroll: we clambered over fallen tree trunks and had to watch our feet on the spongy, boggy moss. In early afternoon we reached Lake Sylvan, shimmering in hot sun. Geese and paradise ducks were on the water, shags on the far banks. The walks had been organised by a small company called Outside Adventures owned by Richard and Elaine Bryant. Richard's great-grandfather came from Cornwall around 1862 and his family have been in the tourist business in New Zealand ever since. They offer tailor-made guided treks or one-day walks (one includes a return trip by helicopter) for those who do not have time to complete any of the famous treks but want to experience part of them. Train and bus travel in New Zealand is much under-rated by New Zealanders. Bus drivers ('My name's John, I'm your steerologist') are jolly people who make jokes about the places you pass, deliver newspapers and mail, and are immensely helpful. Journeys are as sociable as you want them to be. My fellow travellers included a Japanese dry-cleaner who planned to be a farmer, an American couple in their late 70s who had just done the Milford track, a probation officer from Sheffield, and Gary, a young janitor from Louisiana. Trains are comfortable, clean and punctual. I took a five-hour journey from Greymouth to Christchurch on the Trans Alpine Express, which has sheepskin-covered seats. We crossed spectacular gorges and went through 19 tunnels on the climb through the Southern Alps. Turquoise rivers ribboned across white river beds. The Coastal Pacific Express, with many of the amenities of the Trans Alpine, goes up the east coast of South Island to Kaikoura, once a small fishing village, now famous for its whale-watching trips, and on to Blenheim and Picton for the inter-island ferry. We saw seals basking on the rocks in the blue sea. Further north, near Blenheim, the centre of some of New Zealand's best vineyards, we passed the pink and blue lakes of the salt quarries and had a Devonshire cream tea at breakfast time. Angela Wigglesworth was a guest of the New Zealand Tourism Board (New Zealand House, Haymarket, London SWlY 4TQ), and flew with Air New Zealand (77 Fulham Palace Rd, London W6 8JA).

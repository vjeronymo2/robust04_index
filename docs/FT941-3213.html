			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Rise in rate of average earnings causes concern An increase in the annual growth rate of average earnings  - the first rise since February 1992  - raised fears that a long period of subdued wage rises might be over. The underlying annual increase in earnings in the 12 months to January was 3.25 per cent. This was the same as the revised figure for December, which had previously been announced as 3 per cent. The annual growth rate had been steadily declining since the 7.5 per cent recorded in February 1992. In the manufacturing and production sectors, underlying earnings rose 4.5 per cent in the 12 months to January, up from 4.25 per cent in December. The increase in service-sector earnings in the year to January was 3 per cent, up from 2.75 per cent in December and the third consecutive monthly rise. The Department of Employment estimates the underlying rise in earnings by making adjustments for other influences such as pay arrears and variations in the timing of settlements. The actual increase in earnings in the year to January was 3.6 per cent. The department said there was little evidence of an increase in the general level of pay settlements, so the most likely explanation for the rise was increased bonus payments. Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'As the trend cannot easily be explained, and given the weakness elsewhere in the labour market, it is hard to get too concerned at this stage. The uptrend will not be strong.' Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers International, said: 'The rise in average earnings is not yet large enough to threaten the inflation outlook. It is only if the rise is a step on the way up to a level between 4 per cent and 5 per cent that it poses problems to the low inflation outlook. As yet, there is no sign that wage deals are rising that sharply.' The rise in earnings meant that unit labour costs have also increased. In the year to January wages and salaries per unit of output in the manufacturing sector rose by 1.7 per cent, compared with 1 per cent in the year to December. In the three months to January unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector were 1.3 per cent higher than in the same three months a year ago. Productivity is still improving, however. Output per head rose by 3 per cent in the year to January, compared with 2.9 per cent in the 12 months to December.</p>

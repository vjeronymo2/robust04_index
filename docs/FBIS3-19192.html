What is your reply to that?    [Borrelli] We are quite happy. Rather, I do not know how to  interpret this excessive agitation on Mr. Berlusconi's part. It  may lend itself to several interpretations, not all of them  consistent with an entirely calm conscience on the part of the  agitated person. I repeat, we are happy. The prospect of a  recourse to the CSM does not worry us. It seems clear to me,  however, that the judicial initiatives of the District  Attorney's Office are a matter of concern to those who believe  themselves to be the subject of them.    [Buccini] Actually Berlusconi said something different from  that. First, he attacked an unnamed magistrate. Now he is  directly attacking your deputy, Gherardo Colombo, adding that  the aim of the Publitalia investigation was to attack a  political adversary during the election campaign, and is urging  that the situation be remedied, to "take control of the  situation in which Colombo is playing a leading role..."    [Borrelli] I consider it disgraceful to place a political  interpretation on judicial initiatives which, apart from  anything else, have been ratified by not one but three assistant  attorneys and approved by the chief attorney. I deplore being  dragged into these petty exchanges, but I am obliged to respond  once again to defend my office, my magistrates, and the truth...  This is not the first time that political intentions have been  attributed to magistrates, with the sole aim of undermining  their authority in order to defend those under investigation. I  note that the unknown magistrate mentioned by Mr. Berlusconi in  earlier remarks has now been named. This man, Gherardo Colombo,  deserves respect for 20 years of service in the judiciary,  during which time it has never been possible to level any  charges of partiality or lack of independence at him. [Borrelli  ends]    Blow after blow, the battle between Fininvest and the  Attorney's Office came to a head after Silvio Berlusconi's  latest attacks broadcast on the evening television news. But  throughout the day there was a heavy atmosphere in the office in  Milan. Initially, Saverio Borrelli was cunningly evasive:  "What statements by Berlusconi? I would say there was some  shouting, rather..." Then he began to issue a response. And  his tone grew sharper by the hour.    [Buccini] Berlusconi talked about a system of justice  working  according to the clock and said: In any case, I am here to  guarantee that such things do not happen again. He really has a  grudge against the prosecuting attorneys, do you not think? Are  you afraid that an attempt is being made to trap you in a corner?    [Borrelli] I do not know whether that is exactly what  Berlusconi said. But anyone aiming to prevent the prosecuting  authorities from exercising their penal activities, to influence  their timing and methods, is someone who has in mind a prospect  opposed to that of the law-based state, a state in which  everyone is answerable to the law -- not only ordinary citizens,  but also the so-called powerful.    [Buccini] But Berlusconi says that you took action on the  basis of events that happened years ago. Why did you act right  now?    [Borrelli] I must just say that this is not true. In the  investigation in question the events date up to mid-January 1994.    [Buccini] A year ago you were under attack from [former  Italian Socialist Party Secretary] Craxi, and now it is  Berlusconi's turn. The faces have changed, but not the nature  of the polemic. Why? Are you really sure that your conscience  is clean?    [Borrelli] We have suffered many such attacks in the past,  too. The truth has been distorted. Attempts have been made to  attribute political intentions to initiatives taken to ascertain  the truth. I reaffirm my complete confidence in the  independence and honesty of all my prosecuting attorneys. As  for myself, all kinds of things have been said about me. First,  I was suspected of being a League supporter, then a sympathizer  of Orlando's Rete, and last of being a communist or  cryptocommunist...    [Buccini] Be that as it may, there is no question that your  office is again under attack at present. You requested a  transfer to the court of appeal. A few days ago your deputies  urged you to stay on, in a letter in which they forecast further  difficult times for the prosecuting authorities. Do you not  think that you could meet their request?    [Borrelli] I am thinking about it. I will not conceal from  you the fact that this letter had a profound effect on me. But  it is not an easy decision.    [Buccini] Why not?    [Borrelli] Because... partly because, if I do stay on, there  is a danger that I will be accused of being the deliverer. And  I do not believe, and have never believed, in deliverers.</p>

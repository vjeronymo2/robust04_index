			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Denmark cuts interest rates Denmark's central bank cut the official discount rate and one of its other key short-term interest rates from 8.25 per cent to 7.75 per cent yesterday, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. It is the third discount rate cut since the kroner came under speculative pressure at the end of July, when the rate was increased by two full points to 9.25 per cent. The bank said that the latest cut reflected a return to calm on foreign exchanges. NEWS IN BRIEF</p>

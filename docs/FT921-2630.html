			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Observer: Enterprising initiative GrandMet chairman Sir Allen Sheppard tells me he is well pleased at the response to his round robin letter about the need to support the party which, since 1979, has been promoting the renewed spirit of enterprise in Britain. Although far from all of his counterparts were willing to 'put their heads above the parapet', he was 'quite amazed' that two out of every three he approached were ready to sign his letter to The Times. He has never found such a consensus before, except in the GrandMet boardroom, he says. In terms of heavyweight names his letter is reasonably impressive although it does not quite match the list of distressed businessmen, led by Rolls-Royce's Lord Tombs, who wrote to The Times to complain at the Conservative Party's ditching of Margaret Thatcher in 1990. The only names common to both lists are those of Sir John Cuckney, Sir Patrick Meaney, Lord King and Neil Shaw. One name surprisingly absent from both letters is that of ex-cabinet minister and Cable and Wireless chairman Lord Young, author of The Enterprise Years.</p>

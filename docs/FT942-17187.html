			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / UK Company News: Outsiders get foot in Burtons' doors After more than 90 years in the tailoring business, Burtons is contracting out its suits departments to an outside company in 350 of its 422 stores. Burtons, the men's wear chain of Burton Group, is close to agreement with William Baird, which manufactures suits under the Centaur label, to take over selling suits in the stores on a concession basis. While details of the deal are still to be agreed, Baird is expected to manufacture all the stock and employ all the sales staff, with Burtons receiving a portion of the takings. Baird has been operating suits concessions in the group's Debenhams chain for some years. Burtons says selling suits requires high levels of staff training and customer service, which concessions are better able to provide. Concessions also achieve higher sales per square foot, and better profit margins. The move reflects a shift to a more casual clothing range in Burtons stores  -the proportion of its sales accounted for by suits has fallen to about a third of the level in the early 1980s, and its smaller stores do not have suits departments. The suit market has shrunk by about a third in the past two years, principally because of recession and a shift towards the wearing of casual clothing, especially at work.</p>

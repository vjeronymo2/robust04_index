He was once a minister of justice and a secretary of the  Communist Party of Belarus [KPB] Central Committee. He is one  of those few people who remain faithful to their beliefs,  despite all transitory trends. Currently, Valeriy Guryevich  heads the People's Movement of Belarus [NDB] Supreme Soviet  faction. He has recently met with a RESPUBLIKA correspondent.  [passage omitted]    [Gukovskiy]You are the leader of the NDB's deputy  faction. How do you, and your colleagues, assess the current  political and economic situation in Belarus?    [Tikhinya] Serious changes have recently taken place --  society has become more leftist. Left-centrist forces have  consolidated under the NDB's roof. The Belarusian Popular Front  [BNF], which is rapidly losing people's confidence, is  agonizing. This was confirmed by the events that took place in  February -- the failed attempt to turn society upside-down. The  tide of nationalist frenzy is seceding.    Complex and contradictory processes are under way in the  Belarusian economy which, in my opinion, is inertly falling, but  has not yet hit bottom, and I doubt it will do so this year.  Over the last two years, the GDP has fallen by more than 20  percent, which has been an unprecedented decline. The  Belarusian economy could not endure senseless experiments, and  as a result, Belarus has joined the undeveloped countries of the  world.    The social gap continues to widen -- the poor are getting  poorer and the rich are getting richer. According to the  Institute of Sociology Data, two thirds of Belarusian citizens  currently live on the brink of poverty. Biological survival has  become the main problem for many people....    [Gukovskiy]What do you propose?    [Tikhinya] To start with, the entire path we have gone  through should be analyzed, and our ailing economy should be  diagnosed. After that, a program for overcoming the crisis  should be worked out. Today, we resemble a passenger of a  train, the engineer of which does not know where he is going.    [Gukovskiy]When did the engineer lose touch with  reality?    [Tikhinya] At the first stage of Gorbachev's so-called  perestroyka, approximately at the end of 1990. As Goethe said,  we admitted that the idea was useful, but we failed to wisely  implement it. Although we accepted the idea of market economy,  we have not managed to put it into practice so far.    There should be a comprehensive concept of action for  implementing market reforms. We should proceed toward the  market economy on an evolutionary path, beginning with the  sector of economy that is prepared most adequately for this. In  this regard, I totally support the Kebich government, despite  the fact that it sometimes fails to consistently proceed on this  path. Gaydarization and shock therapy are not for us.    Our economic course should be thoroughly corrected. I am not  speaking about this accidentally. Addressing the Supreme Soviet  session after his election, [Supreme Soviet Chairman] Mechyslaw  Hryb stated that Belarus' course, including implementation of  economic reforms, had not been changed. I cannot agree with  this. Reforms that lead the people toward impoverishment are  worth nothing, and it is evident that the people are being  robbed. I have in mind not only the "burnt" savings in the  Saving Bank. During the tenure of [former Supreme Soviet  Chairman] Stanislav Shushkevich, social guarantees, which had  been won in preceding years, were systematically and gradually  liquidated.    I believe that there are at least three preconditions for  coming out of the crisis: overcoming the powerlessness of  authorities, joining an economic union with Russia, and mounting  the battle against crime.    [Gukovskiy]Where, in your opinion, does the  powerlessness of authorities lie -- in its insufficient powers  or low professional skills?    [Tikhinya] Until recently, the main reason lay in the lack  of powers. The parliament, however, has recently granted  additional powers to the Cabinet of Ministers. Therefore, the  personnel issue has now come into prominence. [Prime Minister]  Vyacheslav Kebich's attempts to reorganize the government  deserve approval.    The second necessary precondition, as I have already said,  is  an economic union with Russia. We need it, as we need air, and  the establishment of a common ruble zone should be the first  step in this direction.    The third precondition for overcoming the crisis is the  battle against crime. Corrupted Mafia rings have infiltrated  state structures, which was vividly confirmed by the evidence  collected by the committee headed by Deputy Alyaksandr  Lukashenka. This comes as no surprise, since there still is no  state program for combating crime.    Crimes against property currently amount to 75 percent of  all  felonies. When I was the attorney of the Minsk Leninskiy rayon,  this figure did not exceed 25 percent. However, this is not  strange at all, given the out-of-control price hikes. A man is  tempted into committing a crime if he has nothing to eat, even  under the threat of harsh punishment. Improvement of the  situation depends on how quickly can we improve the economic  situation.    [Gukovskiy]The NDB is composed of various parties and  organizations, in terms of their viewpoint on the future  economic development of Belarus. I understand that an accord is  possible in politics to achieve common goals and tasks at a  certain stage. How, however, is the NDB going to work out a  common economic program? Are you going to create a hybrid made  of contradictory economic viewpoints? Will it not lead to an  even more abnormal and abominable experiment?    [Tikhinya] The NDB will discuss its economic program at its  next congress, which will probably be held after the economic  union with Russia is concluded. I hope that we will not have to  wait too long. There will be no hybrid. We will collectively  discuss a draft program on which our specialists have already  begun to work. I believe that it will be based on the  communists' program. In general, all organizations forming the  NDB agree that the people should be returned what they have been  deprived of, and that we should build a welfare economy. This  conforms to a constitutional provision on building a welfare  state.    [Gukovskiy]The deputies' corps voted for introducing  the presidential office in Belarus. Shortly before that, NDB  leader Syarhey Haydukevich had stated in an interview with our  paper that the movement is for a parliamentary republic. Did  the NDB have not enough votes to block the parliament's  decision, or did you simply change your mind at the last  moment?    [Tikhinya] We are indeed able to block any decision  requiring a constitutional majority. Having analyzed this issue  on the eve of voting, the majority of us finally decided to vote  for introducing presidency. Although I conformed to the  majority, I still believe that we have not taken advantage of  all possibilities of a parliamentary republic. On the other  hand, given the current disorder, the introduction of the  presidency can become the effective means of strengthening the  executive branch that we have spoken of. It should be kept in  mind, however, that the presidency can also lead Belarus to an  authoritarian rule. Therefore, following the introduction of  this office, we should immediately work out a whole range of  limits and counterweights. We should, for example, stipulate  that the president is not entitled to dissolve the Supreme  Soviet, etc.    [Gukovskiy] What sort of a man, in your opinion,  should the Belarusian president be?    [Tikhinya] Speaking about a political leader, it should be  somebody like Petr Masherov [former first secretary of the KPB].  Speaking about a state leader, I would name Yuriy Andropov  [former first secretary of the CPSU] -- Belarus needs exactly  this sort of a man today.    [Gukovskiy]What can you say about chances of specific  politicians in the presidential elections? Whom will the NDB  field or support?    [Tikhinya] Our coordinative committee has not yet discussed  this issue. I, personally, believe that either Lukashenka or  Kebich can become candidates of left-wing forces' bloc. Perhaps  other people will appear. The right wing, in my opinion, will  present as its candidates Karpenko [leader of the Party of  People's Accord], Shushkevich, Tarazevich, and, probably, [BNF  leader] Paznyak; the latter, however, has rather poor chances,  as a very loathsome individual.    [Gukovskiy]How did Tarazevich, former Supreme Soviet  chairman of the Belarusian Socialist Soviet Republic, end up on  the right flank?    [Tikhinya] It is hard for me to answer this question. I  only admit the fact.    [Gukovskiy]Are you going to run for the presidency?    [Tikhinya] According to the draft legislation on  presidential elections, either 70 votes of people's deputies or  100,000 signatures of voters is required to register a  candidate. The NDB will try to present only one candidate. If  my candidacy is put forward, I will run. Today, all I can say  is that I will run for a parliamentary seat.</p>

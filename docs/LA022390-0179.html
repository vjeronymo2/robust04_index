			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> RICH LITTLE FILES FOR CUSTODY  </P> <P> Impressionist Rich Little is seeking custody of his 1-year-old daughter, whose  mother is fighting him over child support.  </P> <P> Little's lawyer, Gerald Z. Berkowitz, says he succeeded in having the child  support argument heard in Delaware, where the mother, Lalette Cottrell, and  child, Lindsay, live, rather than in California, where the comedian lives.  </P> <P> Little is willing to pay support but wants an amount "consistent with the needs  of the child," his lawyer said. If the case were heard in California, Little  would have to pay from $5,000 to $10,000 a month, he said.  </P> <P> "I don't think the Delaware courts would give her that," Berkowitz said. "And I  don't think a child needs $5,000 to $10,000 a month."  </P> <P> Little, of Los Angeles, also filed for custody because Cottrell has "resisted  permitting him to visit his daughter," Berkowitz said.  </P> <P> Cottrell and her lawyer, Daniel F. Kelleher, would not comment.  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / EC finance ministers support legislation preventing banks overstretching on single loans EC finance ministers last night supported legislation aimed at preventing banks overstretching themselves with large loans to single clients, writes Andrew Hill. French and Spanish objections to the detail of the measure still have to be ironed out. But all 12 ministers agreed that the ceiling on bank loans to individual clients should be brought down to the equivalent of 25 per cent of a bank's capital. Britain imposed a 25 per cent ceiling after Johnson Matthey Bankers, a small bullion bank, came near to collapse in 1984, having made large loans to a small number of dubious companies. The measure agreed yesterday should prevent a repeat of that episode in other EC countries.</p>

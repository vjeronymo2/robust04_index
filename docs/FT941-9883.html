			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Equities hit by renewed selling pressure The UK stock market came under renewed heavy selling pressure yesterday, leaving the FT-SE 100 nearly 100 points down at the end of a volatile week. European markets were also sharply down amid fears that global bond and equity markets could come under serious pressure next week. The London equity market's uncertainty was increased by conflicting predictions from equity stock analysts. Most influential was a forecast from Mr Nick Knight, market strategist at Nomura, the Japanese stockbroker, of sharp falls across international stock markets next week. 'Next week could be bloody; we see world markets hitting an air pocket,' said Mr Knight, until recently one of London's most prominent bulls. He said the Hong Kong market would be particularly vulnerable, as would continental European markets. However, other dealers in London said they were not overly worried. Mr Martin Lupton, head of market-making at Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK securities house, said: 'We had a good shakeout but business was curtailed by the bad weather in New York; I think we'll steady up next week.' The FT-SE 100 index of leading UK companies closed 28.1 down at 3,378.9, having been more than 57 lower earlier in the day. Over the week the index has fallen 2.7 per cent, following the move by the US Federal Reserve a week ago to tighten monetary policy, and the quarter-point cut in UK base rates. The FT-SE index was hit by an overnight slide on Wall Street, which ended marginally lower. The Dow Jones industrial average finished 0.56 down at 3,894.78. In Frankfurt, the Dax index fell 28.35 to 2,090.61 on the session, ending 2.2 per cent down on the week. In Paris the CAC-40 index fell 21.68 to 2,275.09, a week's loss of 2.4 per cent. Other European markets were also weaker. In currency markets sterling staged a late recovery. Having slipped from Dollars 1.48 before Tuesday's rate cut to Dollars 1.45 on Thursday, it recovered to close at Dollars 1.4663. It was also slightly firmer against the D-Mark. The Bank of England surprised the UK government bond market yesterday when it opted for a maturity of six to 10 years for its next auction on February 23. Details of the specific stock, the amount to be auctioned and the terms of the auction will be announced on February 15. Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International, interpreted the Bank's decision to go for a medium-dated maturity as a sign it hopes to attract foreign investors. After the news of the auction, long-dated gilts rose by  1/16 of a point and short-dated gilts by  5/32 of a point. London stocks, Page 17 World stocks, Page 23</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Several commentaries on the 1995  presidential elections have recently appeared in the Greek press.    Political analyst I.K. Pretenderis wrote in the 31 March  Athens weekly magazine OIKONOMIKOS TAKHTDRHOMOS that two  different views of the presidency are taking shape. One view  holds that it would be "natural" for a dominant political  personality like Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou to become  president at the end of President Konstandinos Karamanlis' term,  whereas another holds that the president ought to be apolitical.  According to Pretenderis, both views have merit. On the one  hand, the election of a party leader would undoubtedly risk  creating a "president of half of the Greeks," but a president's  resonance also stems from the majority he receives or the party  from which he originates. These considerations notwithstanding,  it is generally believed that the context of the presidential  elections will become clear only after procedures are launched  in the spring of 1995. A view of the future will be provided in  the June European Parliament elections and the fall municipal  contest, which will reveal the balance of the political forces.  If the government majority scores successes in both elections,  the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) will enjoy more  freedom of action in 1995: Papandreou could argue that even if  new parliamentary elections become necessary--if he were unable  to acquire the 180 votes from members of Parliament required for  the presidency--he would still be strong enough to be elected  president. However, if PASOK loses ground in the two contests, a  recourse to parliamentary elections could be risky, Pretenderis  contends. Even if the New Democracy (ND) and its leader,  Miltiadhis Evert, were counting on the worsening economic  climate to deny Papandreou a free hand in the presidential  elections, they would not consider a Papandreou presidency a  disaster, for with the prime minister out of the way and a  "post-Papandreou" PASOK in power in 1997--when new parliamentary  elections are due--the ND could handily score a victory.  However, if it is in Evert's interest to have Papandreou as  president, provided the ND does not vote for him, Political  Spring leader Andonis Samaras should follow a different policy,  Pretenderis continues. If he were to throw his party's support  to Papandreou and thus avoid parliamentary elections, Samaras  could claim a place in the government as his reward. While such  a Samaras move would benefit Papandreou the most, another winner  is Evert himself, inasmuch as an alliance between Political  Spring and PASOK would push the former out of the center-right  area and restore ND's unity. In Pretenderis' view, this analysis  of the situation emphasizes the "serious arguments" for a  Papandreou presidency, less because the prime minister seeks it  than because all the others may desire it.    Writing in the 10 April Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, regular  contributor Stamos Zoulas weighs Papandreou's chances to reach  the presidency. To succeed, the prime minister must do one of  the following:     -  Secure the votes of Political Spring and the  Communist Party (KKE) to reach the required 180 votes.    -  Attempt a  redistribution of parliamentary seats by either canceling  results or repeating contests to make only KKE votes  necessary.    -  Declare early elections under a different electoral  system that would give PASOK more than 180 seats.    -  Risk  dissolving the Chamber of Deputies because of its inability to  elect a president, at which time the next Parliament could elect  him with only 151 votes, as required by the Constitution.    In Zoulas' view, the first version is obviously the most  desirable one, while the others are riskier. They are  nonetheless alternative solutions if indeed Papandreou truly  intends to seek the presidency.    A number of scenarios about the "post-Papandreou" era are  being drawn in case the prime minister decides to run for the  presidency, writes Yiorgos Karelias in the 15 April Athens daily  ELEVTHEROTIPIA. For instance, Papandreou himself would settle  the succession before launching his presidential campaign. As  the incumbent prime minister, he would have the authority to  approve a successor beyond the circle of his rumored  "heirs-apparent" such as Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos  Kaklamanis or Minister to the Prime Minister Anastasios Peponis.  Another scenario envisions Papandreou distancing himself from  the succession issue, allowing the party to be rent by rivalries  that only an extraordinary party congress could settle. The  solution would then be provided by the "historical leadership,"  in this case the various "heirs-apparent." In a third scenario,  an extraordinary and forward-looking congress would vote "with  an eye to the future" and provide a "third solution" by electing  a member of the "new generation." Since the last scenario is the  "most logical," Karelias concludes, it is also the least liklely  to occur.</p>

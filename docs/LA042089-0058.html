			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: 'EXPRESS' HEADS FOR SAN DIEGO, LOS ANGELES  </P> <P> Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Starlight Express" will chug into the Southland at the  end of the year, opening at the San Diego Civic Theatre Dec. 26 and playing the  Pantages Theatre in Hollywood for six weeks, beginning in February.  </P> <P> The weeklong San Diego engagement will open the national tour for the musical,  a high-tech extravaganza featuring roller skaters who portray trains. In  between San Diego and Hollywood, the show will stop in San Francisco.  </P> <P> The tour will cost approximately $4.5 million to mount, in comparison with the  $8-million price tag reported for the New York production. Stan Seiden, West  Coast president of Nederlander Inc., which owns the national touring rights,  said the touring production "has been simplified but not cut down." For  example, he said the train tracks will extend over the orchestra but not up to  the balcony.  </P> <P> "Starlight Express" will be offered as the star attraction of the next Los  Angeles Civic Light Opera subscription season, said Seiden. The other shows  have not been selected.  </P> <P> Seiden, who doubles as president of the LACLO, defended the decision to close  the current season with Barbara Rush in "Steel Magnolias," a non-musical that  played in Pasadena last fall, as the replacement for Cole Porter's "Anything  Goes." "Steel Magnolias" will be the LACLO's second non-musical offering in a  row, following the ongoing "Driving Miss Daisy."  </P> <P> "There aren't any musicals around," said Seiden. "You just can't afford to  produce them like they used to." He added that most of those musicals which do  get produced can't sustain a six-week run in Los Angeles, which is necessary to  accommodate all of the LACLO's subscribers. He declined to say how large that  subscription audience is.  </P> <P> Mailings about "Magnolias" went out to subscribers last week, he said, and only  one complaint has been received -- from a subscriber who had seen the play in  Pasadena. He offered that subscriber a choice of a refund or two extra tickets  to one of next year's attractions, and he said he would do the same for any  subscriber who saw the Pasadena production and who complains about the  duplication.  </P> <P> In the absence of enough musicals, why not change the name of Los Angeles Civic  Light Opera? "It has been talked about," said Seiden. "We've considered  augmenting the name."  </P> <P> Augmenting? How about shortening it -- and removing that musty musical  connotation with one stroke?  </P> <P> We humbly suggest: "Los Angeles Civic Lite."  </P> <P> FACE THE MUSIC: Musicals continue to be produced, despite Seiden's comments.  Some of the latest evidence:  </P> <P>  -- "Harlem Suite," a new dance musical conceived, choreographed and directed  by Maurice Hines, starring Melba Moore as well as Hines, will open May 11 at  the Pantages (which is owned and operated by the Nederlander company) for an  open-ended run. This will be a revised version of a show that played in five  Eastern and Southern cities last fall and winter. Moore has replaced Stephanie  Mills, who replaced Jennifer Holliday.  </P> <P>  -- Preceding "Harlem Suite" at the Pantages is "Don't Get God Started," a  revival of the gospel musical by Ron Milner (book) and Marvin Winans (music),  who stars with his wife, Vicki Winans. It opens Wednesday and plays through May  7.  </P> <P>  -- The Long Beach Civic Light Opera has announced its 1989-90 season:  "Sophisticated Ladies" (Oct. 5-22), "Follies" (March 1-18, using the original  script as opposed to the revised version recently seen in London), "Jesus  Christ, Superstar" (May 3-20) and "1776" (July 12-29, 1990). LBCLO may later  add a new musical version of "Our Town," which is expected to feature Mary  Martin as the Stage Manager; Long Beach was one of the five original investors  in it.  </P> <P>  -- The California Music Theatre continues its revivals at the Pasadena Civic  Auditorium -- including "Kiss Me, Kate," opening Saturday. George Hearn has  bowed out of the role of Pseudolus in the CMT's upcoming "A Funny Thing  Happened on the Way to the Forum" (June 14-July 2). He has been replaced by  E.E. Bell. The "Forum" cast also will feature Jack Carter, Lu Leonard, Barney  Martin and Michael Tucci.  </P> <P>  -- As announced Wednesday, the Music Center will present two musicals in  two-week runs this summer: "Gypsy" with Tyne Daly and "Fiddler on the Roof"  with Topol. "We feel dedicated to the genre," said Music Center Operating  Company president Sandra Kimberling, "because it's obviously what people want  to see." She hopes more time will open up for musicals in the existing Music  Center halls after the new Disney Hall opens in 1993.  </P> <P> On the debit side, Angelenos shouldn't expect to see LACLO's canceled "Anything  Goes" any time soon. The touring company closed prematurely. "The physical  production was too heavy to travel and make all those one-week dates on time,"  said a spokesman for the show. A leaner "Anything Goes" may be revived in time  to make its scheduled Sept. 19 opening at Orange County Performing Arts Center,  but Los Angeles won't see it until 1990 at the earliest.  </P> <P> AWARDS: The Theatre League Alliance (Theatre LA) will present its newly created  Governors Awards to 15 recipients "who have contributed significantly to the  excellence of live theater in Los Angeles."  </P> <P> The honorees: composer-lyricist Billy Barnes, producer-actress Marla Gibbs,  LACLO founder Edwin Lester, East West Players founder Mako, writer-director  Luis Valdez, Music Center creator Dorothy Chandler, critic Dick Lochte, Los  Angeles Endowment for the Arts architect (and Los Angeles City Councilman) Joel  Wachs, and actors Charlton Heston, Jack Lemmon, Lu Leonard and Mary Martin.  Awards will be presented in memoriam to actor-director John Allison, Pasadena  Playhouse founder Gilmor Brown and actor Henry Fonda.  </P> <P> The awards, designed by artist Robert Graham, will be presented at a Nov. 20  ceremony at the Pasadena Playhouse. The event is intended to become an annual  affair.  </P> <P> THE CALLBOARD Theatre will be busy in the next three months. First up is  Project III doing Bertolt Brecht's "Baal," opening May 12 for three weeks. Then  the newly formed Strike Theatre will present three plays in repertory: Don  DeLillo's "The Day Room," the Jacobean thriller "The Revengers," and the  premiere of Harry Kondoleon's "The Fairy Garden."  </P> <P> A MEMORIAL for actor Merritt Butrick, who played the hustler in "Kingfish" at  Los Angeles Theatre Center last year, will be held Monday at 8 p.m. in the LATC  lobby. Butrick died last month of undisclosed causes. Contributions may be made  in his memory to the Actors Fund of America.  </P></p>

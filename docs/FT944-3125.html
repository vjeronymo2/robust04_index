			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Belgacom troubles cloud prospect of privatisation Decorative marble is causing trouble at Belgacom, Belgium's state telephone monopoly. The embattled company was also forced yesterday to deny local newspaper reports that its entire board was about to be replaced ahead of a planned privatisation. The marble was hauled away from Belgacom-towers, the company's new headquarters, but officials denied the decision was a matter of taste. 'The decorations were removed for acoustic and structural reasons,' a spokeswoman said yesterday, an operation which added to the BFr1.6bn (Pounds 31.6m) cost of preparing Belgacom-towers for occupation. News of the expensive refurbishment has not gone down well with the public. Belgium's biggest state-owned enterprise is reputed to be one of Europe's least efficient telephone monopolies. Furthermore, internal rows have frightened off potential investors, delaying a long talked of privatisation. A sell-off is unlikely before 1996 and so far details are sketchy. The government plans to sell only part of the operation to a private investor while retaining control of at least 50 per cent. No timetable has been set and the government has not specified which sections of the company it intends to sell. But if it fails to act, the company risks being overtaken by the rapid development of global telecommunications. In particular 1998 sees the obligatory deregulation of Europe's telephone monopolies under EU law, a date being eagerly watched by privatised telecoms operators. Yesterday Mr Elio di Rupo, communications minister, did not deny reports that Belgacom's board and chief executive would be dismissed soon. He merely said such reports were 'premature'. Belgium's francophone Le Soir newspaper said Mr Bessel Kok, chief executive, and Mr Benoit Remiche, chairman, would be dismissed with large pay-offs. The two men have been at loggerheads over the running of the company and have fallen out publicly. Mr Peter Drummond, a consultant working closely with Mr Kok, was forced to resign after it emerged that he was being paid by both Belgacom and PA Consulting group, advising Belgacom on setting up a mobile phone venture. The row has further delayed progress towards privatisation by creating even greater rifts within top management, already split along party lines. On the question of refurbishment, Belgacom has spent the money on modifications that include two outside lifts, a staff canteen and conference rooms. 'Belgacom has rigorously respected the budgets approved by the board for the refurbishment work which has been necessary for the instalment of about 3,000 employees who, for a long time now, have been owed a decent place to work,' it said in a statement.</p>

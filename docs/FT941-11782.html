			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / Turkish interbank rate at 600% as turmoil persists Turkey's interbank rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other, reached 600 per cent yesterday as turmoil continued in the money markets. Government initiatives have failed to halt the turbulence, which began after the devaluation of the lira last week and the resignation on Monday of the central bank governor, Mr Bulent Gultekin. Several big retail banks increased interest rates yesterday, with Akbank, the largest privately-owned bank raising rates by 2 percentage points to 90 per cent on one-year deposits. Lending rates are between 120 and 150 per cent. The crisis has forced the government back to the domestic debt markets, after limiting its short-term borrowing to reduce budget costs during 1993. The treasury has now announced a series of short-term bill issues aimed at absorbing the liquidity largely created by its own growing demand for short-term advances from the central bank. Those short-term advances were cited by Mr Gultekin as the main reason behind the pressure on the lira, and the subsequent 12 per cent devaluation. The governor had reportedly sought a 30 per cent devaluation. The government has also unveiled a novel index-linked government debt instrument, which will be half repayable in dollars after three months at a rate of 20,500 to the lira. The dollar closed yesterday at 17,200.</p>

Since the  unbanning of the ANC [African National Congress] the  revolutionaries' plan to break the power of the police has  succeeded, assisted to a considerable degree by the De Klerk  government.    The replacement of former Law and Order Minister Adriaan  Vlok  by Mr. Hernus Kriel is only one of the demands of the ANC-SACP  [South African Communist Party] alliance that have been met, and  one could mention several more examples of a planned strategy to  undermine the effectiveness and morale of the police.    These developments only serve to strengthen the impression  that Mr. F. W. de Klerk's government has betrayed the police.  In September 1990, Police Commissioner General Johan van der  Merwe stated that it is important for a government to be able to  depend on the absolute loyalty of each member of the police  force. Loyalty is only possible if the members of the force  trust the government, he added.    He must surely remember those words now that his generals  are  being placed under the microscope by Goldstone. Justice  Goldstone's report this weekend contains allegations which have  not been tested in a court of law. The judge seems to be making  a habit of releasing reports critical of the country's security  forces. His report two years ago about particular South African  Defense Force actions was first presented to the ANC before he  took it to the government.    Despite Justice Goldstone's public image as a liberal, he  was  chosen by the government to carry out a number of investigations  into the security forces. His findings on the Seboking  shootings in 1991 dealt largely with greater control over the  South African Police. As a result of the report nine policemen  were charged with murder. At present more than 300 policemen  are in prison for carrying out their duties. Some are in Death  Row.    Hundreds of policemen are murdered every year. In 1991 the  SAP introduced voluntary psychological support for stressed and  traumatized policemen. Between 1991 and 1993, 132 policemen  committed suicide, and the incidence of dismissals due to  depression and tension has increased by 300 percent. In 1991 a  law was passed by Parliament barring policemen from membership  of any political party. This measure was apparently aimed at  policemen with right- wing sympathies. Yet a mere two years  later, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union, Popcru, was  openly allowed to take part in the marches organized by the  ANC-SACP alliance.    AFRICA CONFIDENTIAL stated in 1992 that a purging of  generals  in the defense and police forces who were unsympathetic toward  the new South Africa was imminent. In June of 1993 the ANC  warned the SAP that a new government would get rid of any  policeman with, quote, blood on his hands. Last month, at the  obvious insistence of the ANC, SAP headquarters was asked for a  list of all policemen who had fired their weapons at least twice  in the course of duty. Despite the loss of more than 14,000  policemen in the past two years, more policemen announced their  intention to resign after this incident. Many of them told the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] that they could no longer  serve a National Party government, in spite of the increased  salaries they are being offered in the election campaign.    The SAP is in tatters and reeling. While APLA [Azanian  People's Liberation Army -- military wing of the Pan-Africanist  Congress] and MK [Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] are  causing havoc, the police are subjected to strict codes of  conduct, overseas watchdogs, civilian monitoring councils,  prosecution, prison sentences, and called to account at the  World Trade Center and, worst of all, betrayed by their own.  Thousands of members of the police force worry about their  future. They know inwardly that they cannot support communism  in whatever guise. They belong among their own people where  they can defend their heritage. They are welcome in the  republic of the Boer Afrikaners.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Knin, 19 Jun (TANJUG) -- The Republic of Serb  Krajina [RSK] is always prepared for talks with the Croatian  side, RSK President Milan Martic told a TANJUG correspondent.  "We can talk at any time anywhere in Krajina," he added. "We  know we are a state and nothing can make us change our mind. We  are prepared to meet them in Plitvice whenever they want."    Expressing the willingness to resume talks, Martic doubted  at  the same time whether the Croatian side will accept it, because  "Krajina will remain adamant in its stand that one cannot go  below what is known as reciprocity and equal terms."    Martic claimed that the latest talks in Plitvice failed  because they did not suit Croatia's needs and that journalists  were used only as a pretext. "They do not suit Croatia's needs,  the Croats are even prepared to sacrifice their own people at  the expense of a war option," the RSK president claimed. "They  were brought into this situation because we agreed to the talks  and they had obviously not counted on it."    Martic said that in Geneva the Croats asked that the meeting  be held anywhere in "Croatia, including the RSK." Hence their  surprise when we agreed to the talks in Plitvice, because they  counted on the Serbian side's refusal. In this way they would  have precipitated the war and found international sponsors for  this attempt.    "We really wanted to discuss economic issues, primarily the  opening of communication lines. But, we are determined about  one thing -- we cannot talk about it unless [UN] Security  Council Resolution No. 820 is abolished."    According to Martic, there are many issues to discuss. The  RSK will ask to be allowed to use the ports of Zadar and  Rovanjska and for access to Europe through Croatian territory,  that is, through Italy, Slovenia, Austria, and Hungary. "In  exchange for that, we would let them use our communications and,  of course, we are ready to give water to Bigrad and Zadar, but  it seems that this does not suit Tudjman and his policy," Martic  says.    Martic believes Tudjman does not care much for the Croats in  Dalmatia. "If we were pounding Zagreb he would be concerned,  but the fact that Zadar has no water supply is in fact good for  him because he uses it to keep people under control and motivate  them to fight against us."    Milan Martic says the Croatian leaders are to blame for the  lack of a regular water supply in Biograd and Zadar because they  are refusing to hold talks. "Everything they are doing is  leading toward the war option, and they will surely strike," he  said. "At the moment they are prevented by huge rifts in the  political and military leaderships, but the opposition is  forcing Tudjman to go to war."    "Their parliament is nonexistent. It is not functioning.  Everyone is working to undermine it, and Tudjman can use that  situation to arrest all his opponents. This is why he needs an  attack on Krajina," Martic said in conclusion.</p>

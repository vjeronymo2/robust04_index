			<p>BFN     [Text] While Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was at the  Chernobyl nuclear power station and in the town of Slavutich,  the subjects of political instability in the Crimea and economic  reform, particularly rumors about the introduction of the new  Ukrainian currency, the hryvna, were raised during numerous  meetings between Kravchuk and the station's employees and  Slavutich residents. Kravchuk set forth his position on this at  the news conference that took place at Slavutich yesterday.    [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] I hope that sobriety will come  to those people who have got it into their heads that they can  do anything, while disregarding, first, Ukraine's laws and  Constitution, disregarding even the established principles of  the international community, which has set this highest line for  states, which is integrity, inviolability of borders, and  sovereignty. They thought Ukraine would continue to tolerate,  to close its eyes, while they, being guided by, say, ambitions,  act and do whatever they feel like.    We said that you have now reached that red line, and once  you  have gone past it we will act severely, resolutely, and  consistently within the framework of the constitutional system.  For our part, there is no other course. But if the other side  also acts equivalently and appropriately, then we will resolve  all issues in a peaceful, legislative way. If someone should  want to work using muscle power or pressure, then he should know  that Ukraine has sufficient forces to make safe -- I am using  the absolutely exact words -- those who resort to such  provocative and unlawful actions, which violate all world  principles, including the principles of goodneighborliness with  Russia.    I want to say that no one does more harm now to our friendly  partnership relations with Russia, which are and will be the  determining factor in spite of everything, as the Crimean  leadership does; no one does more harm. Because in words, for  people to see, they shout they want to become, so to speak, a  bridge between Ukraine and Russia; but in reality they are  always laying mines underneath this bridge, some consciously,  others because they do not know any other way to resolve in a  civilized manner except for one way -- rallies, slogans, and  irresponsibility. I call on everyone -- as you have put this  question -- to be guided by the Constitution, normative acts,  and the principles drawn up by the UN, the CSCE, and other  international organizations.    [Unidentified correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, another  increase in the exchange rate of the American dollar has  occurred in the last few days, which was caused by more rumors  of the introduction of the hryvna. And so, what prospects do we  have regarding the introduction of a national currency?    [Kravchuk] Well, first, the introduction of the hryvna is  not  some kind of rumor. We stated long ago that we are preparing to  introduce our own national currency. To do this we need the  appropriate domestic conditions and the appropriate external  assistance. I have often stressed this.    The second thing is that we are not going to, and I am  saying  this again and ask you to pass it on, make the introduction of  the hryvna into some kind of secret. When this decision is  taken, it will be taken openly, publicly. All of the mechanisms  will be set forth to the people. Everything will be set forth  to the people through the Supreme Council, through the mass  media. It will not be as has happened before: You get up on  Thursday and already you have different money and different  prices. This will not happen this time. One can calm down.    We wanted to know what money remains in the banks now, how  much money there is in circulation now, how many notes, so that  we know what we have, how much and what exchange there is, what  the relationship is. And the National Bank and government sent  an appropriate letter to the localities. This is a normal  phenomenon when the state wants to know what it has. And again  people say, oh, they now want to know (?how much money there  is), they are going to introduce the hryvna.    Believe me, there is not going to be a cavalry attack here.  It will be done in a civilized way, consistently, openly  ...[recording abruptly ends]</p>

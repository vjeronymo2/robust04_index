Disputed security issues were settled by the agreement the two  sides signed in Cairo last week.    Ahmad Quray', Fatah Central Committee member and a key  Palestinian negotiator, said the Cairo agreement is a genuine  translation of the Oslo accord. What we have reached on the  border crossings, he said, was even better than what was reached  in Oslo. He noted that the Israelis agreed that the Palestinian  flag be raised over the crossings.</p>

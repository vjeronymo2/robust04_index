			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Hungarians and Czechs seek unity Czech and Hungarian leaders met yesterday in Budapest to salvage central European regional co-operation, the prospects for which have been damaged by the planned break-up of the Czech and Slovak Federation, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. Mr Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, and Mr Jozsef Antall, his Hungarian counterpart, committed themselves to the Visegrad group of central European countries and to the goal of a free trade zone - whether of three or four members. The two premiers took pains to include Slovakia in the process, saying that to isolate it was in no one's interests.</p>

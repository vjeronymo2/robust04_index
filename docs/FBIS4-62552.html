			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Grigoriy Arslanov, Pavel Spirin] </F>   [Text] Beijing May 15 TASS -- "Talks with leaders of the  permanent committee of the Chinese Assembly of People's  Representatives and other Chinese officials are being held in a  businesslike atmosphere," said visiting chairman of the lower  house of the Russian Parliament, Ivan Rybkin, in an interview  with ITAR-TASS on Sunday.    According to Rybkin, Chinese representatives reiterated that  "Russia's coordinates are of priority importance in the Chinese  foreign policy." He pointed out that during the talks between  the Russian parliamentary delegation and Chinese officials there  was a broad exchange of opinions on problems of bilateral ties  and international politics.    Rybkin pointed out a great role played by the State Duma in  the formation of Russian diplomacy and the public opinion, which  can be seen from recent parliamentary hearings on the entire  spectrum of Russo-Chinese relations.    Touching upon prospects for trade and economic cooperation  between Russia and China, Rybkin pointed out that there is a big  potential in this sphere which was not used up.    "The chairman of the Chinese of the State Planning Committee  put down in his note-book our proposal to supply Siberian goods  to nearby Chinese areas. Russian goods are cheaper than those  imported by China, for instance, from Canada, are no worse in  quality and more accessible, taking into account a short  distance between the partners," Rybkin said.    "I believe that a joint Russo-Chinese commission will work  to  mutual advantage. Russia, possessing the necessary technologies  and highly-qualified experts, might take part in a competition  for the construction of the hydro-power complex Sanxi on the  Yangtze river, which is the biggest in the world. The Russian  "Elektrosila" plant in St. Petersburg is unrivalled in this  field," Rybkin noted.    Later in the day, Rybkin laid a wreath at the monument to  people's heroes in Beijing.</p>

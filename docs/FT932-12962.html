			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2 begins a week of 10-minute programmes commenting upon 40 of the 'best' (whatever that means) pictures in British art galleries. Today in the first episode of The Great Picture Trail Neil MacGregor, director of the National Gallery, presents his choice of of eight, beginning with Titian's 'Three Ages Of Man'. The paintings were selected for 'Sainsbury's Pictures For Schools', a scheme providing 750 schools with framed prints and videos (7.20). The expensive bickering between British Airways and Virgin continues. World In Action reports on the price war between the two airlines and the 'dirty tricks' campaign alleged to have been waged by BA (ITV 8.30). Channel 4 launches a sequence of documentaries about television around the world, Channels of Resistance (10.55) starts with 'Distress Signals' which advances the well-worn thesis that television is becoming global without becoming international: 'The danger is that one national style, the American, will be imposed on all others with disastrous consequences for indigenous production'.</p>

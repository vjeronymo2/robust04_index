			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Company News: Kymmene still in the red KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, made a FM370m (Dollars 87m) loss (after financial items) in the first four months of the year. This compares with a FM73m loss for the same period of 1991 and a deficit last year of FM843m. Mr Harri Piehl, the company's chief executive officer, said Kymmene would make a 'significant loss' this year but it would be 'clearly less' than in 1991. He added that earnings are expected to 'have turned into profit' by the end of the year. A gross profit of FM618m for the first four months amounted to 14.2 per cent of turnover and contrasted with a figure of FM604m for the same period of last year, or 14 per cent of turnover. Turnover was slightly up on the first four months of 1991 to FM4.36bn from FM4.32bn a year earlier.</p>

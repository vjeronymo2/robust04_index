			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RUNNING;  </P> <P> PADILLA BREAKS U.S. RECORD, BUT NO WORLD BEST  </P> <P> All Doug Padilla was trying to do Sunday in the Carlsbad 5,000 men's elite race  was stay in contention. Nothing more, nothing less.  </P> <P> Pretty simple strategy, really.  </P> <P> "I was just trying to match whatever move anybody made," he said.  </P> <P> What he did was come up with a few moves nobody else made and win in 13:29.50,  an American 5,000-meter road race record.  </P> <P> Padilla came in just ahead of Mexico's Ignacio Fragoso (13:31) and Kenya's  Barnaba Korir (13:37).  </P> <P> Elly Van Hulst of Holland won the women's elite race in 15:32.50. PattiSue  Plumer was second in 15:35 and Annette Peters next in 15:36.  </P> <P> There were an estimated 35,000 spectators. Padilla and Van Hulst each won  $5,000.  </P> <P> There were no world bests, noteworthy because of the race's history. The men's  winner has set a world standard in three of the past four years. Two of those  were by Steve Scott, who was 10th Sunday. Padilla surpassed Scott's American  mark of 13:30.2.  </P> <P> "This is a real high point," Padilla said. "This is by far the most prestigious  5K in the world. To come here and have a good race would be great, but to have  a good race and get the American record is fantastic."  </P> <P> Padilla, 33, lives in Orem, Utah. He completed his eligibility at Brigham Young  University in 1981 and got a degree in electrical engineering from there in  1983. He holds the American track record at 3,000 meters, two miles (indoors)  and 5,000 meters (indoors). He has run well in 1990, winning the indoor track  circuit's grand prix, after a rough spell last year.  </P> <P> Still, he wasn't sure how he would fare in Carlsbad. He has asthma, and spring  isn't normally a very good time for that. And, he wasn't happy with his  performance in Carlsbad last year -- he was so far back in the pack that he  doesn't even know where he finished. Finally, his wife gave birth to his third  child two weeks ago, so he hasn't gotten much sleep lately.  </P> <P> He took the lead about 1 1/4 miles into the race and, while never running away,  fended off the others.  </P> <P> As Padilla approached the two-mile mark, 12 runners were bunched up in a tight  lead pack. The leaders crossed the two-mile mark in 8:51. Two-and-a-half miles  in, six runners remained in the lead pack -- but Padilla was ahead.  </P> <P> "I could always hear footsteps," he said. "Two guys came up with me and the  second turnaround (Carlsbad Blvd./Mountain View Dr.) and I had to push to stay  up. Down the home stretch, Fragoso was right there."  </P> <P> The second turn-around, though, was crucial. There are two on the course, and  both are hairpin turns, much tighter than what Padilla is used to on a track.  </P> <P> "One difference is, you can get boxed in on either side in a road race," he  said. "If you're in the second or third lane on a track, you're never going to  get boxed in. Last year, I bet I lost 30 yards on the first turnaround."  </P> <P> Once he successfully navigated the second turn Sunday, it was just a question  of hanging on.  </P> <P> "I could feel that I was starting to get tired. My legs were getting tight  during the last 400 meters. I could see the finish wasn't very far away. I was  just hoping to get there before my legs fell apart."  </P> <P> The biggest problem Van Hulst faced in the women's race was at the start. The  elite men and women ran at the same time, and one of the men got tangled up in  the crowd at the start and fell in Van Hulst's path.  </P> <P> "I jumped over him," Van Hulst said. "I was just hoping I didn't fall. I think  I was on the wrong side. I started on the left side. Next year, I'll stay on  the right side."  </P> <P> Van Hulst, who won the 3,000-meter race at the European Indoor Championships  and holds the world record for that distance at 8:33, also had to contend with  a pack, albeit smaller, in the women's race. She, Plumer and Peters were close  the entire way.  </P></p>

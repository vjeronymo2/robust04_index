			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COCOA prices at the London Futures and Options Exchange fell sharply yesterday, continuing the downturn that began on Monday morning. As speculators and investment funds unloaded holdings the September delivery price tumbled to Pounds 594 a tonne at the close, down Pounds 22 on the day and Pounds 38 from the 2 1/2 -month peak reached on Monday. Traders suggested, however, that the market was likely to consolidate at around the present level, which was still Pounds 85 above the 16 1/2 -year low reached nearly three weeks ago. At the London Metal Exchange COPPER and TIN prices made modest gains from Monday's closing levels but other metals lost further ground. And copper's rise of Pounds 9.25 in the three months position was mainly a reflection of sterling's weakness. In dollar terms, the price was down slightly from Monday's final kerb close. Tin prices were boosted earlier by a wave of short-covering following the falls of the three preceding trading days. After drifting back later the three months price closed at Dollars 7,077.50 a tonne, up Dollars 25 on balance. NICKEL remained easier after investment fund liquidation, the three months price closing at Dollars 7,442.50 a tonne, down Dollars 72.50 on the day.</p>

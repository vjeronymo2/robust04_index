			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> PRICE WORTH 56 POINTS; OKLAHOMA RIPS LOYOLA  </P> <P> They do things differently at Oklahoma. The team's radio announcer wears a  tuxedo, complete with red bow tie. The shooting guard sings the national  anthem.  </P> <P> But one thing never changes: The Sooners don't lose in Norman, and Loyola  Marymount did little to challenge that record Saturday in a 172-112 blowout in  front of a crowd of 10,910.  </P> <P> For the 13th-ranked Sooners (8-1) it was the 51st consecutive victory in Lloyd  Noble Center, and their 75th in a row against nonconference opponents. Nobody  outside the Big Eight has beaten the Sooners at home since Tulsa in December  1982. And the victory raised Oklahoma Coach Billy Tubbs' record to 98-0 in  100-point games.  </P> <P> The Sooner assault was led by their newest hired gun, junior guard Brent Price,  who was freed from point guard duties Saturday and also wasn't asked to sing  "The Star Spangled Banner," which he has done on occasion.  </P> <P> He did everything else: The younger brother of NBA star Mark Price had 11  three-point baskets on the way to 56 points, joining Wayman Tisdale as the only  Sooners to top 50. It was also a record performance for the Noble Center. He  made 20 of 33 shots, 19 from three-point range, and added nine assists.  </P> <P> Oklahoma's point total was the highest ever against Loyola by a bunch,  eclipsing the 152 scored by Northeastern three weeks ago.  </P> <P> Syracuse 94, Cal State Long Beach 79 -- Host Syracuse, out to make a good  impression after a lackluster performance against Canisius on Wednesday, dashed  to a 19-6 lead and built a 32-point bulge in the second half.  </P> <P> No. 3 Syracuse (9-0), which built a 55-35 halftime lead, left no doubt about  the outcome as it held the 49ers to 14 points in the first 11 1/2 minutes of  the second half.  </P> <P> Boise State 66, Pepperdine 56 -- Pepperdine, which led by 12 points in the  first half and by six with 8:58 to play, went scoreless the final 3:12 in  losing at Boise, Idaho. Boise State led, 57-56, when the Waves went cold. The  Broncos then made eight of eight free throws.  </P> <P> Cal State Fullerton 109, Mississippi Valley 100 -- Mississippi Valley State  guard Alphonso Ford got his points Saturday night, but host Cal State Fullerton  got the victory. Ford finished with 39 points, above his 34.1 average.  </P> <P> Fullerton's Joe Small scored 29 points, making 12 of 17 shots from the field  and five three-point baskets. When Mississippi Valley State cut Fullerton's  lead to 84-80 midway through the second half, Small made two consecutive  three-point shots to make it 90-80. ALAN DROOZ  </P></p>

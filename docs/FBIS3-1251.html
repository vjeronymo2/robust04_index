The mood was tense.    Some of the strikers have apparently been sent to King  William's Town to monitor the arrival of the SAP [South African  Police] and then to race back to give their colleagues advance  warning.    Earlier a spokesman for the strikers, Sgt S G Hewana, said  they would "talk" to the South Africans. "The police will come  and talk to us and we will tell them why we are here and they  will listen to us."    He said the strikers were holding 15 officers hostage  including three brigadiers, two colonels and two captains.    The strikers are also holding hostage the wives of several  officers who they have been unable to locate.    Sgt Hewana said the strikers had no grievance against Brig  Gqozo but "we want our grievances to be solved."    Earlier strikers released a list of demands which included  pension payouts before March 28 and leave gratuities to be  handed over to all Ciskei police force members not later than  March 24.    All officers in the force allegedly involved in corruption  should be immediately suspended, they said. These officers  should not be released until the Ciskei attorney general decided  whether or not to prosecute them.    A spokesman for the strikers said colleagues had been sent  to  fetch Police Commissioner Maj-Gen M Noqayi, also suspected by  the strikers of corruption. The police commissioner was  reportedly seeking refuge at Ciskei leader Brig Gqozo's state  house. The strikers said he would be arrested when he was found.</p>

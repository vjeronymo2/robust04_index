			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 31 December, the Defense Ministry decided that  if a serious problem arises in safety problems and in supplying  munitions because of sudden changes in Somalia, it will withdraw  in advance the ROK Army's Sangnoksu unit which is carrying out  UN peace keeping activities in Somalia. Originally, the ROK  Army's Sangnoksu unit was to withdraw from Somalia in July of  next year.    The decision for the withdrawal takes into consideration the  safety of the ROK Army in Somalia. When considering the fact  that the Defense Ministry showed hints for the possibility of  early withdrawal rather than adhering to its policy that early  withdrawal is impossible, there is high possibility that the  troops will be withdrawn earlier than scheduled on the occasion  of the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in the ROK which is  slated for late March of next year.</p>

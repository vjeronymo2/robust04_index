			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Iraq has informed the Arab League that the rulers of  Saudi Arabia and Kuwait continue to provide facilities for the  U.S., British, and French aircraft that violate the Iraqi  airspace, thus seriously threatening Iraq's security,  sovereignty, and national unity.    In a letter of protest to the Arab League secretary general  yesterday, the Iraqi permanent representative to the Arab League  said that from 27-31 January U.S., British, and French aircraft  carried out 192 hostile air sorties after flying from their  bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.    Attaching his letter to a list detailing these violations,  the Iraqi representative asked that it be distributed among the  Arab member states.</p>

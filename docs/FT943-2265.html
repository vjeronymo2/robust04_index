			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Bonds: Attention turns to World Bank global Only two new issues were launched in the eurobond market yesterday following the sharp falls in government bond prices last week. The market's attention turned instead to the World Bank's Dollars 1.5bn global offering of five-year fixed rate bonds which is expected to be launched in the next few days. 'After a terrible week, people are taking time out to consolidate and wait for the next set of (economic) figures in Europe and the US,' said one syndicate manager. General Motors Acceptance Corporation made a rare foray into the eurobond market, tapping the dollar sector for the first time since June 1993 with a Dollars 200m offering of three-year eurobonds. The bonds were priced to yield 47 basis points over US government bonds. Syndicate managers said pricing was aggressive given the current weakness of the US bond market, although the spread was maintained when the bonds had broken syndicate. The deal was supported by yesterday's better tone in government bond markets, lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation said. Demand came mainly from retail investors in Switzerland, the Benelux countries, the UK and Germany. In the Swiss franc sector, Dresdner Finance launched SFr150m of four-year bonds with a coupon of 5.5 per cent. The deal saw some interest from retail investors, joint lead manager Dresdner Bank said.</p>

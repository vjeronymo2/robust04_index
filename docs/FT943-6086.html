			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Profit-taking and 'marking time' were how traders described a poor trading day in both stock index futures and the traded options, writes Joel Kibazo. In futures, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,287. This turned out to be the day's high and the contract drifted lower for the next few hours. The easier bond prices only served to increase the drift in the first half and one trader said: 'The contract just cannot seem to shake off the holiday mood.' September steadied over the lunchtime period before the dull opening on Wall Street triggered another retreat in the contract. September finished at 3,263, down 24 from the previous close and at a strong premium of 14 points to the underlying cash market. Volume remained very poor, reaching only 8,333 lots by the close. In spite of the modest volume, dealers remain positive about the underlying tone of the market and expect a return to more positive territory in the near future. It was also a slow day in the traded options. Total turnover fell to 18,044 contracts, against Friday's figure of 34,796 lots. Among the index options, the FT-SE 100 saw business of 5,817 lots and the Euro FT-SE 1,591 contracts. GEC was the busiest stock option, trading 1,304 lots. It was followed by Barclays with 1,112 contracts.</p>

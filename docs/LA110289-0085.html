			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL, SCHOOL RACES TOP BALLOTING;  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARDS: 23 DISTRICTS ARE HOLDING ELECTIONS. THE CAMPAIGNS HAVE BEEN MOST  HEATED IN POMONA WHERE THE ISSUES ARE TEST SCORES AND OVERCROWDING AND IN  HACIENDA LA PUENTE WHERE THE DEBATE CENTERS ON SO-CALLED MORBID READING  MATERIALS.;  </P> <P> AZUSA UNIFIED  </P> <P> Five candidates are vying for three board seats in the Azusa Unified School  District, which has 10,357 students.  </P> <P> William D. Bradway, 47, is an industrial electronics consultant. An Azusa High  graduate, he has lived in the city on and off since 1952 and has a son in a  local school.  </P> <P> Board President Rosemary Garcia, 44, has served on the board for five years and  has always lived in the city. A consumer service representative in the city's  utilities department, she has five children and taught catechism for two years  at St. Francis of Rome Church.  </P> <P> Inez Z. Gutierrez, 54, has been on the board for 18 years and teaches religion  at St. Francis. She has sent three children through Azusa schools. Born in  Azusa, the Citrus High graduate has served on the city's advisory personnel  board for eight years.  </P> <P> Eunice P. Harrington, a San Gabriel elementary and junior high teacher for 19  years, has served on the board eight years. A Parks and Recreation commissioner  for eight years, she has served as director of the county School Board Trustees  Assn. She is pursuing a doctoral degree in education at Pacific Western  University.  </P> <P> Louis A. Zamora, 28, owns a limousine service and is data processing director  at an accounting firm. He chairs the watchdog Azusa Taxpayers Assn. Born in  Azusa, he graduated from Gladstone High and served in the Marine Corps for  seven years. He has three children in district schools.  </P> <P> Baldwin Park Unified  </P> <P> In the Baldwin Park Unified School District, which serves 15,707 students from  kindergarten through 12th grade, three candidates are running for two school  board seats.  </P> <P> Two of the candidates, Robert C. Gair and Robert Viramontes, are longtime  incumbents. Gair, 56, an estimator for a roofing company, has served on the  board for 17 years. Viramontes, 47, an assistant director of data processing  for the county Office of Education, has served for 16 years.  </P> <P> They cite the district's financial solvency, rising test scores and successful  drug-prevention programs as reasons why they should be be reelected.  </P> <P> Their challenger is Anthony J. Bejarano, 41, a retired railroad switchman, who  is running for public office for the first time. He is the founder of the Paul  Bejarano Foundation for Suicide Prevention, a counseling and educational  organization that he formed after his son's death.  </P> <P> Bejarano, who says he would donate the modest stipend received by school board  members to a scholarship fund, contends that the current board does not devote  enough time to interacting with high-risk youths.  </P> <P> Bassett Unified  </P> <P> Six candidates, including three incumbents, are vying for three seats on the  Bassett Unified School District Board of Education. About 5,100 students attend  schools in the western La Puente district, which has an annual budget of about  $20 million.  </P> <P> Challengers are personnel commissioner Anna A. Aguilar; businessman Robert J.  Fuentes and railroad employee Brenda J. Johnson. They say that feuding board  members have impeded the district's ability to tackle problems such as drug use  and gang activity.  </P> <P> Challengers point to hostility displayed by incumbents Carol A. Smithberg, 55,  and Hector Varela, 46, at a candidates' forum last week. Incumbent Barbara Boyd  is also running.  </P> <P> Varela and Smithberg concede that they have deep philosophical differences  about how the district should be run. But "we are very polite to each other,"  Smithberg said. "The district is being run well."  </P> <P> Varela, who is running for his third term, says his experience on the board  qualifies him for reelection.  </P> <P> In June, Varela was the only board member who voted against consolidating  school bus stops and eliminating several routes. The district approved the  $100,000 cut from its $450,000 transportation budget but later reversed itself  after more than 100 parents protested.  </P> <P> Aguilar, Boyd, Fuentes and Johnson could not be reached.  </P> <P> Charter Oak Unified  </P> <P> Two incumbents and a challenger are vying for two seats on the Charter Oak  Unified School District board. The district has 5,668 students in parts of  Covina, Glendora and San Dimas and the unincorporated area of Charter Oak.  </P> <P> Ralph E. Bristol, 55, a 12-year board veteran, has a bachelor of arts degree  from Cal State Los Angeles and a master of science degree from USC. He is a  professor of accounting at Rio Hondo College in Whittier and a resident of  Covina.  </P> <P> John A. Rose, 41, Covina, has been on the board four years. He is a graduate of  Mt. San Antonio College and Cal State Los Angeles and is administrator of the  Masonic Home in Covina.  </P> <P> Lisa K. Edwards, 35, a Covina lawyer, is a graduate of UC Santa Barbara and the  University of the Pacific. She is vice president and manager of Trust Services  of America Inc. in the Pasadena regional office.  </P> <P> Claremont Unified  </P> <P> In the Claremont Unified School District, which has 11 schools and 5,900  students, three incumbents are seeking reelection against a single challenger  in a campaign that has drawn little interest.  </P> <P> Judith W. Cody, 45, a real estate agent, said she is running on a strong record  that ranges from efforts to establish substance abuse programs in Claremont  elementary schools to her service as chairman of a San Gabriel valley coalition  on education.  </P> <P> John Dierking, 27, a University of La Verne law student and substitute teacher,  is challenging the incumbents. He charged that some members want to increase  vocational education courses, thereby reducing the district's traditional  emphasis on academic programs. Dierking, a graduate of Claremont High School  and Pitzer College, said the district should continue to offer a solid academic  foundation to all students.  </P> <P> J. Michael Fay, 52, a financial planner and former teacher, said Dierking's  suggestion is untrue. Fay said that the district should pay more attention to  the needs of students who plan to end their formal education at high school but  that no one wants to diminish the academic program. Fay, who has served on the  board for eight years, said the absence of major issues in the election  reflects the fact that board members have been working well together.  </P> <P> Sue Keith, 46, a public relations consultant, said that when she ran four years  ago, there were a number of controversial problems, including troubled  relations between teachers and the district. This year, she said, the campaign  has been low-key because there are no major issues.  </P> <P> Covina-Valley Unified  </P> <P> An incumbent and five challengers are competing for two seats on the  five-member board of the Covina-Valley Unified School District, which has  11,500 students in Covina, Irwindale, West Covina and Glendora. The district  has 12 elementary schools, three intermediate schools, three high schools and  one continuation school.  </P> <P> Jake A. Godown, 40, is a sales manager. He has lived in West Covina for more  than 10 years and attended Mt. San Antonio College.  </P> <P> Pat Heritage, 49, is an inventory production control clerk in the City of  Industry. She is president of the Business and Professional Women's Club in  West Covina. Heritage moved to the district 20 years ago from Boise, Ida.  </P> <P> Gilbert R. Ramirez is the current president and a six-year veteran of the  board. Ramirez, 49, has a bachelor's degree in urban studies and a master's  degree in public administration, both from Pepperdine University. He is a  parole officer for the state of California and has lived in West Covina for 21  years.  </P> <P> Duane A. Vasquez, 32, is a graduate of Mt. San Antonio College. He earned his  associate's degree in general education and is now working on a bachelor's  degree in business management through Liberty University in Virginia. Vasquez,  who has lived in West Covina all his life, is a design engineer for Kimball  Industries in Monrovia.  </P> <P> Ellen F. Sandt, 34, is a senior administrative analyst and a 16-year resident  of the district. Sandt has a bachelor of arts degree from Cal Poly Pomona in  liberal studies.  </P> <P> Allen Wilson, 21, of West Covina, is a student majoring in political science at  Cal State Northridge. He received his associate's degree in liberal arts from  Mt. San Antonio College.  </P> <P> Duarte Unified  </P> <P> There are 4,200 students in the Duarte Unified School District. Incumbent James  M. Bowers and challengers Kenneth Bell and Phillip R. Reyes are vying for two  seats on the board.  </P> <P> Bell, 45, is an investigator for the Los Angeles County district attorney's  office. He was a teacher for 10 years in Los Angeles city schools and worked  for the Sheriff's Department as well. Bell has an associate of arts degree in  sociology from East Los Angeles Collge. He has lived in Duarte for nine years  and has four children in Duarte schools.  </P> <P> Bowers, 59, is seeking a second term after four years on the board. He has a  master's degree in general education and has been an educator for 32 years. He  is a professor of computer-aided drafting at Pasadena City College. A Duarte  resident for 13 years, he has a 9-year-old in the school system.  </P> <P> Reyes, 34, is a real estate agent and president of the Monrovia/Duarte Assn. of  Realtors. A graduate of Bassett High School in La Puente, Reyes has lived in  Duarte for 11 years and has three children in the school system. He works as a  mentor to high school youths and is on the Vocational Advisory Committee at  Duarte High School.  </P> <P> El Monte City  </P> <P> Four candidates are vying for three seats in a relatively quiet election for  the El Monte City School District board, whose members have engaged in some  acrimonious personality clashes in the past.  </P> <P> The board oversees a district of 18 elementary schools with 10,970 students.  </P> <P> David Reed, a Glendora print shop owner, is seeking a second four-year term. He  has proposed a system of what he calls "strategic planning" for the district,  to avoid "last-minute" decision-making. "I'm looking for more long-range  planning and input from the community to set the direction of the district,"  said Reed, who has two children in public schools.  </P> <P> Shirley Mante, who also is seeking a second term, has contended that there are  virtually no issues in this year's election. "We just have the same types of  problems that all the districts face," said Mante, a housewife whose only son  graduated from Arroyo High School last year.  </P> <P> Sue Weldon, a school secretary in the district, said that "the district is in  great shape," but that her years as a PTA member could provide some special  insight into district problems. "I'd like to have a little input into decisions  that are coming up," she said.  </P> <P> Marvin J. Cichy, an attorney, could not be reached.  </P> <P> El Monte Union High School  </P> <P> Three seats are up for grabs on the El Monte Union High School District board,  which has helped to initiate an extraordinary construction surge in the last  four years.  </P> <P> Ground has been broken for an adult education center, which will be the  second-largest such school in the state. Construction of a new building and  gymnasium for El Monte High School is also planned. The district has four  comprehensive high schools and a continuation school, with 8,500 full-time  students and 13,000 part-time adult students.  </P> <P> Helen Archer, an educational representative for California Edison, is seeking a  third four-year term. "There are so many projects under way that appear  meritorious that I decided to see them through to completion," said Archer, a  former teacher.  </P> <P> Robert Brown, who owns a fire extinguisher company in El Monte, said the  current board should remain intact because of its record. "We've got a good  board, with good liberals and good conservatives," he said. "We're able to work  out issues without a lot of petty infighting."  </P> <P> Carol Mahoney, a seventh-grade teacher in Rosemead, said it is important for  continuity to be maintained on the board for the sake of the building program.  "We've started all these things, now we'd like to finish them," she said. She  said she wants to lower dropout rates and improve test scores.  </P> <P> Jim Marin, an assistant principal in Pomona and a former member of the El Monte  City School District board, is the only challenger. He could not be reached.  </P> <P> Garvey  </P> <P> The Garvey School District contains 11 elementary and two junior high schools  serving more than 7,400 children in Rosemead and parts of Monterey Park, San  Gabriel and South San Gabriel. Three of the five school board seats are up for  election. Candidates:  </P> <P> Elizabeth Diaz, 31, Rosemead, is academic-community coordinator with the UCLA  mental health programs. She attended Garvey schools and has a bachelor's degree  from Cal State Los Angeles and a master's degree in social work from USC.  </P> <P> Earleen Green, 59, Rosemead, is a campaign secretary for the Alhambra YMCA. She  worked for the Garvey School District for 29 years before retiring last year.  She went through the Garvey system and attended Mark Keppel High School, Sawyer  Business School and UCLA.  </P> <P> Virginia Gutierrez, 36, Rosemead, has been on the school board since 1985. She  is a health care administrative assistant. She attended Garvey Intermediate  School, Rosemead High School, East Los Angeles College and Rio Hondo Community  College.  </P> <P> Maryellen Wilkins, 44, South San Gabriel, works as a legal assistant for  Southern California Edison. She attended Henry Ford Community College in  Dearborn, Mich., and is a founding member of the South San Gabriel Neighborhood  Assn.  </P> <P> Hacienda La Puente Unified  </P> <P> Debate over use of so-called morbid reading books is dominating the race for  three seats on the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District board, which  serves 22,295 students from Hacienda Heights, La Puente, Industry and Valinda.  </P> <P> The district has temporarily banned the books, a series of literature-based  Canadian texts. Meanwhile, it has voted to reprint and keep teaching the  less-controversial stories and poems.  </P> <P> Several challengers say the board should have taken a different stance.  </P> <P> Joe R. Chavez, 52, a Hacienda Heights data-processing supervisor, said the  issue "was poorly handled. I don't think the books are appropriate." He added:  "All the present school board members are either teachers or administrators.  Most of the things they do are in their own self-interest."  </P> <P> Yvonne A. Garcia, 46, a La Puente educator, said she would pay more attention  to academic programs and cultivating leadership skills. She blames the morbid  book controversy on the fact that parents were not involved in choosing their  children's textbooks.  </P> <P> Sally Ann Holguin-Fallon, a La Puente educator, said the board erred in buying  the books. "Half of that series isn't approved by the state," she said. "Most  large school districts choose books off the adopted list." While she agreed  that there are some morbid stories, she objects to the books mainly on cultural  grounds. "The idioms and colloquialisms are uniquely Canadian and don't address  themselves to children in the U.S," Holguin-Fallon said.  </P> <P> Norman Hsu, 54, a Hacienda Heights postal manager, says it is time for some  fresh faces on the board. "This controversy with the morbid books, it proves  that there is a lack of communication between the board and the parents. The  board should involve the parents in the selection process,"' Hsu said.  </P> <P> Incumbent Sandy Johnson, 53, Hacienda Heights, running for a second term,  stresses her background and involvement in statewide school funding issues.  Johnson says the morbid book issue has been politicized and sensationalized.  But she adds that "we have to wait and see what kind of settlement Holt (the  publisher) is willing to make. The books we received, the stories are totally  inappropriate."  </P> <P> Kenneth C. Kim, 61, Hacienda Heights is running for a fourth term and says his  experience makes him a stabilizing force. Kim defended the controversial  series, saying it was screened by state administrators and local teachers. Kim  says he thinks parents will eventually support the books. "Granted there are  some stories that we weren't even aware were going to be in the book, but as  soon as we found out, we told teachers to avoid those stories," Kim said.  </P> <P> Other challengers are Lyla A. Eddington, a community college administrator, and  Robert F. Nero, a high school principal. Both live in Hacienda Heights; neither  could be reached.  </P> <P> Monrova Unified  </P> <P> Four candidates are running for two board seats in the Monrovia Unified School  District, which has 5,440 students. In addition, three candidates are vying for  two years of the unexpired term of Sarah Koch, who resigned last spring.  </P> <P> Candidates in the regular election:  </P> <P> David G. Draper, 37, has worked in electrical engineering for 15 years. He  received his degree from Drexel University in Philadelphia and has lived in  Monrovia for five years.  </P> <P> Christine Goudy, 44, has served on the board for four years and is a secretary  in a real estate firm. A founding member of the Monrovia Drug Awareness task  force, Goudy is on the Monrovia Coordinating Council and the Chamber of  Commerce's government affairs committee.  </P> <P> Frederick Purdy, 57, has taught history in Pasadena for 30 years and is also  completing his first term on the board. Two daughters have graduated from  schools in Monrovia, where he has lived for 26 years. He teaches business  administration at Mt. San Antonio College.  </P> <P> Paul E. Scranton Jr., 45, is assistant principal at Downey's Los Padrinos  Juvenile Hall. A seven-year Monrovia resident, Scranton is president of Court  School Educators of Southern California and holds bachelor's and master's  degrees from Cal Poly Pomona.  </P> <P> In the special election:  </P> <P> Frances Cash, 43, is a bilingual aide at Plymouth Elementary School and has  been involved in PTAs for 14 years. Born in the city, Cash is a Monrovia High  graduate.  </P> <P> Barbara Flucker, 39, is a mortgage clerk and 15-year PTA volunteer. A 10-year  Monrovia resident, she teaches Sunday school at the Divine Guidance Church.  </P> <P> John R. Ralles, 38, is the Lincoln High School math department chairman in Los  Angeles. He holds a bachelor's degree from UCLA and a master's in educational  administration from Cal State Los Angeles. He is a 10-year Monrovia resident.  </P> <P> Mountain View  </P> <P> Eight candidates, including three incumbents, are running for three seats on  the Mountain View School District Board of Education, which serves about 8,500  elementary students in El Monte and South El Monte.  </P> <P> Challengers say the board balks at expelling violent students, which hurts the  district.  </P> <P> Robert Lee Griffith, 36, an El Monte industrial engineering manager, said the  district has lost teachers because of the violence. "We've had several  incidents with weapons, one in which a kid brought two guns on campus and sold  one of them," he said.  </P> <P> Clayton Hollopeter, 51, who is running for his fourth term, called the  expulsion issue "much ado about nothing" and said students are suspended or  expelled according to a board policy that allows officials to do so after other  forms of discipline are unsuccessful.  </P> <P> Edwin E. Wallach, 54, an El Monte marketing representative, also said  discipline was a problem. "These kids get away with murder and the board won't  expel anybody," he said. "I've coached Pony League baseball for 20 years and I  know how to work with kids. Kids like discipline."  </P> <P> Robert A. Menard, 42, who was appointed to the board in June when another board  member retired, denied that the board is soft on student violence and says the  challengers lack familiarity with district procedures for expulsion. "You can't  just expel a child without a hearing," he said.  </P> <P> Andrew Prado Jr., 48, who is running for his fourth term, cited his experience.  "Over the past three terms we have improved math scores (and) built an  elementary school, and I've been instrumental in getting these things  accomplished," he said. Prado said teacher complaints about four recent  incidents "have been blown out of proportion."  </P> <P> Maria F. Avila, an El Monte compliance monitor; Georgino Caraveo, a retired  South El Monte educator, and Juan J. Wing, a retired South El Monte engineering  manager, couldn't be reached.  </P> <P> Pomona Unified  </P> <P> In the Pomona Unified School District, which has 32 schools and 26,000  students, six candidates are competing for three seats with promises to try to  improve test scores and ease crowding. The district serves the city of Pomona  and the northern part of Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> Timothy Graves, 52, who resigned as the district's superintendent a year ago  because of ill health, is seeking to return to education as a school board  member. Graves, who is a diabetic, said his health has improved enough to  permit him to carry out the duties of a board member. Graves came to Pomona as  an administrator 10 years ago and served as superintendent for five years. "The  thing that I brought to the district was a sense of stability," he said.  </P> <P> Cleve Holifield, 56, an engineer at General Dynamics Corp. and a member of the  Diamond Bar Municipal Advisory Council before that community incorporated, said  he believes the district should design a curriculum for each school that will  meet the needs of children in that neighborhood. He said that parents, students  and teachers must work together more closely and that officials must stop  blaming the area's socioeconomic conditions for poor test scores. "That's been  the excuse all these years," he said. "I think we need people (in office) who  don't know you can't do better."  </P> <P> Chaim Magnum, 39, said he believes that his Latino heritage and the obstacles  he overcame to obtain an education are among his qualifications for the school  board in a district whose students are mostly Latino and which has a high  dropout rate. Magnum, oldest of 11 children, came to this country from Colombia  when he was of high school age. He said he had no schooling between the second  and ninth grades, yet he managed to graduate from college. He said one of the  district's major problems is crowding: Thirty-two to 40 children in a classroom  is "conducive to good education."  </P> <P> Candelario J. (Cande) Mendoza, 70, publisher of the bilingual newspaper La Voz,  seeks to regain a school board seat he gave up in 1981. Mendoza said he quit  the board after one term in order to start the newspaper, but now "I've got  things in pretty good shape," and would have time to both operate the paper and  serve on the board. Mendoza said one of his major assets is his experience, 39  years in education in roles from teacher to deputy superintendent to school  board member.  </P> <P> Linda M. Stevens, a business owner and former teacher, is the only incumbent  seeking reelection. Stevens said the district needs five new schools and must  work to improve academic achievement. She noted that the district's new  superintendent has developed a plan for raising test scores. She said she wants  another term to work on scholastic achievement, to solve the student housing  problem, to implement the middle school plan and to upgrade the high schools.  </P> <P> Linda D. Wright, 41, ran for the school board two years ago and lost by just 18  votes. She is running this year with the endorsement of the teachers union and  of the union representing clerical staff, maintenance workers and other  employees. The unions also have endorsed Graves and Magnum. Wright is an  investigator with the Los Angeles County Children's Services Department and is  a former special education teacher. She holds a master's degree in counseling.  </P> <P> A seventh candidate, Robert S. Preece, an attorney, will appear on the ballot  but has withdrawn from the race. His withdrawal came too late to have his name  removed.  </P> <P> Rosemead  </P> <P> The Rosemead School District has four elementary schools and one intermediate  school that serve 2,800 children and employ 110 teachers. Three seats with  four-year terms and one seat with a two-year term are up for grabs. The  district encompasses parts of Rosemead, El Monte, Temple City and San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Incumbents Marie Ortiz and James Trainor and challengers Karan Leon and Robert  Harris are vying for four-year terms.  </P> <P> Randall Cantrell and Robert Kehne are running for the two-year term that  resulted from Fred Mascorro's vacating his seat. Harris, 47, a grocery  distribution clerk and Navy veteran, has lived in the San Gabriel Valley 37  years and has lived in Rosemead four years. He attended Arcadia High School and  has three children.  </P> <P> Leon is a mother of six children, all of whom attended district schools. She  and her husband run an investment management business. She also works part-time  managing a Pasadena roofing business. Leon has lived in the district for 19  years and has attended UCLA and Pasadena City College.  </P> <P> Ortiz, 44, a library assistant at East Los Angeles Library, has helped start a  self-sustaining child-care program, institute a drug prevention program and  purchase new textbooks during her term. A 19-year Rosemead resident, she holds  a library technician certificate from Cal State Los Angeles and has three  children, all of whom attended Rosemead district schools. She is running for  her second term.  </P> <P> Trainor, 48, has lived in Rosemead since 1965 and works as an account  representative for AT&amp;T. Three of his four sons have gone through Rosemead  School District schools. Originally from South Dakota, Trainor has taken  business courses at Pasadena City College. Trainor is running for his first  full term on the board after being elected to an uncompleted term two years  ago.  </P> <P> Cantrell, 37, is a technical analyst for Wells Fargo Bank and has lived in  Rosemead since 1974. He is the father of five children, two of whom attend  Rosemead School District schools. He has also been active in PTA and local  school district advisory committees. Cantrell graduated from Bell High School  and attended UCLA.  </P> <P> Kehne could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Rowland Unified  </P> <P> Three incumbents and one challenger are facing off for three seats in the  Rowland Unified School District, which serves 19,000 students in Rowland  Heights, La Puente, West Covina and Walnut. Candidates are elected at large.  </P> <P> Dean F. Anderson, 64, Rowland Heights, a board member since 1973, says he wants  to design programs to challenge outstanding students. He says the district must  also consider future trends in Rowland Heights. "We're beginning to get into a  declining enrollment, and we need to plan for that," he said.  </P> <P> Rolland M. Boceta, 43, West Covina, who is running for a second term, said he  wants to uphold excellence. "I have supported strong student discipline and the  prudent management of financial policies," said Boceta, a CPA whose firm does  consulting work for other school districts.  </P> <P> Joe Leon, 25, a La Puente engineer, is the sole challenger. A graduate of  Rowland Unified, Leon says he wants to improve the quality of education and  stem the dropout rate. "There's a 29% dropout in grades 10-12 alone," Leon  said. "We need to provide better counseling for student needs."  </P> <P> Mary Jo Maxwell, 49, Walnut, who is running for her second term, says she wants  to address problems of drug and alcohol abuse. "I want to continue the  substance-abuse education provided in all classes," she said. "We need to  provide a positive environment to learn in and safe campuses for our students."  </P> <P> San Gabriel  </P> <P> In marked contrast to the hotly contested 1985 school board election, four  candidates are competing for three seats in a quiet San Gabriel School District  race.  </P> <P> The district, which has 3,223 students, serves most of San Gabriel and parts of  San Marino, Alhambra and Temple City.  </P> <P> Wilbur W. Langdale, 73, a retired firefighter,said he is interested in  attacking the drug problem facing teen-agers. "I'd like to see parents take  more interest in the schools, like my mother did," he said.  </P> <P> Dominic Shambra, 50, an administrator in the Los Angeles Unified School  District, is seeking his fifth four-year term. Anticipating a number of teacher  retirements next year, Shambra said he would like the board to keep salary  levels competitive in order to attract new teachers. Shambra said he is proud  that four years ago the board "brought peace to the district" by hiring a new  superintendent.  </P> <P> Incumbent Nancy H. Trask, who declined to give her age, is running for her  first full term. A retired social worker, she was appointed to the board last  year after the death of Linda Jorgensen. Trask said she would like to add more  music classes to the curriculum.  </P> <P> Catherine P. Healy, who identified herself as an instructional aide on her  candidate's form, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> San Marino Unified  </P> <P> Four candidates, including three incumbents, are running in the San Marino  Unified School District, which has 2,700 students in San Marino, Pasadena and  San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Nancy Bartlett is a fifth-grade teacher in the Pasadena Unified School  District. She is the mother of one son who has attended Huntington Junior High  and San Marino High Schools.  </P> <P> Debbie Bowes, 45, is running for her second term and boasts a 22-year career in  education. She is director of curriculum administration in the Fountain Valley  Unified School District, is a USC doctoral candidate and holds a master's  degree in education from Cal State Los Angeles. Her two children have attended  district schools.  </P> <P> David Destino, 45, an attorney, is running for his second term. His son  graduated from San Marino High School and his daughter attends Huntington  Junior High. Destino holds a bachelor's degree in finance from the University  of Connecticut and a law degree from Boston University.  </P> <P> Robert Reynolds, 53, is the chief financial officer of an insurance brokerage  firm. He holds a degree in accounting from Louisiana State University and a law  degree from South Texas College of Law in Houston.  </P> <P> South Pasadena  </P> <P> With three incumbents choosing not to run for the South Pasadena Board of  Education, voters will have an opportunity to select a majority of the  five-member body on Tuesday. The district has 3,500 students at five schools.  </P> <P> Of the eight candidates, only David L. Margrave -- who served four years on the  South Pasadena City Council -- has run for public office before. Last fall,  teachers went on strike, and in June voters narrowly defeated a school-tax  measure.  </P> <P> The candidates are:  </P> <P> Lynda Bybee-Dane, 41, regional director for business development of a national  construction company. "I have both a creative background and a strong business  background. My aim is to bring business sense to the table. In the past I've  been a documentary film maker and playwright. So I also understand the creative  nature of education."  </P> <P> Alice Hwang, 39, who lists her occupation as parent and educational advocate.  "The most important issue is the lack of harmony in our school district -- the  polarization among the teachers, the parents and the administration."  </P> <P> Yvonne Rose, 41, paralegal. "Our district is suffering from complacency. We  don't want to face the cold, hard facts that some students are slipping in  performance on standardized tests. We have to find other ways of financing our  district, and I've identified some of those ways."  </P> <P> David Margrave, 41, air-conditioning and plumbing contractor, and twice mayor  pro tem while on the council from 1983 through 1986. "The school board could  use a business person's approach. I could add that. We have quality teachers.  We just don't have enough. The facilities are a mess. They've been left to  crumble for 20 years."  </P> <P> Patricia Martinez-Miller, 45, elementary school principal, Magnolia Elementary  School in Los Angeles. "I'm concerned about the financial stress the district  is under, but I do not believe that is the district's only problem." A key  problem, she said, is the perception of a lack trust among all sectors of the  school system.  </P> <P> Fred Mickaelian Jr., 56, public relations consultant. "There needs to be more  effective financial planning," adding that a lack of funding has contributed to  a decline in the educational programs.  </P> <P> Seth S. Sandberg, 49, principal at Sierra Vista Elementary School in El Sereno.  "There needs to be a board member with a little more knowledge, a little more  commitment and a little more experience. I have that."  </P> <P> Judith Vida Spence, 46, psychiatrist. "We have a chronic situation of financial  distress and we have to find some way of dealing with it. Teacher morale is  very, very low right now. The absence of a constructive, participatory working  environment is a key issue."  </P> <P> Temple City Unified  </P> <P> A four-way race in the Temple City Unified School District is highlighted by  struggles over a teachers' contract and the aftermath of a recently failed  attempt to recall two school board members. The district, which has 4,326  students, serves Temple City and parts of Arcadia and San Gabriel.  </P> <P> Ted McNevin, 43, principal of Goddard Middle School in Glendora, helped lead  the recall campaign against board members John Gera and Lewis Moulton. McNevin  said he believes the board's unwillingness to negotiate fairly has created a  rift with employees. "One of my goals would be to heal that division," he said.  </P> <P> Linda L. Miller, 42, elected two years ago to complete the unexpired term of  the late Nancy Cash, said she wants to improve the board's relationship with  employees and hopes the district will use some of its reserve money to update  computers for students and install air conditioners in some schools.  </P> <P> Shirley Norman, who is seeking her sixth term and declined to give her age,  said she stands by her record. On contract negotiations, she said, "I want the  district to pay (teachers) as well as they can afford to pay and stay  financially solvent."  </P> <P> Michael Palmer, 41, chairman of the math department at Muscatel Junior High  School in Rosemead, said he did not support the recall campaign, which he said  would have been too expensive, but would like to "see periodic meetings between  the employee groups and the school board."  </P> <P> Valle Lindo  </P> <P> Three incumbents and one challenger are running for three seats on the Valle  Lindo school board, which serves 1,120 students in portions of South El Monte.  The candidates are:  </P> <P> David R. Del Rio Sr, 51, an electronics technician, seeking his third term. "We  want to maintain our schools at the same level of excellence and to keep  parents informed," said Del Rio, who has lived in South El Monte for 25 years.  </P> <P> Joe Jauregui, 49, an accountant, also running for a third term. "For the last  two terms I've emphasized discipline. We are trying to make this a better place  for children to learn. I stress the three R's," Jauregui said.  </P> <P> Rose Marie Arrieta. The third incumbent running, she is a library services  volunteer and homemaker.  </P> <P> Marlene A. Strohl, an analyst and the sole challenger.  </P> <P> Arrieta and Strohl could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Walnut Valley Unified  </P> <P> There are 12,000 students in the Walnut Valley Unified School District,  attending nine elementary, three middle, one continuation and two high schools.  There are five candidates vying for three four-year terms on the board.  </P> <P> Mari L. Collins, 54, law office administrator, lives in Walnut and has one  child in a Walnut school. She received a bachelor's degree in personnel  administration from the University of Washington; has served on the Suzanne  School Site Council, and was director of personnel at Parkview Hospital in  Riverside.  </P> <P> Kathleen (Kitty) Fritz, 40, is a travel agent and resident of Diamond Bar.

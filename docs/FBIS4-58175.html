			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage indistinct] Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad denied  that interviews conducted by Qatari television on an Iraqi  street and with Iraqi officials have caused a rift in relations  between the State of Kuwait and Qatar.    He said: "We do not consider this subject a rift. There is  understanding within the GCC and the GCC members are the closest  of people to each other."    On a question related to the religious phenomenon in Kuwait,  Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that it was an internal Kuwaiti  phenomenon unconnected with the phenomenon of international  religious terrorism or any external body.    He said: "We accept this phenomenon since we consider it to  be an internal Kuwaiti phenomenon which does not believe in what  others do."    On a question related to the State of Kuwait's stance on the  Palestinian cause, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad said that a  differentiation must be made between the Palestinian cause and  the Palestinian leadership, which has wronged Kuwait. He said  that throughout its history the State of Kuwait has been one of  the most supportive of the Palestinian cause and will continue  to support the Palestinian people, but not through the current  leadership.    He recalled that the State of Kuwait has granted $25 million  through international bodies to set up schools and hospitals in  Gaza and Jericho. He explained that only small groups of  Palestinians have been deported from Kuwait, and that those who  left Kuwait have done so at their own will.    In answer to a question related to Kuwait's stance on the  Arab boycott of Israel, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad stressed that  Kuwait abides by the Arab League resolutions related to the  first degree boycott of Israel. He said that after its  liberation from Iraq, Kuwait had been obliged to lift the second  and third degree boycott because of its pressing need for  companies which possess technology and expertise in those areas  destroyed by the Iraqi forces during their occupation of Kuwait.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special ITAR-TASS correspondents Vasiliy Belousov </F> and Dmitriy Gorokhov]    [Text] Murmansk, 26 Mar -- We do not rule out Russia  joining NATO in future, nor that this organization could undergo  some transformation. But at the present time it is not a matter  of bloc membership, but of cooperation. Herein lies the meaning  of us joining the Partnership for Peace program, which will take  place in the near future. This was stated by Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev when explaining Russia's approach to  interrelations with the North Atlantic Union during a brief  conversation with Russian and Norwegian journalists.    The minister also noted the contacts and ties between Russia  and NATO, which are already developing ; the joint Pomor-94  naval exercises that ended recently were an example of this.</p>

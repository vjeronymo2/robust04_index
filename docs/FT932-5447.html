			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbean banana producers attack Gatt challenge CARIBBEAN banana producers have attacked a plan by five Latin American exporters to have a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade examine the European Community's new import regime, which becomes effective on July 1. The attack is part of the Caribbean producers' continuing war over access to the European market. At a meeting in Kingston, Jamaica over the weekend, trade and foreign ministers from the Caribbean and Latin America discussed their divergent positions on the marketing of the fruit. 'The discussions were frank,' said Mr Charles Maynard, Dominica's foreign minister. 'We explained our position, and they explained theirs.' Latin American delegates to the conference said they were 'encouraged' by last week's ruling by a Gatt panel that the EC's current banana import regime unfairly limits Latin American exports. 'This is a clear indication that new rules must be based on free trade,' one Latin American official said. 'The proposed EC regime will also be contested and I have no doubt that the tendency towards free trade will prevail.' Caribbean and other producers from the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries are seeking protection for their market share in Europe and fear competition from cheaper Latin American fruit. The EC's agriculture ministers have proposed that from July there will be a quota of 2m tonnes a year for Latin American fruit, and that the quota will attract duty of Ecu100 (Pounds 78.8) a tonne. Imports of Latin American fruit above that level will attract a duty of Ecu850 a tonne. Caribbean and other traditional suppliers such as those in Africa will have access for the remainder of the Community's needs - which traders say amount to about 1.5m tonnes a year - and will pay no tariff. However, Caribbean delegates to the conference feared that the conclusion of last week's Gatt panel could influence Gatt council discussions on the banana trade, which are to take place in a fortnight and also in the middle of next month. This, and the attempt by the Latin American producers to have a second panel discuss the new regime, is regarded by the ACP group as a threat to the arrangement and to their market. 'All of this is quite prejudicial to our economies,' Mr Maynard said. A statement by the Caribbean Community Secretariat said the region considered the Latin producers' attempt to have a second panel rule on the new regime 'as being particularly unjustified. 'The Caribbean banana producers have 3 per cent of the world banana market and constitute absolutely no threat, neither to the Central American states, which supply some 38 per cent, nor to the other Latin American banana producing states which supply some 57 per cent,' the statement said. Latin American delegates said they 'understood and sympathised with' the concerns of the ACP producers, but stressed that they too had fragile economies to protect and new markets to develop. 'We should not have to pay a price for being efficient producers,' one said. 'The rules of world trade must be respected by all, including the European Community.' Such is the polarisation of positions on access to the EC that ministers spent the first morning of the Kingston conference arguing over the place of bananas on the agenda. Latin American ministers did not want the matter raised while their Caribbean counterparts threatened to abort the conference if it was not discussed. The conference communique was terse in describing the nature of the debate. 'The ministers thoroughly and frankly discussed the problem of bananas,' it said.</p>

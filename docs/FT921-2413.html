			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Survey of Software at Work (51):  Technology Briefing - Back to the bells and whistles: The instant visual appeal of multimedia technology and the promise it holds for new applications often detract from the real issues of its application. This is particularly noticeable in the lack of genuine business uses of multimedia - although this looks set to change.  Developments in multimedia technology. both to suppliers and to users. It has an instant visual appeal. It can be demonstrated easily to impress potential users. And it promises to open the door to exciting new applications. Multimedia technology combines animated, high-resolution graphics and video, hi-fi sound, computer data, communications and - most important of all - interaction between the system and its user. Simply put, multimedia brings back the flashing lights and 'bells and whistles' which made the first computers so exciting. But in the same way that the flashing lights blinded users to the problems of getting computers to work, multimedia technology can be a distraction if it is not applied properly. As far as business applications are concerned, multimedia is still a technology looking for a problem to solve. So far, the main application of multimedia technology has been in traditional applications such as training and 'point-of-sale' information. But there are clear signs that this will change in the next two years. Hardware and software suppliers now have well-advanced products, costs are falling and the standards' infrastructure, which is needed to make multimedia a success, is beginning to emerge. At the same time, genuine commercial applications in areas such as executive information systems (EIS) and business simulation, have started to appear. In common with most marketing terms, multimedia has, unfortunately, come to mean whatever suppliers want it to mean. As a result, the term is applied to everything from a 'charting' module in a spreadsheet program to a full-blown digital audio/video presentation system. But a consensus appears to have settled on a definition of multimedia which includes audio, video, graphics, data and text, held in a digital form under the control of a computer. The 'digital' element is important. It distinguishes multimedia computing from earlier technologies such as interactive video - where an analogue video machine is controlled by a digital computer. The conversion of traditional media into a common digital format is what gives multimedia its wide appeal. It means that any type of data can be stored, transmitted and manipulated with software. It also means that the data can be mixed together easily - so, for example, a graph showing increased sales can be accompanied by a video picture of the salesperson. Or, an estate agent's description of a house can be accompanied by a video 'tour' and so on. The complete media 'package' can, in digital code, be transmitted over a network, stored on a floppy disk or even transferred to standard video format. Mr Morel Fourman, managing director of UK multimedia specialist Samore,describes multimedia as 'the ultimate cognitive tool' and sees it as the most effective way to present complex information - 'people's cognitive response to information goes up each time you add an extra medium. Multimedia offers the possibility of the maximum cognitive bandwidth,' he explains. 'We are standing on a growing pyramid of information but we have no way to interpret it. Multimedia gives us the point of the pyramid.' He defines the formal function of multimedia as a way to make information 'timely, relevant, understandable and accessible.' Apple Computer, one of the leading players in the multimedia market, has a more pragmatic view: 'Multimedia is about making technology available to the masses. It brings ease of use to interactive television,' says Ms Ferhan Cook, multimedia marketing manager at Apple Europe. She emphasises that the key to multimedia's success is good software: 'Apple has recognised that we must offer more software because multimedia is software-driven - with everything going digital, this is inevitable.' Apple was one of the first manufacturers to see the potential of multimedia technology and has promoted its Macintosh as an 'engine' for multimedia applications since the launch of its Hypercard software in 1988. Hypercard was one of the first software packages to combine different presentation media into a single program. Apple hopes, with its multimedia products, to repeat the success it had with desktop publishing systems in the mid-1980s. But Apple is not alone in the market and there is a fierce battle raging between suppliers over which technology and formats will dominate multimedia. There are parallels with earlier technologies such as camera film formats, audio recording technology and video. All of these technologies appeared in many different and incompatible forms until a dominant 'standard' emerged. Multimedia is no exception. Computer manufacturers, software developers and consumer electronics companies are currently jockeying for position and backing one or other of the potential standards for multimedia. In the last year, leading computer hardware manufacturers, in particular, have moved aggressively into the market. Early in 1991 Apple started to push the multimedia features of the latest version of it s Macintosh operating system software - System 7. IBM announced a multimedia version of its PS/2 personal computer - together with a batch of multimedia software - in October 1991. At the same time, DEC launched a multimedia hardware and software based on the Unix operating system. In addition to their individual promotions, Apple and IBM announced in October that they were working together on a project to build multimedia products through a joint venture company called Kaleida. Other leading manufacturers involved in multimedia development include NCR and Hewlett-Packard in the US, NEC and Sony in Japan and Philips and Bull in Europe. Software companies are not far behind. Database software suppliers like Oracle and Informix are strongly promoting multimedia 'enhancements' to their data base management products. Oracle launched Oracle Card, a competitor to Apple's Hypercard only on the IBM-compatible PC, last summer. The most important software player is, however, Microsoft, the developer of MS/DOS operating system and the Windows 3 graphical environment. It has been involved in developing multimedia technology on PCs since the mid-1980s. It was a pioneer of CD-ROM, a high-capacity storage technology for personal computers similar to that used for audio compact disks. Last November Microsoft recruited backers for its Multimedia PC (MPC) standard and attracted several important players including Olivetti, Tandy, Philips, Zenith (Bull), NEC and Fujitsu. The MPC 'standard' lays down a minimum hardware configuration for the personal computer, which includes a CD-ROM drive, and runs the multimedia extensions to the Windows 3 software. The MPC 'standard' has still to prove itself. But given the overwhelming success of Windows 3, it seems likely that MPC will emerge as a primary platform for the development multimedia applications - despite the rival standards promoted by IBM on its PS/2 and Apple on the Macintosh. The extended Windows 3 software provides the ideal base for mass-market multimedia applications and the first ones are already on the market (see box,page 31). 'Microsoft has a big lead and will certainly have a huge influence on multimedia,' says Mr Rob Wirszycz, marketing director of the UK-based multimedia specialist, Callhaven. 'But Apple is also very strong and has a good product range for the Macintosh,' he adds. Apple's answer to Windows 3 is an applications-build ing language for the Macintosh called Quicktime. Like the Windows 3 extensions, Quicktime provides the mechanisms to handle different media and to build them into applications. Mr Wirszycz says that software like Quicktime and Windows 3 makes it easier to build useful multimedia applications and there are development tools emerging to take advantage of the facilities they offer - 'we are looking at Macintosh software like Macromind Director and Authorware Professional as a way to build applications. Multimedia is moving away from its technical background and becoming more generally usable.' He notes that the last year has seen a notable shift in attitude to multimedia and, partly as a result of the new tools that are available, an increased demand for multimedia applications. 'Until recently, we have concentrated on prototype and pilot projects. But now customers are actually throwing some serious money at multimedia - they actually have budgets for it now,' he says. Computer manufacturers and software suppliers will be keen to get their hands on a large slice of these budgets. But they will not be the only ones. Multimedia stretches well beyond the traditional markets of the computer industry and offers opportunities to companies which have grown to prominence in the consumer electronics field. Philips and Sony, for example, are very active in developing multimedia hardware technology. Japanese manufacturers like Yamaha and Roland dominate the digital audio market. These companies, too, will want a slice of what promises to be a highly-competitive market in the 1990s. It is also a market where flashing lights and 'bells and whistles' are likely to be a key selling-point.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Six men have been charged in Wuhan, capital of  Hubei Province, with the beating last month of a lawyer  representing Taiwan investors in the city. The severe drubbing  of Zhang Tao, which left him with a broken nose and leg, set off  alarm bells in Beijing after it was revealed in the Taiwan media  in mid-January.    Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation called for a full  investigation, fearing it could mark a new trend of violence  against Taiwanese bosses on the mainland.    Chinese officials connected with the case said Zhang's  aggressive work on behalf of his Taiwanese clients appeared  unrelated to the incident. "This was a civil dispute which had  nothing to do with Zhang's supposed work for Taiwan," said Wang  Guoyao, head of Hubei's Taiwan Affairs Offce, from Wuhan. "It  was stirred up into a lot of nonsense in Taiwan."    On January 7, six men, armed with knives and sticks, forced  their way into the Taiwan-owned Hansheng Computer Company, where  Zhang worked as personnel manager. A scuffle ensued, which left  Zhang and two company security guards in hospital.    The police did not begin investigating the case until the  Wuhan Taiwan Business Association issued a statement that  asserted: "There is no way the beating is related solely to  Zhang's private affairs."    On orders from Beijing, Hubei's Governor, Jia Zhijie,  demanded the police catch the six in order to prevent the case  becoming a serious cross strait issue, sources said. The  suspects were detained shortly before the lunar new year and had  been charged, although none had been sentenced yet, Wang said.    Questioning of the men revealed they had beaten Zhang  because  he had agreed to pay only 280 renminbi (HK$246) to cover the  hospital expenses of an old woman who herself had been beaten by  a female driver of the firm, Wang said. The old woman, a nearby  resident, had complained about the noise the driver made with  the car horn every time she drove in and out of the factory gate.    "The actual hospital expenses were probably many times [the  amount offered by Zhang]," Wang said. The old woman's godson  had organised the men to "avenge the remaining expenses" from  the stingy Zhang, he said. "The driver shouldn't have beaten  the old woman and the godson and his friends shouldn't have  beaten Zhang."    The head of the Wuhan Taiwan Business Association, Chen  Fengrong, admitted the beating of Zhang did not concern his work  for association members. "We thought this was the case at  first, but since the arrests it has become clear this was an  internal company matter," he said from Wuhan. "Since the lunar  new year break I've been to visit Wang and we've basically  agreed to put this matter behind us."</p>

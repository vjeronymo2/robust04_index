			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Belgian economy shrinks Belgium's 1993 gross domestic product shrank by an estimated 1.3 per cent, the Belgian central bank said, Reuter reports from Brussels. In 1992 the Belgian economy grew 1.4 per cent. The central bank's new 1993 estimate is slightly better than the 1.5 per cent contraction it forecast in October. This was due mainly to hopes for a stabilisation of fourth-quarter growth.</p>

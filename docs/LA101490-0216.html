			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 49TH ASSEMBLY RACE  </P> <P> Democratic Assemblywoman Gwen Moore of Los Angeles is running for a seventh  term in the overwhelmingly Democratic district that stretches from Marina del  Rey to the Crenshaw area.  </P> <P> Moore is in a rematch this fall with Republican Eric Givens, against whom she  ran up more than three-quarters of the vote in 1988.  </P> <P> Her legislative accomplishments this year include the enactment of a measure to  curb loan scams that have cost some Los Angeles area residents their homes. The  law is intended to restrict large balloon payments on short-term loans by  mortgage brokers.  </P> <P> Moore also sponsored legislation that bans trucks used to carry garbage and  other wastes from hauling food products that are not adequately protected, as  well as a law to make the labels on non-prescription medicines more readable.  </P> <P> Moore is one of a handful of lawmakers under scrutiny in connection with a  federal investigation of corruption in the Legislature.  </P> <P> She unwittingly carried two bills for dummy companies set up by FBI agents  seeking legislative help in opening a shrimp processing plant near Sacramento.  </P> <P> Federal investigators last spring intensified their inquiry into Moore's  office. They subpoenaed campaign contribution records and files on six bills  she authored between 1985 and 1988, including four that would have changed  regulations dealing with alcoholic beverages.  </P> <P> Investigators also have been examining Tyrone Netters, a former aide to Moore.  Both the assemblywoman and Netters accepted contributions from undercover  agents posing as businessmen.  </P> <P> Moore, who testified at the federal corruption trial of state Sen. Joseph B.  Montoya (D-Whittier) in January, has said she did nothing wrong.  </P> <P> Asked whether she thought the investigation will hurt her reelection chances,  she said, "Absolutely not, because people are familiar with my record and know  me and know that I haven't done anything wrong."  </P> <P> Challenger Givens, 33, acknowledges his uphill battle, given Moore's solid base  of support, and says he is running in part to develop a constituency for future  campaigns.  </P> <P> A home builder who lives in the Crenshaw area, Givens has built his campaign  around issues relating to the problems facing minority youth.  </P> <P> Lawmakers, he says, must do more to address the high dropout rate and high  unemployment rate among minority youth, without simply throwing more government  funds at the problem. He says the problems can be solved through greater  involvement by lawmakers and parents in community programs and by creating more  job opportunities for young people.  </P> <P> Moore's campaign contributions have come from utilities, oil companies, labor  unions, trial lawyers, bankers, cable television companies, doctors, hospitals,  nurses, realtors and teachers.  </P> <P> Peace and Freedom candidate Alice Mae Miles and Libertarian Carin Rogers will  also be on the ballot.  </P> <P> Staff writers Josh Meyer and Ron Russell and Times librarian Joyce Sherwood  assisted with this report.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 49RD ASSEMBLY DISTRICT  </P> <P> The district: Marina del Rey, Playa del Rey, Westchester, Culver City, Ladera  Heights, Baldwin Hills, and the Crenshaw area.  </P> <P> Candidate: Gwen Moore (inc.)  </P> <P> Party: Democrat  </P> <P> Candidate: Eric Givens  </P> <P> Party: Republican  </P> <P> Candidate: Carin Rogers  </P> <P> Party: Libertarian  </P> <P> Candidate: Alice Mae Miles  </P> <P> Party: Peace and Freedom  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.10IN:2.22IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Voter Registration  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Registered  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Democrats  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 109,895  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 72.7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Republicans  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 27,500  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 18.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Independents  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 10,889  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Minor Parties*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2,814  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 1.9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 151,098  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * American Independent, Peace and Freedom, Libertarian and miscellaneous  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:1.89IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1988 Results  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Votes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Percent  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 83,307  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 76.7%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Eric Givens (R)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25,322  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 23.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

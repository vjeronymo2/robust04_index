			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / The 'Bibi' factor in Mideast talks: When the crunch comes, Israel may be under new leader THE PRESENT urgency to resume Middle East peace talks should not disguise the fact that the critical long-term decisions on the fate of the Palestinians will not be negotiated for at least another three years. By that time Israel could be under new leadership. According to the terms of the peace process, launched in Madrid nearly 18 months ago, the current phase of talks - scheduled for Washington on April 20 - aims to produce interim self-government arrangements in the occupied Arab territories which will last five years. Only at the start of the third year of that agreement will talks begin on the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. So just as Mr Yitzhak Shamir was replaced as prime minister of Israel last June by Mr Yitzhak Rabin, when Labour defeated Likud in the election, there is a strong possibility that a new leader may be in charge when the final status talks get under way. The election of Mr Binjamin Netanyahu last week as leader of the opposition Likud party therefore takes on even greater significance. A former diplomat and deputy foreign minister, Mr Netanyahu must be the best-known unknown in Israeli politics. His skilled television delivery brought him repeatedly into tens of millions of homes, particularly in the US, as Israel's principal spokesman during the Gulf war. He was also the main government spokesman during the run-up to and initial stages of the peace process. The difference now for Mr Netanyahu, known throughout Israel simply as 'Bibi', is that as leader of the right-wing Likud he will have to shape and articulate policies that are his own. His opponents, within and outside Likud, argue that this will prove to be his greatest weakness. Born a year after Israel achieved statehood and some 25 years after Mr Rabin, Mr Netanyahu represents a substantial generational change in Israel and confirmation of a more individual approach to politics. His style is American, where he spent much of his earlier life, his appeal overtly personal, and his willingness to address policy details so far minimal. Those who know him best say that he represents mainstream Likud thinking, but that he would adopt a rather more hawkish approach to peace negotiations and prove tougher on combating insurrection by the Palestinians in the occupied territories. He is said to be committed to the retention of the West Bank as part of the biblical land of Israel, but might prove less rigid on the future of Gaza and the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 war. The campaign for the Likud leadership provided few additional clues. Mr Netanyahu, three times married, comfortably rode out the storm he had created by accusing an unnamed senior member of the party of attempting to blackmail him over his admitted extra-marital activities. In the one televised debate between the four candidates, Mr Netanyahu ignored his contenders, addressed his remarks to the camera and concentrated on the simple assertion that he was the only man who could return Likud to office. On the campaign trail he followed the example of US President Bill Clinton, travelling throughout the country by bus, and again relying on his personal rapport with Likud voters to bring him an easy victory, winning more than 52 per cent of the votes cast, 12 percentage points more than needed to avoid a second round. No great changes in style are expected in the months ahead. Mr Netanyahu is again likely to follow the Clinton example of going directly to the voters, bypassing the senior figures in the party who opposed him, and demonstrating the breadth of his popular support. Mr Rabin's failures so far to deliver either the peace or security that he promised during the general election will be the key targets for attack, and Mr Netanyahu will certainly be hoping to bring down the government before it has served out the remaining three years of its mandate. He will also be bolstered by the knowledge that at the next election the prime minister will for the first time be directly elected, a factor he expects to be greatly to his advantage. It is no surprise that Mr Rabin and the US administration are urging the Palestinians to press ahead swiftly with peace negotiations, both because they are likely to secure a better deal with the present government and to assist Labour build the platform it needs to offset Mr Netanyahu's appeal at the next general election.</p>

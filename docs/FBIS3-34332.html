			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We begin our news today with the latest incoming  reports on the Serbs' unprecedented attack on the people in  Sarajevo. Reports indicate that the casualty toll of the  besieged and war-stricken people of Sarajevo from this attack  has increased to more than 250. Our colleague in Europe has  sent us more information on this attack:    [Begin recordeding] [Unidentified correspondent in Bonn]  Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Siladzic has said that 66 were  killed and 197 wounded in this attack, which is the worst attack  on civilians since the onset of the war in Sarajevo. After the  attack, in which a 120-mm mortar was used, Sarajevo's central  market was the scene of bodies and of severed limbs. Many of  the wounded died in the halls of Sarajevo hospitals due to the  lack of medical facilities and medicine.    This attack has sparked off an extensive wave of disgust and  rage among the Sarajevo residents at the indifference that is  being shown by the United Nations and the West regarding the  Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina. While condemning the  policy of the United Nations and the West, the officials of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have called for military steps to end the  attacks on civilians or the lifting of the arms embargo on the  Muslims.    Public mourning has been declared in Bosnia-Herzegovina to  commemorate the martyrs of Black Saturday. Bosnian Prime  Minister Haris Siladzic said to correspondents: Why is the  United Nations supporting the aggressors and imposing sanctions  on the victims? Are the 200,000 people whom we have lost so far  not enough for the international community to take serious  steps? Bosnian President Alia Izetbegovic also stated that any  government that supports the arms embargo on the Muslims is a  partner in these crimes.    Meanwhile, in continuation of their past policies, Western  and UN officials have limited themselves to a verbal  condemnation of the attack and have called for investigations to  identify those who are responsible for the attack. After the  Saturday tragedy, the governments of France and Britain have  once again stressed the need to continue the talks. British  Defense Secretary Rifkind said: I do not think that an air raid  on Serb positions will solve the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem.  German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has stated: If the  international community does not react seriously to this attack,  we will lose all our credibility. [end recording]</p>

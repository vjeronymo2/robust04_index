			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Halstead jumps 15.6% to Pounds 4m JAMES HALSTEAD, the Manchester-based floor-coverings, weatherproof clothing and trailers group, yesterday reported a 15.6 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits reflecting the closure of the loss-making Belstaff garment manufacturing operations which depressed profits in the like period a year ago. Pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of December increased from Pounds 3.44m to Pounds 3.97m on turnover down to Pounds 27.5m (Pounds 28.9m) due to discontinued activities. Earnings per share rose 15 per cent to 8.94p (7.78p). The interim dividend is raised 11 per cent to 2.5p (2.25p adjusted for the 1-for-1 scrip issue in December). Commenting upon the results Mr Vincent Clare, chairman, noted that although turnover declined and trading conditions remained 'very difficult', James Halstead, Phoenix Distribution and Driza-Bone all generated increased sales for the period. Halstead, the core floor-coverings business, maintained profits despite stiff competition while both Driza-Bone, the Australian weatherproof clothing business, and Phoenix, the motorcycle accessories distributor, generated increased profits. Due to seasonal factors, both the Conway trailer tent business and the associated Kingway business in France incurred a first-half loss as usual, although the deficit was somewhat higher than usual because of recession. The group added that the Belstaff closure had been completed and the costs were within the provisions made in last year's accounts. For the first time the company has produced balance sheet figures at the interim stage. These showed new borrowings of Pounds 5.17m at the end of December, incurred in Australia as part of a hedging strategy. Net cash amounted to Pounds 3.78m (Pounds 6.9m).</p>

			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Survey of Drax - The Big Clean-up (9): State-of-the-art technology - German experience with FGDs In the early 1980s, reports of forests dying from acid rain pollution were horrifying the German public. Power stations were soon identified as a leading culprit and the West German government reacted swiftly by passing the Large Combustion Plant Ordinance (LCPO) in July 1983. A massive FGD programme began. No other country in the world has carried out a power station desulphurisation programme remotely comparable with that in West Germany during the years 1983 to 1988. The Ordinance laid down strict sulphur dioxide emissions limits for existing and new plant and all large West German power stations using fossil fuels were retrofitted with desulphurisation plant over this five-year period. Today, SO emissions from power stations have been reduced to just 10 per cent of the volume emitted in 1982. In 1991, specific SO output from coal and oil power stations in Germany was by far the lowest in Europe at 0.92 gm per kWh. Thus Germany already easily fulfils the European Community directive passed in 1988 on large combustion plant. This requires a reduction in SO emissions in Germany of 40 per cent by 1993, 60 per cent by 1988; and 70 per cent by 2003, compared with 1980 levels. The EC directive required that only new power stations were fitted with desulphurisation plant. Retrofitting of old plant was not obligatory and has only been carried out in Germany. The German Utilities Association in Frankfurt, VDEW, says DM15bn was spent on the big desulphurisation campaign - while a further DM7bn was invested in de-NOX plant - over the period 1983 to 1988 in Germany. The annual expenditure on FGD operation, including serving capital costs, amounts to some DM3.5bn. This adds 1.5 to 2.0 pfennig per kWh to the cost of electricity generation. For comparison, in mid-1993, industrial customers were paying an average 19.74 pfennigs per kWh for their electricity, not including the average 7.5 per cent German coal support levy. German unification has resulted in a new wave of FGD retrofitting in eastern Germany, to large power stations which burn brown coal. A total of eight 500MW units at Boxberg and Jaenschwalde will have desulphurisation plant installed. The other 8,000MW of brown coal-fired capacity will have to be closed down by the end of June 1996 - the LCPO deadline applied to eastern Germany. How necessary this new desulphurisation campaign had become is illustrated by the fact that in 1990 East German SO emissions were 1.84m tonnes; 10 times higher than those in West Germany although electricity production in the east was just one tenth of that in the west. In practice, German coal power station operators use almost exclusively the so-called limestone wash process because a ready market can be found for gypsum, a byproduct. The utilities and the building industry began talks promptly when it became clear what volume of gypsum would be produced and effective disposal arrangements have evolved. In some cases, the building materials industry has set up shop close to the power stations. For example, Rigips built a new plasterboard factory at Gelsenkirchen-Buer within an easy pumping distance of three Veba Kraftwerk Ruhr (VKR) power stations. These now supply 250,000 tonnes a year of gypsum in water suspension through pipes to the Rigips factory, accounting for half of VKR total gypsum production from its power station capacity. In other cases, the fact that power stations operate at highest load in winter but the building industry is in full swing in summer means the gypsum must be stored before being transported during the warmer months to different parts of Germany. Fortunately, the German gypsum market has a volume of about 4m tonnes while 'hard coal' power stations produce 2.5m-2.8m tonnes a year. The sale price achieved for the FGD gypsum generally covers only the cost of storage and transport, making no contribution to the costs of operating the FGD plant. The story for gypsum produced from brown coal power station FGD plant is rather different. Partly due to the much higher sulphur level in brown coal, the gypsum byproduct is yellow in colour and not of optimum quality. As a result, brown coal power station operator RWE Energie has trouble marketing the gypsum. But because the huge holes left by open-cast brown coal mining have to be filled, disposal of the brown coal FGD-produced gypsum has not proved too much of a problem. When the German desulphurisation programme began, there was some criticism that although the benefits to the environment were clearly very great, the huge investment involved would prolong the life of generally inefficient power stations. In particular, brown coal power stations in western Germany have an efficiency of just 34-38 per cent, so that more than 60 per cent of the fuel input is lost as heat through the cooling towers. The FGD plant itself also reduces both hard and brown coal power station efficiency by about 1 per cent through the power consumption necessary for its operation. Regardless of such criticism, FGD has now become state-of-the-art power station technology in Germany. In fact, last year, leading utility Preussenelektra decided not to use the new coal gasification technology for a 400MW hard coal power station to be built at Luebeck, which would have done away with the need for an FGD plant. It decided to use conventional technology with FGD instead, concluding that efficiency and emissions would be comparable. A 900MW hard coal power station planned for Stendal at the beginning of the next century by east German utility Veag is also on the drawing board as a further-improved conventional hard coal-fired plant with FGD. In eastern Germany, several new 800MW brown coal units with FGD are under construction or planned. The author is a regular contributor to the Financial Times Newsletter Power in Europe.</p>

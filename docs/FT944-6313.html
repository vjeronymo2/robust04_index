			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Leading Article: The Norse spirit prevails In the end, the Norse spirit prevailed. Norway's rejection of the European Union on Monday reflected the country's sense of self-reliance and many Norwegians' fears of the disadvantages stemming from membership of the Brussels club. The result was virtually identical to that of the 1972 referendum on European Community membership, but the longer-term impact on Norway will be much greater than 22 years ago. As Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the prime minister, warned last week, Norway now risks a reduction in political and economic links with its neighbours. The EU will be extended next year through the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden, but without the northern-most member of a group of countries that can no longer be termed the Nordic 'bloc'. Norway's population is equivalant to 1.2 per cent of that of the 15-member Union and its GDP to 1.5 per cent. The rebuff is not the setback for European integration that would have been caused by a No in Sweden a fortnight ago, but it is regrettable above all in the security field. Although Norway remains a member of Nato, rejection of EU membership by a country that shares a frontier with Russia leaves a gap in the EU's embryonic strategy of building a common defence policy within the Western European Union. As far as Norway itself is concerned, the economy is robust enough to withstand any short-term repercussions. It continues to benefit from access to the single market brought by the European Economic Area. However, voters wishing to rescue Norwegian sovereignty may ultimately be disappointed. Alone among Nordic countries, Norway will have no part in decision-making over single market rules. Additionally, the EEA's importance will be diminished as its main members join the EU next year. By increasing longer-term uncertainty about Norway's economic links, the vote may deter foreign manufacturing investment needed to shift the economy away from dependence on hydrocarbons and fishing. Norwegian No campaigners have drawn parallels with Switzerland, which in a still stronger rejection of European integration turned down the EEA and by extension the EU in 1992. However, Norway's more fragile economic base ill disposes it to become the Switzerland of the north. In any case, many Swiss are having second thoughts about the 1992 decision. The EU must keep the door ajar for both Norway and Switzerland to reapply later in the decade. Meanwhile EU leaders need to heed an important message from all three Nordic referendums this autumn: in no country has there been an enthusiastic endorsement of the EU. Addressing perceived shortcomings in the Union's decision-making structures and its economic performance is now more crucial than ever. The EU can prosper only if it wins the loyalty of the citizens of Europe. At present, that condition is a long way from being achieved.</p>

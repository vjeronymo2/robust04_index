			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In view of the foregoing, and based on the recommendations of the staff, the Commission announces that the interim EDGAR rules adopted in February 1993, as amended, are hereby made final and applicable to all domestic registrants and third parties filing with respect to those registrants. Division of Corporation Finance and Investment Management filers will be phased in in accordance with the phase-in schedule attached as Appendix A. An updated comprehensive phase-in list of Corporation Finance registrants also is provided as Appendix B, <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  and a revised phase-in list for filers whose documents are processed by the Division of Investment Management is included as Appendix C. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  Phase-in will recommence with Groups CF&hyph;05 and IM&hyph;03, whose filings made on or after January 30, 1995 will be required to be made electronically, as governed by Regulation S&hyph;T. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  Subsequent phase-in groups will become subject to mandated electronic filing, as provided in the revised phase-in schedules. <FOOTCITE>27</FOOTCITE>  As is true with all rules promulgated by the Commission, all persons making filings with the Commission, including those making third-party filings with respect to electronic registrants, are responsible for apprising themselves of their new obligations associated with filing on the EDGAR system. While the staff attempts to contact registrants in each phase-in group by furnishing a copy of the EDGAR Filer Manual and EDGARLink software prior to phase-in, filers will not be relieved of their electronic filing obligations in the absence of such notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A number of changes to the phase-in lists originally published with Release Nos. 33&hyph;6977 and IC&hyph;19284 have been made to reflect name changes, mergers, requests to participate in a different phase-in group and other changes. These changes have been published periodically in the SEC News Digest and in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> . The lists published today contain the phase-in dates for the significant test group as well as for all subsequent groups in order to inform third party filers of their obligation to file electronically once the subject company becomes an electronic filer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained in Release No. 35&hyph;25746, public utility holding companies are phased in for purposes of filing under the Public Utility Act at the time they are phased in for filings made pursuant to the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, which phase-in date is governed by the Corporation Finance phase-in list. All subsidiary companies are phased-in along with the holding company. Public utility filers that do not file Securities Act or Exchange Act filings and that are not part of a holding company system previously phased in will begin electronic filing when the last group of registrants is phased in.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Investment company filers not named in Appendix C must determine their phase-in date from paragraph (b) of Rule 902 of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.902(b)]. The rule provides that if a registrant is part of a complex that has been phased in, it will be phased in with the complex based on the investment adviser in the case of management investment companies, the depositor in the case of unit investment trusts, or the principal underwriter in the case of internally managed closed-end funds. Thus, a newly created fund that is part of a phased-in complex will be required to make its submissions electronically. Similarly, if a fund that is not phased in changes its investment adviser to one that advises funds in a phased-in complex, it will be required to begin filing electronically after the new advisory relationship becomes effective. However, in order to avoid interrupting the availability of information in electronic format for phased-in filers, after a fund is phased in, it will continue to file electronically even if it changes its investment adviser to one advising investment companies not yet phased in. Investment companies that are not named in Appendix C and that are not associated with a phased-in complex will be phased in in the last group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some funds have more than one adviser. A registrant is deemed to have the same adviser as another fund with the same adviser except in cases where the common adviser is only a sub-adviser of one of the registrants.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  paragraph (b)(3) of Rule 902 of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.902(b)(3)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, the assignment of an investment company based on investment adviser may be inappropriate. For example, the sponsor of a complex might form a ``private-label fund'' for the customers of a specific financial institution. This fund may use the financial institution as its investment adviser but have the same distributor and administrator as other funds in the complex. In that case, the registrant could request reassignment to the phase-in group that includes most of the investment companies using the same distributor or administrator.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  n. 27, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Concurrently with this release, the Commission is adopting a revised EDGAR Filer Manual in connection with an EDGAR system upgrade to Version 4.10 (expected to be available on January 17, 1995) and corresponding modifications to EDGARLink. Release No. 33&hyph;7123. The effective date for the updated Filer Manual also is January 30, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 27 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Corporation Finance registrants desiring to participate in a phase-in group other than the one established by the Commission should direct their requests under Rule 901(a)(2) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.901(a)(2)] to Sylvia J. Reis or Serena C. Swegle, Mail Stop 3&hyph;8, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549 ((202) 942&hyph;2940). Investment Management registrants should submit requests for a change in phase-in date under Rule 902(d) of Regulation S&hyph;T [17 CFR 232.902(d)] to Anthony A. Vertuno or Ruth Armfield Sanders, Mail Stop 10&hyph;6, at the same address ((202) 942&hyph;0591).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Amendments to EDGAR Rules <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff has gained substantial experience with the EDGAR system and its implementing regulations since the first mandated filings were made in April 1993, and determined that certain refinements to its electronic filing rules would be desirable. Proposed amendments were published for comment in July 1994. <FOOTCITE>28</FOOTCITE>  The Commission received seven comment letters with respect to the proposed changes. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  With few exceptions, to be addressed below in the context of specific rule changes, the proposed amendments were well received by the commenters. Consequently, the Commission has determined to adopt the amendments in nearly all cases as proposed; modifications to accommodate commenters' concerns will be identified below. Many of the amendments are minor changes affecting substantive filing requirements (several of which represent codifications of staff interpretations), or clarifying language in the current requirements in an effort to enhance filers' understanding of their electronic filing obligations. Others consist of matters involving Commission procedures and practices as well as technical corrections to the rules adopted previously. The specific amendments are addressed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 28 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Release No. 33&hyph;7074.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The comment letters are available for inspection and copying in the public reference room at the Commission's headquarters.

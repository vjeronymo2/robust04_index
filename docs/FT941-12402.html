			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Survey of the World's Young People (7): Consumers of the future - Emma Tucker reviews business involvement with youth projects There is nothing saintly about businesses who give generously to community-based charitable projects. Philanthropy barely comes into it. Companies are well aware that they function best when they exist within a healthy community of customers, clients, and employees. But consumer prosperity depends on factors such as education, employment and job skills, especially for young people who are the consumers of the coming decades. This is where many businesses see their role. As Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand Metropolitan, the food and drinks giant, puts it: being involved in the community 'isn't to do with do-gooding. Nor is it motivated by concern or shame that GrandMet is such a prosperous company. This is a natural involvement for any company to have'. GrandMet's case is clear: 'The long term continued success of our business depends on the existence of prosperous consumers to buy those products,' it says in a statement on corporate community activities. Arguments in favour of involvement in youth strategies are probably stronger now than ever before. Some 3bn people in the world live in countries that are going through radical restructuring - whether in China, India, eastern Europe or Latin America. 'In the long-term, business has got to appeal to the young people growing up in these and other countries in terms of them as future consumers, clients and employees,' says Mr Robert Davies, chief executive of the Prince of Wales Business Leaders' Forum, in London. Furthermore, the idea that government alone should worry about society's needs has gradually been eroded, paving the way for partnerships between government, businesses, local communities and non-profit making organisations. 'More companies are responding with more resources and creativity than ever before,' says Richard Schubert, president of the Points of Light Foundation, a non-profit organisation aimed at alleviating the most serious social problems in the US. The growth of the International Youth Foundation - which promotes effective youth programmes across the world that have already proven their ability to make an impact - reflects the huge interest that business has in promoting the well-being of young people. In the four years since it was established, its fundraising commitments have risen from Dollars 5.5m to Dollars 23.54m. Yes International, a London based foundation responding to requests from countries overseas for assistance in developing youth enterprise strategies, has - in the nine months since it was established - developed model pilots and support infrastructures in Africa, Asia, and the Carribean, reflecting the fact that business-interest in youth projects as well as willingness to get involved goes beyond the industrialised world. In India, for example, a youth business trust was recently launched, modelled on the Prince's Youth Trust in the UK. Yes reports that the success of the local trust results mainly from the generosity of local Indian industry and secretarial back-up from the Confederation of Indian Industry. For many businesses - at least in the richer nations - significant interest in community involvement began in the early 1980s, when it became clear, as companies tackled the problem of over-manning, that unemployment was set to rise. 'We knew that with a lot of redundancies, we were going to make the situation much worse,' says Sir Allen. 'The natural answer was to say that 'they' - the government - would do something about it, but that was a ridiculous idea.' 'Our involvement in the community is genuinely business driven, even if measuring the returns is not that easy,' he adds. Like many other big companies, most of GrandMet's activities are focused on supporting young people in the world of work. These include an initiative to educate school dropouts, a programme to help young homeless people obtain jobs and projects offering work experience in offices for children in local schools. But business involvement with the community is not just about promoting the prosperity of future customers and employees. Companies in the US, and increasingly in Europe, find consumers becoming more discerning about which products they buy - what may tip the balance is the knowledge that a company is actively involved with the community. 'We know from 1992 Mori research that nearly three-quarters of consumers - 73 per cent - say they are more likely to buy from companies active in the community. One testament to this is the fact that Burger King restaurants which are active in their local area show an increase in their sales,' says GrandMet. Involvement in the community is also believed to motivate employees, and is something - at least when the economy is not in recession - that the best prospective recruits will look at in deciding where to work. The idea of partnership between businesses, communities and charitable organisations is thus an attractive one for the 1990s, appealing both to the long-term business strategies of companies and to changes in the political climate. But this approach is only any good in places where companies perceive that they have a business interest. Realistically, businesses are unlikely to give generously to the countries that most need the assistance. Mr Davies points out that his organisation - the business leaders' forum - has to 'work with the grain', which means it is unable to get business involved in Ethiopia or Sierra Leone, for example. The really poor countries do not have the business potential of a Poland or a China. Expecting corporations to get involved beyond mere philanthropy is a tall order. 'And that,' says the otherwise optimistic Sir Allen, 'is a genuine world problem'.</p>

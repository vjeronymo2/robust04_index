			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HART TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> SAUGUS CONTINUES ROLL WITH DECISIVE VICTORY  </P> <P> Saugus High Coach John Clark remembers Dec. 10 well -- the day of a seven-point  loss to Rio Mesa in the first round of the Beverly Hills tournament.  </P> <P> "We played absolutely terrible," Clark said. "We shot poorly and were selfish.  I lectured their butt off for about 35 minutes. I challenged them to put it on  the line."  </P> <P> Saugus rose to the occasion Thursday night in a 74-33 victory over San Fernando  in a championship quarterfinal of the Hart tournament to notch its fourth win  in a row since a loss to Ventura in the consolation final of the Beverly Hills  tournament.  </P> <P> The Centurions (9-3) have scored 261 points in the past four games, an average  of 65.3 points, while limiting opponents to 123 points (30.8).  </P> <P> Saugus center Greg Yumbar scored a career-high 28 points and pulled down 12  rebounds. Geoff Dains and Steve Tampus added 13 and 12 points.  </P> <P> Saugus, which raced to a 22-4 advantage in the first quarter against Cabrillo  in the first round Wednesday, built a 12-0 lead against San Fernando (4-7) with  Jeromy Smith, who recorded five steals in the contest, scoring six of the  Centurions' first eight points.  </P> <P> Ruben Caballero scored the Tigers' first points with 3 minutes 48 seconds left  in the period.  </P> <P> Saugus defeated San Fernando, 77-55, earlier in the season in the Saugus  tournament.  </P> <P> "We always try to pressure on defense," said Yumbar, a 6-foot-5 senior. "We  have to hustle because our team isn't that big."  </P> <P> Saugus led, 17-11, after the first period, but limited San Fernando to three  points in the first six minutes of the second quarter and expanded its lead to  36-14 with 2:21 left before halftime.  </P> <P> Yumbar, who connected on 12 of 16 from the field, was five of five during the  second-quarter run.  </P> <P> Saugus made 27 of 53 from the field (50.9%) in the game and limited San  Fernando to seven, nine and six points in the final three quarters.  </P> <P> "We shot about as well as we could," Clark said.  </P> <P> San Fernando did not score the final 2:12 after trailing, 63-33.  </P> <P> Jason Riggio and Chris Hernandez each had six assists for Saugus, which will  play Hart in the semifinals tonight at 7:30.  </P> <P> In other championship quarterfinal games:  </P> <P> Hart 87, Calabasas 62 -- Hart scored 18 consecutive points in the third quarter  to increase a 25-24 lead. Ali Peek, who was eight of 12 from the field, scored  seven of his 19 points during the run.  </P> <P> Keith Halcovich scored a game-high 20 points and Marty Downen added 17 for Hart  (7-5). Peek and Downen each grabbed 10 rebounds.  </P> <P> Jason Young led Calabasas (4-6) with 19 points.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley 64, Westlake 57 -- Brock Chase led Antelope Valley with 22  points and John Van Spyk had 22 for Westlake.  </P> <P> East Bakersfield 79, Glendale 71 -- Mike Wright and Hai Tran scored 15 and 14  points for Glendale (6-5). East Bakersfield will meet Antelope Valley tonight  at 6 in the other semifinal.  </P></p>

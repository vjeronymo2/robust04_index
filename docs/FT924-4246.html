			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Book Review: Like father, like son JFK. LIFE AND DEATH OF AN AMERICAN PRESIDENT Volume One: Reckless Youth By Nigel Hamilton Century, Pounds 20. 898 pages Jack Kennedy would never have become president without his father, Joe. The bootlegger, stock market swindler and ambassador to the Court of St James under Franklin Roosevelt was relentless in his pursuit of power, whether in bed or the boardroom. But aside from a brief flirtation with the idea of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1940, Joe Kennedy steered clear of a career in national politics, preferring instead to fulfil his own ambitions through his nine children. Kennedy senior once remarked of his daughter Eunice that if she had 'been born with balls she would have been a hell of a politician'. In the event, it was Jack who made the grade, an outcome which was by no means a foregone conclusion, as Nigel Hamilton suggests in the first volume of this affectionate biography. For much of his early life, Jack Kennedy was racked by back pain and Addison's disease; his academic achievements were nothing out of the ordinary; and he laboured long in the shadow of the family favourite and eldest son, Joe Jr, who later disappeared on a suicidal bombing mission en route to northern France, long after his normal tour of duty was over. Hamilton's thesis is that Kennedy's youth provides most of the clues for understanding the future president. Behind the playboy facade, a serious person was struggling to emerge, according to this biographer, who produces interesting examples of Kennedy's early work as a journalist and student. But the impression remains of a certain recklessness, a desire to live dangerously. Sex is a leitmotiv in JFK's life, as this biography sets out in detail, thanks to dozens of private letters obtained from Lem Billings, a boyhood friend of the future president. Jack Kennedy loved dangerous liaisons. In war-time Washington, he found Inga Arvad, whom the FBI falsely suspected as a Nazi spy. Twenty-five years later, J Edgar Hoover was preoccupied with Kennedy's friendship with Judith Campbell, paramour of Sam Giancana, the Mafia boss. All rollicking stuff, but Hamilton's preoccupation with JFK's health (75 references) and sexual encounters and attitudes (31 references) leaves him prone to psycho-babble. At one point, he compares Jack's tyrannous father to Joseph Stalin, asking improbably: 'Moreover, was there not a complete black-out of news of his father's true behaviour, from assaulting woman guests to lobotomising his daughter? Kennedy and Stalin even shared the same name.' Hamilton's focus on character has merit, if only because he brings out the mixture of diffidence, charm and wit which made Jack such an irresistible political commodity. He also traces Kennedy's progress to political maturity, where, thankfully, the young student and journalist ditched his father's isolationism and craven appeasement of Hitler. The weakness in this approach is that he tends to skirt over more important lessons about Kennedy and his extraordinary family. By far the most telling is the power of money and privilege in America. Thanks to his father's wealth, Jack Kennedy attended the finest universities (Princeton, Harvard and Stanford); he had tea with Princess Elizabeth; he visited France, Germany, Poland, and Russia on the eve of the second world war; and he attended the Potsdam conference in 1945, coming into contact in a matter of weeks with virtually all the players on the international stage including Truman, Eisenhower, Molotov, Harriman, Gromyko, Eden, Churchill, Attlee and Bevin. Not even 30 years of age, Jack had a singular opportunity for a man obviously being groomed for the highest office. To some extent, Jack Kennedy made his own luck. He became a war hero after his PT-boat was rammed by a Japanese destroyer in the Pacific. Hamilton's account of this episode is probably the fullest and most dramatic to date, capturing the mixture of recklessness and personal courage which made him front-page news. Behind the glory, however, there were worrisome tendencies. Like his father, young Kennedy suffered from an inclination to look for short-cuts. For example, he was late in filing to run for the 11th congressional district in Massachusetts, the race which launched his career in national politics. 'A series of frantic phone calls was made,' writes Hamilton. 'In the end, money and influence prevailed.' At the end of this volume, Hamilton claims that Jack had reinvented the Kennedys. He had 'escaped from his father's and his elder brother's Boston-Irish bigotry and found a pluralist, idealistic and internationally defined liberalism that would, one day, define a generation of Americans.' But in the light of what we now know about the misjudgments and brinkmanship of JFK's presidency, Hamilton, in his next volume, will have a hard job revising contemporary judgment among American scholars that as a character Kennedy was flawed, and as a president overrated.</p>

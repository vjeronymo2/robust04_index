			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Eurotunnel shares up on concession extension Shares in Eurotunnel rose sharply yesterday following news that the group had won an extra 10 years on its concession to operate the Channel tunnel. The shares closed at 597p, up 34p. Dealers said that the market had been boosted mainly by French buying interest. More than 60 per cent of the shares are held in France. In return for the extended concession, Eurotunnel has dropped most of its claims of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 1bn against the British and French governments for extra costs that arose through safety, security and environmental measures. The total cost of the tunnel is expected to be about Pounds 10bn, compared with Pounds 6bn in 1987. Eurotunnel's concession will now last for 65 years, taking it through to 2052. Mr Graham Corbett, finance director, said yesterday that the deal would not accelerate progress towards the planned rights issue in the spring, but would facilitate it. The earliest a rights issue could be made would be March. Eurotunnel has to reach agreement with its banks by next Tuesday on a refinancing plan for a further Pounds 1bn, of which at least Pounds 500m should come from the rights issue. It needs the money, in addition to the Pounds 8.95bn already raised, before it can start operations. Analysts suggested yesterday that the share price increase was driven purely by sentiment over the extension of the concession. But they agreed that the deal would ease the group's negotiations with its bankers. Mr Corbett said that in the past six months the group had resolved several difficult issues, including disputes with Transmanche Link, the main contractor, and Bombardier, the Canadian supplier of trains for the tunnel shuttle service. 'We are gradually knocking them down like skittles,' he said.</p>

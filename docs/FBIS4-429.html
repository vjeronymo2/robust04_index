			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpts] Fighting has continued in Rwanda today, five  days after clashes first broke out in the wake of the plane  crash which killed President Habyarimana. A force of RPF  [Rwandan Patriotic Front] fighters has been advancing on the  capital and fighting has also been reported between the RPF and  government troops in some northern districts. [passage omitted]    UNAMIR, the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, has clearly had  little success in brokering a cease-fire between the RPF and the  government. Both the Presidential Guard and the gendarmes have  been involved in clashes with the rebels. And today the United  Nations began to withdraw some of its military police from the  country. On the line to Kigali, Robin White asked UN spokesman  (Mokthar Guei) what they have been doing to bring about a  cease-fire today.    [(Guei)] Well, indeed over the past five days, we have been  trying to bring the two parties together to agree to a  cease-fire. Our efforts are continuing, not very successul, but  we have not given up any hope to bring them back to relaunch the  stalled peace process.    [White] Why is it you cannot stop the fighting in the  capital?    [(Guei)] Well, our mandate is not to impose the peace. We  are here to assist. It is up to the parties to stop the  fighting.    [White] How much fighting is actually going on in the  capital  today?    [(Guei)] Well, as all the other days, very intermittent.  Sometimes very, very intense and sometimes very light. All  types of arms, we understand, are being used: light machine  guns, shellings, mortars, [words indistinct].    [White] Are you yourself beginning to get frightened?    [(Guei)] I have no comment on that.</p>

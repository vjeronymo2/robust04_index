			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / London Stock Exchange: Power stocks upset NEWS that National Power has issued Pounds 225m of convertible bonds hit sentiment in the stock and the shares retreated, leading fellow generator PowerGen lower in their wake. However, analysts were quick to point out that the bond issue was barely earnings-dilutive and as a result there were no downgrades forecast from the sector specialists. Profit-taking was put forward as the main reason for yesterday's share price falls, National Power having closed on Monday at an all-time high of 371p after touching 400p. Yesterday the stock lost 11 to 360p, while PowerGen slipped 7 to 389p. There were also hints that regulatory issues may become more significant in determining the stocks' rating. Shares in both groups have been particularly strong since the pool price review from Offer, the industry regulator, last Friday which deferred any decision on price controls until the autumn. However, the increasingly terse regulatory tone from Offer may have unnerved some investors, and dealers said yesterday that there were also signs of switching out of the National Power ordinary shares and into the convertible. NatWest Securities was one house raising such issues at its morning meeting, where it reiterated its short-term hold, longer-term underperform recommendation on both generators.</p>

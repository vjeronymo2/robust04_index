			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 14 Jun (EFE) -- Today, Cuban authorities  reinforced surveillance at diplomatic missions, particularly  Latin American ones, in Havana following the entry of 20 Cubans  into the German Embassy. The streets surrounding the Belgium  and German Embassies, where two groups of Cubans have entered in  the past weeks, remain closed to vehicle traffic. The  diplomatic missions of Peru, Mexico, Colombia, and Argentina are  heavily guarded.    Diplomatic sources view this deployment of police forces as  a  preventive measure in light of likely incidents at other  embassies while the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is being held.    The recent situation triggered by the crashing of a truck  carrying 21 persons -- 18 men and three women -- on Monday into  the German Embassy so as to request political asylum remains the  same, and seemingly, no changes have taken place.    German Embassy sources consulted by EFE today refused to  comment and limited themselves to referring questions to the  Foreign Ministry in Bonn. Foreign Ministry spokesmen in Bonn  indicated that their government is seeking a European solution  for the Cubans inside their embassy and the Belgian ambassador's  residence in Havana. The German Embassy and the Belgian  ambassador's residence are only a few city blocks apart in the  Miramar neighborhood.    The same source noted that the Cuban refugees are refusing  to  leave the embassy if their situation is not resolved. This  stand is similar to that adopted by a group of 100 Cubans who  have occupied the Belgian residence for two weeks. Only seven  persons have left thus far.    A diplomatic source told EFE that currently, the European  embassies maintain normal contacts regarding these cases, and  that at any moment, the EU ambassadors could meet to discuss the  situation at the German Embassy.    In either case, the Cuban Government has insisted on  pointing  out that this is an "illegal" action that in no way can replace  regular procedures for leaving the island. Yesterday, the Cuban  Government referred to the incident at the German Embassy as "a  carefully planned and unacceptable act."    Meanwhile, the Belgian Government said the 117 refugees must  leave the residence peacefully and follow legal emigration  procedures. They have indicated, however, that the conflict  will not be easily resolved because of the refugees' resistance.</p>

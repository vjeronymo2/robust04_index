			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brinkman Sends Ball Back to </F> Lubbers' Court"]    [Text] Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers, the former CDA  [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader, clashed with Elco  Brinkman, the CDA's leading candidate, last weekend over  influence within the party.    A day after Lubbers publicly expressed doubts about  Brinkman's suitability as prime minister, the CDA's leading  candidate made it clear that he had not found the remark  helpful. "I am and remain available for the prime  ministership," he said.    He said it was "a complicating factor" that the CDA had two  leaders. "I have always thought that and still do," he said.  "But I am keeping the ship on course, even if there is an  occasional wind." Brinkman, who was campaigning in Friesland  over the weekend, said that "Lubbers is now really saying  goodbye and he is having trouble passing on the baton."    Lubbers said on Friday evening [during a television talk  show] that he thought Wim Kok, PvdA [Labor Party] leader, would  be "just as good a prime minister" as his party colleague  Brinkman. The prime minister said he thought it was "a pity"  that a tradition had developed whereby the leading election  candidates automatically became candidates for the prime  ministership. "I have praised Brinkman as my successor as the  leader of the CDA, but I have never said: Here stands the new  prime minister of the Netherlands," Lubbers said.    He admitted that he had seen the CDA's decline coming  several  months ago. "It was difficult for Brinkman to support the  cabinet and at the same time to mark out a new course for after  the elections," Lubbers said. "I have had sleepless nights  about it."    Brinkman reacted with contained anger and indirect criticism  of Lubbers' third cabinet. "I did not have sleepless nights  about that," Brinkman said. "But I do get them about increasing  unemployment, another 15 people without a job every hour, the  real feeling of insecurity on the streets, and the pressure on  the social security system, if we do not act."    The leading candidate had noticed that the prime minister  had  "problems giving up." Talking of his tense relationship with  Lubbers, Brinkman said "taking leave is apparently hurting. He  announced his departure four years ago and now it is right  before him." He said he had not discussed the matter with  Lubbers yet. "But I will do next time I meet him face to face,"  Brinkman said.    Brinkman also said that he was still available for the prime  ministership. "It would after all be peculiar for the CDA to  set off with a leading candidate who was not available to lead  the country. If the CDA says that Brinkman is number one, then  that is the case and that will continue to be the case. I will  keep a steady course, even if there is an occasional wind. In  any event I am available for the prime ministership, although  that will only be decided when the government is formed."</p>

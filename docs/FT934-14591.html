			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / International Company News: Global battle is joined for Spanish telecoms market - The end of protectionism THE gloves are off in the battle for control of Spanish telecommunications, a market which, according to Price Waterhouse, is worth around Dollars 7.8bn, or almost 2 per cent of the global telecoms market. After years of protection from the outside world, the market is being prised open. The Spanish government is about to award two licences to allow independent operators to provide data transmission services, and next year plans to liberalise the cellular telephone business. Opinions are mixed as to how Telefonica, the state-controlled telecommunications group chaired by Mr Candido Velazquez, will face up to the competition. An estimated 31 per cent of its revenues come from businesses that will shortly be opened up to competition. British Telecommunications (BT), France Telecom and Cable and Wireless are seeking data transmission licences. Three domestic consortia, which involve almost all of Spain's big corporate names, have teamed up with foreign operators to bid for the mobile telephone business. Telefonica, in which the government has a 32 per cent shareholding, claims it can hold on to a market share of at least 75 per cent for deregulated services and that it faces a possible 4 per cent loss of annual revenues. It has signed up JP Morgan, the US investment bank, as financial adviser. Telefonica insiders say the US bank will be the company's key partner as it seeks strategic international alliances, particularly in Latin American privatisation processes. The government is going slow on liberalisation. Like Ireland, Portugal and Greece, it has ensured that voice transmission and the basic domestic network (which accounted for 82 per cent of Telefonica's revenues last year) will not be deregulated until 2003 instead of in 1998 as elsewhere in the EC. However, many analysts doubt Telefonica's ability to prosper in an open market. 'The danger is not so much the increasing competition, but the way in which big clients, the financial groups and the industrial corporations, could find ways around the restrictions once better technology is on offer,' says one. Telefonica's fundamental problem is the growing domestic frustration over its services. Monopoly status has bred a lethargic and reactive corporate culture, say its critics. Its long distance tariffs are among the highest in Europe, and its response to customers is slow. A recent survey among major Spanish companies indicated that Telefonica's customer base was divided and unsatisfied; 60 per cent of the corporations interviewed said they would switch to another supplier if they could. BT, which established itself in Spain four years ago, now operates three Spanish nodes, connecting domestic clients to its global network service for data management. Earlier this year it won a contract from Repsol, the partially-privatised energy group and a former Telefonica customer, to manage its external data transmission. Last month BT delivered its boldest challenge yet to Telefonica when it unveiled a Pounds 400m joint venture with Grupo Santander, the big banking and financial services group, to bid for one of the forthcoming domestic data communication licences. The venture, which is built around Megared, a data company that Banco Santander created in 1989 to serve its extensive branch network, aims to capture 22 per cent of the domestic data transmission market over the next decade. The real blow to Telefonica was that it was perceived as being summarily dumped by the Santander group, which had a seat on the Telefonica board, in favour of an outside competitor. Santander informed the national telecommunications group of its alliance with BT just one day before the agreement was publicised. The banking group's nominee director subsequently resigned from Telefonica's board. Telefonica responded to BT's assault by launching its own data transmission company, supplying voice and images as well as data and announcing that it had secured two large clients, Caja de Madrid, the second-ranked Spanish savings bank, and Banesto, a big private bank network, for the new service. Nevertheless, it is clear that the umbilical cord which once linked Telefonica to big domestic financial groups has been severed. In the wake of the BT-Santander alliance, Banco Central Hispano, one of the biggest Spanish banks, acquired 10 per cent of AT&amp;T Network Systems, as part of an ambitious programme of industrial and financial co-operation with the US telecommunications giant. Hispano expects to maintain good relations with Telefonica, but direct competition is inevitable. Hispano is heading one of the consortia for the cellular phone licences. A further mobile phone consortium is lead by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, another big banking group. Perhaps the most visible irony of the deregulation is that the home-based banks have sought partnerships abroad to exploit the new trading climate, while Telefonica has contracted the services of a foreign bank - JP Morgan - to defend its home turf.</p>

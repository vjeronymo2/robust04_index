The spokesmen for the Foreign Affairs Ministry said no  foreign country, organization, or individual has the right to  make irresponsible remarks or interfere. The spokesman said  China's questioning of more than a dozen dissidents in Beijing  and Shanghai was within its rights as a sovereign nation, and  had nothing to do with the visit this week by the U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher.</p>

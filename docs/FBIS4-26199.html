			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Property Rights Clarified"] </F>   [Text] A senior official has refuted rumours that China  plans to sell property rights of money-losing State-run firms to  foreign investors.    The central government is stepping up efforts to verify the  assets at State-owned industries, said Ni Di, Vice-Minister of  the State Administration of State Property.    "But, it is not the central government's intent to prepare  for foreign purchases, as some papers said," he told Business  Weekly in an exclusive interview.    After two years in pilot areas, the State Council plans to  expand its verification of State-owned firms' assets nationwide.    The move is of crucial importance in the development of a  socialist market economy, since it provides accurate information  about assets.    He pointed out that it is untrue that the government plans  to  encourage domestic and foreign businesses to purchase  loss-making large and medium-sized State-owned firms.    The government is, however, encouraging some State-owned  firms to use part of their equipment, workshops, and  infrastructure to lure domestic and foreign investors.    The potential benefits for State firms include updating  equipment and operating methods, making them more competitive.    But it does not mean the State has allowed trading of  State-owned firms' property rights. This practice was  suspended, according to a circular issued by the State Council  in April this year, the vice-minister said.    Setting up ventures between some State-owned firms and  foreign investors therefore does not mean any change in  government-dominated ownership of property, he added.    It is "normal" for some small State firms and State  enterprises "in severe difficulties" to contract, lease and  transfer some assets to other businesses, or even go bankrupt.    But Ni said such activities should be carried out according  to State laws and regulations.    He denied rumours that the government is to set up a special  fund to revitalize State-owned enterprises. Nearly 50 per cent  of the State's annual budgetary investment is now used to  develop State businesses and factories.    The government has special funds to build transport  facilities and supply coal, electricity, and oil. It also  issues State treasury bonds annually.    The funds and the money raised from selling these bonds are  used for supporting State businesses and firms.    So Ni believes it is not necessary to have a special  "revitalizing" fund for State-owned enterprises.    Other official sources say there now are nine State-owned  firms listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. They hope to  raise foreign currency to update their manufacturing  technologies.    Yet all these firms still control the majority of their  shares. as well as their property rights.    It is also a common practice among State-owned firms to seek  foreign investment for ventures China has more than 180,000  foreign-funded ventures which have helped revamp production  technology in 26 industrial sectors.    The State Statistics Bureau said a survey of 2,586  loss-making State firms in the country's eight major provinces  and municipalities shows the majority are in the red due to poor  management.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING NOTES;  </P> <P> BORN TO WAR, THE MATT WALSH NOW PLIES MORE PEACEFUL WATERS  </P> <P> It was 1942 and the start of U.S. involvement in World War II when Garber and  Walsh boat builders launched the 65-foot sportfishing boat Matt Walsh.  </P> <P> Instead of going fishing, it was drafted as a shuttle boat and from 1942 to  1949 was known as the Nickel Snatcher.  </P> <P> It got its nickname from the many workers who boarded the Matt in L.A. Harbor  and were taxied to Terminal Island shipyards for just a nickel.  </P> <P> In 1949, the Matt was converted back to sportfishing and joined the Pierpoint  fleet in Long Beach as a half-day boat.  </P> <P> Tom Murphy, 72, born and raised in Long Beach, said he has memories of riding  the Matt to and from the harbor every day.  </P> <P> Ted Haberfield, 71, of Long Beach, said: "To me the boat is a legend. I  remember in the Pierpoint days, all one needed to do was go out for a half-day  trip, and when we returned tails of fish would be sticking out of the sacks."  </P> <P> Jackpots in those days cost just 50 cents to enter. Today the pots range from  $2 to $5.  </P> <P> When Pierpoint landing closed, the Matt moved to Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> But again, the Matt lost its landing when a storm shut that pier.  </P> <P> Tom Durr purchased the boat in 1978 and moved it to Newport Beach until it was  sold to Ray Duane, who moved it to L.A. Harbor Sportfishing.  </P> <P> Larry Sukahara of the Cabrillo Marine Museum credits Duane for many of the rare  exotics on display in the museum's tanks. Being a half-day boat is an advantage  when an exotic is caught, because Duane can alert the museum to pick it up  alive.  </P> <P> Duane said some changes will be made this winter with a new all-seat gallery.  </P> <P> The Matt Walsh is 57 years young and is still a favorite of many old-timers who  enjoy the comfort of what anglers refer to as the Fat Matt for its wide beam  and comfortable ride.  </P> <P> South Bay Catches: Robert Sias of Gardena, fishing aboard the Toronado, caught  the whopper of the week. After a 20-minute fight, he decked a 61-pound  yellowfin tuna.  </P> <P> Tim Overstreet of Manhattan Beach won the jackpot fishing aboard the  Sharpshooter with his 22-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Marc Larson of Long Beach, on the Sportking, won the jackpot with a 22-pound  yellowtail.  </P> <P> Milo J. Nicolas of Carson caught a 19-pound yellowtail aboard the Shogun.  </P> <P> Juanita Mann of Wilmington, fishing aboard the GW, landed a 12-pound salmon  grouper.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Carlos Menem traveled to Canada on 19 June. The  purpose of his three-day visit is to increase trade between the  two nations.    The president arrived at the metropolitan airport's military  section at 1915 -- shortly after the soccer game between Mexico  and Norway -- on board a helicopter, and 10 minutes later  boarded the plane without talking to the press.    The list of the 32 passengers flying with the president in  the Tango-1 plane was not revealed. But it was known that  Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella, Air Force Commander Juan  Paulik, Economic Relations Secretary Jorge Campbell, Agriculture  Secretary Felipe Sola, presidential physician Alejandro Tfeli,  hair dresser Antonio Cuozzo, and about 20 entrepreneurs traveled  with him.    An interesting note was the absence of Santa Cruz Governor  Nestor Kirchner. "We have been waiting for him since early  today, but he did not even call to tell us he was not coming," a  presidential protocol department official complained.    Menem will meet with economists and politicians in Canada.  He  and Prime Minister Jean Chretien will sign an agreement to avoid  the double payment of taxes on private companies' incomes and  capital and an agreement on cooperation for the peaceful use of  nuclear energy.    But the main item on his agenda will undoubtedly be  Argentina's entry into NAFTA -- much more because he knows the  Latin American country that will most likely join NAFTA first is  Chile.    Both the Argentine president and Felipe Sola will not forget  to discuss the national government's concern over the sale of  subsidized grains to Brazil.    The president will stay at the residence of Governor General  Raymond Hatishin while in Ottawa.</p>

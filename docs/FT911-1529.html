			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / The Long View: Shares that defy the gloom WHATEVER YOU may think about the poor old British economy, the UK stock market has been a distinctly more sprightly animal. In 1990 it has more or less kept pace with the other major world markets despite the particular intensity of the local recession. Its ability to generate high returns over the years has been a indication that, in some respects at least, the British corporate sector has performed quite strongly. There is a reminder here from the new 1991 edition of Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Managers' Pension Fund Indicators, which records that the average gross annual return of 18.9 per cent on UK equities (dividend income plus capital gains) during the ten years 1981-90 compares with 16.7 per cent on overseas equities. A gap of little more than 2 percentage points may not sound much, but it compounds to 25 per cent over a decade. A rather more elaborate study of the long-term returns from four different national stock markets has been produced by Paul Bostock and Paul Woolley of the London investment boutique GMO Woolley. Published in the US Financial Analysts Journal, it shows that in terms of fundamental value delivered to investors British listed companies have indeed outperformed their rivals in the US, Japan and Germany over any five-year or ten-year period within the past twenty years. But currency and market valuation effects have sometimes predominated, most notably in the Tokyo market. Different local inflation rates, and volatile exchange rates, naturally make it difficult to compare stock market returns. Bostock and Woolley have broken down the overall returns into what they call a value-based measure, taking in dividend income and real (inflation-adjusted) earnings growth, together with two revaluation effects. The currency revaluation factor (usually quite small over a long period) reflects exchange rate movements over and above those required to maintain purchasing power parities; and the market revaluation factor (sometimes quite large) reflects changes in the market's average price-earnings ratio, an effect most dramatically seen in Tokyo during the late 1980s when it was adding about 14 per cent each year to the returns enjoyed by investors (though storing up a certain amount of trouble for 1990, when Toyko crashed). During the 20 years 1970-89 the UK delivered 7.8 per cent a year in terms of combined income and real earnings growth, against about 5 per cent in each of the other three markets. But the market revaluation effect pushed Japan well ahead, to give an overall annual return of 22.8 per cent in dollars. Even so, the UK return of 13.9 per cent was well ahead of the US figure of 10.6 per cent, and almost up with the 14.2 per cent return from German equities. Over the five years 1985-89 the UK again came top of the value measures, largely because of the relatively high income (4.5 per cent compared with, at the other extreme, 0.6 per cent in Japan). However, particularly powerful revaluation factors sent both Japan and Germany well ahead on total return. Still, London's return of 28.8 per cent at least trounced the 19.7 per cent from Wall Street. There are several curious features about all this. For example, there appears to be no very close correlation between national economic growth and corporate performance. True, Japan has consistently produced the fastest economic growth and the best earnings growth (though not superior enough to compensate for the meagre dividends). However, German corporate earnings growth has been poor despite a generally good economic growth record, and earnings growth has been worst of all in the US, even though its real annual GDP growth rate has been a respectable 2.8 per cent over 20 years (against 2.5 per cent for the UK). Secondly, the market revaluation effects have been inconsistent. You would expect that investors would place a higher value on faster-growing earnings. That indeed has happened in Japan, but it has also happened in recent years in the US, where earnings growth has been particularly poor by international standards. As for the UK, the much more buoyant corporate performance here has been greeted by little or no price-earnings multiple expansion at all. Is there no justice? In the case of British companies they may indeed have been getting their just deserts, because the quality of earnings has been deteriorating, especially during the 1980s, because of lax accounting practices. International investors have clearly become suspicious of the bottom line obsessions of British managements. When UK company accounts are converted to US standards, earnings typically take a dive. The relationship of stock market performance to national growth is complex. In Germany the narrowly-based stock market is unrepresentative of the multitude of medium-sized, private companies which have made up the economy's powerhouse. There is a much broader spread of listings in Japan, but shareholders tend to come a long way down corporate priority lists: hence the meagre dividend payments. Anyway, the domicile of a company does not necessarily reflect with any precision the geographical location of its activities. British listed companies earn some 40 per cent of their profits from overseas subsidiaries, and another 10 per cent or so from exports. If you extrapolate this process to its limit, a country's framework of tax, law and markets may eventually become more important to large companies than its economic success. The case of the US is probably the oddest of all. Many of its major companies have performed poorly over many years, and yet recently the price-earnings multiples on Wall Street have expanded to levels which have begun to frighten quite a few professional investors. It could be that the market is saying something about the potential for corporate earnings recovery after the recession, or just that investors are vainly seeking to rediscover in stocks the value that has disappeared from the US bond market. Maybe every dog has its day, but some should be kept on a short lead.</p>

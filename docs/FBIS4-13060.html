			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Cairo ROSE AL-YUSUF in Arabic on 11  April carries several articles attacking the Labor Party's  newspaper AL-SHA'B, "extremist books," and a well-known Islamic  writer. It presents portraits of two Islamic figures and  praises scriptwriters and actors for espousing the battle  against terror. Each of the five subjects covered in this  editorial report is dealt with under its own heading as follows:  <H5>  AL-SHA'B CRITICIZED </H5>   A 2,000-word article on pages 58-59 by Wahid Hamid attacks  the Socialist Labor Party's [SLP] biweekly mouthpiece AL-SHA'B  [The People]. In the article, headlined "A Newspaper Against  the People," the writer contends that both the paper and the SLP  are a single-family enterprise, bringing together a group of  relatives and in-laws who share "a hereditary dream of  leadership, pursued even if it is a leadership of a ruined  homeland."    Hamid claims the paper has no allegiance to the country but  instead, "with great ignorance," advocates "the abolition of the  Egyptian character" under the claim of establishing an Islamic  character. He says the paper, rather than defending the  homeland's causes in a sober way, uses exaggeration, invective,  sensationalism, and incitement, which does a disservice to any  cause it defends. He says the government pays no heed to this  publication and might even benefit from it as providing an  example of democratic free speech.    The writer accuses AL-SHA'B of belittling the Egyptian  Government and people but admiring the systems of government in  Sudan and Iraq. Stating that the Iraqi regime would never permit  an Islamic government in the country, he says AL-SHA'B's support  for this regime must spring from its "automatic sympathy with  fascism everywhere, in addition to the usual personal interests  well understood by politicians and media people."    Commenting on a recent article by SLP Secretary General  'Adil  Husayn in which he calls on the people to support his party's  jihad until victory is achieved, the writer asks if the Islamic  state that AL-SHA'B and the SLP advocate will be any different  from the so-called Islamic governments in Afghanistan and Iran.  He remarks that even the Saudi Government is a civilian  government that merely permits the Wahhabists [puritanical  Muslim sect] to monitor Islamic observances.    The writer concludes by saying: "A religious state is a mere  fantasy that is not in harmony with the spirit of Islam, a  religion that has preserved people's rights and left them their  free will and liberty. We are on the side of Islam. We seek to  make it prosper and fight its opponents but without having to  live under a failed dictatorship that professes to be Muslim."  <H5>  EXTREMIST BOOKS </H5>   On pages 60-61, 'Abd-al-Sattar al-Tawilah takes issue with  "extremist books." In an article entitled "A Document of Shame  Against Islam and Muslims," he disputes the arguments set forth  in the book "Putting the Apostates on Trial" by Ahmad al-Suyufi  and says it approves of the assassination of secular writer  Faraj Fudah and others accused of apostasy. He says that  al-Suyufi expresses views similar to those of Shaykh Muhammad  al-Ghazali, Shaykh Mahmud Mazru'ah, and Shaykh Qardawi. He  objects to the book's premise that a person changing his  religion is comparable with national treason and says that even  fascist constitutions guarantee freedom of belief.    Al-Tawilah faults the argument that excuses assassinations  on  the grounds that the government does not permit the religious  stream to form a political party or tortures prisoners in jail.  He remarks: "Numerous political forces are not permitted to  form political parties. Does this mean they have the right to  resort to murder and sabotage?"  <H5>  HUWAYDI VIEWED </H5>   An article by Ibrahim 'Isa on pages 61-63 entitled "Fahmi  Huwaydi's Pistol Has a Silencer" comments on the writings of the  well-known Islamic writer, Huwaydi. He faults him for quoting  other Islamic and secular writers out of context to level  accusations at them, generally in an indirect manner, without  "declaring anything but leaving things to simmer at a suitable  temperature so that the bacteria of accusations will survive  without being proclaimed but also without dying." He says he  believes "Fahmi Huwaydi possesses an exceptional ability and an  astonishing, talented, and admirable know-how in clothing truth  with falsehood" to arouse the anger of any "fanatic" or any  other reader against writers holding views different from his  own to the point of making his readers want to "throttle" those  writers.    He disputes Huwaydi's description as a "moderate" and says:  "The man, talented in several ways, can present himself, and is  represented by others, as a moderate. Behind this screen,  manipulation occurs. I do not know from where his description  as a moderate comes. Is it the calm tone of lamentation in his  lines or is it the silencer he uses when he accuses others of  disbelief?"    While acknowledging Huwaydi's former "important and great"  literary contributions, he accuses him of abandoning his past  intellectual achievements by not coming out strongly against the  call to kill apostates and for his call to hold a dialogue  between the government and the extremists.   <H5>    ISLAMIC FIGURES HIGHLIGHTED </H5>   A 1,800-word report by Usamah Salamah on pages 30-31  discusses the case of a lawyer, Mukhtar Nuh, a formerly obscure  but ambitious figure who has been an active member of the  Egyptian Lawyers Association as a Muslim Brotherhood  representative since 1985. The report discusses his early life  since his enrollment as a law student in 1971 and notes that  this "skillful guitar player" and member of the drama group at  Cairo University's School of Law turned to religion after  graduation and was detained by the authorities for 10 months in  1981 in connection with the "religious streams." His first  public connection with the Muslim Brotherhood is said to date  back to 1985 when he raised the slogan: "Yes, we want it to be  Islamic" during the Egyptian Lawyers Association elections.  'Umar al-Talmasani, the late general guide of the Muslim  Brotherhood, is reported to have told a group of lawyers at that  time: "Mukhtar Nuh will become president of the Lawyers  Association in 10 years but will become Muslim Brotherhood  general guide in just five years."    The report notes that Nuh currently enjoys the backing of  Muslim Brotherhood Spokesman Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, who helped  nominate him for a seat in the People's Assembly 1987 general  election. Nuh is no longer a People's Assembly member but  remains active in the Lawyers Association.    A 2,000-word report by 'Abdallah Kamal on pages 32-33 speaks  of the experiences of 'Abdallah al-Samawi, occasionally referred  to by the writer as Taha al-Samawi, an Islamist jailed several  times and who espouses the concept of repudiating society for  its disbelief. Al-Samawi describes himself as "only a preacher"  but the writer says he is behind the rulings to set video rental  shops on fire and links him with the "Repudiation and  Renunciation" group.  <H5>  ARTISTS PRAISED </H5>   In a 700-word article on page 34, Ahmad Hamrush expresses  dismay at the continuing "terrorist acts by some extremist  groups wearing the guise of Islam." He regrets the failure of  the political establishment, which he says is plagued by  corruption, to do anything about this phenomenon, and praises  writers and moviemakers for endeavoring to resist extremism. He  notes that Egyptian television has stopped broadcasting some  programs and interviewing some personalities that did not  properly interpret religion. Instead it is now showing artistic  works mentioned elsewhere.</p>

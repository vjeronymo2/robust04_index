			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Berlusconi, Bossi Disagree Over </F> Vote's Significance"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Italian Prime Minister Silvio  Berlusconi said here this evening that he sees the European  elections on Sunday [12 June] as a "significant" political test  for the government he formed only a few weeks ago.    But, in a speech in northern Italy, Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi, one of the three allies in Berlusconi's  conservative administration, said the European vote would  "change not a comma" in the government's and the country's  situation, whatever the result.    According to Berlusconi, he is hoping that the majority --  the Northern League, his own Forza Italia and the hard-right  National Alliance -- would win sufficiently well to increase the  government's authoritativeness.    Another hope he expressed on RAI, the public broadcasting  corporation's "Electoral Tribune" series, was that the result  may achieve a greater compactness in the government's ranks,  which have often seemed riven by emerging dissent.    Apparently to further this aim, he told a news and chat show  on one of the Fininvest channels that Bossi and the Northern  League, like the judiciary, had played an important role in  making Italy's change of the political guard possible.    In another nod in the League's direction, Berlusconi said he  favours greater regional autonomy and a fiscal system that  starts from the periphery.    In other points, he appealed to moderately conservative  Catholics to join what he said was a "moderate majority."    In the RAI interview, Berlusconi said he hopes the Italian  MEPs who go to Strasbourg will be able to represent the  citizens' interests by pursuing continuity in renewal.    Bossi's speech stressed that Sunday's vote is important for  creating a true "law-making" European parliament which will make  "good laws" for Europe. He also accused the powers-that-be in  Europe of wanting to avoid giving the assembly law-making  powers. He also warned against voting for Forza Italia. "Anyone  who votes for Forza Italia," he asserted, "knows perfectly well  what's behind it. Let's stop being hypocritical. It's the old  that is coming back."    In other points, he justified his alliance with Forza Italia  and the National Alliance for the March 27 general elections by  saying he was hoping to beat Berlusconi once he had gained an  improved position. "We are guaranteeing governability," he  said, "but we don't intend to be subordinate to anyone."</p>

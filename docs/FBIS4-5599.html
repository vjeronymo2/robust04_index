			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. War Frenzy Undisguised" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher reportedly let out a war-reeking blast  threatening the DPRK over the fictitious "nuclear issue".    In an interview with NBC April 10, Christopher, setting a  deadline for the DPRK, told that "the diplomatic pressure on  North Korea will give way to a more severe approach, with even a  preemptive military strike not ruled out", unless the DPRK  positively reacts to their one-sided and unjustifiable demand  until that time.    U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, too, in an  interview  with NBC April 3 openly blared that "a preemptive military  strike at North Korea will not be ruled out" and they were ready  to risk a war.    Such war blasts ringing out continuously from among the U.S.  high-ranking officials clearly show that the very one who seeks  to provoke a war on the Korean peninsula is none other than the  United States.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Boris Yeltsin in a speech at the formal  banquet in Bonn late on Wednesday dwelt at length on the course  of Russian reforms.    "Our state, he said, is going through a complicated period.  Its substance is manifested in profound changes in all walks of  life: from the national economy down to the individual's  mentality. The complexity of tasks we have set ourselves is not  determined only by the gigantic size of the country. One other  just as important factor is caused by the huge distortions  inherited by Russia from the period of totalitarian rule".    It is impossible to resolve such tasks quickly and without  pain, said the Russian president. "Any tangible results may  follow a longer range flexible policy which, apart from the  world experience, accounts for Russian history, Russian national  specifics and traditions and the psychology of our society", he  said.    "We are seeking to set conditions for active participation  in  Russian reforms by all constructive forces and at the same time,  tough restrictions on extremists", Yeltsin stressed. "We are  well aware that the key to resolving the current problems is in  our own hands. No one but we ourselves can build a prospering  society -- by dint of our people's toil, talents and energy.  And we are confident about a success of our reforms".    On relations between Russia and Germany, Yeltsin said the  present generation of Germans and Russians made use of the  unique chance "that history has given us". "Gone from our  relations is the feuding which has for decades worn out the  nerves and stamina of both nations", said the president. "Today,  we solve all arising issues to mutual benefit in an atmosphere  of calm and well-wishing. One proof is the nature and substance  of current talks with the federal chancellor".    One of the issues of mutual concern, the president went on  to  say, is bilateral economic relations. In his words, Germany is  "Russia's main trading partner". However, he stressed that  businessmen from other countries have started to overtake their  German counterparts in the Russian market. " I do not think that  German entrepreneurs would be willing to concede their leading  positions. But for this, more activity is needed", said Yeltsin.    The Russian president offered German businessmen to open up  direct cooperation with Russian enterprises and promote  manufacturing contacts for years ahead without restricting  themselves to one-off trading deals.    On the situation in Europe and worldwide, Yeltsin stressed  it  was on the change. "The bloc approach to resolving  international issues is going into the past. But eternal peace  is yet to come. What I mean, said the president, is not only  the local conflicts and wars but also global challenges which  can be met by the world community as a whole. That is why there  is an increasing urgency for united effort".    Both Germany and Russia can play a stabilizing role in  complicated global processes, Yeltsin believes. But more  importantly, peace and security guarantees must be brought to  Europe and adjacent regions. "What is needed is the models of  solutions and cooperation that would not infringe on anyone's  interests and leave anyone overboard", Yeltsin said.    "The new single Europe cannot be a club for a few select",  stressed the Russian president. "By the same token, the solution  of security problems cannot be the privilege of a few select".    "The wholesome political, economic and cultural architecture  of our continent should not be allowed to isolate individual  countries or a group of countries on the foe-friend principle  but should try to integrate them within a single organism. It  is not worth trying to divide Europe into high or low security  zones", Yeltsin said.    In his view, "the military-political institutions of our  continent emerging in conditions of the period of the cold war  and confrontation are outdated and in need of internal  transformation". "But the main thing is cooperation in the  readjustment of the system of institutions and mechanisms which  could work to the benefit of one democratic Europe", he pointed  out. "The main route to this, in our view, lies through  establishing the CSCE as an effective regional organization. In  this case, united effort by NATO, NACC [North Atlantic  Cooperation Council], WEU [Western European Union] and CIS can  acquire a new substance under its umbrella". It is precisely  this that determines Russia's attitude to the Partnership for  Peace program, he said.    In his words, "the genuine partnership is an effective  guarantee of security and stability in the continent. But this  can be made possible only if there is a will on both sides and a  movement towards each other." "Such an approach does no ripe  easily even within the framework of NATO", he said. "But this in  itself is no reason for slackening bilateral effort", said  Yeltsin.    "Russia's position on this is clear-cut: we have no  territorial claims to any state. Our defence doctrine is purely  defensive. The Russian armed forces have no tasks other than  defences of the country and its CIS allies, participation in  peacemaking operations in line with international commitments",  said the Russian president.    Yeltsin told the audience that "we are on the threshold of  an  important event in Russian-German relations. The last Russian  soldier will soon leave the German soil. This will draw a line  under the heavy legacy we inherited almost 50 years ago. Of  course, our memories will take us back again and again to the  tragic chapters of history. But this should not be allowed to  become an obstacle to a final historical reconciliation between  the peoples of our countries. The seeds of reconciliations have  shot up and started to bring a rich harvest."</p>

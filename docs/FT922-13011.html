			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / O&amp;Y confident on bank debt accord: Robert Peston and Bernard Simon in Toronto on potential conflict among creditors over demands for new money for Canary Wharf OLYMPIA &amp; York Developments, the troubled property developer, said last night it was confident its 100 banks would agree to proposals to restructure its CDollars 14.3bn (Pounds 6.84bn) debt, even though it admitted all lenders would be asked to make some sacrifice. However, bankers said yesterday that reaching agreement might prove difficult. Some complained the terms might be too favourable to the Reichmann family, which founded and owns O&amp;Y. They also said they needed time to decide whether it is fair that 50 banks, which have lent USDollars 5bn (Pounds 2.94bn) to the parent company rather than directly to the property interests, should make the biggest sacrifices. O&amp;Y also announced the appointment as president and deputy chief executive of Mr Gerald Greenwald, a former vice-chairman of Chrysler, the automotive group which was restructured in the early 1980s. Mr Steve Miller, another Chrysler alumnus who has been taking the lead in negotiating with banks on O&amp;Y's behalf, said: 'We believe lenders are going to go along with the plan'. He was speaking minutes after the end of O&amp;Y's first meeting with all its banks. He expects the banks to give approval to the broad outlines of the plan within weeks. Negotiations will henceforth take place with small groups of banks. The biggest sacrifices under the proposal will be made by banks who have lent around USDollars 5bn to the parent company. They will be asked to defer payments of both principal and interest. However some lenders to the US and Canadian property interests will also be asked to defer principal. Mr Miller said he did not regard deferal of principal as a major concession. But he added: 'Almost all debt will play a role' in the restructuring. He said the banks would not be offered any 'sweeteners' for making the sacrifices. He warned :'If there were massive refusals (to support the plan) there is a possibility that the company could have to go through a series of (bankruptcy) filings'. Mr Miller said that banks which have provided loans for the construction of the Canary Wharf office development in east London would be asked to put up Pounds 100m in new money over the next few months. The Pounds 3bn office development needs to raise Pounds 350m over the next two years. Bankers warned yesterday this demand for new money was likely to lead to conflict between two different groups of lenders to Canary Wharf. It has emerged that four Canadian banks, including the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, have secretly lent Pounds 450m for the Canary Wharf project. They took as security shares in Canary Wharf companies. Bankers say that means these banks rank behind a separate 'club' of ten banks which lent Pounds 500m for Canary Wharf at the end of 1990. This loan is secured on O&amp;Y's assets, its buildings, rather than on shares in the Canary Wharf companies. Bankers in the club of ten - which include Citicorp of the US, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, Credit Suisse, Lloyds of the UK and its rival Barclays - say the four Canadian banks have the most to lose if the Canary Wharf project is not completed, because the Canadian banks hold inferior security. So the club of ten feel the Canadian banks should put up the bulk of the new money required. However, three of the four Canadian banks are also in the club of ten, making the conflict even more complicated. New head of O&amp;Y, Page 26</p>

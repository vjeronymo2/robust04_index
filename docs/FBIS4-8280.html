			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 11 Apr (MTI) -- NATO's attacks against  Serbian military positions in Gorazde served peace not war and  the Bosnian Serbs will hopefully take the warning seriously  enough to return to the negotiating table, Hungarian Foreign  Minister Geza Jeszenszky told the press in Los Angeles today.    Hungary's involvement in controlling no-fly zones in Bosnia,  which is based on a UN mandate, has to be separated from NATO  actions in Sarajevo and Gorazde. The latter manoeuvres were  governed by other Security Council resolutions, and had nothing  to do with AWACS surveillance flights over Hungary, the minister  said.    In reply to MTI, Jeszenszky said he welcomed all steps that  promote a political solution and, at the same time, warn  aggressive forces.    He expressed the hope that the action would contribute to a  political settlement, which started with the Croat-Muslim  agreement.    Asked about the position of the Russian government,  Jeszenszky said Moscow had to be aware that such action might  occur.    The minister expressed the hope that Moscow would continue  to  cooperate with the United States and the United Nations in  settling the Yugoslav crisis.    He recalled that Russian policy had played a useful role in  Bosnian mediation over the past few months. He added that peace  in Bosnia is as much a Russian interest as that of the Unites  States, Hungary and Bosnia itself.</p>

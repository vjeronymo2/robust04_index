			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Philips tumbles 36% to Fl 103m PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, said net profit fell by 36 per cent to Fl 103m (Dollars 57.9m) in the first quarter, largely as the result of a sharp decline in its communications systems business. In spite of the fall in overall profit, yesterday's figures showed that operating losses in Philips' consumer electronics, its biggest and most important business, had stabilised, while two other businesses - lighting and semi-conductors - had posted operating profit rises of 10 per cent and 67 per cent, respectively. However, the group's fourth business, professional products, was hit hard by the sharp reversal in the fortunes of communication systems. A drop in orders from Germany's telecommunications authorities helped push the sector into an operating loss of Fl 9m from a profit of Fl 128m the year before. Group sales fell by 2 per cent to Fl 13.75bn, reflecting poor economic conditions in Europe. On the Amsterdam stock market, which had been braced for a loss, Philips' shares soared by nearly 8 per cent to close up Fl 2 at Fl 27.30. The operating loss in consumer electronics was barely changed at Fl 55m compared with Fl 59m. Price erosion for consumer electronic equipment totalled 2 per cent in the quarter, but Philips also managed to get its costs down, producing a roughly similar loss. In 1992, when restructuring provisions pushed Philips into a net loss of Fl 900m, consumer electronics ran up total operating losses of Fl 553m. Mr Dudley Eustace, Philips' finance director, said: 'The consumer electronics business in Europe remains extremely difficult, particularly in Latin countries,' where last autumn's currency devaluations meant that higher costs in guilder terms could not be passed on to consumers. The US, however, has continued to grow, with the number of colour televisions sold up 13 per cent compared with early 1992. Philips refused to comment on the book profit which it will make on the Fl 3bn sale of its 35 per cent stake in a Japanese-based semi-conductor joint venture, Matsushita Electronics Corp, to its partner Matsushita. Mr Eustace would say only that the deal, announced last week, would be completed in the second quarter and that the proceeds would be used to reduce debt. Mr Eustace, who joined Philips from British Aerospace in mid-1992, said renewed efforts at better asset and cash management had paid off, producing a Fl 547m decrease in working capital. Philips ended the quarter with a net cash surplus of Fl 772m against a deficit of Fl 576m the year before. This, in turn, enabled Philips to bolster its debt-to-equity ratio to 59:41 from 61:39 at the end of 1992. Mr Eustace said his five-year goal is to achieve a ratio of 40:60.</p>

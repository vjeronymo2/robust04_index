			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Observer: Rose-tinted rear mirror Observer's 'Micawber' award for positive thinking goes to the annual report just published by Ford of Britain. 'We ended 1992 on an encouraging note,' breezes chairman Ian McAllister, before mapping out his first year's stewardship with landmarks such as the following. The Ford Escort was the UK best seller last year . . . Ford's share of the commercial vehicle market rose . . . so did productivity at Dagenham by almost a quarter . . . quality was up . . . warranty costs were down . . . there was a Queen's Award for Exports. To boot, he goes on, the organisation is 'well on the path towards global competitiveness'. And, with 'exciting new products coming on stream and new levels of performance and efficiency', now is the time 'to consolidate our leadership of the UK automotive industry.' With so golden a future evidently ahead, it seems a pity to look back - as the eight-page commentary does not - to other landmarks in the rear mirror, including: The Pounds 353m pre-tax loss . . . the Pounds 330m new equity pumped in for a second successive year's subvention from Detroit . . . the drop in car production, and the shrinking car-market share . . . the loss of 5,000 jobs, or 12 per cent of the workforce . . . the negative trade balance. After all, it's only the annual report.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / All-night party ends in cheers for Sydney The raucous welcome for the 2000 Olympics THE OLYMPIC 2000 bid decision may have arrived at an uncomfortable 4.30am in Sydney. But Australia's biggest city was never going to miss its chance to party. At Circular Quay on the city's central harbour, tens of thousands of people gathered to watch the event relayed live from Monte Carlo on giant television screens. For the most part, the crowd was young, beer-swilling, and intent on a good time. 'Syd-ney, Syd-ney', it yelled obligingly, as presenters urged chanting. The atmosphere lay somewhere between that of a pop concert and a football game. But when Sydney's victory was announced, the decibel count rose to deafening levels, and the normally decorous city centre was transformed into a swaying, horn-blaring fiesta. Celebrating Sydney-siders hugged each other at random. Sky and harbour twinkled with the lights from helicopters and the flotilla of boats. Fireworks erupted over the famous harbour-side Opera House, its 'sails' decked out in the Olympic bid colours. In many of the city's big hotels, where residents and celebrities were enjoying special 'all-night' packages, the partying was only marginally more restrained. Most hotel managers had laid on continuous bar facilities, and some had staged special events. The prize for innovation could have gone to the Inter-continental. The upmarket hotel devised a five-course dinner, with each segment tuned to one of contending cities - Turkish delight, Beijing duck, a German fish-based starter accompanied by schnapps, and a Sydney-style dessert concoction decked out in Olympic colours. Manchester proved more of a challenge. In a leap of gastronomic imagination, the chefs finally settled on barley soup and lamb sausage . . . served under an umbrella. The celebrations will now continue throughout today and well into the weekend. This morning, the action switches from Circular Quay to neighbouring Darling Harbour, where there will be more fireworks, bands, concerts, and a variety of street theatre events. Pubs across the city are expected open round the clock. Ahead of the decision, many organisers had admitted that the task of balancing their desire to cash in on a win, with the threat of small turnouts if Sydney lost, was little short of a nightmare. The celebration was called merely 'Thank You, Sydney' and one West Sydney pub hedged its bets: its Friday programme was called 'Cheers and Tears'. In the event, they need not have worried. Meanwhile, Sydney's win was expected to give share prices a lift when trading opened this morning. A cost-benefit study, undertaken by KPMG Peat Marwick for the city's bid presenters has suggested that the nation could enjoy a ADollars 7.3bn boost to gross domestic product over the next 11 years as a result of hosting the Games. Additional tax revenues, resulting from extra tourists and expenditure, could amount to almost ADollars 2bn. Local property and construction companies have been tipped to do particularly well as a flood of building work gets under way. For small traders, hawking Sydney souvenirs, the Games decision has been every bit as nerve-racking. 'If Sydney loses, I'm going home to cry and get some sleep,' said one T-shirt seller on Circular Quay yesterday afternoon. Beside her was a pile of unsold sweatshirts. In the event, she may lack sleep, but the dollars will certainly roll in. The celebratory atmosphere, however, does mask some mixed views among the city's residents about the desirability of hosting the Olympics. Most have been enthusiastic - 'It could be as good as the America's Cup', said one resident, ahead of last night's decision - and a recent poll suggested that 82 per cent of people in New South Wales favoured hosting the games. But a minority of Sydney-siders have worried that estimates of a small operating profit from the Games may prove over-optimistic, pointing to financial problems which have developed in other Olympic cities. 'No thanx' read the graffiti scrawled over one 'Thank You, Sydney' poster in the city centre. The wails of the Cassandras, however, were inaudible amid the 'Syd-ney, Syd-ney' chants last night.</p>

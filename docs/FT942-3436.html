			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Iran to let private banks open Iran has decided to let privately-owned banks open from next week for the first time since the Islamic revolution in 1979, Reuter reports from Nicosia. Mr Mohammed Hussein Adeli, central bank governor, was quoted by Tehran radio as saying the bank would supervise the private banks 'and therefore guarantee their activities'. Mr Adeli said regulations for private banks had been approved by the government and a Money and Credit Council and declared to be within constitutional and religious laws. 'The banks would be able to take deposits and participate in production and economic activities nationwide,' he said. Iran nationalised private banks at the start of the revolution. There are five existing state-owned banks. Foreign banks have representative offices in Tehran. Initial capital of a private bank should be at least 5bn rials (Pounds 1.9m). No bank would be allowed to lend more than 15 times its deposited capital, Mr Adeli said.</p>

			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine or the grape: that is the question - Another New World versus Old conflict SERENA SUTCLIFFE, head of Sotheby's wine department, was describing, at a discussion over dinner with the CIVB, the official wine organisation of Bordeaux, how difficult it is to persuade 'what I call The Ordinary Wine Drinker' that he should drink basic bordeaux rather than Bulgarian Cabernet. 'I wonder', she asked, looking deep into the president's eyes, 'would it be possible for you to put a bit more flavour into your wines?' The officials dutifully took notes and presumably, after a few dozen committee meetings, an instruction will be sent to the Entre-Deux-Mers region which provides so much ordinary bordeaux: Hold the subtlety. The French in general, especially the Bordelais, are feeling particularly sensitive about competition from other countries at the moment - not least because their wine exports have dropped for the first time in a decade. The CIVB conceded one important point over this recent dinner in London. We managed to convince them of the folly of their stated party line that 'Bordeaux should not be judged in the same league as New World wines . . . the criteria used need to be different'. But they are determined to play according to different rules from the New World. French appellation officials have decided to ban the names of grape varieties from wine labels. The theory is that once they start selling their wines as, for example, Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon instead of Chassagne-Montrachet and Pauillac, then they agree to play the same game as New World wine producers and throw away their trump card: geography, or terroir. They are banking on the fact that, as far as geographical wine names go, they are centuries ahead of the Americans and antipodeans in terms of brand development. But what is the most sensible way to label a wine? Until the perfect grape variety is found for every plot of vineyard and all wine drinkers know what that is (and we are a very long way from that), information about grape varieties is genuinely helpful to the modern consumer, even if printed in much smaller type than the name of the wine's provenance. The French may find that their place-based naming strategy works in the long term, but only if they are serious about improving quality in the lower ranks, which they tend to translate directly as curbing yields. (And this should certainly help to 'put more flavour' in the Entre-Deux-Mers wines - although some parts of the region may be simply too cool to ripen red grape varieties fully anyway.) What would you surmise from the word Tarrango on a wine label, for instance? This red in a burgundy bottle, new to Britain's shelves, may sound Latin American, but in fact it is from Brown Brothers, a 104- year-old family company based in the Australian state of Victoria. A closer look at the italics under the 'Limited Production' stamped on to the label (which sets one thinking about how many wines are available in infinite quantity) reveals that TARRANGO is a new Australian grape variety, designed to yield light Beaujolais-juicy reds for summer drinking. At Pounds 4.45 from Waitrose it seems a good buy to me, with lots of fruit, no tannin, and something reminiscent of South African Pinotage about the aroma. Ironically perhaps, this specially-bred vine variety has in fact been named geographically, after a small township in Victoria. The Bordelais may never feel seriously threatened by Tarrango, but the sensible ones are monitoring closely (or even participating in) what is happening just three hours down the autoroute in the Languedoc. Many of the region's best buys are Vins de Pays labelled by grape variety, tolerated if not encouraged by the French appellation authorities, but more and more exciting Corbieres and Minervois appellation wines are also emerging. DOMAINE DES PENSEES SAUVAGES is a small property in the rugged heart of the Corbieres run by British emigres Nick and Clare Bradford. Mirroring what the typical Brit thinks of English winemaking, I had never sought out the wine, but a bottle of their regular 1991 tasted recently was extremely impressive: subtle (the Bulgarians need lose no sleep), rewarding with food, and clearly made from old vines with care and passion. The 1991 costs Pounds 4.50 from Ben Ellis of Brockham, Surrey (0737-842160) which also has the 1991 Reserve. The 1990 is just Pounds 4.75 from Abbey Cellars of Yeovil, Somerset (tel: 0935-76228). The most useful bit of information on most wine labels is of course the name of the producer. There are few producers who could persuade me to part with Pounds 7 for a bottle ranked only as a vin de table, the lowest French wine rank, but the small print on the label of LES COLLINES DE LAURE 1991 carries the name Jean Luc Colombo, one of the Rhone's most energetic and user-friendly oenologists. This excitingly vibrant red is made from his Cornas vines too young to qualify for the strictures of the Appellation Controlee authorities and offers a superior Syrah-with-a-story for drinking this summer (Pounds 6.75 from Adam Bancroft, 4 -7 Great Pulteney Street, London W1 071-434-9919). This young Master of Wine specialises in Under-appreciateds, Eastern France. His VDQS Cotes du Vivarais 1990 from MAS DE LA BEGUDE is staggeringly powerful and ambitious for Pounds 5.58, and knocks spots off the average supermarket Chateauneuf-du-Pape. A wine to be drunk or kept, but certainly a name to be watched. The name Denis Dubourdieu on a white bordeaux label should alert wine insiders. LE SECOND DE REYNON 1992, Pounds 5.49 from Oddbins, is marvellously fruity, an adjective all too rarely applicable to dry white bordeaux in my experience, although 1992 whites are better than most. Pomerol and Michel Rolland is another insider combination, and Oddbins again have his well structured, full blown generic POMEROL 1991, in fact his declassified Ch Bon Pasteur, at Pounds 7.99 which is also ready for the dinner table. Finally, evidence that the Spaniards at least are prepared not just to countenance international competition, but to take inspiration from it. Sainsbury's has the cleverly crafted, barrel-fermented NAVARRA VIURA-CHARDONNAY at just Pounds 3.99, perhaps too oaky for some palates, but a creamy full-bodied combination of one local and 80 per cent of another distinctly international grape variety.</p>

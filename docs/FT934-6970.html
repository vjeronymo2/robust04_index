			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Germany triggers wave of easing The Deutsche Bundesbank's repo rate reduction last Tuesday triggered a wave of money market easing across Europe, writes Conner Middelmann. The Bundesbank's two-week repo rate fell by nine basis points to 6.29 per cent on Tuesday. That was followed by Thursday's announcement of a 6.25 per cent fixed-rate repo for this week, which was seen as a signal from the German central bank that while rates will continue to fall, they will only ease gradually. The Bundesbank's rate cut, preceded by a unilateral Danish rate reduction on Monday, was followed in the course of the week by cuts in money market rates in the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Norway and Portugal. Some say this may continue in the near term if the D-Mark stays weak against its partners in the European exchange-rate mechanism, allowing them to trim their rates further. France is eyed as a prime candidate for near-term easing, especially since its currency strengthened markedly against the D-Mark over the last week. The franc closed at FFr3.4690 on Friday, up from FFr3.4830 a week ago. However, with the French authorities intent on safeguarding the value of the franc while rebuilding their foreign currency reserves, many market players feel the Bank of France will wait for cuts in Germany's leading rates before making a move. The Bundesbank's central bank council is widely expected to lower its key discount and Lombard rates at one of its two December meetings. The dollar ended the week on a strong note, buoyed by high hopes for world trade talks and a general optimism on the US economy. Dealers said the currency's ability to hang on at the end of the week, a change from the usual Friday profit-taking, indicated it could see further gains this week.</p>

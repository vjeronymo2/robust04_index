			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren has urged major state-owned enterprises to orient  themselves with the market and play a leading role in the market  economy being created nationwide.    During a tour of inspection of east China's Shandong  Province  from May 19 to 26, Rong said that the establishment of a market  economy has afforded an excellent opportunity for such  enterprises to develop themselves.    The enterprises have strengths in personnel, technology and  equipment, he said, noting that some have set an example for  others to follow in displaying these advantages fully.    He expressed the belief that workers and staff of such  enterprises will certainly brace up and work even harder to  invigorate their enterprises.    Local officials told the vice president that during the  first  four months of 1994, output value of major state-owned  enterprises all over Shandong Province shot up 15 percent over  the same period in 1993.    Profits and taxes generated by such enterprises jumped 20  percent during that period.    "Reform is essential to the invigoration of major  state-owned  enterprises," Rong told local officials.    Specifically, such enterprises must introduce a modern  enterprise system and a market-oriented operational mechanism by  carrying out reforms in employment, personnel and income  distribution, he noted.    The leader also stressed the need to arouse the initiative  of  workers and staff, develop and manufacture quality and  marketable products and pursue a diverse economy as a way to  provide jobs to surplus workers.    He called for efforts to promote scientific and  technological  progress. He did so while visiting the Jinan Motorcycle Plant,  the Qilu Petrochemical Corporation, the North Star Wristwatch  Factory and seven other companies in seven cities, as well as  two economic and technological development zones in the cities  of Yantai and Weihai.    "When possible, major enterprises should set up their own  research institutes," he said, adding that practice will make it  possible to speed up the upgrading of products and improve their  competitiveness.    According to the vice president, the import of funds and  technology, especially high and new technology, is a good way to  retool major state-owned companies in China.    Rong Yiren also asked such companies to make full use of  domestic scientific and technological findings.</p>

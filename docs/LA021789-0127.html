			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE WORKS OVERTIME FOR 95-92 VICTORY  </P> <P> An ailing UC Irvine basketball team limped into Thursday night's game against  University of the Pacific hoping to find the panacea for all Big West  Conference teams: Take a win from the Tigers and go to bed.  </P> <P> The Anteaters were playing without Jeff Herdman -- the nation's leading  three-point shooter who has the flu -- and also had their top rebounder and No.  2 scorer, center Mike Doktorczyk, limping with a severe thigh bruise.  </P> <P> Irvine, 10-12 overall and 7-6 in the Big West, scored a 95-92 overtime victory  over Pacific (5-17, 1-12) at the Spanos Center. It was the Tigers' third  consecutive overtime loss at home.  </P> <P> The Anteaters managed to finally pull away from the tenacious Tigers and led by  10 (75-65) with 5:33 left in regulation. But Pacific outscored Irvine, 16-2, to  take a 81-77 lead with 1:25 left.  </P> <P> Doktorczyk, who scored 26 points, hit a three-pointer with 1:13 left to cut the  Pacific lead to one. After an Irvine turnover -- when guard Kevin Floyd slipped  to the floor -- Pacific's Reggie Ricks hit a pair of free throws to give the  Tigers an 83-80 advantage with 20 seconds left.  </P> <P> Floyd, who scored 25, then hit a three-pointer with eight seconds left to send  the game into overtime.  </P></p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Poland sets the pattern - Eastern Europe's move towards convertible currencies FOREIGN exchange trading in the former communist world from the Elbe to the Pacific Ocean used to be either a state-controlled rip-off or a furtive, back-street affair with money changers who were often secret policemen in disguise. The Poles were the most blatant and competitive of black-market dealers and it was entirely appropriate therefore that Poland became the first of the post-communist regimes to make its currency, the zloty, internally convertible and turn foreign exchange dealing over to the private sector. Poland's trail-blazing liberalisation of its foreign exchange market was an essential element in the IMF-backed economic stabilisation programme which began on January 1, 1990. Backed by a Dollars 1bn currency stabilisation fund provided by western governments and financial institutions the exchange rate of the zloty was fixed at 9,500 to the dollar, the rate at which it was trading on the black market. To general surprise the once-despised socialist currency then appreciated in real terms for the next 17 months as the internal purchasing power of the zloty was eroded by inflation while its external value remained fixed. Then came the first devaluation in May last year followed by introduction of a crawling peg system which devalues the currency by around 1.8 per cent a month. While the central bank maintains this controlled floating regime, actual trading is carried out in thousands of privately-owned exchange booths and commercial bank counters equipped with real-time computer terminals which compete fiercely over their spreads to attract custom. The success of Poland's bold experiment in foreign exchangeliberalisation and internal convertibility was followed in a quieter way by several other former Soviet satellites. In no case, however, has full convertibility been introduced, involving capital account transactions and non-residents. Hungary also comes close to full convertibility in practice, however, with non-residents guaranteed the right to repatriate Forint earnings on direct and portfolio investments. But even Hungary maintains token limitations on residents obtaining foreign currency for business or travel purposes and it remains far easier to change hard currency into local currencies than vice versa. The introduction of varying degrees of internal convertibility throughout eastern and central Europe has been accompanied by the collapse of trade denominated in the now-defunct transferable rouble and a sharp rise in trade with hard currency markets. This has led to a corresponding increase in export-import financing and foreign exchange trading volume. Between the last quarter of 1989, which saw the destruction of the Berlin Wall, and the end of the second quarter of 1991 the three central European countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which are now associate members of the European Community, saw their exports to the OECD area rise by between 13 and 35 per cent, with a corresponding rise in foreign exchange transactions. But the most important development in foreign exchange trading is due on July 1 when the Russian government takes the first big step towards introducing convertibility for the rouble. For decades the act of even taking rouble banknotes out of the Soviet Union was considered a serious criminal offence. Tourists and businessmen alike were only allowed to change money at a grotesquely over-valued rate while the gigantic bureaucracies which dealt with foreign trade were tied up in knots by an incredibly complex structure of foreign trade co-efficients and other bureaucratic nonsense. This created a thicket of differing exchange rates which bore no relationship at all to any concept of market value and made it impossible for the Soviet authorities to have any rational foreign trade policy. On July 1, all these various artificial exchange rates will be abolished and replaced by a single, albeit floating, rate of exchange. The idea is for the rouble to float for a few months to get an idea of its approximate market value and then to fix a central rate within a 7.5 per cent fluctuation band. This is expected 'sometime this autumn', according to Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the Russian central bank. A huge amount of work remains to be done to train the necessary staff and set up the infrastructure required to ensure orderly foreign exchange trading across this huge country extending over nine time zones from St Petersburg in the west to Sakhalin or Vladivostok in the east, with key oil- and gas-producing, and therefore hard-currency-earning, Siberia in the middle. The new convertible rouble will be the currency of Russia, the largest, and potentially the richest, of the 15 former Soviet republics which made up the defunct Soviet Union . Those of the former Soviet republics who want to remain within the 'rouble zone' will have to play by the rules hammered out in the inter-republican central bankers' commission where Russia, with its huge energy and raw material resources, has the most influential voice. Russia's pre-eminence will be reinforced by the imminent steep rise in the rouble price of its energy and raw material exports to the other former Soviet republics. Those republics, like the Baltic states and Ukraine, which have no oil or gas of their own, will inevitably run up deficits with Russia. But Moscow's willingness to supply the necessary rouble credits will depend on the willingness of other republics to play by the new monetary rules which will accompany rouble convertibility. As the terms of trade move sharply in Russia's favour the other republics will have to step up exports to Russia and agree to tight monetary and other disciplines. In this way, Russia will almost certainly re-assert its hegemony over the former Soviet republics and enforce economic re-integration of the rouble zone through a combination of higher energy prices and convertibility. If this prognosis is correct the prospect of the former Soviet republics being able to introduce their own national currencies will be much reduced. Latvia was the first to introduce its own parallel currency in a move which the IMF described as 'economic suicide'. The other Baltic states, Estonia and Lithuania, have similar plans alongside the Ukraine which initially created a semi-Ukrainian currency by sticking coupons on existing rouble banknotes. This was essentially part of a rationing system to give nationals priority access to scarce food and other items, but plans are advanced for the introduction of the Hryvnia as a fully-fledged national currency. But the introduction of new currencies is shrouded in considerable controversy. Mr Matiukhin, diplomatically commented that in the beginning at least, the new currencies are likely to be as independent as the Scottish pounds, issued by several Scottish banks, but only under strict Bank of England control.</p>

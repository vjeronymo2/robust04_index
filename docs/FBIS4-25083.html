			<p>BFN     [Text] Nanning, 21 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)-- The Xinan  Appraisal Center -- China's largest appraisal institution on the  quality system of export-manufacturing enterprises (IS09000) --  yesterday opened for business in Nanning, marking the first step  of a joint effort by the six southwest provinces and cities of  Sichuan, Chongqing City, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, and Tibet to  bring their practices in line with international conventions.    Experts at yesterday's inaugural convention of the Xinan  Appraisal Center said that cooperation between economically  advanced areas in southwest China has resulted in considerable  economic growth. The region now boosts thousands of exporting  enterprises which are getting increasing numbers of overseas  production orders. Given the situation, the six southwest  provinces and regions joined hands in establishing the Xinan  Appraisal Center on the quality system of export-manufacturing  enterprises to push for the IS09000-series international  standard, which will link the region with the 50 countries that  adopt this standard.    Experts claim that the center is the largest appraisal  center  covering the widest geographic area among the 20 so far  registered in China. It will effectively promote the quality  management of exporting enterprises in the southwest region and  increase the competitiveness of their products.</p>

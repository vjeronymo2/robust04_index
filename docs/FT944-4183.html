			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Observer: To the dogs All right, so it is the wrong Morgan that is in 'merger' talks with SG Warburg. While everyone was squinting stage left in the direction of JP Morgan, enter stage right the boys from Morgan Stanley. The latter had even helpfully sent up a smoke signal last month by taking another 350,000 square feet on the Isle of Dogs. Pity no one thought to ask the Americans how they intended to fill the pristine new space. So, while a large number of Warburgers were yesterday wondering whose graphology test they should now be sitting, the more securely seated looked yet more anxious - at the dreadful possibility of having to operate from Canary Wharf. Morgan Stanley president John Mack may wax lyrical to anyone who'll listen on the subject of his marvellous London premises - but he works in New York. At least the Corporation of London will be fighting the reluctant commuters' corner, though. Having probably lost BZW's dealing floor to Docklands, the Corporation will be mustard keen to keep Warburgs, or whatever it is called.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by JORDAN TIMES staff reporter Nirmin Murad] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--His Majesty King Husayn said Saturday [16  April] that Jordan only recognises the Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) as the sole legitimate representative of the  Palestinian people and as such will not allow any other  Palestinian group to operate from Jordanian territory.    The King said the government had decided that the Islamic  Resistance Movement, Hamas, had been operating illegally in  Jordan before Israeli Prime Minister Yizhaq Rabin discussed the  issue in remarks he made Thursday. [passage omitted]    A senior Jordanian official who asked to remain anonymous  said the issue had been under discussion in the Cabinet since  Hamas representative in Amman Muhammad Nazzal claimed his  group's responsibility for the bus bomb attack in Hadera and had  already issued instructions to the interior Ministry to limit  Hamas operations in the Kingdom.    "The minister of interior had instructions to call the two  Hamas representtives and inform them that they were operating  here illegally before Rabin made his statements to the press  Thursday evening," the official told the Jordan Times. [passage  omitted]    Palestinian Ambassador to Jordan al-Tayyib 'Abd-al-Rahim  welcomed the King's reaffirmation that the PLO is the sole  legitimate representative of the Palestinian people in Jordan  and elsewhere.</p>

			<p>-- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY  <F P=103> OW2005051994 </F> <F P=104>  Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN </F> <F P=105>  Japanese </F> BFN     [Text] Details of a draft report on how the optical fiber  network ought to be developed to build a multimedia society,  which has been worked out by the Telecommunications Council  (chaired by Fumio Watanabe, adviser to Tokyo Marine and Fire  Insurance Co., Ltd.), an advisory panel to the post and  telecommunications minister, were revealed on 3 May. With  regard to the focal point of allotting roles between "the  government" and "the private sector," the draft report specifies  the need for the private sector to play a leading role in  developing the network, saying "it is desirable to make utmost  use of vital power of the private sector." According to the  draft report, the optical fiber network is scheduled to be  completed in 2010. The draft report urges the government to  revise related laws and to establish an assistance and loan  system to promote the use of the optical fiber network for such  services as remote medical care and education at home by 2010.  The council plans to submit a final report to the post and  telecommunications minister on 31 May after working out final  details.    The United States is an advanced nation in building the  optical fiber network, in which a large amount of demand for  related services is expected following the spread of multimedia  and software equipment. With Vice President Gore playing a  leading role, the country is promoting the national information  infrastructure (NII) project designed to make various use of the  optical fiber network. In Japan as well, there is now a growing  demand for coming up with policies that will serve as a  "guideline" for establishing the optical fiber network. For  example, people in the government, the industrial circle, and  the medical and education fields have shown strong interest in  development of the network.    The draft report is comprised of seven chapters. In the  first chapter, "The Need To Improve the Information  Communications Infrastructure," the draft report makes it a  condition for developing the optical fiber network that  "everyone everywhere in Japan is able to enjoy life at the same  level as in the most convenient place in the world, to get a  job, and to touch culture."    Moreover, in analyzing the "new media" project that drew  attention in the eighties, the draft report states that the  project failed because measures to use new media were  insufficient in creating new demands. In the seventh chapter,  it cites laws that have to be reviewed to materialize the  following services that are now regulated by laws: remote  diagnosis and medical treatment; education at home; working at  home with telecommunications; an inquiry of a witness and a  meeting of a board of directors through a teleconference system;  home shopping for medicine, rice, and real estate.    With regard to the scale of domestic markets concerned, it  predicts that business in the multimedia market as a whole will  amount to approximately 123 trillion yen in 2010. Of this  amount, the optical fiber network business is expected to reach  about 56 trillion yen.    In the sixth chapter, the draft report clearly says the  private sector should take the initiative in developing the  network. It also points out that the government's role is "to  promote necessary deregulation, to encourage highly motivated  companies' access to the business, and to emphasize improvement  of conditions based on the current move toward a fusion of  communications and broadcasting." Moreover, since the  development of the optical fiber network costs approximately 1  trillion yen every year, the draft report proposes setting up an  interest-free loan system designed to assist communications  enterprises such as NTT [Nippon Telegraph and Telephone  Corporation].    It also urges the "government" to help the private sector  develop new ways of using the optical fiber network, to bring  about the on- line system for dealing with services at the  window and public relations bulletins, and to reduce exchanges  of notes between organizations.    Noting the schedule for developing the optical fiber network  in the fourth chapter, the draft report indicates a plan to  finish installing fiber-optic lines to cover households  nationwide in 2010 when Japan's population is expected to reach  a peak. It proposes the three-step procedure for installing  fiber-optic lines: the first step is to install fiber-optic  lines in areas of cities where prefectural offices are located,  by 2000; and the second step is to install the lines in all  areas of cities with a population of over 100,000 by 2005. It  also indicates that it is necessary to install fiber-optic lines  in public organizations, including schools, libraries, and  hospitals, by 2000, in an effort to have them play a leading  role in promoting the optical fiber network.</p>

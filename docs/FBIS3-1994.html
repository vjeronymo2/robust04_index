			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Xiao Rui (5618 3843) ] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 23 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--At the  National Statistical Work Conference today, State Council Vice  Premier Zou Jiahua stressed that in today's rapidly changing  society, statistical information is a yardstick of the national  economy and social progress and that it is necessary to ensure  that statistics are accurate, timely, comprehensive, and  convenient and that accuracy takes precedence.    Zou Jiahua said: It is not very easy to ensure the accuracy  of statistics. It is a rather serious phenomenon where, for  their own advancement or transfer or for political honors or the  material interests of a small group, leaders of some localities,  departments, and units would carry out statistical tricks. Some  even retaliated against statistical personnel who dared to  uphold principles. It is necessary to tackle these negative and  corrupt practices with party discipline and state law.    He said: The socialist market economy makes new demands on  statistical work. Following the change in the form of the  state's economic management from the previous tangible,  microscopic, and direct management to intangible, macroscopic,  and indirect management, the CPC Central Committee and State  Council always encounters three questions in making  macroeconomic policy decisions and in macroeconomic regulation  and control: First, in what condition is the current national  economy and social progression? Second, how are we going to  regulate and control them if they are abnormal? Third, what  will be the effects of the macroscopic regulatory and control  measures? These three questions concern statistics at all  times. Without timely and accurate information supplied by the  statistical system and without their effective supervision, it  is difficult to make correct policy decisions for the national  economy.    Zou Jiahua said: In statistical work, we must break through  traditional statistical concepts and further reform and open up.  We should establish a statistical system that suits China's  national conditions in keeping with the general laws of the  market economy and by referring to the world's advanced  statistical science and technology. It is necessary to  radically reform statistical and surveying methods, develop  partial survey methods, and actively promote the sample  surveying method in particular. It is necessary to establish a  system of statistical and survey methods which is based on  periodic general surveys, whose main body is regular sample  surveys and which uses major surveys, scientific calculations,  and a small number of overall statistical reports in a  comprehensive way.    Zou Jiahua also stressed: Cultivating and developing an  information market and achieving the commercialization and  industrialization of information is one of the main points in  the development of a market system. Vigorously cultivating and  developing a market in statistical information is a task which  brooks no delay. Statistical departments must energetically  promote the effective circulation of social and economic  information and share it with society.</p>

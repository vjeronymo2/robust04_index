			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Private View: From exodus to Armageddon - Alexander Nathanson, a Russian immigrant to Israel, on anti-Semitism, his new life in the Jewish Motherland, and the search for employment FROM THE ruins of Armageddon came the sound of violins. The sound led to a man and woman in their fifties who stood together in the shade of a eucalyptus tree at the foot of the ancient city. They were reading from dog-eared sheet music, duets by the late 18th century composer Ignace Pleyel. Propped in front of them was a printed plastic sign 'New immigrants from USSR' and a basket containing coins. The couple said they had arrived from the Ukraine two years ago and this genteel form of busking was the only employment they had found so far. Israelis are fond of saying with a wry pride that they have enough Russian immigrant violinists to fill their national symphony ten times over. But the joke turns sour when in the centre of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv you can find whole streets full of professional musicians scraping for a living. About 350,000 Soviet Jews have landed in Israel since they were given freedom to emigrate in 1989, a number which is equivalent to 7 per cent of the country's population. The total was expected to rise to 1m by 1995 but in the past year the monthly intake has halved and halved again. At the last reported count, some 1,500 Russians had applied to go home again. Russian unemployment has given rise to scandalous tales - of university professors reduced to scavenging in dustbins, of doctors employed as hodcarriers and women teachers resorting to prostitution - and to resentment on both sides. I went to the Soviet Jewry Centre in central Jerusalem to meet Alexander Nathanson, a 50-year-old physics lecturer from Kuybyshev on the river Volga, who has been in Israel for 15 months without a job. The centre is one of 14 refuges in the city where Russians can go to keep themselves occupied. This one specialises in the arts: chamber music, jazz, drama, painting, and performances by 'the singing rabbi'. An Edith Piaf album was playing in the coffee shop. Everybody smoked. A greybeard with a profile to rival Rasputin's sat at the bar. A dark youth by the window sighed over a letter from home. Somebody was practising the saxophone in a nearby auditorium. Nathanson is tall and very shy, with big hands and a slow smile. He talked, through an interpreter, as if undergoing yet another bureaucratic interrogation: self-effacing to the point of submissiveness, polite, alert but careful to say nothing that might offend his host country. I asked him whether he had felt victimised in Russia. 'In general it was difficult for a Jew to get to university, especially to a physics faculty.' Would you have got further if you were not a Jew? 'Possibly.' In ordinary life, how did this discrimination show itself? 'I tried to get to the polytechnic and they didn't want to take me because I was a Jew. They didn't sign the reference in the Communist party committee. Only with that could you get to college.' Nathanson went to the local school and to the University of Gorki to study solid-state physics and eventually, after his two years in the Red Army, became a lecturer at a technical college. I asked him: although you suffered professional discrimination, were your neighbours friendly? 'I had a very good relationship with all my colleagues at work. But I was very surprised by something that happened some time before I came to Israel. We were discussing a photograph in a magazine and one of my friends said to another: 'Look, this man looks a bit like you]' The other answered: 'No he doesn't. Why do you compare me with some Jew?' I was very depressed. I didn't expect that reaction from him because he had been my friend for many years.' Was it because of anti-semitism that you decided to emigrate? 'It was one of the reasons. Besides, I was afraid for my children, for their future. I didn't know what was going to happen to the country.' Nathanson emigrated with his wife Alla, a piano teacher who is also looking for work, and his daughters Inna, 21, and Elina, 15. I asked him if it was his decision to leave, or his wife's. 'It was our joint decision. We thought a lot about it and then decided.' In the Soviet Union did you feel Jewish or did you feel Russian? 'I was born in Russia and my native language was Russian. I was brought up on Russian culture and literature. And of course I read the works of Russian writers and I loved them. But I never forgot that I'm a Jew and I was also aware of Jewish culture: I went to concerts of Jewish music and everything, but I am not religious.' Did you really want to go to America or some other country? Was Israel your first choice? 'We came here at the time of the Gulf War and we stopped first of all in Hungary where my wife tried to get us to some other country. But I wanted to go to Israel and insisted.' What is so special about Israel? 'We didn't have much choice. That is one of the reasons. Another important reason is that it is our national motherland.' What are your prospects of work? 'At the moment I am studying at the university, a special course for teachers of physics and mathematics. I hope that after I've finished I'll be able to find a job.' There must be many others with similar qualifications. Won't it be a problem finding work? 'Yes, I think it's a big problem at the moment. But I am also a member of the organisation of Russian scientist immigrants who try to develop their own ideas for commercial application. I hope we will manage but it's very difficult. Perhaps I will find a job in this way.' Have you done any kind of work for money here yet? 'Not yet. I've given some private lessons.' Any building work or waitering? 'No.' The Nathansons lives on 870 shekels (about Pounds 204) a month unemployment benefit and what is left over from the so-called Absorption Basket, a start-up loan which has to be repaid if the immigrant leaves Israel within five years. Do you find it depressing? 'Naturally I have spent a lot of time learning Hebrew. But I am not used to being unemployed for such a long period.' Did you know before you came how difficult life would be here? 'I did know, but I was hopeful.' Housing is as much or more of a problem in Israel as it was in Russia. Critics of the right-wing government accuse it of treating the Russian immigrants as political pawns: using their presence to justify aggressive settlement-building in the occupied West Bank instead of finding ways of absorbing them in the home economy. In Kuybyshev the Nathanson family had two large rooms. In their suburban flat in Talpiot outside Jerusalem they share three bedrooms and a sitting room with his parents-in-law and his daughter's husband. What do you most like about Israel, I asked him. 'The people and the scenery. Almost every day when we were studying the ulpan (the immigrants' crash course in Hebrew) in the north we went on excursions.' How does it compare with home? 'The biggest difference is that I am used to water. I used to live on the bank of the river and here in Jerusalem I feel there is no water. I used to go sailing with my friends every summer.' And what do you find most difficult about living here? 'The main difficulty is not knowing the language. But now things are improving. Second, the lack of friends and relatives.' Do you find the Israelis resentful because there are so many Russians here looking for work? 'You can't generalise: there are different kinds of people. I myself have mostly met people who are very nice and ready to help. Maybe there are some who are not happy about the Russians.' You've suffered no victimisation because of it? 'No.' Do you know people who have? 'I don't like blaming people without knowing the facts. You can't blame people just from something you've heard.' Have there been occasions when you have wished you had never come? 'I miss not working very much. But I have never thought of returning. We have had no discussions like that in my family.' At 50 years old it is quite late in life for such a big change, isn't it? 'Yes, of course it's very difficult. But I did it for the most part for the sake of my children. Maybe if I had been alone I wouldn't have come here.' Can you describe how living here has changed you? Do you feel a different person? 'I lived in the Soviet Union for almost 50 years and although I understood and realised many things, I was influenced by the Soviet propaganda and ideology. 'Here I feel much more free. It's a pity that I wasted a lot of time on such empty things: for example, studying the history of the Communist Party. I used to study at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism and that also was a waste of time. Now I realise it.' While in the army Nathanson was invited to join the Communist Party. He refused. 'I wasn't blind,' he said. Do you see any similarity between the way the Russians treat the Jews and the Jews treat the Arabs? 'It's very difficult to answer this question. To answer it you have to know much more about history and roots. From what I can see those Arabs who live in Israel feel very free and feel secure, while some Israelis even in their own land feel they have to be wary when they come in contact with Arabs. 'I think that to understand Israel you must live in Israel. If you are outside the country it doesn't look the same as if you live here. It's a little bit difficult.' He smiled warily. 'Everyone has his own problem in life.'</p>

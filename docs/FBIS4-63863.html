			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia insists only on political settlement between  Kiev and Simferopol, Chief of the Russian Foreign Ministry  Information and Press Department Grigoriy Karasin stated at a  briefing in Moscow Tuesday.    He confirmed that the position of Russia towards the  sovereign Republic of Crimea as an integral part of Ukraine  remained the same and was well known to the Ukrainian  leadership. He stressed that it was necessary to observe  territorial integrity and inviolability of the existing borders.  Karasin said it was also very important to respect the  sovereign will of nations. He emphasized that the parties must  refrain from the use of force.    He said Russia was concerned over tension in bilateral  relations which might emerge due to Crimea. He emphasized that  the discord between Kiev and Simferopol was a domestic Ukrainian  affair. "However, certain Ukrainian politicians are trying to  lay all responsibility at the door of 'some external forces'  meaning Russia," Karasin pointed out.    The situation in Crimea once again proves that the key  issues  of Russian-Ukrainian relations must be solved urgently, he said.    Karasin added that the current Russian-Ukrainian talks in  Moscow were focusing on these issues rather than on Crimea.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Outline of State Industrial Policy in the Nineties" -- </F> approved at the 16th Executive Meeting of the State Council on  25 March 1994]    [Text] Beijing, 22 Jun (XINHUA) -- Formulating an  industrial policy is an important means of the state to  strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control,  effectively adjust and optimize industrial structure, raise the  qualities of industries, and promote sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy. To implement the  guidelines of the 14th National Party Congress and the decision  of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  and based on the current conditions and trend of our country's  economic development, the "Outline of State Industrial Policy in  the Nineties" is herein formulated as a guide and basis for  making various industrial policies in the future.    The following principles must be observed in formulating the  state industrial policy. 1) The industrial policy must conform  to objective laws of the industrialization and modernization  process and must be in close touch with China's national  conditions and the characteristics of the changes of its  industrial structure; 2) It must accord with the requirement of  establishing a socialist market economic structure and bring  into full play the fundamental role of the market in resource  allocation under the state's macroeconomic regulation and  control; 3) It must give prominence to what is important and  concentrate efforts on resolving major issues affecting the  entire national economy; 4) It must be operable and must  primarily use economic, legal, and necessary administrative  measures to guarantee its implementation, and it must support  the development of industries and products in short supply and  restrain the development of industries and products in excessive  supply.    The major tasks to be tackled by the state's industrial  policy in the nineties are: to continue strengthening the role  of agriculture as the foundation and develop the rural economy  in an all-around way; vigorously strengthen basic industries and  strive to ameliorate the situation in which infrastructures and  basic industries lag behind to a serious degree; step up the  development of pillar industries to promote all-around  revitalization of the national economy; rationally adjust  foreign economic and trade structures to enhance the  international competitiveness of our industries; accelerate the  pace of developing high- and new-technology industries and  support the development of new industries and products; and  continue the vigorous efforts to develop tertiary industries.  At the same time, it should optimize the industrial  organization and structure, raise industries' technological  level, and make the industrial distribution more rational.  <H5>  I. Vigorously Develop Agriculture and the Rural Economy and </H5> Increase Peasants' Income    Vigorously developing agriculture and the rural economy and  increasing peasants' income are the primary task of our  country's economic development in the nineties. We must firmly  cultivate an awareness of farming as understood in the broader  sense to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry,  sideline production, and fishery in an all-around way;  vigorously develop the type of farming that provides high yields  of fine quality with maximum efficiency capable of earning  foreign exchanges; and bring the volume, variety, and quality of  farm produce to a level that will meet the demands of a nation  with a relatively comfortable standard of living and the demands  of the international market. We must rationally adjust the  rural industrial structure, actively develop secondary and  tertiary industries in the countryside, gradually shift the  surplus labor force in rural areas, and raise the overall rural  production capacity and economic efficiency to a new level.    In developing agriculture and the rural economy, it is  essential to seriously implement the policies and measures which  have already been laid down by the party Central Committee and  the State Council, and to carry out the "agricultural  development program of China for the nineties." It is necessary  to extend the term for contracting cultivated land; and to  stabilize and further improve the household contract  responsibility system with remuneration linked to output as the  main form, as well as the dual management system which combines  household with collective operations. It is necessary to  rationally restructure agricultural production organizations and  to promote new forms of production organization, such as  integration of crop cultivation, aquaculture and processing, and  integrated management of agriculture, trade and industry. It is  necessary to cultivate the rural market and to establish sound  systems of protective grain prices, of grain risk funds, and of  grain reserves. It is necessary to establish and keep improving  a socialized service system for agriculture and to form a  three-tier service network of the state, the collective, and the  local people. It is necessary to seriously protect cultivated  land, gradually establish basic farmland reservations, and  formulate relevant procedures for their management. Both the  central and the local governments should increase agricultural  investment year by year and support the industry for  agricultural production. At the same time, the peasants should  be guided to increase investment in production and encouraged to  use foreign capital in agricultural development. It is  necessary to actively use and popularize new, suitable  agricultural techniques and to advance agriculture through the  application of science and promotion of education. It is  necessary to reduce peasants' burdens and protect their  interests and legitimate rights.    While agricultural productivity is being raised, making a  rational relocation of the rural surplus labor force is an  important measure for promoting agriculture and rural economic  development and increasing peasants' income. A further step  should be taken to accelerate the development of village and  town enterprises, particularly those in the central and western  regions. It is necessary to improve planning and provide policy  guidance to bring about proper concentration of village and town  enterprises. It is necessary to make full use of and transform  existing small towns, and to build new small towns.    It is necessary to implement seriously the plan set by the  party Central Committee and the State Council for aiding the  poor, and to basically solve the problem of food and clothing  for 80 million people in poor regions within seven years.  <H5>  II. Conscientiously Strengthen Infrastructure and Basic </H5> Industries    While our infrastructure and basic industries are lagging  far  behind our economic development as a whole, efforts should be  made to resolve such a contradiction and to gradually make the  former catch up and keep pace with the latter. It is necessary  to adhere to the principle of "making overall plans and a  rational geographic distribution, giving prominence to what is  important, doing our best according to our capability, and  stressing economic efficiency" to accelerate infrastructural  construction and the development of basic industries.    In the transport industry, a higher priority should be given  to enhancing the transport capability of railroads and efforts  should be focused on the development of large transport  passages. It is necessary to take full advantage of various  conveyances, including highways, water transport, air transport,  and pipes, and to accelerate the construction of a comprehensive  transport system. The telecommunications industry should aim for  high speed, good quality, and a large scale; actively introduce  advanced world-class technology and equipment; strive to  increase the proportion of equipment produced by our own country  as soon as possible; and vigorously promote the phased-in  construction of high-speed information networks covering  selected regions. Energy industries should pursue the policy of  stressing both exploitation and conservation and ensure a  coordinated development of energy sources, the economy, and the  environment. Of them, the coal industry should accelerate the  construction of key state-owned coal mines and promote the  transformation and improvement of local mines, including  township and town mines. The petroleum industry should  stabilize the eastern region, develop the western region, find  more petroleum deposits, and make rational use of foreign  resources. The electric power industry should adhere to the  principle of considering local conditions, developing both  hydro-electric and thermo-electric power generation, and  properly developing nuclear power generation. It is necessary  to strengthen and improve existing water conservancy facilities,  make comprehensive efforts to harness selected major rivers and  lakes, prevent soil erosion, protect and rationally allocate  water resources, enhance the ability to combat floods and  droughts, and gradually solve the water supply problem of  regions and urban areas with water shortages. It is necessary  to accelerate the development of urban public utilities in  accordance with the principle of "unified planning, rational  distribution, comprehensive development, and coordinated  construction."    To accelerate the infrastructural construction and the  development of basic industries, the state will mainly adopt the  following policies: to give full play to both central  initiative and local initiative and establish a system under  which the duties of the governments at various levels are  clearly defined; to formulate specific plans for infrastructure  and basic industries and promote their healthy development; to  institute and keep improving a policy-oriented long-term  investment system and a long-term policy-lending system and  provide policy-oriented financial support to  government-encouraged construction projects; to encourage and  guide the use of private funds in the construction of  infrastructure and basic industries, and consider first the need  of infrastructural construction and the development of basic  industries when issuing shares and bonds; to expand the scale  and area of using foreign capital and encourage foreign  businessmen to make direct investment in infrastructure and  basic industries; to further harmonize the relations of prices,  give play to the important regulatory role of the pricing  mechanism, and continue and strengthen government control of the  prices of monopolized goods and services; to continue the policy  of low-priced land requisition for infrastructure and basic  industries; to spend government income from the sale of land  resources on the construction of infrastructure; and with  approval, to let investors of transport facilities enjoy higher  priority in obtaining the right to engage in real estate  development and business along communications lines and in the  vicinity of harbors and airports, as a comprehensive economic  compensation.    III. Take Active Efforts To Invigorate Pillar  Industries    We should strive to accelerate the development of the  electronic, machinery, petrochemical, automobile, and  construction industries and turn them into pillar industries for  the national economy.    The development of the machinery industry should focus on  the  manufacturing of basic machine-tools, basic spare parts, and  whole-set equipment which requires key technologies in an effort  to optimize product mix, improve its technical standard, and  enhance its market competition. The electronic industry should  speed up its modernization on the basis of manufacturing  microelectronic components and telecommunications equipment,  computers, and other newly emerging information products as the  mainstay. The petrochemical industry should make active efforts  to expand its production and enhance its technical level and  processing ability. The automobile industry should act as  quickly as possible to form a production system with fewer  plants but high production, and to establish a market where  competition is orderly, and it should increase its share of the  domestic market and competitiveness on the international market.  The construction industry should focus on housing projects in  urban and rural areas, the state's key projects, and urban  construction. It should actively build a unified, open,  competitive, and orderly market and improve the quality of  construction products.    To accelerate the development of pillar industries, the  state  will adopt the following measures: The state will formulate and  promulgate a unified industrial policy and guarantee its  implementation by legal means. The state will gradually  establish an investment and lending system which is beneficial  to the development of pillar industries. The state will also  set up a standardized mechanism enabling enterprises to have  direct access to loans. In its annual plan for issuing stocks  and bonds, the state will make priority arrangements for pillar  industries. The government will support pillar industries in  developing technologies in some important fields by providing  financial and material assistance. With the approval of the  State Council, a small number of large-scale enterprising groups  will be endorsed with a right to directly borrow and underwrite  overseas loans commensurate with their capital and income. In  accordance with international practices and articles of relevant  agreements, some products of pillar industries will be treated  as products of infant industry and given suitable protection for  a set period of time. Meanwhile, part of the domestic market  will be conditionally opened to foreign products in exchange for  key technologies and equipment.  <H5>  IV. Active Efforts Should Be Taken To Develop Foreign </H5> Economic Ties and Trade    We should continue to expand our foreign trade, actively  readjust the trade structure, bring our advantages into play,  and greatly enhance the economic performance of our exports to  facilitate and optimize the industrial structure, strengthen  international competition, and maintain the international  balance of payments.    The state encourages increasing exports of the following  products: farm and sideline products with fairly good advantages  for competition in foreign markets, products of light industry  and the textile industry, household electronic and electrical  appliances manufactured with almost matured technologies,  products with high added value and with the ability to compete  on the international markets, and high-tech products. The state  does not encourage exports in bulk of resource-type products  which are in short supply domestically. The state will  gradually reduce exports of primary products and products which  require a large amount of energy to produce. Exports of some  products will be limited or prohibited.    The state encourages importing new technologies as well as  relevant key equipments and key spare parts. It will suitably  increase imports of some primary products which are in short  supply domestically. It will assist infant industries to  accelerate the pace of importing, assimilating, and absorbing  new technologies as well as producing new equipments and key  spare parts. The state does not encourage imports of high-price  consumption products.    As far as readjusting the structure of foreign economic ties  and trade is concerned, the state will adopt the following  measures: It will bring into play the important role of the  Import and Export Bank of China and assist enterprises to  increase their export of whole-set equipment as well as  machine-tools and electrical equipment. For some products under  quantitative import or export controls, a system of bidding,  auction, and regulated distribution will be used in accordance  with the principle of economic effectiveness, fairness, and  openness. It will improve the policy which aims to promote  export of intensively processed products and high value-added  products. The state will endorse various qualified enterprises  with a right to engage in foreign trade and encourage  large-scale enterprises (groups) to set up direct sale channels  in foreign countries. The state will rationally readjust tariff  rates in accordance with its industrial policy.    V. Industrial Organization, Industrial Technology,  and Industrial Distribution    1. The policy governing industrial organizations aims at  promoting rational competition among enterprises and establising  economies of scale and cooperation between specialized  departments so that an industrial organizational structure in  line with the technological and economic characteristics of  industry and China's economic development stages can be formed.  A market structure with a small number of large enterprises  (groups) acting as the main competitors shall be formed in  industries which have pronounced effects on the development of  economies of scale; a market structure of an appropriate size  characterized by rational division of work and cooperation among  large, medium-sized, and small enterprises shall be formed in  industries which produce large quantities of spare parts and  components; and in industries where results of the development  of economies of scale are not pronounced, the development of  small enterprises should be encouraged so that a  competition-based market structure can be formed where a rather  large number of large, medium-sized, and small enterprises  coexist.    To attain the above objective, it is necessary to take the  following readjustment measures: To progressively introduce  market mechanisms and encourage rational competition among  naturally monopolistic regional industries; and to continuously  draw up standards governing the minimum production scale for  industrial enterprises and products which have pronounced  effects on the development of economies of scale. At the same  time, it is essential to break the barriers between different  regions or departments and restrict or even prohibit the  development of projects falling short of the standards set for  economies of scale so as to promote the establishment of  economies of scale. To encourage enterprises to act  independently in reorganizing themselves or forming themselves  into public- and private-owned transregional, transdepartmental,  and even transnational business conglomerates, doing so through  fair competition, merger, takeover, and holding each other's  stocks. We should accelerate the formulation of laws and  regulations governing market competition to create an external  environment favorable to fair competition among enterprises and  readjustment of enterprise organizational structure.    2. The industrial technology policy should give priority to  promoting development of applied technology, encouraging the  integration of scientific research and production, accelerating  the popularization of scientific and technological achievements,  promoting the introduction and assimilation of advanced foreign  technology, markedly improving our products' quality and  technical functions, significantly reducing energy and material  consumption as well as production cost, and striving to upgrade  the technology of Chinese industry.    The state will take the following measures to promote  technological advancement in industry: To increase all kinds of  investment in scientific and technological research and  development through various channels and gradually increase the  proportion of investment in the gross national product; to draw  up and implement technological research and development programs  significant for the development of different industries so as to  support and encourage them to assimilate and absorb advanced  imported technology and to make innovations; to strengthen  planning for high- and new-technology industries and do a good  job in building high- and new-technology development zones  approved by the state; to push forward the process of  standardization and serialization and promote the use of  international standards, advanced foreign standards, and even  stricter in-house standards for enterprises; to enhance  enterprises' ability to independently develop new products,  encourage enterprises to strengthen ties with institutes of  higher learning and scientific research, and speed up the  commercialization of scientific and technological achievements;  and to regularly publish, in the form of laws and regulations,  backward production technology and equipment that must be phased  out.    3. The main principle for the policy governing industrial  distribution is: While continuing to give play to the economic  strengths of relatively developed regions and accelerate their  development, it is necessary to aid economic development in less  developed regions and gradually narrow the gap between  economically developed regions and less developed regions. The  state supports the development of industrial belts which give  play to their natural resources and economic strengths and in  which specialized departments in various regions divide their  work and cooperate.    To gradually set up a rational pattern of industrial  distribution along the coasts, rivers, railroads, and frontiers,  large cities located along main lines of communications should  act as centers to bring along the development of major economic  regions. To achieve sustained, rapid, economic growth and better  efficiency, the eastern coastal region should utilize more  foreign capital and resources in vigorously developing an  export-oriented economy, especially technology-intensive  industries and products which have high added-value and foreign  exchange earning capability and which can economize on the  consumption of energy and raw and semifinished materials. The  central and western regions should harness their resources and  utilize the border regions' geographic proximity of opening to  the outside world in striving to develop industries and products  capitalizing on such advantages. The state will gradually shift  preferential economic policies in investments, loans, project  distribution, and foreign capital use from regions to  industries, and will give necessary assistance to major projects  for development and construction of the central and western  regions. The state will support the central and western regions  in developing village and township enterprises, and will  encourage economically developed regions to engage in joint  development, technological cooperation, regular cooperation in  related departments, and personnel exchange with the central and  western regions.    We should make the best use of circumstances to guide the  healthy development of urbanization, setting up an urban  construction system with harmoniously structured and rationally  distributed large, medium, and small cities.  <H5>  VI. The Procedures for Formulating Industrial Policies and </H5> Their Implementation    Industrial policy is made up of policies on industrial  structure, policies on industrial organization, policies on  industrial technology, policies on industrial distribution, and  other policies and regulations having an important bearing on  industrial development. To ensure the industrial policy's  scientific nature and authority as well as its effectiveness,  the following provisions on the formulation and implementation  of industrial policies are especially made:    1. State industrial policy must be decided by the State  Council. The State Planning Commission is the comprehensive  department specifically in charge of studying, formulating, and  coordinating state industrial policy. The State Planning  Commission will take the lead and coordinate with the relevant  departments in formulating various industrial policies.  Industrial policy will be implemented mainly by relevant  leading departments of their trades at the central level, with  the State Planning Commission making overall coordination.    2. A system for deliberating state industrial policy must be  established. Industrial policy and policies having an important  bearing on industrial development, which are drafted by the  relevant departments, must be examined and coordinated by the  State Planning Commission. They must go through scientific  assessment and democratic deliberation organized by the State  Planning Commission and participated in by the State Council's  relevant departments, industrial and academic circles, and  consumer organizations before they are submitted by the State  Planning Commission together with the relevant departments to  the State Council for approval, promulgation, and implementation.    3. A system for guaranteeing the implementation of the state  industrial policy must be established. Planning, finance,  banking, tax, domestic and foreign trade, tariff, security  market supervision, industry and commerce administration, state  asset management, and other economic management departments must  earnestly implement state industrial policy and must coordinate  with the State Planning Commission before formulating a major  policy concerning industrial development.    4. A system for supervising, inspecting, and evaluating  state industrial policy must be established. The State Planning  Commission together with the relevant departments are  responsible for supervising, inspecting, and analyzing the  implementation of industrial policy; for making periodical  reports to the State Council on the progress and results in the  implementation; and for making suggestions for improvement based  on changes in the economic situation and industrial structure.    5. Local people's governments at the provincial level must,  on the basis of this outline's requirements and in the light of  the realities in each locality, study and formulate specific  rules for implementation and report them to the State Planning  Commission for the record.    6. Based on this outline's requirements, the state will in  the near future formulate a draft industrial policy governing  the transportation, communication, construction, electronics,  machinery, and petrochemical industries, as well as on foreign  capital, foreign trade, technology, and restructuring of  industrial organizations. The State Planning Commission will be  in charge of organizing and coordinating the formulation of  policies.    7. The State Planning Commission is responsible for  interpreting this outline.    This outline will be implemented on the day of promulgation.    Appendix:  <H5>  Several Provisions Concerning the Enforcement of the </H5> Standard of Economic Scale on Fixed Asset Investment Projects  (the First Batch)    To help readjust the industrial structure and enterprise  organizational setup, to bring into full play the advantage of  economies of scale, to increase the investment returns of  construction projects, and to make Chinese products more  competitive on international markets, the following provisions  are made concerning the enforcement of the standard of economic  scale on fixed asset investment projects for a few fast-selling  products in short market supply and having relatively  conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale production:    1. The standard of economic scale for fixed asset investment  projects is referred to the reasonable construction scale for  projects that have been recently built or expanded, and have  their technology upgraded in the 1990s. The standard of  economic scale is a major component of the state industrial  policy and an important basis for reviewing and approving fixed  asset investment projects. People's governments at various  levels and all relevant departments, as well as enterprises of  all types (including foreign-funded enterprises), should comply  with the standard.    2. Construction projects meeting the standard of economic  scale still need to be submitted for examination and approval  according to the existing procedures; projects below the  standard of economic scale are, in principle, not approved.  However, special consideration will be given to construction  projects below the standard of economic scale in remote regions  with poor transport facilities and economic backwardness. In  such cases, units preparing for construction must first explain  the reasons for the construction and report them to the relevant  departments for examination and approval; and then, based on the  division of work between capital construction and technical  transformation, submit a construction project proposal and a  feasibility report, respectively, to the State Planning  Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission for  examination and approval.    3. The state encourages industrial departments, local  governments, and enterprises to cooperate in setting up limited  liability companies or limited liability stock companies to meet  the standard of economic scale for construction projects. For  projects meeting the standard of economic scale, banks should  give preferential support in terms of loans and use of foreign  exchange. With the approval of the State Council or its  authorized agency, units in charge of such projects may issue  stocks or shares to raise construction funds in accordance with  the procedures stipulated by the state.    4. The State Council shall authorize the State Planning  Commission to work together with the relevant departments in  publishing successively the standard of economic scale of  products with conspicuous returns achieved through large-scale  production, and in making timely revisions of the scale  according to the development of national economy.

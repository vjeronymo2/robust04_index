			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "End of the Diet," by Jayme Brener and Flavio </F> Pachalski, with contributions from Helio Contreiras in Rio  Janeiro]    [Text] The Army's lean years--during the Collor de Mello  administration there wasn't even enough money to feed the  troops--seem to be nearing an end. At least this is what we  infer from the plans announced last week by Army Minister  Zenildo de Lucena during a lecture at the Army General Staff  School (Eceme) in Rio de Janeiro. According to the minister,  this year the Army will get $200 million to purchase weapons and  equipment. The money is part of the $800 million that the  government is supposed to inject into the Army's bank accounts  over a four-year period. "We will not be able to leap into total  modernization, but we will get up out of the bottom of the pit  where we have been since the Collor administration," an official  who attended the Eceme lecture told ISTOE.    The military command's idea is to split this year's $200  million into two parts. Half will be used--on the domestic  market--to buy personal equipment, such as helmets. The other  half will be spent on armaments imports. One of the stars of the  transaction will be the purchase of fifty 105mm guns, the Light  Gun model made by the British firm Royal Ordnance that was used  in the Falklands War (1982) and the Gulf War (1991). Four units  had already been bought by the Army last year. Each gun costs  between $800,000 and $1.2 million and has a maximum range of 24  km, twice that of the American M-101's, the venerable survivors  of World War II that the Army now uses. Interest in the Light  Guns goes way back, but the military budget squeeze led the  government to make the purchase of the guns conditional on  extremely favorable financing over a 10-year period. Of course  the purchase did not go through.    But, attention! The deal with Royal Ordnance does not  involve  merely a potential arms purchase. "We are dreaming big," said  General Armando Paiva Chaves, president of War Materiel Industry  of Brazil (IMBEL). "We see this as a long-term relationship," a  spokesman for the British company told ISTOE in London. Royal  Ordnance has long-term experience--400 years of it, since it  descended from the first British weapons factories. Its  approaches to the Brazilian army gained new energy in 1991. The  company is aiming high; it wants to retire a good part of  Brazil's approximately 570 old 105mm guns, as well as some 155mm  guns.    The British firm and the Brazilian military really embraced  each other in 1992, when they formed the joint venture known as  South America Ordnance. There are three partners, with equal  shares: Imbel, the Schahyn Cury group and, of course, Royal  Ordnance. The objective is to use Brazilian influence in Latin  America to market British weapons. On the other hand, Royal  Ordnance's worldwide network would enable Imbel to expand its  business. The joint venture is exporting about $10 million every  year in munitions. One of its customers is the Philippines.  Malaysia and Thailand are likely to follow. All this is very  hush-hush, according to a golden rule of the explosive world of  the arms trade. On Wednesday, when the Brazilian military  command was already rubbing its palms together in contented  anticipation of the new Light Guns, Lenio Zimmer, director of  South America Ordnance, was denying that the transaction had  occurred. "We are only concerned with the technical part, we  have nothing to do with the commercial aspects," was the  justification he gave later.    There are some who say that the marriage between Royal  Ordnance and the Brazilian Army is destined to fly even higher.  For example, there could be an agreement that would write a  happy ending to the soap opera of the bankrupt Engesa  [Specialized Engineers, Inc.], the manufacturer of a good part  of the Army's vehicles and tanks. That and any other flight  would probably have as takeoff point the willingness of the  Brazilian Government to beef up the military budget. The $200  million installment that is expected to be received by December,  it is well to remember, was promised for 1993.</p>

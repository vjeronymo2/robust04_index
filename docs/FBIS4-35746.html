			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "a responsible source" within Hamas] </F>   [Text] We in the Hamas Movement have heard the statements  of 'Abbas Zaki, in which he alleged that the Hamas Movement has  agreed, in principle, to take part in what he called the  Palestinian Authority.    We state that these statements contain no truth whatsoever,  are completely fabricated, and are designed to confuse the  position of the Hamas Movement, which strongly rejects the  infamous Cairo agreement.    The source added: The Hamas Movement reiterates its  rejection of participation, in any form, in the authority of the  feeble self-rule, and that no agreement was reached to hold any  meetings with Fatah. Moreover, 'Abbas Zaki's claim that there  is a draft covenant of honor between Fatah and the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces has no truth and is designed to enhance the  ugly image of self-rule and 'Arafat's leadership following the  signing of the agreement of relinquishment in Cairo.</p>

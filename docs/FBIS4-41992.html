			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Davydov, Russian foreign economic relations </F> minister: "Russia and the EC: the Corfu Meeting"]    [Text] The agreement on partnership and cooperation  between Russia and the European Community signed by President  Yeltsin on the Greek island of Corfu can without exaggeration be  called a document without precedent for post-confrontation  Europe. After nearly two years of intense negotiations, the  main parameters and conditions for new cooperation between  Moscow and the economic union of 12 leading European states were  finally defined.    The necessity of concluding such an agreement was prompted  by  new geopolitical realities. The breakup of the USSR, the  disintegration of the socialist camp and with it of the  notorious Comecon, reoriented foreign economic activity by  Russian enterprises toward the EC. Their performance and the  condition of our economy as a whole became increasingly  dependent on access to European markets.    Today the EC is Russia's largest trade and economic partner.  In 1993 it accounted for more than 35 percent of its trade with  distant foreign lands, including 36 percent of Russian exports  and 35 percent of imports. The EC countries are the main  investor in Russia's economy while the community's market is the  main market for Russian strategic exports. We buy a substantial  part of agricultural products, machinery, and other requisite  goods in the EC.    Apparently in the future the EC region, which accounts for  more than two-fifths of world trade, will be playing the role of  Russia's leading business partner. Experts estimate that after  the Community's expansion with the Scandinavian countries and  Austria, its share in trade with Russia could increase nearly  1.5 times, reaching 44 percent. One should also not forget that  our former Comecon partners -- East European countries -- are  standing on the EC threshold and in the longer term the  Community could be joined by the Baltic states. So far only  Switzerland and Albania are the sole European states to the west  of the CIS external borders that are not asking to be admitted  "under the roof" of the Community.    In its turn Russia is the largest political and trade  partner  for the EC among the countries of the former USSR. It makes up  approximately 85 percent of EC trade with the CIS countries and  some 70 percent of all Western commitments on credit, technical  and humanitarian assistance to the former Soviet republics. In  recent months a large number of EC member states, interested in  establishing long-term links, have hastened to Russia. This  also includes investment cooperation.    At the same time, the EC's and Russia's movement toward each  other has until recently been substantially hampered by the  absence of a corresponding legal regime while trade barriers  with respect to Russian goods such as uranium and aluminum even  gave some experts cause to talk about a new "iron curtain."  After all, the agreement, inherited from the Soviet era,  between the USSR and the EC and Euratom on trade, commercial,  and economic cooperation, signed in 1989, was geared toward  interaction between fundamentally different economic systems.  It was rather primitive, addressing only matters of a trade  regime, moreover in a spirit discriminatory to Russia. Therefore  the need to conclude a new agreement that would extend to Russia  rules uniform for all Community countries has grown urgent.    What does the Corfu agreement mean for Russia? One of the  conditions enshrined in it is the creation, after 1998, of a  zone of free trade with the EC. This involves not only a free  flow of goods but also freedom of incorporation, trade in  services, and capital movement. It is also important that the  EC has recognized Russia as a country with a transitional  economy, abandoning its treatment as a country with a state  trade system. This underlies the EC's abolition of former tough  trade discrimination. Furthermore, for the first time in  international legal practice, Russia, which is not a party to  GATT, has managed to incorporate into the agreement direct  references to a number of its key provisions. As a result, the  EC will fully lift quotas on imports from Russia which up until  recently covered more than 600 goods.    As far as the political dialogue between Russia and the EC  goes, the agreement stipulates the establishment of a system of  consultations on the entire range of international and economic  problems. To this end meetings between the president of Russia  and the EC leadership will be held at least twice a year.  Dialogue at ministerial level will proceed within the framework  of a Cooperation Council to be set up. A Parliamentary  Cooperation Committee is also to be formed with deputies of the  Russian Federal Assembly and members of the Europarliament.    Today the main goal set forth by Russia at the start of  negotiations with the EC has been accomplished: Moscow has  managed to create favorable conditions for economic interaction  with the "club" of leading European countries. Russia has  stepped over the threshold of Europe.</p>

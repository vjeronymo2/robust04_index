			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UN's small farmer aid agency seeks new means of funding The Governing Council of the UN's International Fund for Agricultural Development ended a three-day meeting last week by deciding to look for new ways of funding Ifad's work because the present method has broken down. Since 1977, western and oil exporting countries belonging to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries have contributed a certain percentage of Ifad funds. These are loaned to projects to help small farmers in developing countries. But the Opec countries now want to contribute less because of declining oil prices. Western governments will tell a committee that is examining improved ways of funding Ifad, that they will contribute more if they have more voting rights. At present, the three blocs that make up the fund's membership, the West, Opec and the developing countries, each have one third of the votes. The West seems prepared to take over some of Opec's contribution, if it also takes over some of its votes. Mr Ruud Treffers of the Netherlands told the council that Ifad's present structure gave 'very few incentives for countries to increase their contributions'. He said that the Netherlands would increase its contribution if voting rights were linked more closely to contributions. While Ifad has enough money to support its work in 1994 and 1995, it will face a crisis if funds are not replenished next year. It has so far lent about Dollars 4bn for nearly 400 projects, mostly to help the poorest and most vulnerable farmers, and claims that these projects are helping farmers to grow an extra 42m tons of food a year.</p>

			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HE'S NO. 13;  </P> <P> BRUNO'S LUCK DOESN'T FIGURE TO BE ANY BETTER THAN THAT OF 12 OTHER BRITISH  HEAVYWEIGHTS SINCE 1900  </P> <P> Given the track record of his British predecessors in this century, zero for  12, the odds against Frank Bruno winning the heavyweight boxing championship at  the Las Vegas Hilton Saturday night, 7 1/2-1, look about right.  </P> <P> On the other hand, given Mike Tyson's most recent performances in the ring --  his last three opponents have lasted less than a total of seven rounds -- 90-1  might be more like it.  </P> <P> But this sunny, smiling son of London's blue-collar Wandsworth District will  nonetheless step through the ropes Saturday, becoming the 13th British  heavyweight to challenge an American for the heavyweight title in the 20th  Century. And no one predicting an upset has yet been found, not even among the  40 or so British journalists on hand.  </P> <P> "Most people back home are just hoping he can give Mike a good fight, maybe  extend him a little bit, not get embarrassed," said Colin Hart of the London  Sun.  </P> <P> Bruno has seemed quietly confident. "I'm relaxed, I'm quite confident," he  said. "I respect Mike Tyson, but I don't fear him. I respect any man who has  the courage to step through the ropes."  </P> <P> Bruno, who has 31 knockouts in his 32-2 record, is England's most popular  sports figure, according to British writers. His chiseled face is on television  and in newspapers daily. He earns a six-figure income endorsing products.  </P> <P> In England, anything this guy does is news. Last September, a nation was  transfixed as news reports came in from Jamaica, where Bruno, caught in the  200-m.p.h. winds of Hurricane Gilbert, protected his girlfriend and two  daughters with his body.  </P> <P> For the hurricane he figures to see Saturday, they say he'll earn about $3.6  million, plus what he earns from British closed-circuit and cable television.  The total could hit $6 million.  </P> <P> He's an open, affable man, who, like his opponent Saturday, spent a term or two  in what the British call a "special school." In Tyson's case, it was called  reform school.  </P> <P> Bruno's family arrived in London from Jamaica in the late 1950s. His father  died when he was 11. His mother, Lynette, is a nurse and a Pentecostal  evangelist.  </P> <P> At 27, Bruno is almost 6-foot-4 and should weigh about 225 Saturday. He was  almost that big when he was 15, and a schoolyard bully. His mother, unable to  control him, enrolled him in a "special school" outside London.  </P> <P> As British boxing writer Hugh McIlvanney put it, the school, Oak Hall, was for  youngsters "who were not yet delinquent but were heading enthusiastically in  that direction."  </P> <P> At Oak Hall, someone taught big Frank how to box. In short order, just after  Bruno turned 18, England had its youngest amateur heavyweight champion.  </P> <P> He turned pro in 1982, and knocked out his first 21 opponents. Excitement grew.  Crowds began watching his East London workouts, in a gym above a pub.  </P> <P> Then Bruno met Bonecrusher Smith in 1984, in London. In a 10-rounder, Bruno, by  all accounts, won at least seven of the first nine rounds. But he came apart in  the 10th and Smith knocked him out.  </P> <P> He knocked out four more opponents -- including Gerrie Coetzee in one round --  and earned a World Boxing Assn. title bout with Tim Witherspoon at London's  Wembley Stadium in July, 1986.  </P> <P> It was the Smith fight all over again.  </P> <P> Before 40,000, Bruno, ahead on everyone's card, was knocked out in the 11th.  </P> <P> Now you know why the odds are 7 1/2-1. When Tyson beat Smith on a decision in  1987, he won nearly every round.  </P> <P> Is there any way Bruno can pull this off and become the Englishman who finally  reverses his country's nine-decade losing streak against American heavyweight  champions?  </P> <P> Not many in England think so, but they'll love him just the same.  </P> <P> "He's so popular, I think he'll be a hero if he lasts more than 91 seconds,"  said Hart, alluding to the time it took Tyson to dispatch Michael Spinks last  June.  </P> <P> "If he goes two or three exciting rounds, that would be even better. If he  wins, they'd probably make him a duke, he'd visit Buckingham Palace . . . "  </P> <P> Despite widely held beliefs that he will lose, Bruno remains optimistic.  </P> <P> "If I paid attention to what everyone said about me, I wouldn't get out of bed  in the morning," he said.  </P> <P> Of his losses to Smith and Witherspoon, he reminds critics he's older and  stronger.  </P> <P> "I'm more of a man now than when I fought Witherspoon, mentally and  physically," he said.  </P> <P> He may stand little chance of beating Tyson Saturday night, but with most of  those he has been in contact with the last seven weeks, he would win a  unanimous popularity decision.  </P> <P> The hotel staff threw a party for him when he broke early camp in Scottsdale,  Ariz., and those there said that some of the employees shed tears when he left.  </P> <P> Things haven't been nearly that sweet at the Las Vegas Hilton, however. Bruno  was reportedly upset that his suite wasn't made up when he arrived in town,  that no limousine was provided to take him to his workouts and that the hotel  wouldn't give him a Tyson-Bruno T-shirt.  </P> <P> Honest.  </P> <P> Embarrassed, Team Bruno called a news conference, where everybody apologized.  "It just slipped out of my mouth," Bruno said.  </P> <P> Bruno would also win a beefcake decision. If no one had ever seen or heard of  either fighter, no one would bet against Bruno when they take their robes off.  </P> <P> Bruno is all lean slabs of muscle. And much taller than Tyson. He is also, most  agree, strong enough to hurt the champion, maybe to even knock him off his  feet.  </P> <P> But he couldn't do it to Smith or Witherspoon, so . . .  </P> <P> Camp Bruno talks a good fight, in the face of the odds. "I guarantee you're  going to see one of the best fights you've ever seen here in the U.S.," said  his trainer, Terry Lawless.  </P> <P> At a press conference Wednesday, after Don King had talked for 45 minutes,  Bruno stood up and spoke for one minute. "Don King makes Mike Tyson out to be  Superman, but I've got the Kryptonite, right here," he said, showing his right  fist, then sitting down.  </P> <P> Since his arrival here, Bruno has been seeing a psychiatrist, who comes to the  Hilton every day to put Bruno under hypnosis. It's a form of relaxation  therapy, Bruno's camp explains. They say the challenger was in excellent  physical shape in the bouts he lost, but that prefight tension drained him.  </P> <P> And Bruno has had plenty of time to get tense. This fight, because of the  Tyson-Robin Givens soap opera divorce and other problems, was postponed five  times.  </P> <P> Originally, it was to have been held in London. When the site was switched to  Las Vegas, the Hilton compensated British promoters, as well as Bruno. "I don't  fear any man, but I do fear losing," Bruno said. "I fear making a fool of  myself in front of millions of people."  </P> <P> That could happen, Frank.  </P> <P> This is an impressive-looking challenger, but one who stands straight up,  throws one punch at a time, exposes his chin, is slow as a statue and has a  history of wearing down in the late rounds.  </P> <P> But stop worrying, Frank. If you wind up looking foolish against this guy,  you'll have lots of company.  </P></p>

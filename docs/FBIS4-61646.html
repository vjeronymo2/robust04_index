			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Excerpt] Moscow, 8 May -- "Stability and maximum harmony  in society -- that is what the army wants," said Army General  Pavel Grachev, Russia's minister of defense, at a meeting today  with the personnel of the Tamanskaya Motorized Infantry Division  on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Russian Army  and in connection with Victory Day which, in the words of the  minister, has become a "day of spiritual unity and kinship" for  all Russians.    The Russian Army's two years had been crammed full of events  and novel tasks, the minister noted. "It has been a time for  appreciating the enormous responsibility which has been laid  upon the army," he said. "A majority of servicemen have  displayed maturity and an understanding of their purpose and of  the complex processes underway in society." "Whatever  interpretation is put on the tragic events of October 1993, it  is now clear that the military averted civil war in Russia,"  Pavel Grachev believes.    According to the minister, "there are those who try to  portray the army as weakened and bloodless and, in some cases,  as a caricature of itself, in order to discredit it." "The  reality is," in his opinion, "that the Armed Forces remain a  reliable tool of the state and a guarantor of stability in  society, in spite of the difficulties."    Replying to journalists' questions, Pavel Grachev noted  there  are now three departments -- the Ministries of Defense and  Foreign Affairs and the Security Council -- working on a  conception of a partnership between Russia and the countries of  Europe. "The president has approved what we are doing," the  defense minsiter stressed. "He set us this task a long time  ago." The proposals of experts and academics will be looked at  in the middle of May at a session of the Security Council and  then revealed on 24 May in Brussels. In his opinion, the  Partnership for Peace program is of a declaratory nature and is  void of specific proposals for cooperation and interaction  between the countries of Europe. Furthermore, the role of  Russia -- "once again denied the capacity to have thoughts and  make suggestions" -- has not been reflected in the program.  [passage omitted]</p>

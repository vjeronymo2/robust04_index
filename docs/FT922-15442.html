			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Former BNL official says US and Italy knew of loans to Iraq MR Christopher Drogoul, the man at the centre of the scandal over more than Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) of improper Iraqi loans extended by the Atlanta, Georgia, branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), has broken his silence and accused the US and Italian governments of knowing about the loans. Mr Drogoul is the former manager of the BNL Atlanta branch and his signature appears on more than Dollars 2bn of medium-term loans and letters of credit extended between 1987 and 1989. Part of the loans helped President Saddam Hussein obtain militarily useful technology from US and European companies that went into Iraq's nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile projects, according to documents obtained by the Financial Times. Mr Drogoul was indicted last year on fraud and other charges related to the loans, which were kept on a duplicate set of 'grey book' records outside the normal BNL loan authorisation system. Mr Drogoul, who has not given a press interview before, visited New York last weekend and met Il Manifesto, a small Rome-based communist newspaper. This morning's edition of the paper quotes the former BNL man as alleging that the National Security Agency (NSA), the secretive US electronic surveillance agency, intercepted the thousands of telexes between Baghdad and BNL Atlanta and thus was aware of the loans. Mr Drogoul also claims he kept two mid-level BNL executives in Rome informed of his Iraqi dealings and says the bank knew 'in general terms' of the Iraqi loans. US and Italian investigators have said in the past they believe BNL Rome had knowledge of the transactions, a charge the bank has consistently denied. Mr Drogoul does not offer any evidence of direct US government knowledge of the BNL Iraqi loans, but he traces the flow of loans from Atlanta back to 1983, when an initial US government-guaranteed Dollars 30m agricultural credit was extended by BNL Atlanta.</p>

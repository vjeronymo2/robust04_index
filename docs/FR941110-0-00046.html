			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With respect to SNFs, State-operated facilities, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA validation actions when HCFA's enforcement choice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prevails, HCFA would have the exclusive authority to settle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any case at any time prior to a final administrative law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judge hearing decision. With respect to non-State-operated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NFs or dually participating facilities or HCFA validation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveys when only the State's enforcement decision prevails,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the State would have the authority to settle any case at any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time prior to the hearing decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Closure of a Medicaid Facility and Transfer of Residents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a Remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1919(h)(2)(A)(iv) of the Act allows the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to close a Medicaid facility and transfer its residents as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an available remedy in emergency situations. This provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeared in our proposed &sect;488.226 (Closure of a Medicaid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility and transfer of residents). Notice and appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights would be in accordance with State procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 10. Other Alternative or Additional State Remedies Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Than Termination_Medicaid only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1919(h)(2)(A) allows the State to develop alternative or additional State remedies (other than denial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of payment for new admissions and State monitoring). At  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;488.228 (Alternative or additional State remedies), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that for Medicaid facilities, the State may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establish and impose alternative remedies if the State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrates to HCFA's satisfaction that the alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correcting deficiencies as the remedies of temporary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management, civil money penalties, and emergency closure of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility and transfer of residents. Regardless of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative remedies the State establishes, we proposed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they must include denial of payment for new admissions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State monitoring as remedies. We reached this conclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because section 1919(h)(2)(D) of the Act requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> denial of payment for new admissions and State monitoring be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed when a NF was found to have provided substandard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care on three consecutive standard surveys. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also required the State to include denial of payment for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> admissions because section 1919(h)(2)(C) of the Act requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this remedy be imposed on a NF that has not complied with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the participation requirements within 3 months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last day of the survey which found the facility out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the requirements. We proposed requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that these alternative or additional remedies be approved by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA and specified in the State plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 11. Selecting an Enforcement Remedy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Once a State or HCFA determines that violations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing home requirements have occurred, there is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to assess what the most effective remedy ought to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be to assure the protection of the well being of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident population. At &sect;488.208 (Choice of remedies), we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed that the survey agency or HCFA assess individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies or clusters of deficiencies first according to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following initial factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The presence or absence of immediate and serious threat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to resident health and safety;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The severity of the deficiency; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The scope of the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also proposed that, following the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment, HCFA and survey agency could consider the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following secondary factors:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The relationship of one deficiency or group (cluster)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of deficiencies to other deficiencies; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The facility's prior compliance history in general and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically with reference to the cited deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

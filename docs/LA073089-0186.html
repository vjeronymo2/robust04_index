			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: AIRPORT DEPARTURE FEES ARE A TAXING EXPERIENCE  </P> <P> Getting there may still be half the fun, but in dozens of countries around the  world, leaving can sometimes be less than pleasant.  </P> <P> It's all thanks to a hidden -- at least a poorly publicized -- travel charge  that you probably aren't even aware of until you arrive at the airport, ready  to board your plane.  </P> <P> It's called the departure tax, a nasty little addendum to the cost of your  trip.  </P> <P> Ask travelers who have just left Australia, Japan or Hong Kong, and chances are  they'll complain about being hit with some pretty heavy departure taxes.  </P> <P> And chances also are that they had no idea of the additional charge until they  arrived at the airport to leave each country.  </P> <P> There are other unhappy passengers leaving Mexico, the Bahamas, Bangladesh or  Brazil, Singapore, Sri Lanka and the Sudan who were forced to pay departure  taxes -- in local currency. More than 50 countries charge a departure tax.  </P> <P> When Japan opened Narita Airport in 1978, the government began charging a  departure tax on all passengers embarking on international flights. The charge  is 2,000 yen, about $14 U.S. A sign hanging in the airport at Puerto Vallarta,  Mexico, announces that the current departure tax is $10, "subject to change."  </P> <P> Hong Kong's departure tax used to be $120 Hong Kong (about $15 U.S.). Recently  the tax was lowered to $100 Hong Kong, still stiff at about $13 U.S.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Forced Delays  </P> <P> The problem with the departure tax goes beyond its cost. More often than not,  the fee can force delays. I'm writing from experience. On a number of occasions  I have converted my local currency back to U.S. dollars, only to be told of the  tax when I got to the airport.  </P> <P> And some passengers have missed flights because they had run out of money  before arriving at the airport to take a flight home.  </P> <P> Or they have arrived at the last minute to catch their flight home, only to  have to run to an airport bank to change their money back to local currency to  make the departure tax payment.  </P> <P> For years, the highest departure tax was imposed by Australia, which has  charged a whopping $20 Australian (about $14 U.S.).  </P> <P> The Australian government collects millions of dollars each year from people  leaving the country. Still, the revenue was not received without hundreds of  complaints by travelers through the Australian Tourist Commission.  </P> <P> After five years of fighting, the commission thought it had won the battle when  late last year the Australian government announced that the unpopular tax would  be removed.  </P> <P> It was to be replaced by a ticket tax, imposed only on tickets written in  Australia, therefore primarily affecting Australian residents.  </P> <P> But just as suddenly, the order was reversed, and the government announced that  it would keep the controversial tax. The only difference was that the tax would  be collected by the airlines instead of the government.  </P> <P> One piece of good news: The current charge has dropped to about $10 U.S.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Passenger Complaints  </P> <P> Complaints also have been lodged by passengers connecting from other countries  who had to stay overnight at Narita Airport because of airplane schedules. They  are required to pay a departure tax, whereas the tax for overnight stay at  other Japan airports is not required.  </P> <P> The departure tax in Barbados rose over the years from $6 to $10, and then two  years ago to $16 Barbados (or about $8 U.S.).  </P> <P> In Jamaica, the departure tax is $80 Jamaican or $16 U.S., double what it was  just a few years ago.  </P> <P> In many cases the tax is quietly included in the price of travel packages. As a  result, many people traveling to Jamaica never even know that they have paid a  hefty departure tax.  </P> <P> Not every country has been able to successfully maintain a departure tax. About  eight years ago, West Germany attempted to levy one.  </P> <P> "It was short-lived," said a spokesman. "Opposition from the airlines, German  residents and travelers was so strong that it practically started a  revolution." The tax was removed.  </P> <P> The airlines helped to defeat the German tax. After all, many passengers  mistakenly assume that the airlines, not the governments, are charging the tax.  </P> <P> </P> <P> International Tax  </P> <P> In many cases, the airlines are certainly collecting the taxes. Most Americans  don't know it, but a $3 international tax is included in the price of every  ticket bought to a foreign destination.  </P> <P> "Departure taxes are just something they have to live with," a spokesman for  Pan Am said. "We don't like it, but we also can't control it."  </P> <P> Some countries are so concerned about galloping inflation that they have also  begun departure taxes aimed at their own citizens who are leaving town.  </P> <P> Israel levies a 250-sheckel travel tax (about $175 U.S.) that every national  must pay before leaving the country.  </P> <P> Some countries have even tried to charge a form of arrival tax. For several  years travelers landing in Egypt were required to buy at least $150 in local  currency at airport banks before passing through customs.  </P> <P> And the visitors were told to keep their exchange receipts if they hoped to  convert their extra Egyptian pounds back to U.S. dollars at the end of their  trip.  </P> <P> But there was a Catch-22. In small print, or in some cases no print at all, was  the regulation that required visitors to spend at least $30 worth of Egyptian  pounds for each day they were in the country. Credit-card purchases didn't  count.  </P> <P> As a result, many departing Americans made the painful discovery at the Cairo  airport that they couldn't exchange their Egyptian money, that their original  exchange receipt was meaningless and that their pounds had suddenly become an  unexpected souvenir of their trip. In effect, they had paid an arrival tax and  a departure tax.  </P> <P> Thankfully, the Egyptians have eliminated the $150 purchase requirement. But  exchanging money at the end of a trip can still be a problem. Warning in Egypt:  Only exchange dollars for Egyptian pounds as you need them during your stay, or  make credit-card purchases. It will make leaving the country that much easier.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Entrance Fee Proposal  </P> <P> For a number of years, bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress to  charge an entrance fee into the United States. Under one proposed plan,  international travelers and returning citizens would be required to pay a $5  "user fee."  </P> <P> "It's a form of 'double duty,' " one angry travel agent said. "In addition, if  you think there are long lines getting through customs now, just think what it  will be like if this goes into effect."  </P></p>

			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Ministers quail as Tory lords 'do their duty': Four of the government's bills are facing serious trouble in the upper house The past, wrote LP Hartley, is another place; they do things differently there. Indeed they do, as ministers are finding to their cost in the House of Lords. Like Baroness Thatcher before him, Mr John Major is discovering that the permanent Conservative majority in the Lords does not guarantee support for Conservative legislation. The government is facing serious trouble on four bills in the upper house - an almost unprecedented scale of opposition in a chamber dominated by Conservative hereditary peers. The latest outbreak came on Tuesday, when the police and magistrates' courts bill, which implements reforms announced at October's Conservative party conference, was savaged during its second reading debate. A week earlier, the education bill, which reforms teacher training and reduces the independence of student unions, was given an almost equally rough reception. There is also unrest - stoked on Wednesday by Lord Taylor of Gosforth, the Lord Chief Justice - about some aspects of the criminal justice bill, which amends the so-called right to silence for defendants in criminal trials. And sceptical whispers are circulating on the Lords' red leather benches about sweeping new ministerial powers contained in the de-regulation bill, published on Wednesday. Modern governments are not made and broken in the Lords. But ministers are nervously aware that trouble in the upper house can spread rapidly to the Commons if not smartly checked. For the moment, Downing Street is trying hard to appear unruffled. But concern is growing, as Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, told the cabinet on Thursday. The government is most concerned about the quality of the emerging opposition, which ranges from prominent Conservative academics such as Lords Beloff and Skidelsky on the education bill to the independent Lord Knights, a former chief constable, and Lord Carr, a former Conservative home secretary, on the police bill. The most damaging criticism has come from Lord Whitelaw, Lady Thatcher's deputy prime minister, widely regarded as the former prime minister's most influential adviser until his retirement in 1988. Lord Whitelaw did not mince his words. He told the Lords: 'When I find I am anxious and concerned, surely it must be my duty to speak out firmly, and that is what I am doing.' As one senior minister put it, when a Conservative government finds that men such as Lord Whitelaw think it their duty to speak out, something is going very wrong. Lord Richard, Labour's leader in the Lords, puts the government's problems down to a mixture of arrogance and bad management. The Conservative rebellion, he says, requires little assistance from Labour. Others see the eruption of unrest as a response to the government's waning authority. 'This is a classic sign of a weak government,' says a pessimistic minister. Peers are well aware of the rumbling divisions among Conservative MPs, which have left some maverick backbenchers willing to oppose the government on almost any issue. With Mr Major's narrow Commons majority of 17, it is hard to threaten to reverse Lords defeats in the Commons when just nine rebel Conservative MPs can hold the government to ransom. However, the Lords is hamstrung by the Salisbury rules, named after the Victorian Conservative prime minister, under which peers do not oppose the principle of legislation for which the government has a manifesto mandate. But feelings are running high, as Lord Whitelaw's intervention showed. For the moment, the cabinet has decided to wait and see what happens. But peers say it is likely to take more than a few minor concessions to get the government off the hook on which it has impaled itself.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Balfour wins rail link work Balfour Beatty Civil Engineering yesterday won the Pounds 60m main contract to build the underground stations and tunnels for the Heathrow Express project, Paul Betts writes. The Pounds 300m joint project by BAA, the privatised airports group, and British Rail is to construct an express rail link between Heathrow and the centre of London. The service, scheduled to start operating in December 1997, will mean that the world's busiest international airport can be reached from Paddington Station in 16 minutes. BAA said trains would run every 15 minutes. The project would create 1,800 jobs during construction and a further 200 during operation, said Mr Rod Hoare, Heathrow Express managing director.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / PRI snatches victory from its own defeat / A look at Mexican democracy after a PAN triumph THE ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in Mexico has lost only its second election for a governorship in more than 60 years - yet, for President Carlos Salinas, the elections on Sunday could hardly have gone better. The party lost the northern border state of Chihuahua, but did so to the conservative National Action Party (PAN). This should both strengthen the government's democratic image and the faction in the PAN which is conciliatory towards the PRI. Furthermore, the PRI - in power nationally for 63 consecutive years - appears to have defeated the left-leaning Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD) for the governorship in Michoacan, home state of Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD's founder, The government's plan, said Miguel Angel Granados Chapas, a political commentator in La Jornada newspaper, has been to 'present Cardenas as an unviable option for the 1994 presidential elections by showing him incapable of leading his party to victory in his own state.' This appears to have been accomplished. Also, the weekend results should further widen the gulf between PAN and the PRD, an important government objective over the past three years. The electoral authorities report the PRI with 50.9 per cent of the vote in Michoacan, against 34 per cent for the PRD, with 76 per cent of the vote counted. In Chihuahua, the PAN has 51 per cent, against 42 per cent for the PRI, with 56 per cent counted. Mr Francisco Barrio Terrazas has claimed the governorship for the centre-right PAN, after alleging he was robbed of the job after a 1986 election. Cheering Barrio supporters took to the streets after the weekend election. Even so, the way in which the PRI defeated the PRD in Michoacan casts doubt on the government's commitment to a fairer, more open political system. Frederico Reyes Heroles, editor of the respected political magazine Este Pas, put it thus: 'The controlled media, illegitimate resources, indiscriminate support, legislation and agencies - all under the thumb of the executive and its officials - turn the (electoral) contests into fiction.' The PRD claims that the government party fiddled the electoral roll, outspent it 50:1 and, through its control of the state's electoral machinery, inflated its vote. Mr Ricardo Pascoe, PRD spokesman, described the electoral process has 'fraught with irregularities'. The PRD is still claiming victory, and post-electoral tension is expected. Widespread fraud, characteristic of previous Mexican elections, did not occur on Sunday, partly due to the government's tough new electoral law. Many of the PRD's charges of fraud are by now little more than an automatic response to its own weak electoral showing. However, the party's central complaint that it had to compete 'against the whole apparatus of the state' may have more validity. The PRI used money from Solidarity, the government's anti-poverty campaign, to undercut support for the opposition. Michoacan will receive the equivalent of Dollars 275m in Solidarity money this year, three times the national average per head. Solidarity's emblem of the national colours is almost indistinguishable from that of the ruling party. The campaign was one of the most expensive and sophisticated undertaken by the government party, which set up a huge organisation of paid and voluntary cadres, culminating in 72,000 vote-promoters, each of whom was expected to deliver 10 votes on election day. Good performers were promised free holidays. The government tried to turn the campaign into a contest between their pro-business candidate, Mr Eduardo Villasenor, and the PRD, in which it succeeded in more ways than one. While he travelled in a borrowed helicopter, or one of three aeroplanes, the PRD made do with three minivans, and some Volkswagen Beetles. Almost without exception, the media in the state supported Mr Villasenor, giving little coverage to the PRD. President Salinas seems in no hurry to dismantle the apparatus that makes it difficult to compete fairly with the government party. This month, he said that he had made 'a cautious reform, no less profound, but careful in the sense we are not going to provoke splits nor run the risk of breakages'. The president, most analysts have now concluded, has decided to preserve the PRI, not just because he fears damaging divisions, but because it has proved very effective at winning elections. The party is being reformed, with old corporate sectors being turned into regional voluntary organisations. As Michoacan showed, greater emphasis on regional, rather than corporate organisation, helps deliver the vote. Because of the PAN victory in Chihuahua, it is easier for the president to hold out against any radical reform. The conciliatory wing in charge of the PAN has won two gubernatorial elections and been handed a third governorship when fraud charges undermined a PRI victory in Guanajuato last year. As the main beneficiary of selective democracy practised by the PRI, the leaders may see no need to push for any stronger reform. The government's fear that the opposition might unite in the 1994 presidential elections on an pro-democracy crusade has receded. Instead, the opposition is likely to be divided, with the PAN celebrating its victory and the PRD mulling over the now mandatory post-electoral protests. The PRD will have to ponder its future. It has failed to win in its stronghold, where Mr Cardenas won 64 per cent of the vote in 1988. If the party's protests against electoral irregularities turn violent, the government will portray it as a disruptive, dangerous force inimical to change, further damaging its chances of recovery before 1994.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's life insurers resent role as bad guys / Outlining the effects of the Tokyo stock market collapse The collapse of the Tokyo stock market has had a humbling effect on Japanese life assurance companies, once among the most formidable investors in domestic and international markets. With unrealised gains on stock holdings eroded, life assurers, which had assets of Y140,000bn (Dollars 1,082bn) at the start of the year, are more cautious about investment. Nippon Life, the industry leader, claims that it will only allocate up to 5 per cent of new money to the stock market, and will try to reduce overall exposure. The stock and bond markets stumbled on rumours that insurance companies were selling what used to be long term holdings. 'We now seem to be the bad guys of the financial markets. . . Everybody is blaming life insurance companies for the decline in the stock, bond and real estate markets,' says Mr Hideo Kato, manager of finance and investment planning at Sumitomo Life. Mr Shigeyuki Araki, manager of investment planning at Dai-Ichi Life, denies allegations that insurance companies are selling off long-term holdings. However, with unrealised gains on stock holdings down by as much as 60 to 70 per cent at the leading life assurers, insurance companies are understandably reluctant buyers of the Tokyo market. Allocation to foreign bonds, which carry foreign exchange risk, are also being reduced sharply. The life companies, instead, want to increase corporate loans, including subordinated loans to banks. However, loan growth to corporations has been relatively slow, with industry postponing capital spending. One reason behind the shift to lower risk investment is the liberalisation of insurance dividends and policy fees, where the cartel influenced payouts to policy holders are to be freed. That may happen as early as next year. Until now, the life industry has been cushioned by substantial hidden assets. With this buffer reduced, and dividends directly reflecting return on investments, the life companies are being forced to make more rational investment choices. The sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market will affect policy dividends this year. Japanese life insurers are required to pay policyholders out of income, but as gains on tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment trusts are regarded as income rather than capital gains, policyholders will bear the brunt of the stock market crash. Mr Araki expects that life assurers will be forced to lower dividends by at least 0.25 per cent. A fall in dividends may affect the already slowing asset growth at the life insurers. Last fiscal year, assets at the leading eight companies, which surged by 15 to 20 per cent at the peak of the mid-80s, grew by 8.4 per cent to Y110,000bn. Interest rate deregulation has caused Japanese investors to regard insurance policies as savings. Life insurers cannot now take long term funds for granted and will have to anticipate large fund shifts on interest rate movements. The problems among smaller life insurers are severe. Many small companies face heavy losses on stock investments, and analysts suggest that some are drawing on reserves to maintain a dividend payment. Free competition in one of Japan's most tightly regulated financial industries may force the weaker life companies to the wall. Bail-outs by larger life assurers may be on the horizon.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary 'corruption' alleged THE Parliamentary Boundary Commission was accused of being 'corrupt' by Mr Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, in the Commons last night. There were repeated protests from the government benches when he claimed that its recommendations had been consistently biased and had resulted in an advantage of between 10 and 20 seats for the Conservative party. Mr Tony Banks, Labour member for Newham North West and a former colleague of Mr Livingstone on the now defunct Greater London Council, supported his charges. Mr Barry Porter (C Wirral South) then asked if there was any procedure for halting speeches by 'honourable members who have gone insane'. Mr Livingstone complained that the Parliamentary Boundary Commission was attempting to secure a reduction in the electorate of the London borough of Brent so that it would be entitled to only two instead of three constituencies. He said he had been 'tipped off' by a telephone call from a person employed by the Local Government Boundary Commission. He said this commission, in response to a request from the parliamentary commission, had produced proposals bringing the electorate down to 'within 100' of the required number. Mr Peter Lloyd, a home office minister, dismissed Mr Livingstone's 'fantastical assertions' about the lack of objectivity and non-partisansship of the parliamentary commission. In the general election it took 71,000 voters to elect a Conservative MP compared with 61,000 to elect a Labour MP. 'If the boundary commission were biased in favour of the Conservative party it has done an extremely poor job,' Mr Lloyd added.</p>

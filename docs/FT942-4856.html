			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Jordan and Israel in peace talks progress Jordan and Israel achieved a breakthrough in their peace talks yesterday by agreeing to implement a number of items listed on their peace 'agenda' signed last September. After two days of talks in Washington, the two countries agreed to set up a commission on boundaries and water disputes and to carry out a number of joint infrastructure and development projects. They also decided to hold future negotiations, for the first time, in either Israel or Jordan. Earlier, Mr Jawad Anani, a senior official in the Jordanian government, said the most important obstacle to better relations was the dispute over the exact demarcation of the countries' borders. The border between Jordan and Israel,pencilled out by Winston Churchill in 1922, has never been formally recognised. 'For practical reasons, we need to decide once and for all on our borders before other agreements are possible,' he said. The establishment of a joint commission to examine the disputed border has been a key Jordanian demand. The agreement came as Jordan announced a cabinet reshuffle. The current prime minister, Mr Abdel Salam al-Majali, is expected to retain his post but officials say that new faces will be brought into other positions to 'reinvigorate' the government and the new phase in the peace process. It was not clear last night who would appear in the new cabinet. The lower house of parliament has been calling for representation of MPs at cabinet level, as in previous governments, but a former minister said that this 'was doubtful'. The Jordanian/Israeli agreement includes: the construction of a road along the coastline of the Gulf of Aqaba linking Jordan, Israel and Egypt; a decision to draft an outline of future trade and economic relations, which will be co-ordinated with the Palestinians; the convening of a special sub-committee on joint tourism ventures; and co-ordination on establishing a transboundary cultural heritage park in the Rift Valley which lies along the Jordanian/Israeli border, south of the Dead Sea. The chief Israeli negotiator, Mr Eli Rubinstein, described the agreement as 'meaningful' while Jordan's ambassador to Washington, Mr Fawez Tarawneh, said it 'far exceeded our expectations'.</p>

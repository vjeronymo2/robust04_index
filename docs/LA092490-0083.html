			<p><P> September 24, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> P.F. WESTBROOK; KEY PARTNER IN L.A. LAW FIRM  </P> <P> Philip Fulmer Westbrook, key litigation partner for the O'Melveny &amp; Myers  law firm for four decades, has died. He was 70.  </P> <P> Westbrook died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of a ruptured aneurysm.  </P> <P> Born in Duluth, Minn., Westbrook earned bachelor's and law degrees at the  University of Michigan. He served as a Navy officer in World War II and joined  O'Melveny in 1947.  </P> <P> Among Westbrook's major cases was his successful defense of Occidental  Petroleum against Armour &amp; Co. in a 48-day trial over trade secrets used in  the manufacture of super-phosphoric acid.  </P> <P> "In one afternoon of cross-examination, Phil destroyed Armour's expert witness,  a key turning point in the case," recalled O'Melveny colleague Everett B.  Clary. "Interestingly, Phil had outlined the questions he intended to ask this  witness on a paper napkin during the lunch hour. . . ."  </P> <P> In his Hollywood cases, Clary said, Westbrook extricated entertainer Ricky  Nelson from a bad contract, and was fired by legendary actress Mary Pickford  when he refused to follow her orders, which he considered unethical.  </P> <P> Westbrook won $400,000 for a Philippine financier in a counter-suit against  producer Albert Zugsmith over a film that was never made, and then married his  key witness, actress Fay Spain. Miss Spain died a few years later.  </P> <P> After his semi-retirement in 1985, he served on the board of the Western Center  on Law and Poverty.  </P> <P> Before marrying Miss Spain, Westbrook had been married to Julie Chockley, the  mother of his children Stephen, Lloyd, Catherine and Lida. He is survived by  his current wife, the former Zoya Trirogoff, the four children and another son,  Joe Lazaro, and eight grandchildren.  </P> <P> Services are scheduled for 1 p.m. Sunday at Westwood Hill Congregational  Church.  </P></p>

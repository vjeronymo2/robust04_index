			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "TV Today" newscast] </F>   [Text] The top leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of  Colombia [FARC] told TV Today that they will not sabotage the 13  March elections and that they are drafting a political proposal  for the country. They also promised not to kidnap any more  mayors, but they warned that they will continue with their  military actions until they achieve a peace agreement. Because  of legal reasons we cannot transmit the voices of those who were  interviewed, but in the next report we are going to present the  basic points of their proposals.    The FARC members said they will not sabotage the next  elections and guaranteed that people will be able to vote  without any problems on 13 March. We absolutely agree the people  should be allowed to express themselves by voting for the  candidates they want as their representatives. We are not going  to sabotage the elections because we believe it is the right of  all our fellow countrymen, they said.    The FARC members note that if some politicians were withheld  it was only temporarily and only to discuss their positions. We  may decide to talk to someone as it is the only option we have.  That is part of the activities conducted by each front, they  said.    The FARC said they would continue to promote a proposal for  a  national reconstruction government. To achieve that they will  continue to carry out propaganda activities and said the  confrontation situation will continue. As long as there are no  agreements the guerrillas will continue to operate. We are  strong and have many possibilities, the FARC leaders said.    They say steps have been taken to join the National  Liberation Army, and they support the peace process between the  government and the Socialist Renewal Current. They say anything  done for peace in Colombia is fine with them.    As for possible dialogues between the National Guerrilla  Coordinating Board and the government, they say the time is not  right and that the solution to the guerrilla problem is linked  to the solution of the country's big problems.</p>

			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC RIM TALK;  </P> <P> ELOQUENT -- AND INTERESTING -- SEMINAR SPEAKERS ARE HARD TO COME BY.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of growing American interest in the Pacific Rim, more  organizations are sponsoring seminars on business opportunities in Asia. The  economies of the Pacific Rim are growing -- as a subject for conferences.  </P> <P> With the growth in conferencing comes a spate of speakers-for-hire, a growing  number of "Pac Rimmers" ready and willing to tell companies how to ride the  Asian economic tide. Some come with interesting and helpful presentations, and  others come with dull speeches and hidden agendas.  </P> <P> As the ranks of traveling Pac Rim "experts" swell, conference organizers --  faced with more and more competition for seminar dollars -- are beginning to  cast a more critical eye at podium candidates as part of an effort to identify  entertaining and informative speakers.  </P> <P> Conference organizers and leading speakers say the quality of presentations can  vary widely because the ranks of the eligible range from executives with weak  public speaking skills to university professors with little or no understanding  of the business world.  </P> <P> "Speakers can make or break a conference," said Jack Lewis, who organizes  Pacific Rim conferences for USC's International Business Education and Research  program. "An instructor must have content and good delivery skills. It doesn't  do anyone any good if a speaker is knowledgeable but doesn't know how to keep  the participants interested."  </P> <P> IBEAR, which has a tradition of preparing seminars, has produced conferences on  the Asian economies since 1985. However, many other organizations -- for  example, some management consultants, accounting firms, business chambers,  trade groups and foundations -- have only recently begun to sponsor Pac Rim  conferences. Some of the newer sponsors sometimes have difficulty getting  desired speakers, according to Richard Drobnick, an economist and director of  IBEAR.  </P> <P> </P> <P> An Invitation a Week  </P> <P> "It's a big growth industry . . . and many conferences are lousy," Drobnick  said. "Often, important people are put in a position where they don't want to  speak. They don't want to say anything controversial. That situation produces a  lot of yawns."  </P> <P> Drobnick, among the nation's most popular Pacific Rim speakers, said he gets  about one invitation per week.  </P> <P> "The demand (for speakers) has really taken off in the last couple of years,"  Drobnick said. "Sponsors want to get someone who knows something about business  in that region. That may sound silly, but it's not unusual for a conference to  present someone who doesn't know very much. In those situations, the  (speaker's) staff writes a speech."  </P> <P> IBEAR tries to ensure quality by having seminar participants grade their  conference instructors on a scale of 1 to 7 -- 7 being the top grade.  Participants rate the speakers on clarity, knowledge, organization and other  elements.  </P> <P> IBEAR administrators say participants rank most instructors in the 5-to-7  range. In most cases, IBEAR relays those grades to the speakers. However, a  small number are given low grades and are not invited to speak at subsequent  seminars, IBEAR administrators said. They said ratings are not relayed to  speakers in those cases.  </P> <P> Among those getting kudos from IBEAR and other conference organizers are two  China scholars -- William A. Fischer of the University of North Carolina and  Denis F. Simon of Tufts. Thomas Gold of the University of California-Berkeley  is rated among the best speakers on Taiwan. Yu Sang Chang of Boston University,  a specialist on Korea, also makes the "best-address" list of some sponsors.  </P> <P> The list of so-called stars has lengthened as more and more management  consultants and corporate executives join academicians on the circuit. One of  the most respected speakers in this "business world" group -- Berkeley-based  consultant Tom Lifson -- condemns those who use conferences for personal  ax-grinding.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Awkward Situation  </P> <P> "These people," Lifson said, "are not so interested in enlightening the  audience. They have ulterior motives. I've seen speakers who provide a  professional service, try to highlight the need for their service -- try to  sell their service. That's uncomfortable for the audience and embarrassing to  fellow members of the panel."  </P> <P> On the other hand, some academicians irritate their audience by presenting  theory without a practical context, according to Christopher Engholm, a San  Diego business consultant who has frequently attended conferences. Engholm, who  has business experience in China, said he sometimes chafes when a professor  focuses on studies in a narrow academic discipline, a field that only remotely  relates to business.  </P> <P> "One conference presented two graduate students who actually read their  dissertation," Engholm recalled. "After listening to a dynamic speaker, having  someone read to you can be pretty anticlimactic. Later, someone asked them a  business-related question and they couldn't give an answer.  </P> <P> "Sometimes," Engholm continued, "you get a muddle-headed academic who studies  surveys and reads the Harvard Business Review, but has very little hands-on  experience. I've seen audiences get pretty frustrated with that."  </P> <P> While conferees, conference organizers and leading seminar speakers sometimes  differ over the most redeeming qualities of a conference speaker, they all  subscribe to one philosophy: Know the audience.  </P> <P> "The best speakers have a feel for the needs of the audience," explained Diana  Rowland, author of "Japanese Business Etiquette" and a speaker. "Some make a  mistake by not speaking on the same level as the audience. You need to be  knowledgeable, but you also need to provide the information in an interesting  way."  </P> <P> Robert Sharp, a Los Angeles-based vice president at Manufacturers Hanover, said  he uses humor to get his audience to relax and be more receptive.  </P> <P> "I often tell them that the first 38 years in the (Asian) market are the  hardest," said Sharp, formerly president of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Bank  Ltd. in Tokyo. "It's important to have a touch of lightness and humor because  financial information can be boring."  </P> <P> While eloquence and wit are important to some conferees, others are more  interested in a speaker's business contacts, according to Natasha Wolniansky,  director of international programs for the New York-based American Management  Association.  </P> <P> "The smart executives come for the networking," she said. "That's the biggest  selling point for the conferences -- the opportunity to network with people who  have done business in Asia."  </P> <P> Wolniansky said she prefers to present executives from firms based in the  Pacific Basin as speakers because U.S. executives are very interested in the  views of their Asian counterparts.  </P> <P> However, Hiro Saito, a Los Angeles-based senior vice president and general  manager at Mitsui &amp; Co., said he accepts fewer speaking invitations to  Pacific Rim conferences. He said he has been losing interest because many  concentrate on broad topics -- dealing with cultural differences, for example  -- instead of nuts-and-bolts topics such as business opportunities.  </P> <P> Saito said he has seen a change in the approach of Japanese speakers at  conference gatherings.  </P> <P> "Japanese people generally are not outspoken . . . and have not been  provocative," Saito observed. "Now, the Japanese are becoming more outspoken at  these conferences."  </P></p>

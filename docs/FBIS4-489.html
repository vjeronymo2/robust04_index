			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ben Maclennan] </F>   [Text] East London April 10 SAPA -- International and local  observers were labelled "CIA agents" by a PAC [Pan-Africanist  Congress] official at a funeral in Ngangelizwe, Transkei, on  Saturday [9 April].    A schoolboy who reportedly tried to take a short cut through  the stadium where the funeral was taking place, was shot and  killed, allegedly by a PAC marshal.    The funeral, on Saturday, was of the chairman of the PAC's  Port St Johns branch, Mr Mvumelwano Mapipa, killed in a shooting  incident on the Port St Johns-Umtata road last month.    A member of the PAC's Transkei executive, Mr Victor Zamela,  told the crowd of about 300 that United Nations, international  church monitors for peace and network of independent monitors  observers in the stadium were "CIA agents", and that they were  there to foil the PAC's struggle for freedom.    Earlier, a Ngangelizwe schoolboy, Xola Jafta, was shot dead  at the stadium, allegedly by a PAC marshal.    A source said the youth had apparently been trying to take a  recognised short cut through the stadium grounds to shops on the  other side, and got into an argument with a marshal. "This PAC  marshal took a gun and shot him right in the chest," he said.    When the police were summoned, the marshals fled, and the  PAC  leadership made no attempt to help the police, the source said.  Jafta was dead on arrival at Umtata hospital, he said.    Speakers at the ceremony also claimed the ANC was  responsible  for Mr Mapipa's death, and attacked Transkei ruler Major General  Bantu Holomisa, saying the PAC had protected Transkei and now  Transkei was turning against them.    The comments came only two days after IEC [Independent  Electoral Commission]-brokered peace talks in Umtata between the  ANC and PAC.    The talks, called to halt months of violence in the Port St  Johns area, ended with a commitment from both sides to an  immediate truce, and to a peace summit.</p>

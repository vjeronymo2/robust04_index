			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / World Trade News: Dutch trade mission visits Vietnam today THE NETHERLANDS deputy trade minister Yvonne van Rooy is due to arrive in Vietnam today as head of the first high-level Dutch trade mission to visit this south-east Asian nation, the government said yesterday, AP reports from The Hague. Ms Van Rooy takes with her representatives from about 50 companies in the agricultural, construction, chemical and banking sectors, according to a ministry statement. The delegation will travel to Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City during the seven-day visit, the statement added. 'The aim of the mission is to intensify bilateral economic relations and strengthen the position of Dutch trade and investment companies in Vietnam,' it went on. The Netherlands and other western countries have shown growing interest recently in doing business in Vietnam as a consequence of Hanoi's free market reforms and indications that the US trade embargo will be lifted fairly soon. In 1990, Vietnam, a nation of 64m people, relied on communist countries for 85 per cent of its imports. The Dutch trade mission is being added on to the start of a visit to Indonesia, a former Dutch colony, scheduled to begin April 30. Ms Van Rooy has appointments with the Vietnamese ministers for trade and tourism, transport and communications and agriculture. A meeting is also planned with the chairmen of the state planning and investment committees.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Back at You: Environmental activist Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald and Nancy  Reagan, has taken to TV to blast her father's presidency. On an episode of "A  Current Affair" airing today, Davis says: "My sense of grief and helplessness  increased when I learned that the Reagan Administration had allowed 20,500  dolphins a year to be killed." But in an unrelated magazine interview in which  the former President took on critics of his wife, Reagan said: "People in the  political world who want to whack away will do so if they can also find a  family member to lay it on."  </P> <P> Moving Day: Signs of the Middle East crisis turn up in the strangest places.  Early Wednesday a Hertz rental truck pulled onto the sidewalk at the Four  Seasons Hotel in Washington, D.C., and movers began loading at least 100 pieces  of luggage as Saudi Prince Turki Bin Faisal and his family cut short their  vacation to return home. The prince had taken over 13 rooms at the expensive  hotel.  </P> <P> North's Never: Iran-Contra figure Oliver North says he has no plans to run for  public office. North said in a Virginia newspaper Wednesday that he has formed  a foundation to air political issues, adding: "I have no political aspirations  of my own." But he concluded: "My daddy used to tell me, 'Never say never.' "  </P> <P> Revelations: Kitty Dukakis said in her book, "Now You Know," that she turned to  her addictions in panic in 1988 when she realized her husband, Michael Dukakis,  might be President. "On a typical day, I would rise, wait till my husband left,  and by 9 o'clock in the morning, cancel all my appointments. I would go to the  liquor cabinet in the dining room, measure out three or four ounces of straight  spirits, and drink it down. Then I'd go upstairs, shut the blinds, unplug the  phone, and read until I passed out."  </P></p>

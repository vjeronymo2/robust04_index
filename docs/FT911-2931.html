			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Compaq shares dive on second-quarter results warning COMPAQ Computer's stock price dropped sharply yesterday when the company said second-quarter earnings were expected to be below those of the same period last year, primarily because of the impact of the strengthening dollar on overseas profits. Compaq's share price dropped from a Wednesday close of Dollars 61 7/8 to trade at Dollars 52 1/4 by the close yesterday in New York. First-quarter earnings, reported yesterday, were Dollars 114m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, up 24 per cent from Dollars 9m, or Dollars 1.06, a year ago. The earnings were at the low end of analysts' projections. First-quarter revenues rose 11 per cent to Dollars 971m from Dollars 872m a year ago. Compaq warned that second-quarter earnings would be below those of the quarter last year when earnings were Dollars 104.3m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, on revenues of Dollars 862m. During the first quarter, international revenues rose 16 per cent, while US revenues rose by 5 per cent, Compaq said. Foreign sales accounted for 59 per cent of the company's revenues. 'The rising value of the US dollar may have an adverse effect on revenues and profits in the second quarter,' said Mr Rod Canion, Compaq president and chief executive.</p>

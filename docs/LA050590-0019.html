			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE FLOWER-ARRANGEMENT ART OF JAPAN BLOOMS WITH HELP OF SAN DIEGO SENSEI  </P> <P> Sadako Oehler has tried for years to promote Japanese culture in San Diego  through flower arrangements.  </P> <P> Oehler has studied ikebana, a highly structured form of Japanese flower  arranging, since she was a 12-year-old girl in Japan.  </P> <P> In 1947, after graduating from the Ikenobo Art Institute in Kyoto, Japan, she  began teaching the art to others, first in Japan and, after 1959, in San Diego.  </P> <P> She is now the chief instructor (sensei) of what has become the popular Ikenobo  Ikebana chapter in San Diego. Today, the chapter which she founded, celebrates  its 15th anniversary at the Marriott Hotel next to Seaport Village.  </P> <P> "It was particularly gratifying to see the chapter established, since it was a  dream started in 1959 when I first arrived in San Diego and started teaching  floral arrangements," Oehler said.  </P> <P> As part of the anniversary celebration, Muneo Nakamura, a professor from the  Ikenobo Art Institute in Japan, will today demonstrate the finer points of  stylized flower arrangement at the Marriot.  </P> <P> Friday, the professor demonstrated Ikenobo technique at one of the classes  Oehler teaches in Balboa Park three times a month.  </P> <P> "When arranging flowers, we pay attention to the natural characteristics of  plants," Nakamura said through an interpreter. "In Ikenobo, how materials grow  in nature is an essential characteristic, and the arrangement should bring out  their natural characteristics. Some plants grow curved and some grow straight."  </P> <P> There are three styles of Ikenobo, rikka, which is an upright style depicting a  landscape; shoka, a traditional and modern form that uses one to three plants,  and jiyuka, or freestyle.  </P> <P> The different styles must have harmony or balance for the plants to interact or  respond to each other, Nakamura said. He compared flower arranging to making a  cup of coffee.  </P> <P> "First the coffee is black, it is good but bitter, sugar is added to make it  taste better, and milk is added for good harmony and you have a perfect cup of  coffee," Nakamura said. "You use three different materials for a good cup of  coffee. In flower arranging, you don't throw three materials together, you use  plants that work well together as the materials do in a cup of coffee."  </P> <P> In his shoka arrangement, Nakamura chose three plants with different shapes,  colors and characteristics. He put the bird of paradise in the vase first  because it was the central piece due to its beauty and brilliant orange. The  privet was chosen for its light green, which contrasted with the slender yellow  iris.  </P> <P> The headmaster of Ikenobo School in Japan, described the art of flower  arranging this way:  </P> <P> "The moment a flower is cut, it severs all ties with nature. The time when that  flower is about to be placed in a vase, there comes a moment when the soul of  the flower and the soul of the ikebana-lover merge into one full being set  aflame. That's the moment when the life of ikebana makes its new birth."  </P></p>

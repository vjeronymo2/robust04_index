			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CLOTHING SOUGHT FOR HOMELESS YOUTHS  </P> <P> An organization that counsels homeless youths launched a drive Wednesday in Los  Angeles to collect warm clothing and blankets for some of the estimated 10,000  runaways and other displaced young people living on the streets.  </P> <P> "A lot of times the kids who come from other states aren't prepared because  they think it never gets cold in Los Angeles, and they have just a handful of  clothing on their back," said June Reese, a spokeswoman for Covenant House.  </P> <P> During a news conference at the group's Hollywood headquarters, Supervisor Mike  Antonovich urged residents to bring blankets, sweaters, scarfs and other warm  clothing to any of 14 county Community Services Center for distribution.  </P></p>

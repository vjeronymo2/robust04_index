			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / UK Company News: GR to become investment company GR (Holdings), the leisure, property and sheepskin processing company, is being transformed into an investment vehicle by its control-ling shareholders, Mr Anthony Stalbrow and Mr John Stalbrow. Through a specially created company, A Stanford, they are making an agreed bid at 64p a share, which values the company at Pounds 8.43m. Stanford has acquired the Stalbrow's 51.1 per cent holding in GR and the offer has been accepted in respect of a further 16.5 per cent. GR's shares were unchanged yesterday at 64p. The move continues an ongoing process at GR where the traditional trading activities have declined so that now only 40 per cent of current assets are deployed in this area, the balance being used in securities and property. In March, GR reported increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 216,882 (Pounds 124,753) for the six months to December 31.</p>

Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito told a press conference  that it is "somewhat inadequate" to say Hata is responsible in  overseeing the framework talks because three government  ministries are in charge of three fields in the talks. But Hata  will naturally fulfill his role as the foreign minister and  deputy prime minister, Saito said.    Saito said if subcabinet-level talks fail to reach accords  by  the time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President  Bill Clinton meet on Friday, the Japanese negotiators may ask  for Hata's judgment. But it is still unclear if Hata will  directly take part in negotiations, he said.    The U.S. Trade Representative's Office issued a statement  Friday saying Hata is responsible for the bilateral negotiations  and that Trade Representative Mickey Kantor will be in contact  with Hata "on a daily basis" in the coming days.    Japan and the United States remain at loggerheads over a  U.S.  demand that "objective criteria" be set to gauge foreign access  to Japan's markets. The two sides will reopen subcabinet-level  talks in Washington Monday in a last-ditch effort to wrap up the  talks before Friday's summit in Washington.    Tokyo and Washington are expected to draw up a progress  report on the framework talks, initialed in July, in time for  the summit.</p>

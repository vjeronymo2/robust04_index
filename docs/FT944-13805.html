			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Samsung and 'fortress Europe' factor Sir, Your leader, 'Inward &amp; upward' (October 18), makes the point that one of the reasons Samsung is investing in Cleveland is the UK's membership of the European Union. That is true as far as it goes. But, as you reported on the front page the same day, the real EU-related factor in Samsung's decision, according to Mr Chan Bea, UK managing director, was to counter 'possible anti-dumping measures by the EU'. The decision therefore seems to be another triumph for proponents of 'fortress Europe'. The question your leader did not address is how much damage to Europe and, indeed, the world economy - and therefore to UK interests - the fortress Europe doctrine is causing. Ian Milne, director, The European Foundation, 61 Pall Mall, London SW1Y 5HZ</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Electric advances HONGKONG Electric, the monopoly supplier of electricity to Hong Kong Island controlled by Hutchison Whampoa, has reported earnings net of tax and transfers to a government scheme of control, up 17.6 per cent to HKDollars 2.3bn (USDollars 298m) in the year to December 1991 from HKDollars 1.9bn in 1990. This performance was achieved on turnover up 12.2 per cent to HKDollars 4.86bn from HKDollars 4.33bn. A final dividend of 44 cents was declared which, with the interim of 26 cents, makes 70 cents for the year - up 15 per cent on 1990's 61 cents. Mr Simon Murray, the company's chairman, said barring unforeseen circumstances he anticipated a similar growth in profits and dividends in 1992. He said that in 1991 the company's electricity sales had risen 5.8 per cent over 1990. This was in line with the company's long-term forecast of 5 per cent to 7 per cent growth in electricity demand on Hong Kong Island. Mr Murray said that Hongkong Electric's 1990-95 HKDollars 15bn capital spending programme was continuing. During the first half of this year the company planned to commission a new 350 MW coal fired power station  - Lama Unit 6 - which it has been testing since December. Later in the year it will begin its Lama Stage III expansion plan which calls for the construction of the company's next 350 MW coal fired unit. Mr Murray said the company's property development was proceeding well and that these activities made a useful contribution to profits, although the land bank of one of its associates, Secan, will only contribute for the next four years.</p>

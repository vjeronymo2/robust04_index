			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Granada gives commitment on programming Top Granada executives yesterday gave formal commitments that the company will remain a producer of properly funded programmes. The undertaking were given by Mr Alex Bertstein, chairman of Granada and Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, at a meeting with Mr George Russell, chairman of the Independent Television Commission and Mr David Glencross, ITC chief executive. The meeting followed widespread concern after Mr Robinson sought the resignation of Mr David Plowright, executive chairman of Granada Television. The ITC said last night that the Granada executives confirmed that the company would remain a producer-broadcaster, making rather than commissioning most of its work. Programme commitments would also be properly resourced.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Radio ACIR Program Director Guillermo Ochoa from </F> the "Panorama" newscast]    [Text] A man armed with a .38 caliber gun was arrested  yesterday during the event to nominate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de  Leon as the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential  candidate. Members of the presidential general staff arrested  the man just a few steps from the multiple purpose room where  the appointment was announced. The man's name is Miguel Angel  Bernal Vargas and he was taken to the Attorney General's Office  7th Agency located at the Cuahtemoc Station.    Bernal Vargas said he is a member of the General Secretariat  of Safety and Roads, and that his mission was to an act as an  ear in the event. He was disguised, sorry to say, wearing a  jacket with many pockets, like the ones used by photographers  and hunters. These jackets are useful as they can hold film and  other supplies in all the pockets. That is the way this  individual was disguised.    Inasmuch as persons entering the hall were being searched,  it  was discovered this man was carrying a .38 caliber gun in a  small bag. He was arrested and turned over to the 7th Police  Station [as heard]. Mr. Lievano Sanchez, PRI secretary of  information and propaganda, confirmed the arrest of this man,  who claimed he was acting as an ear.    This is a regrettable practice of some government offices  and  people, and even the Federal Army. They send individuals  disguised as photographers to certain events so that they can  prepare a detailed report on not only what was said, for example  in a news conference, but also of the reactions, attitudes, and  so forth. They prepare very special reports for certain people  or certain offices. They simply carry a recorder or a  photographer's jacket and are sent to these events. Sometimes,  they carry a recorder and pose as radio reporters, other times,  they carry a camera and pose as photographers. They mingle with  the rest of the reporters and then go and present their private  reports.    Unfortunately, this is a method frequently used by  government  offices. In this case, who knows who sent this ear, but he must  not be very intelligent because the ear was carrying a gun to  cover an event of this type. This is unbelievable, truly  unbelievable.</p>

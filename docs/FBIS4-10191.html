			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 7 April.    The increase in interest rates on the U.S. market, and the  expectations that this rate will continue to grow, has prompted  foreign investors to withdraw approximately $1 billion from the  Brazilian stock market in one week. The decision has also  affected the Brazilian foreign debt, as higher interest will  make debt certificates more expensive. (Sao Paulo FOLHA DE SAO  PAULO in Portuguese 5 Apr 94 Section 2 p 1)    The Sao Paulo stock market yesterday registered its sharpest  drop of the year (10.5 percent), with losses estimated at  between $12 and $16.5 billion.

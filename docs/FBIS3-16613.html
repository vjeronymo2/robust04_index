At a meeting in Riga Thursday the Latvian Council for TV and  Radio Broadcasting decided to notify Ostankino that if by April  4 the debt for the 1st quarter is not repaid to Latvia, it will  immediately consider cutting off the transmission of Ostankino  TV programs on its territory.    So far, Ostankino has paid to the Latvian Council for TV and  Radio Broadcasting only one third of the agreed amount.    Chairman of the Council Zigmunds Skujins said at the meeting  that it is impossible to meet the demand of the second major  faction of the Latvian parliament, the Movement for National  Independence of Latvia, that the transmission of some Ostankino  programs be stopped for political reasons.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FASHION 89;  </P> <P> WORKING WARDROBE;  </P> <P> CLOTHES TRANSFORM IMAGE OF A WOMAN CLIMBING UP THE CORPORATE LADDER  </P> <P> The upwardly mobile look doesn't come easily. Or inexpensively. But it can pay  off, as it did for Tess, the lead character in "Working Girl." She's the  "Rocky" of the secretarial set, a woman who fights her way up from messy to  marvelous by restyling her hair, dumping her makeup and wearing her boss's  aggressively elegant, high-ticket clothes.  </P> <P> Could it happen in real life? Probably so. A former secretary exited a recent  screening of the film with one wrist held high, Rocky-like, cheering: "She did  it, she did it; she's just like me."  </P> <P> The ex-secretary says she was able to change her professional caste and  transform her image by "studying and imitating everything I could, including  upper-echelon style." Her hair is short, her clothes modern and precisely cut.  She usually shops at Bullock's Pasadena store -- "but only during sales, and  only for well-made items I can keep forever." She will not let her name be used  here because she now holds managerial rank in the local office of an upscale  national magazine, where she says everyone assumes she was born authoritative  -- and chic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sacrifices Are Required  </P> <P> Of course, hardly anyone ever is.  </P> <P> And hardly anyone, boss or assistant, can easily afford a closetful of outfits  by Giorgio Armani, Sonia Rykiel, Chanel and Calvin Klein. Most working women  can't even afford a wardrobe of good, lower-price copies. However, sacrifices  are required for success -- and buying good clothes may be one of them.  </P> <P> Presented here and on Page 4 are a few "originals" by designers whose clothes  were worn in the film, and some good-looking alternatives at somewhat lesser  prices.  </P> <P> Women who know what they're looking for can find even bigger bargains if they  wait for end-of-season sales and then splurge on the best-looking outfits they  can afford. Suits like these do not go out of style from year to year; like  wine, the best improve with age. Some even become "collectors' items."  </P> <P> But some women simply aren't knowledgeable about style. They don't know what to  look for, no matter how much money they are able to spend. For them, an  educational afternoon in a retail store, trying on such top designer labels as  Calvin Klein, Armani, Rykiel and Chanel, might be illuminating.  </P> <P> The best designers, via the clean shaping of suit jackets and the subtle  mobility of skirts, can convey an air of authority on even the most  unauthoritative type. And, fortunately, very expensive clothes are usually  imitated by dozens of manufacturers who produce them at a price level that the  masses can afford.  </P></p>

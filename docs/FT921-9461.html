			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / UK Company News: AES announces rescue plan ASSOCIATED Energy Services, the construction, household goods and industrial equipment group, shares of which have been suspended on the USM since November, yesterday unveiled a rescue plan together with an interim loss of Pounds 287,000. Turnover for the half year to May 31 was slightly ahead at Pounds 1.15m against Pounds 1.29m, but operating losses increased to Pounds 280,000 (Pounds 63,000). Losses per share were 1.04p (0.25p). The rescue plan involves a combination of capital restructuring and expansion via the acquisition of Guardian Foundations (Southern), a specialist underpinning company, and Cellular Communications Network, which distributes mobile cellular equipment. The purchase of Guardian (Southern) will be satisfied by the issue of 66.2m new shares, representing approximately 69.8 per cent of AES' enlarged share capital. The acquisition of Cellular is for an initial nominal Pounds 1 and a deferred profit related payment not exceeding Pounds 499,000. A reconstruction and reduction of the share capital is also planned. The reconstructed capital will consist of 94.9m shares of 1p each. The proposals require shareholders' approval. An extraordinary meeting is scheduled for March 5.</p>

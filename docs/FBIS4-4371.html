The reason for this foreign policy approach is rather different  from Malaya's purported original purpose in sending some 1,413  soldiers to the Congo in its first UN peacekeeping operation in  1960. Then it was to prop up a besieged UN Secretary-General in  his fledgling peacekeeping role which a small nation like Malaya  felt could blunt the edge of Cold War politics.    Today, it would seem more like the manoeuvrings of an  aspirant middle power flexing its political sinews on behalf of  itself, the Third World, the South and Islam, whichever way one  chooses to look at it.    On March 12 this year, Defence Minister Datuk Sri Najib Tun  Razak made it a point to advertise Malaysia's contribution to UN  peacekeeping operations in a ceremony bestowing a national award  to all soldiers and personnel who had served with the UN in such  operations. Some 2,555 officers and men are currently serving  in UN peacekeeping duties in Bosnia (1,512), Somalia (982),  Mozambique (19), Liberia (17), Cambodia (11), West Sahara (6),  Iraq and Kuwait (5), Angola (1) and at the UN in New York (2).    The three most prominent recent and current peacekeeping  operations in which Malaysia has been involved include actions  in Cambodia, Somalia and Bosnia. Most recently. Malaysia's UN  peacekeeping role has gained a significant fillip for better or  worse as Malbatt II (Malaysian Battalion II) in Somalia prepares  to take over from the Americans when they pull out of Mogadishu  on March 31. Today, Malaysia's foray into Bosnia-Herzegovina  represents not only its current largest involvement but arguably  its most difficult mission both from the military and political  standpoints.    In that regard, Malaysia's particular posture and current  actions in UN peacekeeping are calculated to match its vision to  become a developed country by the year 2020, which is also part  of a trajectory towards middle power status in world politics.  Notwithstanding this, in behaving as a nation-state, Malaysia  acts not merely at the direction of its leaders but is  demonstrably sensitive to and constrained by its domestic  situation and the ever-changing international environment.    The end of the Cold War has brought about a rash of UN  peacekeeping and would-be peacekeeping operations which has put  not only an unprecedented strain on the UN's budget but has also  taxed the tempers of its members.    The US-led coalition's actions against Iraq during the Gulf  War of 1991 generated angst among Muslim populations, including  Malaysians, and this has now gravitated to Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It takes little explaining as to why a country like Malaysia  has cried foul over the excruciatingly tardy pace at which the  West has deemed it fit to act with force in Bosnia, and that too  on a scale and level well below that of the action in the Gulf.  Malaysia's strident stance on the Bosnian issue stresses this  "double standard" of the West, which, it hopes, rests on  economics (the oil factor of Kuwait) and not Western  ethnocentrism or xenophobia (the birth of an Islamic Balkan  state).    Thus, it may be argued that Malaysia' involvement in the  Unprofor (the UN Protection Force) operation in Bosnia is as  much motivated by politics geared or targeted either at the  international Islamic audience or the predominantly Muslim  population at home. This is not to say that humanitarianism is  not a factor in such policies but perhaps altruism dovetails  well here with political motivation. The politics, one hastens  to add, is borne of a genuine concern with Western callousness  and double standards on human rights and its lack of  appreciation of Islamic perspectives.    In contrast, the Cambodian action which now counts among one  of the UN's successful peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations  presented no political dilemmas to Malaysia or conflict with the  West. Indeed, Asean's high profile in the Cambodian conflict as  well as in its resolution phase meant that participation in the  peacekeeping effort was almost a foregone conclusion for  Malaysia. Add to that Cambodia's geographical proximity and  potential economic links with Malaysia which have now been  firmly established through air links, banking, trade and other  flows. Two Malaysian soldiers perishing in the line of duty  (succumbing to Malaria, not the bullets of the Khmer Rouge) were  from the country's viewpoint, a small sacrifice for the winding  down of the last serious international political conflict in  Southeast Asia.    All said, Malaysia's foray into UN peacekeeping and  peacebuilding operations has been approached with calculated  expediency even as Malaysia has in a real sense taken to heart  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's call for effective  preventive diplomacy, peacemaking and peacekeeping in his  "Agenda for Peace" speech at the 1992 47th Session of the  General Assembly.    Malaysian Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed, in  his vision to turn the country into a developed country is  clearly aware that the principle of noblesse oblige applies in  domestic as well as in international affairs. The economic  development and rising affluence of Malaysia has made it  possible to pursue such a principle wherein one of the ways is  to contribute to maintaining international security. Doing so  through the UN is the least controversial and perhaps the most  prestigious approach.    In championing the cause of the Southern countries and the  Third World, it would also seem fitting that a country like  Malaysia should consciously engage in UN actions which would  otherwise come under the direct purview or control of major  powers should the smaller states opt out of them.    Indeed, as is perhaps becoming more evident in a situation  such as in Somalia, the presence of smaller powers is often less  counter- productive to that of big powers, which tend to elicit  accusations of ulterior motives. This said, one must quickly  caution that playing the role of UN policeman in these turbulent  times may certainly enhance national status but it is often a  dismal task in which the dividends are few and the frustrations  legion.</p>

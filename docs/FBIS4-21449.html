			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Josefa Gomez Navarro] </F>   [Text] The European Economic Community (EEC) and the  British Government will support the Ministry of the Environment  and Natural Resources (MARENA) in a series of major projects to  control and take pressure off the advancing agricultural  frontier in our country.    Through CADESCA, the Central American Program for the  Stabilization of the Agricultural Frontier, the EEC will support  the ministry by promoting a development project that will ease  the pressure on the agricultural frontier in the Bosawas area.    To this end, MARENA officials submitted a proposal for the  Bosawas region in which they identified the areas to be  monitored. They are the basin of the Bocay River, including  mestizo communities, the development area in what used to be  Resistencia de Ayapal, and the Sumo communities in this  800-square kilometer zone.    The project will help support the communities in awarding  land titles.    The British Government will be supporting MARENA by using  satellite photography to determine the advance of the  agricultural frontier.    Although an agreement has not yet been signed with the  British Government, the head of MARENA, Dr. Jaime Incer,  indicated that Nicaragua may have access to the service this  year.    The issue arose during a visit by the British ambassador,  who  was impressed by the amount of information handled by MARENA's  forest inventory center, Incer said.    The project will furnish regular satellite photographs of  Nicaragua, showing where forests have been burned, where trees  are being planted, etc.</p>

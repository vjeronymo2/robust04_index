After the survey, Li Tieying made  this conclusion: As an experimental city for the establishment  of the socialist market economic structure, Wuhan has the  necessary foundation, conditions, and initiative. He hoped that  Wuhan would play the Hubei card, the card of the economic belt  of the Chang Jiang's middle reaches, and the card of the entire  nation, and bring into full play its role as a comprehensive  reform experimental city.    The State Council survey team arrived in Wuhan on 1 February  for a five-day inspection of the city. While in Wuhan, Li  Tieying and the survey team members, accompanied by provincial  and Wuhan City leaders, inspected the Tianhe airport, the Wuhan  Stock Exchange Center, the Wushang Group, the Wuhan Steel and  Iron Corporation, and the 7 February Memorial Hall. While in  the Tianhe airport, Li Tieying told a comrade in charge that  this new airport must have a new mechanism. He wrote an  inscription, which reads: A high departure point, a new  structure, safety first, management first, and service first.    When Li Tieying entered the hall of the Wuhan Stock Exchange  Center, warm applause broke out. Li Tieying told a person in  charge of the stock exchange center that this center must be  managed properly according to international practice. He also  held talks with some Wuhan entrepreneurs in the Wuhan Steel and  Iron Corporation, during which he solicited their opinions on  how to form a modern enterprise system.    As early as 1984, the party Central Committee and the State  Council selected Wuhan for a comprehensive reform experimental  city of the country. This effectively stimulated the city's  reform, opening up, and economic development. In December last  year, the State Economic Structural Reform Commission formally  decided on Wuhan for a new round of comprehensive experimental  city reform, approved Wuhan's experimental program on  establishing a socialist market economic structure, and set  detailed requirements for Wuhan's reform. [passage omitted]    Li Tieying and the survey team members were of the opinion  that Wuhan's explorations of state enterprise reform, price  system reform, and market structural reform had had a certain  impact on the entire country. Wuhan comrades have really  understood that without reform, there is no way out; only reform  will bring about the sustained, speedy, and healthy development  of the economy.    Li Tieying said: Wuhan's reform corresponds with Wuhan's  actual conditions, has yielded significant results, created much  experience, and enjoys a high reputation in the country.  Wuhan's reform has important bearings on reform explorations in  hinterland cities.    Li Tieying stressed: This year is a crucial year of reform.  In line with the decision of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, the state has speeded up  establishment of the socialist market economic structure. The  purpose is to emancipate and develop productive forces and to  bring about a fine economic cycle and healthy economic  development. Wuhan's development has resulted from reform and  opening up. In the new round of reform, there will be plenty of  scope and prospects for Wuhan to display its talents.    Li Tieying pointed out: A structural transformation is a  huge systems engineering project, which requires strengthened  party and government leadership in its implementation. The  party and government should be the designers of the new  structure and the builders as well. The State Economic  Structural Reform Commission fully supports Wuhan's reform.  Hubei should be used as a stage for Wuhan comrades to act on.  [passage omitted]    Provincial and Wuhan City leaders including Guan Guangfu,  Jia  Zhijie, Hui Liangyu, Qian Yunlu, Li Daqiang, Wang Zhongnong,  Zhao Baojiang, Li Yuan, Wang Shouhai, and Li Meifang accompanied  Li Tieying and the survey team during their tour of Wuhan. Li  Tieying and the survey team also listened to reports by  provincial and Wuhan City party and government leaders.</p>

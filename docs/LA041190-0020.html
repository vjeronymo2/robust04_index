			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY RESIDENTS ASKED TO CONSERVE  </P> <P> In response to drought warnings from state water officials, the Orange County  Board of Supervisors on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution urging  residents to voluntarily cut water consumption by at least 10%.  </P> <P> The resolution urges water suppliers to push conservation proposals and asks  restaurants to post notices telling patrons that water will be served only to  those who ask for it.  </P> <P> Although the county does not have authority to enact mandatory water  restrictions, Tuesday's resolution is accompanied by a list of 10 water-saving  hints. Among other things, residents are asked to avoid watering during hot  parts of the day, to install pool covers and to avoid hosing down driveways and  sidewalks.  </P> <P> Tuesday's vote came in response to a meeting last week at which  water-conservation officials appeared before the board and asked the county to  take some action.  </P> <P> The state is in the fourth year of a drought, and even though Orange County  sits on a large underground lake that helps buffer it from shortages, officials  of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California urged the county to  join in the state's efforts to curtail usage.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 4 (AFP) -- The Red Cross Monday [4  April] postponed plans to evacuate thousands of Moslems from the  town of Prijedor following ethnic killings, citing disagreement  with Bosnian Serbs over how many people are to leave.    The announcement came from Andreas Kuhn of the International  Committee of the Red Cross after a meeting with Bosnian Serb  leader Radovan Karadzic in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Pale  near Sarajevo.    "I am not sure whether we will go back to negotiation or  we'll take other measures" to protect the Moslems of Prijedor in  western Bosnia, Kuhn said. "This is to be decided in Geneva."    Asked if the Red Cross continued with preparations for the  evacuation, Kuhn said, "We are ready and we remain ready."    The Red Cross and the United Nations had planned to begin  the  evacuation of about 6,000 people from Prijedor on Tuesday.    Moslems there fear for their lives following a massacre last  week in which 17 Moslems and three Croats were killed, UN  officials say.</p>

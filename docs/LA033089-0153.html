			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNISYS, LIKE IBM AND DIGITAL, LOWERS EARNINGS FORECAST  </P> <P> Unisys Corp. said it expects to report a loss for the first quarter, joining  two of its largest computer industry rivals in downgrading earnings estimates.  </P> <P> Unisys, the nation's third-largest computer company, estimates that it will  report a first-quarter net loss of $60 million to $80 million. It reported net  income of $149.3 million in first quarter 1988.  </P> <P> International Business Machines Corp. and Digital Equipment Corp. have said  within the past two weeks that they expect their first-quarter results to fall  below analysts' estimates, casting doubt on the strength of the computer  industry and prompting heavy slides in their share prices.  </P> <P> The company blamed several factors for the expected loss, including the costs  of a government probe of defense procurement and low shipments of its 1100  mainframe computers as customers await its new 2200 replacement series.  </P> <P> The company also said a reorganization announced in January, including the  restructuring of its U.S. computer business, would weigh on the first-quarter  results.  </P> <P> But Unisys said it believes that the loss is an aberration and that it expects  operating results to return to more normal profit levels in the second quarter.  Last year, it reported second-quarter net income of $162.3 million.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the Defense Department suspended three Unisys divisions  from doing business with the government as part of its investigation of fraud  in defense procurement. All three of the units were parts of Sperry Corp.,  which merged with Burroughs Corp. in 1986 to form Unisys.  </P> <P> Unisys said these unusual disruptive factors and continued industrywide  weakness in the U.S. computer business will result in lower than planned  first-quarter shipments.  </P> <P> It also said the first-quarter results, which it expects to report April 21,  will show the worse-than-expected effect of operational factors, including  lower production runs and inventory reduction programs.  </P> <P> But the company expects to improve operating results substantially as the year  progresses.  </P></p>

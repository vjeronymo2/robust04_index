			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / On the campaign trail - in Japan: Bush may leave Tokyo disappointed by Japanese concessions, and less able to resist protectionist pressure Mr George Bush, who arrives in Japan today on the last leg of an Asian tour, will be offered a bumper package of new year's gifts by his Japanese hosts. But whether the US president will be satisfied with his presents looks very doubtful. What Mr Bush wants is a cut in Japan's politically sensitive bilateral trade surplus - to be achieved, preferably, before this autumn's presidential election. What he will get is a mixed bag of concessions from Japanese government and industry which is unlikely to have much immediate macro-economic impact. Japanese officials and businessmen alike fear that Mr Bush may return to Washington a disappointed man and that his disappointment could rebound on Tokyo. The danger is that the president might no longer have the stomach to resist demands from Congress for electorally popular action against Japan, possibly including protectionist measures. Japanese officials are also concerned that arguments over the Dollars 40bn-a-year bilateral trade imbalance will overshadow discussion on issues such as the Uruguay Round of trade talks and the impact in Asia of the end of the Cold War. Mr Nagayo Homma, a retired professor of Tokyo University and an expert on US-Japan relations, says: 'The Japanese government is extremely worried about the likely outcome of this visit.' The concerns should be kept in perspective. Although links between the US and Japan are being put under strain, they will not be easily broken. The two countries, which together account for 40 per cent of the world's gross national product, are each other's largest trading partners. The US is the biggest recipient of Japan's foreign direct investment, accounting for nearly half the total. Politically, the partners have been bound together since the end of the Second World War. More American servicemen (46,000) are stationed in Japan than anywhere else in Asia. Japan pays for more than 40 per cent of their costs. Mr Bush and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, will spend time on the fate of the former Soviet Union and other global issues, as well as regional matters such as North Korea's nuclear weapons research programme. With great ceremony, they will sign a Tokyo declaration - a joint statement  -which will affirm the security alliance between the two nations and their common interest in world peace and prosperity. The document - appearing a few weeks after the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbour - will be presented as a symbol of all that has been achieved in trans-Pacific relations since 1941. However, there is no disguising the new strains that are emerging in the relationship, born of the fact that Japan accounts for an ever-increasing share of the income of the industrialised world, whereas America's share has been in decline for 40 years. Many Japanese are concerned about their long-time partner's economic health. Mr Miyazawa said last week that the US needed 'friendship and compassion' in its hour of need - words that some Americans may find patronising. Speaking at the Grand Shrine at Ise, the centre of Shinto, the Japanese national religion, Mr Miyazawa said that America deserved to be rewarded for helping Japan's post-war economic recovery through the transfer of technology and capital. 'It would be a loss to the entire world if the US could not fully discharge its responsibilities as the world leader because of its domestic difficulties.' The US, as the politically dominant partner in the alliance, hates to see its economic advantage ebbing way. As an avowed free-marketer, Mr Bush would prefer American companies to staunch the flow for themselves. But as a politician he cannot afford to wait much longer. Too many jobs are being lost in the US. And too many voters are blaming Japan for the losses. That is why he is touring Asia banging a drum for American business and why he is seeking from the Japanese government interventionist moves (such as pressure on carmakers to distribute imported vehicles) that he would not countenance in the US. It is a far cry from the original plans for the visit. When the trip was first considered last year, it was intended to be a celebration of the global partnership between two inseparable allies. Many internationally minded Japanese regret that Mr Bush could not come, as previously scheduled, in November. At that time the memory of the Gulf war was still fresh, and Japan was smarting from the charge that it failed to do enough to support the US-led forces in the Gulf. It was anxious to make amends. In particular, the government wanted to pass through the Diet (parliament) a controversial bill which would have allowed Japanese troops to be sent on active missions overseas, on United Nations peace-keeping operations. The bill provoked some hostility from people who feared that it would infringe the country's peace constitution and possibly trigger a resurgence of militarism. But the government rightly thought that it was an essential first step towards Japan playing a role in the world commensurate with its economic power. Professor Akihiko Tanaka of Tokyo University's Institute of Oriental Culture believes a timely visit from Mr Bush might have persuaded legislators to back the bill. In the event, a decision was postponed, and is unlikely to be made this year. Similarly, it might have been easier last year for Mr Miyazawa to speak positively about opening Japan's rice market to imports, as he is under pressure to do from his partners in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Now with the deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round only a few days away, the time for manoeuvre is very short. Mr Bush was forced to postpone his trip, partly because of events in the former Soviet Union and partly because of criticism in the US that he was spending too much time on foreign affairs, and too little fighting the recession at home. Now Japanese officials are dismayed to see him preoccupied with domestic considerations. They are concerned too that Japanese politicians, led by Mr Miyazawa, are increasingly involved with an election of their own, to be held in June, for the Diet's upper house. The deterioration in the US economy since the autumn has further soured the climate for the visit. The decision by General Motors, the carmaker, to lay off more than 70,000 people has given ammunition to Mr Bush's critics who accuse him of doing too little to protect US industry from the effects of Japanese competition. The president's opponents have pointed to the gross imbalance in auto trade between the US and Japan, with Americans importing some 1.58m Japanese-made cars in the first 11 months of last year and the Japanese buying just 28,000 from the US (13,000 of them made in America by Honda Motor, the Japanese group). In the past, the president might have shrugged off such criticism. But the seriousness of the recession has forced Mr Bush to espouse some of the rhetoric of economic interventionism. Speaking in Australia last week, Mr Bush said the purpose of his Asian tour was to secure measures from Japan to create jobs in America. Many Japanese are astonished that Mr Bush has chosen to bring with him on his tour 21 top executives of US corporations - including the heads of the Big Three carmakers, GM, Ford Motor and Chrysler Motor. Prof Tanaka says: 'It's very peculiar for the president of the most powerful nation in the world to act like a commercial salesman.' Nevertheless, Japanese officials and businessmen are doing their best to accommodate the president. While they do not like Mr Bush seemingly bringing his re-election campaign to Japan, they would like it even less if he lost the presidency to a Democrat rival, swept to power on an interventionist or protectionist ticket. Hence, the pile of gifts for Mr Bush. Top of the list is the Bank of Japan's decision on December 30 to cut the Official Discount Rate from 5 per cent to 4.5 per cent, a move which could stimulate domestic demand. The Bank of Japan has also presided over a rapid appreciation in the yen over the last few weeks to around Y124 to the US dollar - its strongest for three years. A sustained appreciation should make imports, including US goods, more popular. Mr Miyazawa will almost certainly agree to American demands for a resumption of the Structural Impediments Initiative talks - bilateral discussions about deep-rooted economic problems which first began two years ago. The prime minister may also suggest that Japan could contribute to the Superconducting Supercollider - an Dollars 8.25bn scientific research plant under construction in Mr Bush's home state of Texas, for which the US has been seeking Japanese support. Concrete action should come in the car market. Tokyo is finalising measures to deal with Mr Bush's specific demands for better market access for American companies. The government is expected to relax testing standards on imported cars. It is also exerting great pressure on Japanese carmakers to open their dealerships to foreign companies and set targets for sales of imported cars. For their part car manufacturers have already announced wide-ranging plans to increase purchases of imported parts and of locally produced components for their foreign factories. Nissan Motor, for example, plans a 150 per cent increase in imports over 1990 levels to Dollars 1.23bn in 1994 and a 200 per cent increase in local procurement to Dollars 5.4bn. However, even if these import-boosting measures succeed, the results will not be evident for some time. It has taken Mercedes Benz 50 years to build a network of 200 outlets in Japan. The Japan Automobile Dealers Association complained yesterday that it had hardly ever received an approach from US carmakers, and Japanese consumers had serious concerns about the quality of US-made vehicles. Mr Hiroshi Kume, the chairman of the Japan Auto Manufacturers Association, says bluntly: 'It's up to the customers what cars they buy.' The Japanese bristle at the claim - made most recently by Mr Bush in Australia - that Japan is partly responsible for the US's economic problems, including unemployment. 'Japanese people feel that GM's job losses are a reflection of GM's own failings, not ours,' says Prof Tanaka. The commonly held Japanese view, propounded with increasing directness, is that weaknesses in the US - such as the budget deficit, poor educational standards, insufficient investment and inadequate efforts in export markets  -are the root cause of America's economic woes. American officials do not deny the accuracy of these charges. But they counter with equally pointed attacks on continuing barriers to the entry of foreign companies into the Japanese market - notably the complexity of bureaucratic decision-making and the preference of companies in keiretsu (industrial groupings) to trade with each other at the expense of outsiders. The danger of engaging in such discussions in an election year is that Mr Bush's short-term political requirements will divert attention from the search for longer-range economic policy initiatives. As Prof Homma says: 'In Japan and the US the political will to solve serious economic problems does not exist.' Japanese officials feel that they have little choice but to try to help Mr Bush. They see him as their best hope of blocking the rise of protectionism in the US. But in spite of the Ministry of Trade and Industry's reputation for influencing industry, there are limits to its capacity for squeezing concessions from businessmen. When he returns to a US mired in recession, Mr Bush may judge that the gifts from Tokyo were too little too late.</p>

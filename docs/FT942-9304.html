			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Government irritated by Reynolds Hopes of a breakthrough in the search for peace in Northern Ireland were set back yesterday as it emerged that the upbeat tone of recent remarks by Mr Albert Reynolds had irritated London. The Irish prime minister's comment that written questions from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, about last December's UK-Irish declaration were 'answerable' was seen as unhelpful by some in the UK government because it raised expectations that the deadlock might soon be broken. But Downing Street yesterday moved towards clarifying one of the questions raised by Sinn Fein by hinting strongly that acceptance of the joint declaration was not a precondition for involvement in political talks. Downing Street said the 'primordial' requirement for Sinn Fein to enter talks was a permanent end to the IRA's armed campaign. It said this renunciation of violence was 'at the heart' of the declaration. London intends to publish the text of Sinn Fein's questions, which were forwarded by Dublin, at the same time as its comments, probably tomorrow Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, has sketched out the areas covered by the questions without giving precise details. Government sources at Westminster were yesterday playing down expectations of what might emerge from London's comments. They said many of the questions raised matters that would only be resolved after further talks between Ulster's constitutional parties. At least one of them constituted a 'trick question', since it appeared to refer to a unionist veto that the government has consistently maintained does not exist. As unionists warned of a likely upsurge in loyalist violence if the government's response to Sinn Fein was too explicit, police launched a drive against suspected loyalist terrorists in Belfast. Following the largest operation of its kind this year, police were last night questioning up to 20 people, including the suspected leader of the outlawed Ulster Defence Association. The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it had seized three submachine-guns and 300 rounds of ammunition. But the cycle of violence continued when a 35-year-old Roman Catholic man was shot and injured while making a regular weekly delivery to a shop in north Belfast. Downing Street insisted last night that the government was not 'in the business of clarification' and had only 'helped the Downing Street declaration to explain itself'. It said the exercise of commenting on the Sinn Fein document was 'no different in kind' from previous speeches. 'The fact that Sinn Fein appears to find it necessary to produce a document indicates that they and the IRA are having to justify their actions to fellow nationalists.' Mr Reynolds's comments came after unscheduled talks in the US with President Bill Clinton. The Irish prime minister said he hoped London would give the most positive response it could.</p>

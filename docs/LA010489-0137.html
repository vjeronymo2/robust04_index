			<p><P> January 4, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> U. OF CINCINNATI HIRES MAINE COACH  </P> <P> Tim Murphy, who turned around the football program at the University of Maine,  was named today as the head football coach at the University of Cincinnati.  </P> <P> "I'm foolish enough to believe that I can influence this program. We have no  place to go but up," said Murphy, 32.  </P> <P> Murphy, described as a disciplinarian and a motivator by new Cincinnati  athletic director Rick Taylor, had worked as an assistant coach for three years  under Taylor at Boston University. Murphy said he is concerned about  Cincinnati's NCAA probation and said he will work to improve the program's  image nationally.  </P> <P> Murphy, who has been the head football coach at Maine the last two seasons, was  one of two finalists for the job vacated by Dave Currey.  </P> <P> Cincinnati has had six straight losing seasons in football and has been put on  NCAA probation for violations in its football and men's basketball programs.  Currey resigned after his fifth losing season and after the NCAA sanctions were  announced.  </P></p>

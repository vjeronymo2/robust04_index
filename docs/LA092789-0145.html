			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> AMERICAN ERIC GRIFFEN ONE VICTORY AWAY FROM GOLD MEDAL IN BOXING  </P> <P> Light-flyweight Eric Griffen of Houston moved to within one victory of a gold  medal at the World Boxing Championships by outpointing Kim Dok Nam of North  Korea, 20-10.  </P> <P> Griffin took charge in the third round of the 106-pound-division bout when he  began backing Kim up with right hooks and straight lefts to the head.  </P> <P> Griffin's opponent for the championship Saturday night will be Rogelio Marcello  of Cuba.  </P> <P> The American team continued to complain about the computer scoring system under  which at least three of the five judges must record a blow for it to be scored  a point. They contended that judges were not pressing their electronic buttons  for body blows and all of the punches in combinations.  </P></p>

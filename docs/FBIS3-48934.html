In the past year, we  managed to create the conditions for achieving a just solution  to the Yugoslav crisis. We succeeded in this because our policy  has been just and based on the inalienable right of our country  and our people to protect their historical, state, and national  interests but also based on the principle of respecting the same  rights of other peoples.    Today, no one -- neither throughout the former Yugoslavia  nor  in the world -- can deny Serbia, its citizens, and the Serbian  people their persistent and lasting endeavor for peace. We can,  therefore, freely say that we quite justifiably expect that the  coming year will bring a lasting and just peace.    Great mobilization for work and economic recovery are  awaiting us in the new year. We expect the implementation of a  comprehensive economic program, on which we have been working  for some time and whose preparations have been carried out and  completed in the last few days, to commence at the beginning of  the year. This program aims to curb inflation, stimulate  production, make public expenditures and social policy rely on  realistic sources of funds, and eliminate speculations.    Everyone will have to bear some of the responsibility. This  equally refers to the governments at the federal and republican  levels, businessmen, trade unions, workers, peasants, and all  citizens. Under such conditions, our economic recovery will be  possible, and this is why resolving the amassed problems of our  economy will be focused on next year.    Along with the struggle for economic recovery, we will fight  a merciless battle against all forms of crime, because crime is  incompatible with the nature of a free and democratic society.  Serbia and its citizens and the entire Serbian nation have great  potentials for a successful economic and cultural development.  Next year will be crucial for the quick realization of these  long- term aims.    I wish you all much success and a happy New Year.</p>

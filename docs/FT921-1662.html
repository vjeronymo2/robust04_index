			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Labour considers uniting public-sector pay bodies LABOUR leaders are giving serious consideration to transforming the way in which public-sector pay is determined and, if elected, may establish a permanent public-service pay advisory commission to decide pay awards. They have also indicated that they would not abandon the current attempt to introduce performance-related pay for 500,000 civil servants. The public-service pay advisory commission, which would be fully independent of the government, would supersede the existing pay-review bodies which fix pay for nearly half of the 4m to 5m public-sector employees, including doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces. It is also committed to establishing a new pay-review body for university lecturers. The commission would bring all the existing pay-review bodies under one roof. The idea was floated in a 1990 Fabian Society pamphlet by Professor William Brown and Mr Bob Rowthorn, who suggested that the body's independence could be ensured by a governing council such as that of the conciliation service Acas, with some members being nominated by the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress. Labour officials believe that the current mix of cash-limited collective bargaining, pay formulas based on the average earnings index and pay-review bodies is unsatisfactory and is in danger of creating a 'two-tier' system - with those groups covered by collective bargaining getting left behind. Even the pay-review bodies themselves, say the officials, 'produce incredible disparities'. They are also said to be in an institutional no-man's land, being neither part of the government nor fully independent of it. The Labour manifesto commits a Kinnock government to seek 'fairer and more rational ways of determining public-sector pay within clearly defined budget limits'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, who is one of  the candidates to the presidential post in the current election  campaign, admits the possibility of two official languages --  Russian and Ukrainian, Interfax-Ukraine reports. This idea is  set forth in Kravchuk's election program, entitled "Through  Civic Accord to a Stronger State and Faster Reforms."    Observers believe that the recognition of Russian as  Ukraine's second official language will win him additional votes  in the predominantly Russian eastern and south-eastern regions.    If elected, Kravchuk will work for the adoption of a new  constitution. He favors a presidential-parliamentary form of  government which, he says, excludes the monopolization of power  by one of the authoritative branches.    Kravchuk supports the concept of unitary state with a  well-developed network of local governments and broad economic  independence of the regions. He also favors a legal settlement  of relations with Crimea. He comes out for the development of  the CIS, for a more intensive economic integration of the CIS  countries and for equitable relations with the neighbors,  including Russia.    Kravchuk attaches great importance to a radical improvement  of the investment climate and will make efforts to ensure that  Ukrainian and foreign entrepreneurs be equally interested in  making investments to the Ukrainian industry.    He is planning to accelerate the monetary reform and to  introduce the internally convertible "hryvna."    He favors the idea of lowering the bank rates, separating  the  finances of industrial enterprises from the state budget, and  accelerating privatization under state control.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Monday Interview: Blessed with a bit of luck - Edmond Alphandery, France's new economy minister, speaks to David Buchan and Alice Rawsthorn This is take-off week for France's new economy minister. He is a co-pilot of the Balladur government's budget which will be unveiled today, and later he will be flying solo with the draft legislation he has prepared to make the Bank of France independent and to sell off many of France's state-owned companies. It is a big chance for Edmond Alphandery, a 49-year-old academic economist-turned-politician, to put his well-honed ideas on money, central banking, savings, taxation and Europe into practice. His much-repeated overall aim is to 're-establish a climate of confidence' in France. A small part of that, however, involves public confidence in the minister himself. Certainly, Mr Alphandery seems to have what Napoleon desired for his marshals - a certain amount of personal luck. Perhaps wisely, in 1986 he stayed out of the Chirac government, preferring to write a book from the parliamentary backbenches on the dangers for the centre-right of 'cohabiting' with President Francois Mitterrand. Six years later, wiser still, he made the opposite calculation. Last December he turned down Mr Mitterrand's suggestion that he go to Brussels as an EC commissioner, banking on the fact that the centre-right would form the next government and gambling on the hope he might get the economy portfolio. True, this portfolio is no longer the super-ministry which the late Mr Pierre Beregovoy once ruled over. In particular, prime responsibility for the budget is lost to Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, a long-time Balladur associate. This explains why Mr Alphandery is 'minister of the economy', with 'finance' dropped from his title. Mr Alphandery is well qualified for the job. Almost over-qualified in the eyes of some of his countrymen who regard as suspect his study of monetarist and free market economics at The University of Chicago and at Berkeley, as well his later teaching stint at Pittsburgh. 'There I learnt the theory of prices, which is a superb science in explaining virtually everything that goes on in an economy,' he says. 'When I came back, I was one of the first French economists to teach price theory a l'Anglo-Saxon.' He still tends to see the economy in terms of the free play of supply and demand more than many Frenchmen's penchant for administrative direction, whether in housing policy or interest rates. Indeed, he insists that in cutting its official rates five times in the past month the Bank of France was 'not forcing the market, but following it'. It would not have been in his power or that of the French central bank to dictate to the market, he stresses. 'Supply and demand on the market are such that rates are pushed down . . . they (rates) are higher than they could be, and rational expectations are for a lowering of rates in France.' Nonetheless, this member of the centrist, Christian Democrat CDS wing of the UDF federation does not want to be branded a free-marketeer. 'Not every economist who masters price theory automatically falls in love with the market . . . My approach is more the German social market than the free market in all its brutality.' He remains, therefore, very French in his preference for fixed exchange rates and carefully controlled privatisation. There is also an element of luck in the timing of his arrival in the plush sixth-floor ministerial office of the Bercy fortress constructed by Mr Beregovoy. Though predictions about the slump in the 'real economy' have worsened in the past month, the monetary indicators have all moved in the right direction. He claims to have predicted months ago a stronger franc and lower interest rates, on the basis of four factors. First, 'hourly wage costs are about 20 per cent lower in France than in Germany'. Second, even if the rate of price rises has slowed in Germany because of recession and in France has recently risen, 'there is still an inflation differential of more than 1.5 percentage points in France's favour'. Third, 'we in France still have a current account surplus while Germany has a deficit.' Finally, 'even though our (budget) deficit has got worse, it is still comparable with Germany's deficit'. Therefore, the minister claims that it was quite logical that when the new government came in, promising to 'use whatever means necessary to defend the franc', two things should have happened. The franc has strengthened from a rate of FFr3.40-41 to the D-Mark in March to below FFr3.37 last week, and 'I sleep quietly knowing that there is no reason to worry about the franc'. The interest rate on three-month money has also dropped from 10.69 per cent on March 29, the day after the Conservatives' parliamentary victory, to below 8 per cent last week. Of equal consequence to borrowers has been the commercial banks' 0.75 per cent cut in their base rate to 9.25 per cent, 'its lowest level since July 25 1986', Mr Alphandery declaims with pleasure. But is less than a 1 percentage point cut in banks' lending rate enough to revive France's economy? 'Far from it,' he says. 'The level of our rates is not where it should be. But we have a further margin of manoeuvre and the European Monetary System (EMS) does not block us from using it. Clearly, it would be more agreeable to cut rates when the Germans do. But if they do not want to do so sufficiently, that is their business - we will still be able to do so.' On public finances, the government seems boxed in, though the minister claims the tax increases to be announced today 'can have a positive effect if they give credibility to the government and confidence to the country'. But he claims the government's 'second margin for manoeuvre' is the amount of state assets it chooses to sell off. This month's privatisation bill will broadly follow the lines of a similar operation by conservatives in 1986-87, including reserving chunks of shares for 'noyaux dur' shareholder groups. 'Rather than have control of a company raffled back and forth on the stock market . . . it is far better for its management to have a certain number of shareholders of reference, who know the company's strategy and have an interest in it succeeding,' says Mr Alphandery. Privatisation's pace will depend 'on the stock market's absorption capacity . . . and we will see how things look at the end of the summer break'. But the purchasing power is there, says Mr Alphandery. The question, rather, is how to get some of the FFr1,200bn now in short-term money funds (Sicavs) into long-term savings or equities. The recent drop in short-term rates is helping. But the minister also wants to give long-term savers a tax break, of which first signs could come today. For all his talk of margins of manoeuvre, there are self-imposed constraints the minister positively welcomes. One, of course, is putting France's current low inflation/strong money record into the hands of an independent Bank of France for safe-keeping. Mr Alphandery, however, claims the new system which he will unveil on Tuesday will be 'very French', differing from the Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve in being centralised (as distinct from federal) and in leaving the Bank of France's banking supervision role intact. He gives no support to persistent rumours that France and Germany will narrow the EMS band within which their currencies move against each other, or that their central banks will take some joint institutional step towards closer co-operation. 'There is plenty already on the table - il y a du pain sur la planche - with the European Monetary Institute due to be set up within eight months, and with all that needs to be done to respect the (Maastricht treaty's) convergence criteria.' When he was an opposition economist, Mr Alphandery admits, he was one of the first to say Maastricht's targets should be 'relativised' or softened to reflect harder economic times. Now, as economy minister, he says 'we can't go back on these criteria - they are a spur to the necessary discipline' for monetary union. But the treaty still allows flexible interpretation of the targets, he stresses.

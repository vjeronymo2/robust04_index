			<p><P> March 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATIONERY -- IT'S NOT STANDING STILL;  </P> <P> WAREHOUSE 'SUPERSTORES' LAUNCH FIERCE COMPETITION FOR THE ONCE-STAID OFFICE  SUPPLIES MARKET  </P> <P> Sometimes, when business is slow, Dee Erickson, manager of Wolcotts Commercial  Stationers in downtown Los Angeles, stands outside the store looking pensive.  </P> <P> Erickson says he blames the dearth of customers on the lack of nearby parking  spaces, but, when pressed, he admits that a nearby discount office supply  superstore is waging a quiet -- but fierce -- price war against him.  </P> <P> "The warehouses are making inroads," said Erickson, a 42-year veteran of the  stationery business. "They are definitely going to hurt some of the dealers."  The players -- big and small -- are all competing for a piece of the  $90-billion to $100-billion-a-year U.S. office supply market, according to  industry experts. And it is already evident that many companies will not  survive the fray.  </P> <P> The dramatic change in the office supply industry began about three years ago  when two former supermarket executives opened a store called Staples in  Brighton, Mass. Since then, venture capitalists have invested about $200  million in 16 office supply superstore chains across the country. Office Club,  BizMart, WORKplace, Office America and Office Depot are only a few of the new  office products superstores, as they are called.  </P> <P> The no-frills superstores average about 30,000 square feet and stock about  10,000 different items. They claim to offer savings of up to 50% on everything  from telephones to stick-on mailing labels.  </P> <P> They can give the discounts because they buy enormous quantities directly from  the manufacturers. Most of the chain stores stay open long hours, seven days a  week, unlike the traditional stationer, who keeps regular business hours,  Monday through Friday.  </P> <P> The superstores' strategy has been to target small and medium-size businesses  eager to save money on office products and equipment. Most superstores can  outfit a business from scratch, providing everything from the coffee maker to  the personal computer system hardware and software.  </P> <P> "The superstores have totally upset pricing in the industry," said Jack Miller,  president of Chicago-based Quill Corp., a $250-million-a-year, mail-order  office products company. "Everything is up for grabs."  </P> <P> However, Miller feels less threatened by the superstores because he believes  that his mail-order customers will remain loyal. Mail-order companies accounted  for 5.3% of the industry's 1987 sales.  </P> <P> Miller predicts that if smaller dealers find themselves unable to compete on  price, they may be forced to go into what he calls "niche marketing." For  example, one company may begin to specialize in serving the office products  needs of hospitals or medical buildings, while another may just focus on  selling filing systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Offer Personal Service  </P> <P> Most industry leaders are taking a wait-and-see attitude as the superstore  chains open their doors across the country. "Anytime there are new entrants in  the marketplace, some people will be affected," said Jack Bodeewes, president  of the 9,000-member National Office Products Assn. "I'm not sure which segment  of the industry will be hurt the most."  </P> <P> Bodeewes, who owns Business Products &amp; Services in El Paso, suggests that  the smaller retailers begin fighting the competition by providing what they are  best at -- more personal service.  </P> <P> "I've heard about people with stationery stores located near the Price Club who  had to close down," said Raj Patel, owner of Nelson's Stationery on Colorado  Boulevard in Glendale. "It is kind of scary."  </P> <P> Patel, who bought the 45-year-old business five years ago, said he can give  customers some discounts on big purchases, but he certainly cannot compete with  the superstores' prices.  </P> <P> "But you don't get the personal attention at those stores," Patel said. "I  think that's the only thing a small stationery store can offer."  </P> <P> The superstores have already taken a toll on Sacramento's office supply  retailers, according to a report in the Sacramento Business Journal. In  November, the Journal reported that three longtime Sacramento stationery stores  filed for bankruptcy protection a few months after the first office supply  superstores moved into town.  </P> <P> The impact on traditional stationers in Los Angeles will probably take longer  to surface.  </P> <P> For decades, the office supply industry relied on a stable distribution system  that started with the manufacturer and ended with the dealer but included a  wholesaler or two in between. By cutting out the wholesalers, and by keeping  their overhead low, the superstores can offer surprisingly large discounts.  </P> <P> For example, the same roll of 3M Magic transparent tape recently on sale at  Wolcotts for $1.49 was selling for 99 cents at the downtown Office Club. A  Swingline 747 model stapler selling for $22.95 at Wolcotts could be had for  $11.99 at the Office Club. And a staple remover on sale for 79 cents at  Wolcotts sells for 39 cents at the Office Club.  </P> <P> "The problem is that the public perception is that the independent dealer is  gouging them, and that isn't true," Wolcotts' Erickson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No-Frills Setting  </P> <P> Erickson does not deny that products cost less at superstores, but he points to  the advantages of dealing with smaller retailers, including free delivery. And,  he said, many small businesses are penalized by being forced to buy hundreds of  pencils or 1,000 file folders at a time from the superstores when they do not  really need that volume.  </P> <P> Although service, delivery and credit are still the most attractive reasons to  buy from a small dealer, many warehouse-format stores now offer these services  for additional, modest fees.  </P> <P> The office products superstores patterned themselves after general retail  superstores such as the Home Club and Price Club. They all offer a wide  selection of products in a no-frills, warehouse setting.  </P> <P> George Orban, president of WORKplace, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., was a  pioneer in the discount business and said he finds opportunities by looking for  products with inefficient distribution channels. Earlier, he was a founder of  Ross Stores Corp., a discount clothing store chain, and of Egghead Software.  </P> <P> WORKplace, with stores in Montebello and City of Industry, plans to open 20  stores in the Los Angeles area by 1990, according to Orban.  </P> <P> "I think there will always be room for the conveniently located small store,  because we won't be putting one of these (superstores) on every corner," he  said in a recent interview.  </P> <P> WORKplace stores differ a bit from the competition because they emphasize  computers and software. Each WORKplace store features a full Egghead software  store inside.  </P> <P> Todd Krasnow, vice president of marketing for Staples, said there probably  won't be 16 different chains of superstores, but "there will be room for a  few."  </P> <P> "It's amazing how quickly this is happening," Krasnow said, adding that  Staples, with 23 stores on the East Coast, expects to gross $120 million this  year.  </P> <P> Mark Begelman, president of Office Club, based in Concord, Calif., said the  office products world was ripe for change because it was "a gigantic industry  with antiquated channels of distribution."  </P> <P> California alone offers a $9-billion market for office products, he added.  </P> <P> So far, there are 16 Office Clubs in California, Oregon, Washington and  Colorado. A basic membership costs $10 a year. Non-members pay 10% more for  products than members do. For $50 a year, members can order by telephone, have  merchandise delivered and make credit purchases.  </P> <P> The new downtown Los Angeles Office Club, which opened in the first week of  January, already boasts 3,500 members. The manager said customers love the free  parking and easy access off Temple Street.  </P> <P> "We are trying to give the smallest business person the buying power of IBM,"  Begelman said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, small stationery store owners and managers will watch what happens  to the big guys with interest. Wolcotts' Erickson predicts that "sooner or  later some of them are going to go down the tubes."  </P> <P> But, he doesn't deny that he could buy things at a lower cost from them.  </P> <P> "My own wife buys at a warehouse store," he said with a sigh.  </P></p>

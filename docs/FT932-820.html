			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Reduced exceptionals boost LIG to Pounds 27.8m - Main business resilient to recessions A CREDITABLE performance by London International Group's health and personal products business was offset by a fall into losses in the photoprocessing division, leaving annual profits down from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 32.5m before exceptional costs. These costs were much reduced, though, at Pounds 4.7m (Pounds 22.5m). That left the pre-tax profit for the year ended March 31 1993 at Pounds 27.8m, up from Pounds 16.9m. Exceptional items covered the closure of some photoprocessing facilities and reorganisations costs within the health and personal products side. The group said it had no further comment to make on the episode last month when it was censured by the Stock Exchange for warning some analysts and shareholders that profit forecasts were too high. The result was at the lower end of revised expectations, and the shares fell 6p to 176p. Mr Tony Butterworth, chief executive, said it was frustrating to have the distraction of the photoprocessing losses when the health and personal products activities - including condoms, toiletries, surgeons gloves and household gloves - represented 90 per cent of group assets. Turnover rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 416m (Pounds 398.1m) and operating profits were slightly down at Pounds 47.5m (Pounds 48.6m). Within that the health and personal products activities increased profits by 20 per cent to Pounds 51.4m, with margins rising from 15.4 to 17.5 per cent, but photoprocessing losses of Pounds 3.9m replaced profits of Pounds 5.9m. Mr Butterworth said lower volumes and prices had hit ColourCare, the photoprocessing business, and there was overcapacity in the industry. LIG aimed to be the lowest cost processor and several million pounds of costs had been cut from the business. The benefits of that would be seen in the current year. The acquisition of SupaSnaps had given the group nearly 30 per cent of the UK market, he said. He said once recession ended the business was well placed to earn good returns. The group would then take a strategic look at it which could result in its sale or retention. The European industry was consolidating along the lines of the US and UK industries, he said. Meanwhile, the group's main business had proved resilient to recession in the UK and US. He struck a note of caution though as markets in Germany, Spain and Italy were now going into recession which could restrict sales growth. Geographical expansion was an important element of growth. In March the Durex brand was launched in China. The group reckons to have 35 per cent of the world market for branded condoms. He said the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, currently looking into pricing of condoms in the UK, was expected to report next February. Biogel surgeon's gloves, launched in the US three years ago, had now got a 24 per cent share of the US market by value. However, a reduction of stock in the distribution pipeline had held back sales. Interest charges rose from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 15m reflecting higher borrowings and interest rates in countries where LIG borrows to hedge assets, such as Italy. Year-end net debt was Pounds 128m Mr David Harbut, the finance director, said the business had been close to generating cash before acquisition and exceptional costs and these costs would be reducing now. Cash generation to reduce debt was a priority, he said. See Lex</p>

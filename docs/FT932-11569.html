			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / IG Metall begins strike: Engineering and steel stoppages in protest at wages in east IG METALL, Germany's powerful engineering union, will today step up its strike action in eastern Germany unless the employers reinstate a cancelled contract aimed at equalising eastern and western wages by next year. The strike, which started yesterday and is the first officially held in eastern Germany since 1933, affected five steel plants in Berlin-Brandenburg and 19 metal and engineering sectors in the heavy-industry state of Saxony, as well as the state's four steel plants. In all, over 14,000 workers came out in support of IG Metall, but with less enthusiasm than expected by the union which is dominated by westerners in eastern Germany. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, president of IG Metall, told workers in Dresden: 'We didn't want to strike. We were forced into it by the employers. But we will strike as long as is necessary and we will win.' Last night, Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, prime minister of Saxony, tried to mediate between the union and employers, but Mr Steinkuhler said he did not expect any immediate results from the meeting. Instead, he warned that the five eastern German states would be engulfed in an indefinite strike unless the employers returned to the negotiating table and gave the metal and engineering sectors a 26 per cent pay increase this year, and the steel sector a 21 per cent rise. These claims were part of the original contract, signed between IG Metall and the employers and eastern German managers in March 1991. But the collapse of the east European and Soviet markets, combined with the recession in western Germany, forced the employers to cancel the contract. They have since recommended pay increases of around 9 per cent. Both Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' association, and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers' association, yesterday said they would not reinstate the contract. 'We simply cannot afford it,' steel employers said, adding that much of the sector was already heavily subsidised and saddled with large debts. IG Metall has responded by saying eastern Germany should not be turned into a low-wage economy, even if that might help make the region competitive in the long term. IG Metall's strategy is now aimed at increasing day by day the number of plants which will be affected by strikes. Over 50 enterprises have been selected in the metal and engineering sectors in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and Saxony and steel plants in the five states. Metal and engineering plants in the remaining three states of Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Berlin-Brandenburg will be balloted if a compromise cannot be found over the next week or so.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government believes "it is essential to carry  out structural economic reform, including deregulation, while  making market intervention in coordination with other nations"  in order to address the problem of the sharply rising value of  the yen. The government will quickly work out concrete and  detailed measures by the end of June. Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata will attend meetings of administrative vice ministers of  all ministries and agencies on 9 May to urge positive action on  deregulation. He will also reaffirm the government stance on  deregulation at economic cabinet ministers' talks to be held on  10 May.    To prevent a further rise in the yen's value on the foreign  exchange market, the government has decided it is most important  not only to take direct measures, such as market intervention,  but also to promote economic reform at home--for instance, by  easing regulations and ensuring continued expansion of domestic  demand.</p>

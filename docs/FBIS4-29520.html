			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 20 (YONHAP) -- South Korea on Saturday  proposed to meet North Korea on June 28 to discuss procedures  for the inter-Korean summit.    The proposal, contained in a message from South Korean  Deputy  Premier Yi Yong-tok to his North Korean counterpart Kang  Song-san, said that a three-member delegation from each side led  by a deputy premier-level official should meet at the truce  village of Panmunjom at 10 A.M.    The decision to propose the contact was made at a  unification-related ministers' meeting held early Saturday  morning chaired by Deputy Premier Yi.    "Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who recently visited  your side, has relayed to us that your top leader proposed  holding a South-North summit in the near future without any  conditions," Yi said in his message to Pyongyang.    "I was authorized to let you know that we agree to the  proposal as it is the most ideal event considering the inward  and outward conditions of our country and the fervent wish of  our people," he said.    The burden on both South and North Koreans has been getting  heavier over the past half-century because of distrust and  confrontation, Yi said in the message.    "We have been saying that a meeting of the top leaders is  favorable if it would quickly dissolve the South-North tension  aroused by the nuclear problem and settle a relationship of  reconciliation and cooperation by opening the door to peaceful  reunification of our country," Yi said.    Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku, meeting reporters after the  inter-Korean contact proposal was made, said there is no reason  to delay the summit because "the sooner, the better."    He explained that Seoul made the proposal based on its  position that denuclearization of the Korean peninsula must be  realized, peacefully, through negotiation.    "It's the government's stance that results should be  produced  in the near future so that this preparatory contact would not  drag on or pose problems in procedure and agenda-setting as in  past contacts," he said.    The proposed meeting on June 28 is not designed to discuss  exchanging special envoys but to prepare for a summit, the  unification minister said. "It will be a working-level contact  to decide on the time and location soon so that the summit can  take place."</p>

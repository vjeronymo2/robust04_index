			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Abracadabra] It's the barter magicians: Motoko Rich talks to the people who can turn a photocopier into a delivery van Mr Edward Kalfayam, owner and managing director of Digital Print Technologies, a commercial printer, has performed an act of financial sorcery. 'I am spending Pounds 20,000 that I don't have this year,' he said. In deals with a computer company and a laminating-machine maker, Mr Kalfayam acquired Pounds 20,000 worth of hardware by bartering his company's printing services. This kind of reciprocal arrangement is more familiar to factory managers in the former Soviet Union, where struggling economies have resorted to barter as a form of payment. But for Mr Kalfayam, whose business has a turnover of just under Pounds 1m a year, the trade of services for goods rather than cash is a positive move which has bolstered his company accounts. Now he has an opportunity to increase his bartering power and move beyond one-to-one trades. As a member of London-based Capital Barter Corporation, a company which orchestrates third-party deals, he has entered a pool of businesses which offer their goods and services for trade credits rather than cash. Since last year Digital Print has used trade credits to purchase legal services, couriers, air-conditioning and floor coverings. CBC is one of a handful of barter companies in Britain's fledgling industry, which includes The Bartering Company and Business Barter Exchange - both in London - and Eurotrade in Newcastle upon Tyne. The UK's systems are modelled on a flourishing industry in the US, where the Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.4bn) barter business has been running for more than 30 years. There, large companies such as Lufthansa, the German national airline; Playtex Family Products, which makes healthcare products, and USA Network, a cable television company, use barter schemes for sophisticated deals of about Dollars 2m or more. CBC, which began trading last year, conducts comparatively modest deals, ranging anywhere between Pounds 15 for a restaurant meal to Pounds 15,000 for a stock of computers. It acts as bookkeeper for its network of 150 members - which is growing at a rate of 10 a month - including big corporations such as Konica Business Machines and Olympus Optical Company, and small businesses such as Digital Print, and Mandeer, an Indian restaurant in London. The barter company debits and credits its members' accounts in 'trade pounds'. These credits are equivalent to sterling, with items priced at retail or wholesale value, depending on the nature of the business. Each member is assigned a credit limit depending on the size of the company and the desirability of its products. Within the pool the most popular items are computers, photocopiers and airline tickets. In the US, selling unsold inventories is an important function of the larger barter companies. 'With the proliferation of bells and whistles on new products, older products go obsolete very quickly,' said Mr Alan Elkin, chief executive of Active International, one of the largest US barter companies. The company does Dollars 500m in trade annually. Mr Elkin said: 'We allow manufacturers to trade for a wanted asset rather than cash, and they can liquidate their merchandise for the full value that it is worth.' But barter can never be the main form of sales for a company's product. 'It is not going to save a failing firm that cannot make enough sales on a cash basis,' said Mr Paul Suplizio, chief executive of the International Reciprocal Trade Association. 'But it can provide a margin of additional value.' This value is best achieved in sectors where the incremental cost of taking on extra clients is low. Printers, hotels, advertising agencies and many manufacturers fall into this category. 'Allowing one room to be let on barter, for example, only costs a hotel the price of laundry and cleaning because all the other services in the hotel are fixed costs paid for by cash clients,' said Mr John McLennan, CBC operations director. 'But the buying power it earns in trade pounds is equal to the full retail value of the room.' Some companies are reluctant to deal in barter because they believe they still get better deals in cash. 'A lot of companies, when they find out how much a fax machine is in trade pounds, say they can get a better deal by getting a discount in cash,' said Mr John Howard, marketing manager at Konica Business Machines, which has traded about Pounds 80,000 worth of photocopiers and fax machines for carpeting and delivery vans. 'But if they think how much it would cost to generate that cash, they would find it is cheaper to do the deal on barter.'</p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Sinn Fein joining talks ruled out Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, yesterday forcefully ruled out any move to admit Sinn Fein to talks on the province's future in return for a temporary IRA ceasefire. Sir Patrick said he would unreservedly condemn any move by Dublin to invite Sinn Fein to its proposed Forum of Peace and Reconciliation in return for such a step by republican leaders. He said he was confident that the Irish government would not issue such an invitation. 'There is nothing here between the two governments,' he said. But speaking on BBC TV's On The Record, Sir Patrick refused to make clear whether lines of communication with republican leaders were still open. Pressed on the subject, he replied: 'I have said to the House of Commons that if there is to be any further communication with the IRA or Sinn Fein before they have declared a permanent end to violence and stopped supporting it . . . nothing will be passed down that chain of communication that is other than what is being said publicly.' Reinforcing London's insistence on a permanent end to IRA violence, Sir Patrick said a temporary ceasefire amounted to nothing more than passing 'a suspended sentence of death' on future IRA victims. 'That is not something that I regard as anything other than an insult and certainly nothing that should attract any response of any positive character.' He added: 'How can anybody be interested in a temporary ceasefire when it is no more than a threat to pick it up again in six months' time or six minutes' time?'</p>

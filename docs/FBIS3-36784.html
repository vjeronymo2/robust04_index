			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas </F> and Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk at the Seimas radio  studio; Kravchuk speaks in Ukrainian with passage-by-passage  translation into Lithuanian; translated from the Lithuanian;  correspondents not named -- live]    [Text] [Announcer] The treaty on friendship and cooperation  has just been signed and the presidents are going to hold a news  conference. The news conference is relayed live from the Seimas  radio studio.    [Brazauskas] The Ukrainian delegation. [sentence as heard]  We are happy to witness a great event in our political lives.  We have defined, I can even say we have improved our relations  with a great state such as Ukraine. Today's visit will make a  very good and positive impression on our lives.    We have discussed possible paths for our further cooperation  with Mr. President and his delegation. We also spoke about the  improvement of these relations, we touched upon foreign policy  matters as well. I congratulated Mr. Kravchuk on Ukraine's  decision [changes thought] and I believe that namely today the  Ukrainian minister of foreign affairs is signing the Partnership  for Peace agreement. [Words indistinct] today join the ranks of  partners, especially such a mighty partner as Ukraine.    Discussing the issues of our domestic policies we, of  course,  spoke mostly about the progress of economic reform and about the  results of this progress, both positive and negative. We shared  our experience [in this sphere].    [Kravchuk] Ladies and gentlemen, in sharing the conclusions  and assessments that President Brazauskas of Lithuania has just  spoken about, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, and the  Government of Lithuania for the hospitality and the friendly  attitude you have shown to us. I am convinced that the signing  of today's documents are a very important step, that another  step will be taken in Kiev, that the President of Lithuania Mr.  Brazauskas, will visit Ukraine and that I will officially invite  him to visit our state. Thank you    [Correspondent] A question from the Baltic News Service. I  would like to ask the president, do you think that the idea to  set up the Black Sea and the Baltic Sea alliance has any future?  If so, what meaning could be attached to that idea?    [Kravchuk] I think that the Eastern and Central European  initiative that Ukraine proposed and which coincides in many  aspects with similar initiatives proposed by Poland, France, and  other states, makes possible the creation of such an alliance  with the Baltic states, Ukraine, and other states. It is  important for me to stress that when we speak about such an  alliance, we are not talking about any blocs, any military or  political blocs, but about security zones, about economic and  political cooperation, and foreign political interaction. We  have all the grounds for this.    [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words. The initiative  that has been shown by Ukraine and the Ukrainian president and  which has been supported is not, of course, aimed at forming a  military bloc, nor is it intended to do so. Therefore, the  French initiative, or more precisely, the initiative shown by  the French Prime Minister coincides with the above mentioned  initiative. These are very concrete steps toward general  European cooperation. I think that the Partnership for Peace is  one of the main means available in Europe today for carrying out  this cooperation.    [Correspondent] A question from Ukrainian television. I have  a question to the presidents, the presidents of Ukraine and  Lithuania. Please explain -- the economic foundation is the  priority for future relations between our states, after all,  these economic documents were signed today after the political  document was signed. What are the basic directions in this  development? Thank you.    [Kravchuk] First of all, I would like to stress that  economic  relations between Ukraine and Lithuania are not just the  beginning of such relations. We have a good foundation and  traditions, and on the basis of these we should build and  broaden our economic relations by laying a new road and  principles. At present they do not correspond to our  possibilities. There are objective reasons for this: The  settlement crisis and the introduction of our own currencies.  All this has had an effect on relations but the prospects and  the possibilities are too broad, and we have already spoken with  Mr. President about the possibilities for trade and cooperation  in the field of transport through the Baltic ports; we could  have access to this region through the Black Sea and Lithuania  could have access to other regions. Therefore, we have good  prospects and good possibilities. I spoke about this and once  again would like to stress that today we have signed an  important political document, which is also partly an economic  document. I hope that new documents will be signed in Kiev.  Our cooperation and relations in the economic sphere will be  broadened and will deepen in all aspects.    [Brazauskas] I would like to say a few words on the same  topic. The currently existing developed transport communication  lines that link the Baltic Sea with the Black Sea, can be and  should be utilized. What is important here is that an  agreement, and I would think that there would be no doubt about  that, should be reached on these issues with Ukraine and  Belarus. Our shipbuilding and ship repair enterprises use steel  that is exclusively manufactured and imported from Ukraine.  Therefore, we are greatly interested in cooperation, first of  all, in this sphere. I think that while both our states are now  moving toward a market economy, and this process is not an easy  one, our cooperation should be organized in such a way that it  will become a very broad and beneficial relationship.    [Correspondent] A question from KOMMERSANT DAILY ROSSIYA.  A question to President Kravchuk. Esteemed Leonid Makarovich,  Ukraine is the first country in the CIS to join the Partnership  for Peace agreement today. Can you tell us please what impact  the new situation would have on the rather complex relations  with Russia, first of all because of the Black Sea Fleet and  with the world community concerning the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons. Does Ukraine intend to become a full member of  NATO?    [Kravchuk] I think that first, the signing of this  initiative  by Ukraine will not have any bearing on relations with Russia,  because perhaps Russia will also sign this initiative on  Partnership for Peace too. After all, this initiative is open  to all countries. When we all become members, [changes thought]  not members, but when we all sign this initiative then there  will be real cooperation between all states. Second, I am  convinced that resolving the nuclear arms problem and  implementing the trilateral agreement by all sides, which was  signed in Moscow, we will, at the same time, strengthen the  positive attitude and friendly relations between Russia and  Ukraine. I am convinced that we will also resolve the issue of  the Black Sea Fleet, because I know that unless the pressing  problems of nuclear arms and the Black Sea Fleet are resolved,  it will be difficult to build normal friendly relations with  Russia. Our political relations with Russia are especially  important. I am convinced that this particular meaning will  have realistic content if there is goodwill on the part of  Russia and Ukraine. I consider that the Partnership for Peace  initiative does not contradict the interest of all states but  will favor understanding, cooperation, and the working out of  certain programs and policies of our foreign policy and also of  other states, and this is really being done for the benefit of  peace and not confrontation. It is the right of every state to  determine its own foreign policy.    [Kravchuk] By way of conclusion, I would like to say that  the  problems that currently exist between Russia and Ukraine should  not be deliberately exacerbated because we are aspiring to  resolve them through mutual understanding and mutual support.  We are attempting to build these relations for the future so  that nobody sows the seeds of discord among our peoples, because  our future lies in friendly, and I stress, in friendly and  businesslike relations with Russia, our neighbor, with which we  have the most interests and where most of our foreign policy is  directed. Finally, I would like you to listen to the policy  that the Ukrainian state is pursuing and not to listen to the  statements made by the opposition, because they do not  principally coincide with this most important problem.    [Correspondent] A question from UKRINFORM agency. This is a  question to the head of the Republic of Lithuania. Currently,  in your country there are approximately 50,000 Ukrainians.  Could you say that they live in your country like at home. You  probably discussed this problem today with the Ukrainian  president.    [Brazauskas] I think that the Ukrainian national minority,  which comprises about 50,000 people, are Lithuanian citizens  enjoying full rights and there are no problems whatsoever in  this matter. We are glad that people of all nationalities,  including Ukrainians, have taken up Lithuanian citizenship. The  overwhelming majority of them have taken up Lithuanian  citizenship. Today, these people are taking an active part in  the country's political and social life. I hope that when Mr.  President meets representatives of the Ukrainian community he  will hear the same thing that I have just said.    [Announcer] This was a live relay of the news conference  held  by the Lithuanian and Ukrainian presidents at the president's  office in Vilnius.</p>

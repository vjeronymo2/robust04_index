			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed interview with Colonel Desire Bouterse, </F> National Democratic Party leader in New Ground near Paramaribo;  date not given: "Presidential Candidate Bouterse: `In Five  Years, I Will Lay the Foundation Here for a Singapore'" -- first  two paragraphs are ELSEVIER introduction]    [Excerpts] The talk took place on "New Ground," a neglected  former Netherlands plantation, and a two-hour trip from  Paramaribo over the Commewijne. This is where Desire (Desi)  Delano Bouterse (48), who until 31 January of 1993 was the Army  commander, spends a lot of time. The greeting is a bit stiff.  This is a different Bouterse from the one at a meeting four  years ago at the Het Park club in Fort Zeelandia, which at that  time was the military headquarters which had a strong hand in  Suriname's affairs of state. Back then he was a colonel,  starched in his faultless uniform; now he is a country dweller  in boots, shorts, and T-shirt. He has put on some weight.    Bouterse, the current leader of the National Democratic  Party  (NDP), sits down on a crude wooden bench underneath a tree.  [passage omitted]    [ELSEVIER] Are things not going well with the Army?    [Bouterse] An army is a part of the community. At this time,  the Surinamese community is showing all the signs of chaos. As  the Army is a part of the unity, it too is showing the signs.  In addition, it is being systematically cut back and stripped.  Gorre is not in a good enough position to offer any resistance  to this. For this reason, there is grumbling among military men.    [ELSEVIER] Would you happen to know any people who would be  better in the post of Army leader?    [Bouterse] Ceder would be good. I am also thinking of  Boerenveen, Christopher, and Slijngaard (Bouterse gives some  names of high-ranking officers, all of whom have advisory staff  functions in the entourage of President Venetiaan or Defense  Minister Gilds). I hope that my naming these people will not  have any consequences for them.    [ELSEVIER] Is the Army still in a position to carry out a  coup?    [Bouterse] (Laughing) I do not think so. And I do not hope  so, either. We have had a certain amount of developments in  Suriname: two Army coups. I think that this was quite enough  for the safe transformation of the young Republic. It has had  its historic meaning. In the end, the political work must be  left up to the politicians. We had already implemented this  evolution. Now, the Army is being rapidly detached from  politics, although here in Suriname each political party is  still trying to have an influence on the Army. [passage omitted]    [ELSEVIER] How are things going with the NDP? Is it right to  say that you would be prepared to cooperate with others in order  to come up with a national approach?    [Bouterse] We definitely need that. There is a difference  between podium talk and your responsibility. Our country is in  a very serious situation and is going through a bad time.  Economically, there is a wide open, chaotic situation. With  every passing day, the people are finding it harder to make ends  meet. President Venetiaan and the Front are governing on an ad  hoc basis, letting things take their own course. People no  longer believe in him. He offers no prospects. The solution  lies in early elections. I think our followers are growing. We  are prepared for full or partial power.    [ELSEVIER] What do you mean full?    [Bouterse] If we get the majority, if not, then we will work  together with those people who accept a national approach, along  the lines of a consensus model.    [ELSEVIER] What is the core of this contribution?    [Bouterse] People must be put back to work in this country.  Authority and discipline must return. There must be a slightly  military approach, with a slightly adjusted model of democracy.  There should be a parliament, but not endless waffling. Let the  representatives of the people meet every three months to discuss  legislation, but do not let them mess around with plans that are  never implemented. That makes me resentful. If they leave me  in peace, then within five years, I will lay a foundation for a  new Singapore here on this land, with these people, and with all  the resources. We have wood and gold, but not yet the know-how  and the money to use it for development. Other countries do.  The thing to do now is to have the inventiveness to combine  national interests with international interests, in an open  manner, without engaging in backhanded methods, through a  consensus.    [ELSEVIER] What stands in the way of this consensus?    [Bouterse] One condition is to have a national  reconciliation. There are still a lot of hard feelings. The  coups, the counter-coups: We must draw a line under all of  this. One man says: "You killed my family." And the other man  says: "You locked me up." We have black pages in our history,  but if we keep looking back, then we will keep attacking each  other. [passage omitted]    [ELSEVIER] People are saying that you want to become  president?    [Bouterse] What shall I say? Everyone has been expecting for  a little while that, given half a chance, Bouterse would become  the new president. For me, however, this is not an end in  itself. If I had wanted that, I could have done that for a long  time. If the voters want it and the community requests it, then  I will not shirk that responsibility. If I obtain political  power, however, then people will know that it will call for a  lot of hard work. That costs votes. I am not going to tolerate  the fact that you have to wait two hours for passport control at  the airport, that the streets are in shambles, that people do  not show up for work, and things like that.    [ELSEVIER] Will you cooperate with the Netherlands as a  friendly nation?    [Bouterse] Politics is a tough business, one in which there  is no room for hard feelings. The history is there. We were a  colony of the Netherlands; hundreds of thousands of Surinamers  live in the Netherlands; and we have an international treaty.  Of course, it is up to the Netherlands to decide whether it  wants to cooperate with a Bouterse government. If not, then I  am not going to go whining to The Hague. But we are looking for  other countries to cooperate with.</p>

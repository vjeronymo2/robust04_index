			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sony Music suffers decline in sales Sony Music Entertainment, the 71 per cent-owned entertainment subsidiary of the Sony electronics group, yesterday unveiled a fall in profits and its first annual sales decline for nine years. Pre-tax profits fell 11.7 per cent to Y19.84bn (Dollars 189.4m) on sales down 1.2 per cent to Y99.6bn. This was a result of lack of hits by Japanese musicians, said Mr Kazutoshi Shiraishi, Sony Music Entertainment's managing director. The poor performance of domestic music was only partially offset by increased sales of discs by Billy Joel, experiencing a revival in Japan, and other foreign stars. Net profits rose 0.6 per cent to Y12.01bn, due to a temporary drop in corporate tax payments, but will shrink again to an expected Y9.7bn this year as the tax bill rises, said Mr Shiraishi. He expects a revival in sales of Japanese music discs, but not in foreign discs or video-cassettes. On these grounds, he forecast pre-tax profits to fall this year to Y18.5bn, on sales of Y99.3bn. The annual divided has been increased to Y25 per share from Y22.5. Earnings per share fell from Y133.36 to Y116.62 last year, due to dilution caused by a share issue.</p>

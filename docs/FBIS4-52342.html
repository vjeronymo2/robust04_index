			<p>CSO     [Text] Hitachi will launch local production in the United  States of core equipment for next-generation communication  networks such as superhigh-speed optical transmission systems  (SONET) and asynchronous transmission mode (ATM)-related  equipment. The program will call for a threefold increase in  personnel and a sales goal of 50 billion yen for fiscal year  1998 for the local subsidiary. In the United States, telephone  companies and cable television (CATV) companies are building  high-speed digital communication networks compatible with the  "information super highway concept" and demand for  next-generation communication equipment has risen sharply.  Hitachi hopes to preclude trade friction through local  production and assume an aggressive marketing stance in this new  field.    SONET and ATM switching equipment encompass a variety of  communication equipment used for high-speed transmission of not  only voice and character but images as well. Production will be  in charge of Hitachi's local subsidiary, Hitachi Telecom USA,  headed by President Makoto Suzuki and located in Atlanta,  Georgia, which currently handles the production of private  branch exchanges (PBX) in the United States. Capital expansion  will involve investments in the range of 4 to 5 billion yen and  if the project goes well, production will start by the end of  the year.    The program will involve an increase in Hitachi Telecom's  employees from the current level of 130 to about 400 by fiscal  year 1996 mostly through appointment of local hires.    This will be the first time that Hitachi markets SONET  systems. Executives of the company say, "We are receiving many  inquiries from U.S. communications companies." The company's  sales objective for the transmission sector for fiscal year 1998  is 35 billion yen.    At the end of last year, Hitachi received an order for ATM  multiplexing systems in the area of ATM-related equipment from  Time-Warner for use in two-way CATV service systems. The seven  units for which orders were received at that time were  manufactured domestically and have already been delivered. In  the future, manufacture of all products destined for the United  States will be completely transferred to Hitachi Telecom as a  means of avoiding trade friction. The sales objective for fiscal  year 1998 is roughly 15 billion yen.    Hitachi hopes to increase its market presence in the face of  rapid developments in the multimedia sector and attendant growth  in market potential for next-generation communications  networking businesses.</p>

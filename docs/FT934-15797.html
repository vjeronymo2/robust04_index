			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shares in Dutch financial group soar SHARES in ING, the Dutch financial services group, rose to a record level yesterday on news that the government had sold its stake of nearly 7 per cent in the company to a large domestic pension fund. PGGM, the healthcare workers' pension fund, purchased the shares, worth Fl 1.27bn (Dollars 690m), as a long-term investment designed to realise its goal of bolstering its holdings in Dutch shares. The transaction makes PGGM the largest single investor in ING, just ahead of insurance companies Aegon and Amev. The 17.67m shares were sold for Fl 71.64 each, a discount of about Fl 3 to ING's average share price of Fl 74.66 in the 10 trading days up to October 5. The shares made further gains in the days leading up to the announcement. The shares closed yesterday at Fl 77.90, up Fl 0.80 as traders welcomed the sale of shares that had been overhanging the market. The state's stake of just under 7 per cent is a legacy of its holding in the Postbank which, through a series of mergers, is now part of ING. The government had said that it would eventually reduce its stake but the timing was never specified. The disposal comes after a strong run-up in the value of ING shares over the past year from their lows of Fl 42 in the autumn of 1992. Other financial stocks like ABN-Amro Bank have also risen sharply in the same period.</p>

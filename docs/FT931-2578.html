			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Strong pound restrains equity market THE LONDON market's continuing disenchantment with the chancellor of the exchequer's Budget proposals and an impressive show of strength by sterling kept the lid on share prices yesterday, in spite of a wealth of highly encouraging domestic and international economic and corporate news. The expiry today of the March Footsie futures contract was another factor cited by dealers as being largely responsible for bringing some of the unexpected downside pressure to bear on the cash market. However, not even a constant flow of bullish news, which included the first fall in UK unemployment figures for 34 months, highly encouraging data on UK average earnings, unit wage costs and building society lending, proved sufficient to offset the effect of a rising pound. The latter was in positive territory all day, anticipating the half-point reduction in Germany's discount rate, a move said to have been discounted by the UK market for some days. The extent of sterling's rise was seen by the market as indicating that another hoped for reduction in UK rates could still be some way off. Gilt-edged securities subsequently attracted strong support throughout the session. The FT-SE 100 Index settled a net 10.2 lower at 2,879.7, just a fraction above the day's worst level of 2,879.6 registered only minutes before the close of trading. There was better news for the market's second-rank stocks which comprise the FT-SE Mid 250 Index. Reports of sizeable switching operations out of the FT-SE 100 and into the Mid 250 stocks saw the latter index finish 7.4 higher at 3,133.3. Equity prices were under pressure at the outset, when the Footsie future was responsible for driving the cash market down by around nine points during the first hour of trading. The whiff of a German interest rate cut, however, plus some determined buying of selected areas of the market - notably the property stocks - brought about a keen rally which lifted the FT-SE 100 to the day's high of 2,896.7 shortly after midday. Thereafter, bouts of selling pressure, especially in the leading international stocks, saw the market retreat to close just off the day's low. Traders were surprised at the extent of the market's decline, especially in the face of a strong opening on Wall Street, which was almost 30 points ahead shortly after it opened. A senior marketmaker at one of the leading UK integrated securities houses said that the equity market 'now feels much more comfortable' after the 42.7 points decline since the Budget. But he emphasised that the big UK institutions 'are still mulling over the advance corporation tax and tax credit changes'. Turnover of 706.3m shares was described as 'brisk but unspectacular', and was again heavily weighted in favour of the non-FT-SE 100 stocks, giving credence to the talk of switching into the smaller stocks. The value of market business transacted on Wednesday totalled Pounds 1.4bn. Spring Ram provided one of the session's real features, the shares plunging after being relisted in the wake of the profits warning. At the close the stock had halved from its pre-suspension price of 129p; turnover rocketed to 27m shares.</p>

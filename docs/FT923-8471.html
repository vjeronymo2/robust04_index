			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / N-plant granted 10-year extension BRITAIN'S oldest nuclear reactor, at Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, is to continue running for another 10 years, Juliet Sychrava writes. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said the decision by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to allow the Magnox-type reactor an extended lease of life will put the lives of local people at risk. The group said radioactive discharges from Bradwell were outside the new recommendations laid down by the Radiological Protection Board. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear stations in England and Wales, said it had satisfied the inspectorate that Bradwell, which opened in 1962, presented no danger. It was well within the legal limits.</p>

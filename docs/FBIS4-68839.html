			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A.N. Raspopin, chairman of the Novosibirsk </F> Municipal Committee for Protection of Consumer Rights, by  Vladimir Krylov, VECHERNIY NOVOSIBIRSK correspondent; place and  date not given: "The Law Is on Our Side"]    [Text] Last year, starting in May, from the moment  the Law "On Protection of Consumer Rights" went into effect and  the appropriate municipal committee was established, the  committee received about 2,000 complaints, more than 1,500 of  which were examined and the rest are in a stage of resolution.  More than 37 million rubles [R] has been returned to purchasers.  We bring to your attention an interview by our correspondent  with A.N. Raspopin, chairman of the Municipal Committee for  Protection of Consumer Rights.    [Krylov] Aleksey Nikolayevich, I happened to read about this  kind of incident once in an American journal. Coming down the  stairs in a hotel, a little girl stumbled on the stair carpet,  broke the heel of her shoe, and dislocated her foot. A suit was  filed in court. Expert analysis established that, first, the  runner was not stretched tight and, second, that the screws  attaching the heel were not long enough and did not ensure  reliability. The victim was paid a big sum in damage  compensation. After reading this, you will sigh: Well, that is  in their country! You will not get anything like this in our  country. Is this really so, is our consumer without rights?    [Raspopin] No, not now. Each one of us is reliably protected  by the Law "On Consumer Protection." In addition, it is well  reinforced by the Statute "On Coordinated Actions To Ensure  State Protection of the Rights of Consumers of Commodities,  Work, and Services," which was signed by a whole number of  responsible government organs. An entire system for the  protection of consumer rights has been established in the  country.    [Krylov] Everything is described in sufficient detail and  clearly in the law. But what are the fundamental rights of an  individual if he bought a commodity of poor quality, or if he is  dissatisfied with work and services performed on his order?    [Raspopin] In the event that an article proves to be of low  quality, has defects and flaws, and does not meet required  standards, the seller is obliged to perform repairs at his own  expense or replace the commodity. If the article went out of  commission during the warranty period, responsibility is also  placed with the selling organization and, in addition, if the  purchaser refuses an exchange, he is reimbursed not the former  cost but the new cost in effect the day of the appeal. We have  mainly had complaints about television sets, refrigerators, and  washing machines, and they occurred for wine and vodka items and  household services. All the suits were satisfied. I will cite  even this example. As a result of a power surge, expensive  equipment--a personal computer system and a video set--were  burned out at citizen Stankov's place. He filed a suit. The case  was decided in his favor, and the cost of the equipment--R1.7  million--was paid, plus punitive damages, and 15 percent of the  cost to the state budget; in addition, the guilty organization  paid R36,000 for the expert evaluation.    [Krylov] But how is trade reacting?    [Raspopin] Sometimes it shows opposition and refuses to  compensate for damage voluntarily: returning the money, or  replacing the commodity. But as soon as the question of bringing  the case to court arises, the tone of many people changes, as a  rule.    [Krylov] It also happens frequently that sellers cannot  provide reliable information about the commodity and the  manufacturing firm. Either they do not possess it, or they  cannot be bothered to answer, or they deliberately conceal  things in order to sell a commodity. What is done in such a case?    [Raspopin] Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Law "On Protection of  Consumer Rights" obliges the manufacturer and seller to make  information about a commodity available to the purchaser in an  easily understood form--the manufacturer, the price, the main  consumer features, and storage periods. Incidentally, on the  basis of the Law "On Answerability of Sellers for Violating  Consumer Rights" in the event of a systematic violation of  rights, a trade enterprise and a manufacturing firm can be  liquidated in the established legislative procedure. It cannot  be ruled out that an announcement could be made about the fact  that the store is being closed for violating consumer rights.    [Krylov] There is not always time in the store to examine a  purchase. For example, I brought it home, looked it over  carefully, there was something I did not like, then...    [Raspopin] Then the purchaser has the right within two weeks  from the day of the sale to return the commodity and demand an  exchange.    [Krylov] The rather widespread rebuke still occurs in trade:  We did not produce it, all claims have to be made with the  manufacturing plant.    [Raspopin] This is absolutely not true. Trade is obliged to  sell only quality commodities, to conclude a contract for  guaranteed service and repair, or to refuse to sell such a  commodity. Even if there is no contract but the commodity is  defective, trade is nonetheless obliged to repair or replace it,  and it in turn requires compensation from the manufacturer.    [Krylov] But what about warranty periods? Household  equipment  is expensive, but trade frequently establishes ridiculous  periods--sometimes several days, sometime a couple of weeks,  and, at best, a month. But a hidden defect does not always  appear that quickly.    [Raspopin] Here trade is wrong. Established standard periods  exist--for complicated household equipment, as a rule, this is a  year or two. Even if the seller writes that, he says, he is  giving a guarantee for only two weeks or two months, in the  event the purchased household equipment breaks down the law will  be on the side of the consumer.    [Krylov] That is, sellers should remember the saying: You  cannot back out once you have begun.    [Raspopin] Absolutely correct. And also a certificate has to  be shown during the purchase. All products that come into the  trade network must be certified in a mandatory procedure.  Incidentally, if the trade inspection discovers the absence of a  certificate--it has a right to remove the commodity from sale.    [Krylov] Sometimes in the plant instructions for equipment,  notations are made that if there is no date of sale and store  stamp or the commodity was sold by a commercial structure, the  manufacturer is not responsible and does not provide warranty  repair.    [Raspopin] The purchaser does not have to pay attention to  such notations, just as the court does not take them into  account. Such notations contradict the Law "On Protection of  Consumer Rights."    [Krylov] Thus, if the purchaser acquired a faulty commodity,  and trade refuses to satisfy his claim, he should appeal to you?    [Raspopin] Yes, but only physical, private persons. We do  not  examine suits of juridical persons. We will provide the consumer  with a consultation, and we will draw up all documents free of  charge, and the purchaser himself will not have to pester anyone.    [Krylov] As far as I know, the procedure for appealing to  the  court is rather simple. But why do people, after gossiping among  themselves, not defend their rights according to the law?    [Raspopin] Most likely because the very word "court" is  associated with something unpleasant. But after all, this is a  normal civilized means of defense of their rights. Indeed, even  the plaintiff may not appear in court himself--our structure  will take care of everything for him.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Taipei set to raise stake in BAe/TAC deal THE Taiwanese government is poised to increase its stake in the proposed joint venture between British Aerospace and Taiwan Aerospace Corporation from 29 per cent to 39 per cent in an effort to convince Taiwanese banks to lend more cash to the project. The government is also likely to step up pressure on private sector investors to put up capital to reduce the risks to creditor banks. The success of the Dollars 250m (Pounds 167m) venture is vital to BAe's recovery strategy. Its loss-making RJ range of regional jet aircraft would be manufactured in Taiwan, close to the rapidly growing markets of east Asia, and with lower labour costs. Mr Yang Shih-chien, Taiwan's deputy minister of economic affairs, said yesterday that government officials had agreed on these changes to try to conclude talks on the joint venture by July 31, a deadline set by BAe's board. Earlier this week Mr John Cahill, BAe's chairman, visited Taiwan in an effort to reassure Taiwanese banks of the viability of the venture and to restate the deadline. BAe said yesterday that the deadline was not final and would be reviewed if necessary. Under yesterday's proposals, which still need cabinet approval, the Executive Yuan Development Fund would hold 29 per cent of the venture (up from 24 per cent) and the Chiao Tung Bank will hold 10 per cent (up from 5 per cent). Both are state- controlled. Mr Yang also said the China Development Corporation (CDC) whose main shareholder is the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, had indicated it would also buy into the joint venture if the Chiao Tung Bank raised its stake. He said about 15 per cent of the capital needed was still uncommitted. 'We just need to find two or three investors willing to put up a 5 per cent share.' The economic affairs ministry would 'actively assist TAC in getting existing private sector stockholders to increase their investment or find new private investors,' Mr Yang said.</p>

			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Major urges Edinburgh deal to end EC paralysis MR JOHN MAJOR told other European Community leaders yesterday that they must strike a deal to make the Maastricht treaty acceptable to the Danish people in order to free the EC from its current paralysis. On the eve of a two-day European summit in Edinburgh, the prime minister rejected suggestions by other leaders, notably President Francois Mitterrand of France, that if no solution were found to the problem of Denmark's and Britain's ratification of the treaty, the other 10 members could proceed towards European Union on their own. His warning came as it became clear that Spain, which wants significant increases in fiscal transfers to poorer member states, was unwilling to accept marginal new increases in the latest British budget proposals. The new proposals were attacked last night as inadequate by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, who is pressing for a bigger expansion of Community spending. There were signs, however, that Mr Major might be ready to give some further ground if other EC leaders dropped their demands for a reduction in Britain's rebate from Brussels. Mr Major said in a series of television interviews that there could be no question of a 'two-speed' EC. The treaty had to be ratified by all member countries before it came into effect. They therefore had to reach an agreement at Edinburgh which would be accepted by the Danes at a second referendum. Britain, which holds the EC presidency until the end of the year, has made new proposals on Denmark and EC financing, considered to be the biggest problems on the summit's agenda. Faced with the refusal of their partners to make any amendments to the treaty, the Danes want the EC to adopt a number of declarations which would recognise their right to opt out of the proposed economic and monetary union, a common defence policy, common interior and justice policies and EC citizenship. British officials said last night that it was not so much the substance of the proposed declarations on Denmark, but their legal form, which was the problem. The latest proposals had gone some way towards satisfying Danish demands that the special arrangements for Denmark, while not amending the treaty, would nevertheless be considered as legally binding. The officials recognised that the problem of EC financing would probably be the hardest to solve and that, if it was settled at all, it would not be until the end of the meeting tomorrow night. Spain's demand, backed by Germany, for a higher 'own resources' ceiling for the EC budget than that proposed by Britain is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome. Britain's new proposals, under which more cash would be channelled to the poorer EC countries, such as Spain, Greece and Ireland, yesterday received a cool initial reception from Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's prime minister.

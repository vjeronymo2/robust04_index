			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Minister backs Northolt growth The government is stepping up its efforts to allow business aircraft to use the Royal Air Force airfield of Northolt, west London, to relieve increasing pressures on business aviation at Heathrow. The Department of Transport and the Ministry of Defence yesterday issued a consultation paper seeking the views of industry and business aircraft users on the potential for developing a civil enclave dedicated to small business aircraft on the airfield. The move was signalled in May's competitiveness white paper in view of increasing pressure on facilities for general and business aviation in south-east England. Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, aviation minister, said yesterday: 'Business aviation is not just a rich man's plaything. Many serious companies are dependent on small aircraft and it is important for UK plc to get in and out of London with ease.' One attraction of Northolt is its proximity to Heathrow - many corporate jet users want to connect with long-distance scheduled services from Heathrow, the world's biggest international airport. Shell, the integrated oil group which operates its own corporate jet fleet, welcomed the government's initiative. Northolt handles royal, VIP and military traffic. It handles about 4,000 movements - either a take-off or landing - by civil aircraft each year and has capacity for a further 3,000 movements. The government wants to see this spare capacity used. Security will be a significant issue in view of the use of the airport by royal and VIP flights. There are proposals to transfer the Queen's flight from RAF Benson in Oxfordshire to Northolt. Lord MacKay said flight operations would remain the responsibility of the MoD, while ground operations, including aircraft and passenger handling, would be the responsibility of the operator of the proposed new business aircraft centre. The consultation process is expected to be completed by the second half of next month. The plan is expected to spark fierce local opposition on environmental grounds.</p>

			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Taking a leaf out of Dame Marie's book: The adoption of New Zealand methods for the teaching of reading THE FIRST batch of reading tests administered to seven-year-olds in England and Wales last summer produced dismal results. They showed that 28 per cent of those tested could not read without help and had difficulty spelling three-letter words such as car or sun. Until quite recently such difficulties were not regarded as disastrous. The received wisdom was that children needed time to develop. In some cases it was only on arrival at secondary school at age 11 that remedial teaching would be provided. Valuable years in school were wasted and children confirmed in a pattern of educational failure. In New Zealand, by contrast, six-year-olds with below-average reading skills get intensive help to catch up. The worst readers are withdrawn from class and coached for half an hour a day for between 12 and 20 weeks by a specially-trained teacher. Almost all are then returned to normal teaching. The results have been impressive, with less than 1 per cent of pupils needing help after 20 weeks. Research shows that the improvement is retained after three years. The pioneer in this reading recovery programme is Dame Marie Clay, emeritus professor of education at Auckland University and former world president of the International Reading Association. She believes the programme can eliminate any form of reading difficulty not caused by a physical problem, and rejects the common assumption that up to 15 per cent of people are 'reading-disabled'. Her approach has spread to Australia and the US, and has now reached the UK. The first local education authority to adopt her approach was Surrey County Council, which sent a teacher to New Zealand for a year's intensive training in 1989. She trained 19 other teachers and the first children began the programme last year. There will be 33 trained teachers by the end of this summer, each working on four children at a time. Mrs Maria Evans, the school inspector running the Surrey programme, said: 'There is a big spin-off for the schools. Improving children's reading skills also improves their writing ability, their attentiveness and comprehension.' The approach is not cheap. A specialist teacher is attached to a single school so the children become familiar with him or her. It would cost Surrey more than Pounds 400,000 a year to introduce the programme in every primary school in the county. Seven London boroughs have shown an interest in adopting similar programmes and Dame Marie is to spend two years training teachers at the University of London Institute of Education. The funding announced yesterday for further pilot projects should ensure that she has plenty of recruits for her courses.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Pension tax rebates to be altered THE government has announced plans to encourage personal pension holders to stay out of the state pension plan. From 1996 it will offer age-related tax rebates which will be more generous to older people. The move is widely seen as an admission that the present system may not reduce the cost of the state earnings related pension scheme (Serps). Under the present regime, men in their late 40s receive too little tax rebate to make a personal pension worthwhile, and those who have them are advised to give up personal pensions and rejoin Serps. But the government still intends to reduce tax breaks for the young, a move which the insurance industry fears will discourage them from buying personal pensions. 'The government is committed to considering options for a new system of rebates related to age to come into effect from April 1996 for personal pension holders,' the Department of Social Security said. The government, which had rejected all age-related rebates a year ago, will now consider extending tax incentives to occupational schemes as well. The move comes as the government's own actuarial department has produced figures showing that if the government were to maintain its current policy, tax rebates would be bound to fall over the next 30 years so that only those in their late 20s would choose personal pensions. The present system offers the same rebate to all - a structure which encourages people to rejoin the state pension system as they grow older and which saves the government very little money. The National Audit Office has estimated that between 1988 and 1993, personal pensions rebates cost Pounds 5.9bn more than they saved in potential social security expense. Much of the insurance industry has opposed the introduction of age-related rebates because it is felt they will offer young people tax incentives too small to encourage them to choose a personal pension. Because lower contributions to pensions schemes are required from young people, the current flat rate rebate system allows them to buy a far more generous personal pension than they could obtain in the state system. However, some insurance companies support the concept because they believe it will allow them to retain pension clients longer. 'We will be able to hang on to our premium-paying clients,' said Mr Ron Spill, head of pensions at Legal and General, one of Britain's largest providers of personal pensions. Currently, personal pension holders who opt out of Serps are entitled to a rebate of 5.8 per cent of tax of national average earnings. By next April, the government intends to cut that to 4.8 per cent of earnings and only those over the age of 30 will be eligible for the maximum tax savings. The current system has encouraged 4.7m people to take out personal pensions, but it is expected that a large minority of those will opt back into the Serps system when the less generous rebates take effect.</p>

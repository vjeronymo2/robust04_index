			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] La Paz, 25 December (LOS TIEMPOS)--Another matter  mentioned by Minister German Quiroga in the interview obtained  by LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz was referred to in the forecast made in  the program of "Popular Participation" which the government  plans to implement during the next administration.    In this respect he pointed out that the democratic process  reestablished in Bolivia in 1982, following a long period of  military governments which came to power in successive coups  d'etat, created an imperious need, which could not be postponed,  for setting up new means of effectively channeling the will of  the people at policymaking levels and in the institutional  processes of leadership of the country.    The minister of government said that this objective of  converting the present, democratic and representative system  into a new, participative and dynamic system aimed at the basic  institutions of Bolivian society should be clearly expressed in  the first place in the structure of municipal governments and  then in the forms of representation in Parliament, through the  election of deputies on separate lists, as projected in the Law  on the Need for Reform of the Political Constitution of the  State.    He said that the recently promulgated Law on Majorities and  Minorities as a standard for municipal elections has the same  objective. In that way the rights of citizens will be legally  guaranteed in the future, not only to vote but also to choose,  preventing the possibility that their views, expressed through  the ballot box, could be subject to later political  negotiations, as has happened up to now.    He noted that this plan for participation by the people,  which has been formulated as a fundamental part of the program  of government proposed to the country by the MNR [Nationalist  Revolutionary Movement], seeks to establish a system of  political participation which "goes beyond the political  parties." As a result, he repeated, "It would be madness to say  that we are allegedly trying to set up a program for long-term  control of the government, as some opposition groups charge."</p>

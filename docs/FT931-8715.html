			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Betrayed Franco puts boot into Brazil's lumbering state sector: Indebted and inefficient, public companies have lost the president's backing WHEN the Brazilian President Itamar Franco assumed office last year one of his first complaints was that the use of an elephant to symbolise the state in the campaign for privatisation was 'derogatory' to such a valiant sector. Not only did he suspend the elephant but the entire privatisation programme. Mr Franco's rose-tinted view has since been clouded by the discovery of the sector's drain on the exchequer. The state sector now holds almost as much debt as Brazil's entire foreign debt. Its arrears on taxes and social security contributions amount to Dollars 8.7bn (Pounds 6.1bn) - more than the government is struggling to raise through its proposed fiscal reform. Already this year the central bank has provided Dollars 400m to enable state companies to keep up payments to international creditors. Saying he feels 'betrayed' by state companies and 'their intolerable privileges', this week Mr Franco ordered an investigation into their activities and slashed salaries of directors by as much as half. Legislation is awaiting Senate approval to allow parastatals to be declared bankrupt and Mr Franco says he may review the monopoly status of some. As a result of an intensive state-led development programme begun in the 1950s to make the country self-sufficient, Brazil has 159 state companies involved in everything from gold-mining, oil, aerospace and shipping to manufacturing of computers, steel and fertilisers, and employing 730,000 workers. This year state companies are projected to lose Dollars 5bn through waste and inefficiency, spend Dollars 6bn servicing debt of Dollars 93.3bn, and take out of the budget Dollars 8bn for investment. In return they will pay back Dollars 10bn in taxes, leaving a net drain of Dollars 9bn. Mr Joel Korn, president of Bank of America in Brazil, says 'this is the real cause of inflation'. While Mr Franco may have ideological objections to selling off these companies, he wants to stop them bleeding the economy. To the alarm of the company presidents, he is refusing to authorise the traditional monthly inflation-plus adjustments in tariffs without cost plans. Even Petrobras, the usually sacrosanct state oil company, is to undergo an audit. Unravelling the finances of state companies is not an easy task. Not only are their costs often a mystery but a huge web has been created of interlinking debts. According to Economy Ministry figures, the champion debtor is the electrical sector. Eletrobras, the holding company with assets of Dollars 36bn, owes Dollars 59.2bn including the debt on Itaipu, the world's largest hydroelectric project, and has arrears of Dollars 12.4bn against projected profits this year of just Dollars 100m-Dollars 500m. More than half the state sector debt is in foreign and domestic bank loans and multilateral financing. A further Dollars 18.9bn is in debentures issued over the last decade to capitalise holdings. Another Dollars 2.9bn is owed to suppliers and construction groups. Many state companies would have been declared bankrupt long ago had they been in private hands and, if the new legislation is approved, several may not be long for this world. Favourite candidates are Cosipa, a steel mill, which has overdue debt of Dollars 1.1bn - equal to its yearly revenue and needs Dollars 300m to pay suppliers, and Lloyd, the paralysed state shipping company, which retains 1,100 workers for just two ships and last year lost Dollars 65m. Seven out of 10 parastatals are inefficient, according to Mr Jose Manoel Goncalves de Oliveira who recently co-ordinated a 1,400-page study on Brazil's infrastructure for the Electrical Association. In the energy sector, for example, Brazil needs five times as many people as Canada to produce three times less energy. The telephone service, it says, is 'falling from third to fourth world levels' with 24 out of 100 calls not connecting. Brazilian ports are the least efficient in the world with costs of Dollars 15 to load a tonne of soya compared to Dollars 2 in the US and Dollars 4 in neighbouring Argentina. 'How can a country think about being competitive internationally with these conditions?' asks Mr Goncalves. However, state companies' directors claim that, had they not been state-run, they would not be in this situation. They point out that successive governments have kept public sector tariffs artificially low to suppress inflation and have constantly meddled with directors for political or even corrupt ends. Petrobras has had seven presidents in the last three years. Directors of the National Steel Company complain that the bureaucratic straitjacket of the state has denied them the flexibility to compete with recently privatised Usiminas. The government cash crisis has also blocked desperately needed investment. Privatisation would seem the obvious answer, but for Mr Franco's belief that there is something inherently wrong with selling off state assets. His decree on privatisation issued last month gave him imperial powers over the process and investors have not been optimistic that the programme will restart as promised next month. However, there are signs Mr Franco may be changing his mind. He said this week: 'The concept of a state enterprise that I defend is one that serves the interests of the state and not of interest groups.' He left little doubt on which category he thinks Brazilian parastatals belong to.</p>

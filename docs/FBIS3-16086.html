			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nikolay Dudnikov: "No Quorum"] </F>   [Text] Salekhard -- The fate of the elections to the  Russian Federation Federal Assembly and local organs of power in  Yamalo-Nenetsk Autonomous Okrug hung by a thread. By 1700 hours  on 6 March only 23.8 percent of the total electorate had voted.    Gasworkers, oilworkers, fishermen, and hunters had not gone  to the voting stations, because they had been sitting waiting  for their pay for a long time.    In order to save the situation, the organizers of the  campaign were forced to bring into play various methods of  influencing voters. Appeals were repeatedly broadcast on okrug  radio, while in some places they actually traveled to healthy  people's homes with the ballot boxes. Although, as is known, in  former times this practice was reserved for invalids and the  sick.    So the final total for the number of voters rose to 28.7  percent, which was enough to declare the elections valid.    Of the six contenders for the Federation Council, Okrug  Administration Head Yu.V. Neyelov won by a large margin.    Two well-known people in Yamal made it to the okrug  parliament: Vasiliy Tikhonovich Podshibyakin, general director  of the geological association, and Kh.M. Yezengi, president of  the "Yamal For Future Generations" association. But one seat in  the okrug Duma remains vacant. This means there can be no  quorum. So, in all likelihood, Yamal can expect yet another  election.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / International Company News: Kvaerner takes over shipyard KVAERNER, the Norwegian engineering, shipping and shipbuilding group, has acquired the 60 per cent it did not own in Kimek, a shipyard in Kirkenes on the border between Norway and Russia, from Syd Varanger, a partially state-owned company. As consideration for the deal, Kvaerner will provide the yard - to be called Kvaerner Kimek - with NKr30m (Dollars 5.2m) in fresh capital and NKr70m 'in kind' including technological assistance. It will implement a NKr230m expansion and modernisation programme to be completed in 1994. The industry ministry will contribute NKr189.5m to the modernisation programme, to allow the yard's workforce to expand by 100 to 250 employees by 1995, and provide an additional 150 jobs as local spin-offs from the yard's remotely-situated operations. Syd Varanger had planned to close the yard. Kvaerner Kimek will derive an estimated 80 per cent of this year's NKr150m budgeted turnover from Russia, where it has a well-established market concentrating primarily on modernisation and maintenance of the Russian fishing fleet. Since 1988, when Kvaerner acquired the Govan yard in Scotland from British Shipbuilders, it has had an almost insatiable appetite for shipyard acquisitions. Its investment in shipbuilding expansion in the last four years has reached an estimated NKr1.3bn. In 1990 it acquired Masa-yards in Finland. Earlier this year it bought a ship-repair yard in Gibraltar and a group of Norwegian yards. Last month the group took control of the Warnow shipyard in eastern Germany for NKr4m in a deal which propelled it to the position as Europe's biggest shipbuilder. In 1991 shipbuilding accounted for one-third of the group's total NKr18.66bn revenue. In the first nine months of this year the shipbuilding division boosted operating revenue to NKr4.14bn from NKr3.9bn last year as profits rose to NKr494m from NKr339m.</p>

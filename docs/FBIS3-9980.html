			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by Honduran President Carlos Reina with </F> unidentified reporters at the Government House in Tegucigalpa on  23 February; monitored in progress -- live]    [Excerpts] [Reina] The international community has  questioned me a great deal about the Palmerola situation. This  is a very sensitive issue, particularly in the international  context. [words indistinct] In my opinion, the Palmerola base  resulted from an military agreement [words indistinct] It is not  a formal treaty; it was not submitted to the National Congress.  Based on this agreement, [words indistinct] it was theoretically  established that it was a [words indistinct] base.    The Cold War has ended. What happens to this installation?  Can it be utilized -- with international cooperation -- for the  benefit of the Honduran people and the United States? Can it be  used to combat such a threatening and damaging scourge as drug  trafficking? Can it be used for [words indistinct] ecology, or  to help control disease, or to improve the transfer of  technology in the agriculture sector, or to help in the health  sector? All of this will have to be discussed in due time at the  National Congress. The National Congress will decide this. I  will even go further. We could ask the people of Comayagua, who  are directly affected, what they think about the presence of the  installation there. I strenuously opposed war activities there,  as they only bring us destruction. [passage omitted]    We are talking about privatization in general, not about one  particular company. The simplest example would be [words  indistinct]. This was taboo some time ago, one could not talk  about this. I am very happy that currently we can talk about the  privatization of a hotel or of any other institution. The  privatization issue is neither good or bad in itself. It all  depends on what is being privatized and how it is being  privatized as this can lead to widespread corruption or it can  serve to help Honduras' economic independence. In this way, we  would not have to face situations arising from the payment of  the foreign debt. A total of 43 percent of the Honduran budget  is used to pay the foreign debt. If we add what goes to pay  bureaucracy to this, we are facing a truly dramatic situation.  Some institutions have told me that almost 90 percent of their  budget is used to pay for administration. After that, what is  left for the institution's goals? What I want to tell you is  that we have not discussed [word indistinct] appears in the  press; we have not started to discuss this. Nevertheless, we  have initiated discussions on Hondutel [Honduran  Telecommunications Enterprise]. This has an even more profound  effect on Honduran economy.    [Unidentified reporter] On the Palmerola issue, can you give  us more details. Will your government send the foreign troops,  the American troops, deployed there away, or are they going to  stay?    [Reina] [words indistinct] is still pending, but I can give  you some hints. I believe we should see if it is good for  Honduras -- taking into account international cooperation -- to  maintain the installations. We must take into account 1) this is  a Honduran base; 2) the arguments for and against this  installation will be discussed at the National Congress, and 3)  the people must be directly asked what is their opinion on this  matter. The international context changed from a Cold War to an  agenda of international cooperation.    As far as Hondutel is concerned, there are two firm  proposals. One is from [name indistinct], which was published in  the press. I believe it is very attractive and very [word  indistinct] proposal. Why this? Well, because there is a way to  take advantage of these [words indistinct] and to become more  efficient as an institution.    [Reporter] Have the Armed Forces begun the debate on  privatization?    [Reina] This all depends on whether we are convinced it is  good for Honduras. In any case, I have firmly committed that if  it is done it will be because it is good for Honduras, its  economy, and the future of its people. It will be done with the  utmost honesty, [words indistinct], controlled, reviewed,  supervised, so there is not the slightest doubt of a dirty deal  behind the privatization. [passage omitted]    What we have to do is present a proposal and discuss it with  the Armed forces and the other institutions. This proposal has  three options: 1) there will be no more forced recruitment; 2)  the Armed Forces has a proposal on the selection of members of  this armed institution; and 3) our proposal that recruitment be  on a volunteer- educational basis. This can be included and  should be included in our proposal to the legislative assembly.    As far as Palmerola is concerned, within the context of the  Cold War, it is a human tragedy that has lasted for almost half  a century, from 1945 post war, to 1989, 1990, 1991, depending on  the region where world tensions were being eliminated. There are  people who still have the Cold War mind-set; they would like  those tensions and ideological confrontations to return. This  must be discussed in depth and light must be shed on the  Palmerola issue.    This is the result of extending an agreement not a treaty.  The difference between an agreement and a treaty, for those who  are not lawyers, is that an agreement does not have to be  submitted to Congress while a treaty needs to be submitted to  Congress. Everything relating to military matters should be  submitted to Congress. During that time, however, we were  involved in a national security situation. Those were very  difficult times for Honduras, the hemisphere, and humanity.  There was an arms race going on that was going to become the War  of the Galaxy. That is why we firmly opposed this because  Honduras was going to be the scene of a world war.    Having overcome this, the discussion must center on whether  international cooperation and collaboration can help us  accomplish the points of the new agenda. What are these points?  Human rights, ecology, drug trafficking, fighting poverty, and  the improvement of justice. This is what we must discuss. We  must no longer talk about who is or is not a communist, which  was a common topic within the context of the Cold War. If this  can be done and be discussed in-depth at Congress, the decision  regarding such installations will come from here. [passage  omitted]    [Reporter Diaz] [words indistinct] to improve the country's  economic situation by reducing the fiscal deficit. Aside from  the talks on the privatization of some enterprises and taking  into account that 90 percent of the budget of different  institutions is used to pay personnel, could your administration  -- as other governments have promised to do many times -- reduce  state bureaucracy?    [Reina] Miss Edith Diaz, Mr. Jaime Rosenthal said in his  letter issued the day before yesterday that the problem is not  the fiscal deficit per se, which is very appropriate. He said  the problem is the deficit with the balance of payments, namely  the commercial balance. He indicated that we do not export  enough; we import more than we export, thereby incurring  deficits. Consequently, we must produce more to be able to  export more. I think he is saying the right thing.    But your question centers more on how and when the fiscal  deficit will be cut. When we talk about Hondutel, it is  precisely for that purpose. Petrodollars came and these  countries got irresponsibly into debt. Now 43 percent of the  budget goes to pay this debt, while another large percentage is  used to pay state employees. There is no money left for the  development of the country. How can we advance like this? Where  did the borrowed money go to? How was it spent? How was it  invested?    To reduce state bureaucracy, one must know how we received  the country in January 1994 and take measures to cleanse the  economy. This begins by fighting corruption. To reduce the  government, the problem is sometimes how to compensate people  employed by the government. For example, these people's salaries  were increased so they would have larger benefits. I have asked  if we must eliminate excess personnel? I was told yes, but we  must pay so many millions in severance pay. This is a  straitjacket for the government. What do we do? Do we break the  law and not compensate them? Do we go further into debt to pay  the compensations? Do we leave officials in office who do not  have any duties? Do not go into politics because this is very  difficult. It is not easy to resolve these problems, but we are  going to face them. We must overcome... [pauses] because these  situations can be overcome. A government team with good  intentions, courage, determination, a team of the best men can  do so. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 30 May (KUNA) -- The PLO has strongly denied  the existence of an agreement with Israel to deport Palestinian  refugees in Lebanon to east Europe.    The PLO added in a statement, a copy which has reached KUNA,  that it has become necessary to reiterate clearly and publicly  that there was no foundation whatsoever to the reports on the  deportation of thousands of people to East European counties, to  al-Hirmil, to the Biqa' valley, or anywhere else.    The statement went on to say: It is important that our  people everywhere, particularly in Lebanon, should know that the  PLO did not reach agreement with anyone on the problem of  Palestinian refugees in Lebanon or elsewhere.    The statement described such reports as fabrications which  could only be hatched by people with bad intentions who fish for  rumors in order to use them to the detriment of the Palestinian  people's unity. It added that the "problem of refugees is a  sacred topic which no one should manipulate. It is furthermore  an issue which revolves around the sacred right of return which  is cherished by the PLO and every Palestinian."</p>

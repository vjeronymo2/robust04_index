			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EXPERTS PROBE RUBBLE OF BRONX GAS BLAST  </P> <P> Investigators sifted through the charred rubble surrounding a Bronx power plant  Saturday, trying to reconstruct events leading up to a massive gas explosion  that killed two people and injured scores of others.  </P> <P> Consolidated Edison sent a team of experts to its Hellgate power facility,  where more than 100 utility repairmen were working to fix five electricity  feeders damaged in the spectacular Friday afternoon blast.  </P> <P> The thunderous explosion, apparently touched off when a Con Ed worker backed a  backhoe into an exposed gas line, sent bright orange flames surrounded by  plumes of thick black smoke hundreds of feet into the air.  </P> <P> The monstrous blaze forced the utility to shut off electric service for  hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers on Friday, paralyzing subway service for  evening rush hour commuters.  </P> <P> Electric service was restored, but customers on the Upper East Side of  Manhattan were asked to limit usage to prevent an overload on the system.  </P> <P> Utility investigators were trying to determine the exact cause of the explosion  and whether the utility's construction crew was aware of the gas line, said  Laurie Hanson, a Con Ed spokeswoman.  </P> <P> It was unclear whether government officials would take part in the  investigation. Con Ed comes under the purview of the state's Public Service  Commission. A spokesman for the commission was not available for comment.  </P> <P> The fire damaged the Hellgate facility itself, destroyed a nearby recycling  plant, demolished at least 20 cars and forced police to evacuate residents from  the area.  </P> <P> Hundreds of firefighters battled the five-alarm blaze, which abated somewhat  after Con Ed shut off the gas line feeding the fire about an hour after the  explosion.  </P> <P> The operator of the backhoe, Louis Seminario, 58, of Queens, was declared dead  at the scene, officials said. One other unidentified person, a teen-ager who  apparently was a bystander, was pulled from the East River and later died from  a heart attack.  </P> <P> More than 30 firefighters and eight others suffered injuries in the explosion  and fire, officials said.  </P> <P> Authorities ordered police in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens to work overtime  to prevent looting and vandalism, but no incidents were reported, officials  said.  </P></p>

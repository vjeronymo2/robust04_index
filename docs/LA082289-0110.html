			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOCAL GAS ENDS OPPOSITION TO WY-CAL PROJECT;  </P> <P> SIGNS OPTION TO BUY SPACE ON PIPELINE  </P> <P> Wy-Cal Pipeline Co. -- the underdog in the race to build a natural gas pipeline  into California -- got a boost Monday when Southern California Gas Co. agreed  to drop its opposition to the project and signed an option to buy space on the  pipeline.  </P> <P> Wy-Cal, which has proposed a 1,000-mile, $665-million pipeline from Wyoming to  Kern County, said SoCal Gas had agreed to an option to buy space to move no  less than 75 million cubic feet a day of gas on the pipeline, the maximum  capacity of which is 650 million cubic feet a day, over the next 20 years.  </P> <P> The announcement comes a week after Wy-Cal announced that Pacific Gas &amp;  Electric Co. had acted on its option to buy 50 million cubic feet a day on the  same pipeline over 20 years. As a result, PG&amp;E got an option to buy up to  25% of WyCal.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'An Ongoing Contest'  </P> <P> The announcements apparently rejuvenate the Wy-Cal project, which had fallen  behind rival Kern River Gas Transmission Co. in its bid to build a pipeline  from the Rocky Mountains.  </P> <P> Wy-Cal also has a letter of intent from Southern California Edison to transport  50 million cubic feet of gas a day for 15 years.  </P> <P> "It's still an ongoing contest . . . (but) it reaffirms that Wy-Cal is still a  viable contestant in what has been called the gold rush to California," said  Ellen Beswick, editor and publisher of the industry newsletter Natural Gas  Intelligence in Washington.  </P> <P> The two projects and several others are competing for a share of the expected  strong market for natural gas in California.  </P> <P> Wy-Cal has an added advantage over Kern River: a certificate from the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission. Kern River's application with FERC is pending.  </P> <P> If SoCal Gas exercises its option with Wy-Cal, it can buy a portion of the  pipeline's California facility after 20 years. SoCal has a similar agreement  with Kern River, said gas company spokesman Richard S. Terrell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Previous Agreement  </P> <P> A Kern River spokesman said his project had customers interested in more than  800 million cubic feet a day, including firm commitments for 180 million cubic  feet a day.  </P> <P> SoCal Gas previously agreed to move 150 million cubic feet a day on the Kern  River pipeline and 200 million cubic feet a day on the Altamont pipeline from  Canada that would connect with the Kern River system.  </P> <P> In keeping its options open with both competing pipelines, SoCal Gas "is just  hedging (its) bets now," Beswick said.  </P></p>

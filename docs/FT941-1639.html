			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Institutional investment The government's institutional investment figures for the final quarter of 1993 bear all the footprints of fund managers stampeding into the fashionable assets of the day. There was strong net investment in overseas securities and property as investors scrambled to fulfil the targets set by their asset allocation committees. It is perhaps little surprise that many overseas markets have proved groggy since and property shares have paused for breath. Institutional liquidity will be fuelled again this year by rising dividends, the ending of many pension fund holidays and strong sales of single-premium investment products by the life insurance sector. Theoretically, that should help UK financial markets. With cash inflows remaining high and the rate of gilts and equity issuance dropping sharply, markets should be squeezed higher by the sheer weight of money. The inflow of fresh funds into institutions may reach Pounds 55bn this year while the government's funding requirement will drop from Pounds 50bn to Pounds 38bn. The flow of rights issues has abated; flotations are only likely to absorb part of that shortfall. But that happy investment scenario tends to overlook the influences on the existing owners of stocks and assets. Hedge funds have been pruning their holdings and overseas investors have turned tail in the gilts market. UK institutions may be flush with cash this year but the signs are they will have to take up a lot more of the running.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cynthia Malta] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Brazil is proposing to its  Common Market of the South [Mercosur] partners -- Argentina,  Paraguay, and Uruguay -- the establishment of stricter rules for  certificates of origin. These rules would go into effect in  1995, by which time the four countries will be exchanging  products without charging customs fees. The current rules  contemplate a minimum national content of 50 percent in each  product, with the possibility that the tariff may be changed.  Ambassador Paulo Nogueira Batista, the Brazilian representative  before the Latin American Integration Association [ALADI] in  Montevideo, has said that Brazil proposes increasing this  percentage to 75 percent and demands that product  classifications be modified. He said that if it is not possible  to enforce stricter rules, the trade of vehicles within the  Mercosur would continue via import quotas, even after January  1995.    The Brazilian Government may begin to negotiate a bilateral  free trade agreement for the implementation of the South  American Free Trade Area [SAFTA] without affecting its trade  within Mercosur. Ambassador Nogueira Batista pointed out that  the Asuncion Treaty, which created the Mercosur, allows this  initiative. Interested countries can present exception lists on  which certain products would be protected by higher tariffs.  The remaining products would have zero tariffs for 10 years as  of January 1995. Jorge Campbell, Argentine secretary for  international economic relations, has reservations about the  negotiation of accords to create SAFTA. He said: "The countries  that negotiate these accords will have access to an agreement  which took us a long time to negotiate."</p>

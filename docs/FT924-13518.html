			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Political hara-kiri NOTHING EPITOMISED Mr Shin Kanemaru's political life so much as his leaving of it yesterday. Behind closed doors, surrounded by factional henchmen, the godfather of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party resigned his parliamentary seat in response to public anger over his involvement in the country's latest political bribery scandal. That this is a significant development is not in doubt. For years Mr Kanemaru has been by far the most important powerbroker in the LDP's most powerful faction, responsible for prime ministerial appointments (including that of the current incumbent, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa) as well as substantial policy directions. His departure will, in the short term at least, destabilise the party, as would-be inheritors squabble over his mantle. Just possibly, it will also mark the beginning of action by Japan's political leadership to reform itself and in the long term make the Japanese political system more transparent, less expensive and so less prey to corruption. Western critics should be wary of taking too high a moral stance over this affair. Japan is not alone in having corrupt politicians, and its system has produced manifest success. The LDP has presided over more than three decades of stability, peace and economic growth, a record which parties in the US and Europe can only envy. Other countries have arguably suffered more than Japan from pork-barrel politics. One of the reasons US public finances are in a mess is because parochial American politicians protect cherished local spending programmes. The LDP, by contrast, oversaw a fiscal consolidation in the past decade and thus enabled the government to announce an emergency programme of Y10,700bn (Pounds 45bn) to stimulate the economy. Factional politics Moreover, in the wake of the collapse of communism, politics in the west is taking on some Japanese characteristics. It is becoming less ideological, more managerial and in parties such as the British Conservatives, who have been in power for more than a decade, more factional. Nevertheless the latest scandal, in which Mr Kanemaru has admitted taking Y500m in illegal contributions from the Sagawa Kyubin company, raises troubling questions. Not the least of them concerns transparency: who really holds power in Japan? Is it shadowy 'kingmakers' whom foreigners rarely meet and who owe their position more to their fund-raising abilities than their electoral standing? And who holds power now? It does not seem to be Mr Miyazawa, who has been left hanging in mid-air by the struggle to succeed Mr Kanemaru, at a time when the economy is in a parlous state, Japan is in delicate negotiations with Russia over the Kurile islands and the Gatt talks are in the balance. Corrupt ways A thread of corruption runs through Japanese politics largely because of the system of medium sized, multi-member constituencies, which means a single party can win several seats in the same constituency. Politicians from the same party find it difficult to differentiate themselves by ideology, so they compensate through their munificence. They need a constant supply of money, which mainly comes from companies who expect favours in return. This is a system in need of change. Mr Miyazawa has promised a plan for reform this November. For that to be more than window dressing it would need to include measures for more open disclosure of sources of political funding and the imposition of much tougher penalties on those who flout the law. It should set out a timetable for replacing the multi-member constituencies with smaller, single-member seats and redressing the imbalance between over-represented rural areas - where the 'old ways' of Japanese politics are still most entrenched - and under-represented towns and cities. A government weakened by Mr Kanemaru's resignation and tainted by controversy is not obviously in a position to deliver such sweeping reforms. Until the political system is transformed, the disparity between Japan's internationalising economy and a parochial political system that encourages politicians to focus on funding their electoral machines can only grow.</p>

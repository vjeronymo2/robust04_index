			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: Viacom tops the Paramount bill - A look at the final offers for the entertainment group The Dollars 10bn, five-month takeover battle for entertainment group Paramount Communications may be within days of a final showdown, with cable company Viacom holding an apparent lead but television shopping channel QVC Network still fighting hard to win investor support. Shareholders have until midnight, New York time, on Monday to decide between the bidders' final offers, and victory will go to whichever company wins over 50 per cent of Paramount's stock. However, if neither side gets over half the shares, the battle will continue and the bidders will be free to alter their terms again. During the final few days of the campaign, both Mr Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom, and Mr Barry Diller, the film industry executive who heads QVC, have been wooing the big institutional investors and Wall Street traders who control much of Paramount's stock in a succession of face to face meetings. Two issues dominate these sessions: the relative value of the offers, and which bidder will be better able to exploit the assets of Paramount, which include Hollywood film studios, book publishing, theme parks and New York's Madison Square Garden sports arena. A significant number of investors have already made clear that they intend to tender their shares to Viacom unless QVC can improve its terms, which the rules of the Paramount auction forbid it from doing before Monday's close. Viacom is offering Dollars 107 a share in cash for 50.1 per cent of Paramount's stock, compared to QVC's Dollars 104 a share. The package of common stock and other securities QVC is offering for the remaining 49.9 per cent has a higher theoretic market value than that in Viacom's bid, giving the overall QVC bid a value of around Dollars 86 a share to Viacom's Dollars 81.50. QVC's apparent lead is due partly to the fact that Viacom's shares have fallen sharply as it has looked more like the winner, while QVC's shares have risen. Investors are concerned about the amount of Viacom paper that will flood the market in the event of victory, as well as the debt the winner will be taking on. However, many investors say they prefer the Viacom offer because it guarantees to pay up to Dollars 12 a share if its stock trades below a certain level in the year after a Paramount takeover. The QVC bid lacks any such mechanism and Mr Diller argues that 'there are no safe harbours. There might appear to be but there really aren't. They are illusions'. However, QVC has been hinting that its largest backer, the telephone company BellSouth, might give a degree of share price support by offering to buy a certain amount of QVC stock at a particular price over a period of years. But if it did so before Monday night it might be accused of breaking the auction rules. As for strategic fit between the two companies, shareholders are essentially being presented with a choice between Viacom's depth of management and broad range of businesses, and Mr Diller's individual proven flair for turning around troubled Hollywood studios. Paramount Pictures, the crown jewel among Paramount's assets and the reason the takeover battle has been fought so long and hard, has a distinctly lacklustre track record - a fact underlined last week when the group warned it would suffer a loss of Dollars 35m to Dollars 40m in its third quarter. Mr Diller, who headed Paramount during one of the studio's successful phases, and then went on to launch Mr Rupert Murdoch's Fox business as a fourth television network, says the group's film and television operations need most work. 'And I've the most experience in those areas . . . that's not the experience the other side has. It will take them longer.' Viacom - which bought many of its creative businesses, rather than building them from scratch - argues that it is the better bet because a merger with Paramount, together with its simultaneous Dollars 8bn bid for Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental retailer, will create a 'global entertainment powerhouse'. Viacom says it will bring to the partnership much more depth of management, its own successful track record in television programming and Blockbuster's strong cash flow and film and record retailing chain. The combination will offer new distribution channels for Paramount's studios. Wall Street was initially unenthusiastic about a Viacom-Blockbuster-Paramount deal, largely on the grounds that Blockbuster's video rental business is going to be made obsolete by inter-active, video-on-demand in the home. But some analysts have since warmed to the combination. Says Mr Christopher Dixon of Paine Webber: 'The ability to create efficiencies, cross promote and develop new businesses holds enormous promise.' The idea of Mr Diller reviving Paramount still excites Wall Street, which for the most part believes both bidders would be worthy winners. But with the strategic arguments finely balanced, perceptions of short-term shareholder value will win the day, and right now that looks like handing victory to Viacom.</p>

			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AUG. 31 DEADLINE FOR EASTERN REFUND  </P> <P> Customers who bought Eastern Airlines tickets and were unable to use them  because of the strike have until Aug. 31 to file claims with the court involved  in Eastern's bankruptcy proceedings, the Department of Transportation said  today.  </P> <P> The department said it was issuing a consumer advisory because it believed that  many ticket-holders might not have heard about the deadline. Eastern and the  bankruptcy court initially advised passengers not to file claims until a  procedure was established, the advisory said.  </P> <P> On July 21, Eastern filed a plan calling for full refunds in cash, with  interest, to people holding unused tickets purchased before March 9. The court  involved is the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Letter: The pricing of CDs in the US and the UK Sir, In your editorial on compact disc pricing, you recommend that the competition authorities follow the lead set by Australia, which has concluded that a ban on parallel imports is against the public interest. As the managing director of an independent record company I know that consumers will stand to gain little from such a measure when it comes into force next year and that the Australian record industry, particularly the smaller independent companies, stand to lose much. The prohibition of parallel imports keeps the record industries of the world in balance and is practised by all the major music producing countries, including the USA, Canada, Germany, Italy and Spain. Its purpose is to stop domestic markets being flooded by cheap imports that attack the ability of the indigenous record industries to produce a wide variety of product for the home market. The USA, just as much as smaller territories, have very severe and rigorously enforced regulations covering foreign imports. Only last year copies of U2's Achtung Baby were turned away at the American border because they were not of American manufacture. While the US authorities have no intention of abolishing their own restrictions - and they don't - it would be disastrous to dispense with our own. At present, record companies grant licenses covering the use of their rights to foreign companies on a territory-by-territory basis and artists are sometimes signed to different labels in different territories. The absence of import controls in the UK alone handicaps British record companies in their own domestic market, while their competitors continue to enjoy full protection. The first to suffer will be the independents, both record companies and retailers. Cheap overseas recordings will push the companies out of business, while retailers without American operations through which they can purchase and re-route stock - all but HMV and WH Smith - will be severely disadvantaged. Import controls are fundamental to the exploitation of intellectual property rights in music. Their abolition here would deprive the UK of the creative and independent seed-bed from which the British record industry has, up till now, flourished.

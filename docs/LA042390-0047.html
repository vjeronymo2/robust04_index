			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECRETARIES: A SNAPSHOT OF THE PROFESSOR  </P> <P> You should be especially nice to your secretary this week. And not just because  this happens to be Professional Secretaries Week but also because secretaries  are already in short supply and demand for their services is growing.  </P> <P> Nationally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 16.9% increase in  secretarial jobs nationwide by the year 2000. In Southern California, demand is  even stronger. The state Employment Development Department estimates that in  just five years -- from 1987 to 1992 -- the number of openings for secretaries  in Los Angeles County will increase by 15.3%, to 144,580. (Orange County, over  the same period, is expected to show an 8.3% rise, to 31,510 openings.)  </P> <P> Professional Secretaries Week was established in 1952 as an effort by  Professional Secretaries International to upgrade the image of the profession.  </P> <P> Strictly secretarial job classifications, which the government reports under  three occupational employment statistics codes, have been used for the  accompanying statistics. Classifications include medical and legal secretaries  but exclude such general office occupations as clerks, receptionists, typists  and stenographers.  </P> <P> Number of secretaries  </P> <P> Nationally  </P> <P> In millions  </P> <P> 1983: 3.16  </P> <P> 1984: 3.13  </P> <P> 1985: 3.25  </P> <P> 1986: 3.21  </P> <P> 1987: 3.29  </P> <P> 1988: 3.21  </P> <P> 1989: 3.14  </P> <P> </P> <P> Median weekly earnings  </P> <P> Nationally  </P> <P> 1983: $252  </P> <P> 1989: $328  </P> <P> </P> <P> Profile  </P> <P> Based on 1988 data  </P> <P> Median age: 36.7  </P> <P> Median schooling: 12.8  </P> <P> 99.1% are female  </P> <P> 91.0% are white  </P> <P> 31.5% work part time  </P> <P> 68.5% work full time  </P> <P> </P> <P> Age  </P> <P> 1988 data  </P> <P> 60+ / 5.3%  </P> <P> 50-59 / 13%  </P> <P> 40-49 / 23%  </P> <P> 30-39 / 27.3%  </P> <P> 20-29 / 27.9%  </P> <P> Under 20 / 3.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tenure  </P> <P> 1987 data  </P> <P> Median years in profession: 7.5%  </P> <P> 20+ years / 13.7%  </P> <P> 10-19 years / 26.5%  </P> <P> 4-9 years / 29.3%  </P> <P> 3 years / 30.5%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Southern California Salaries  </P> <P> (middle range) As of Aug. 1989  </P> <P> Orange County: high: 27,976 / low: 22,360  </P> <P> Los Angeles County: high: 28,288 / low: 21,892  </P> <P> </P> <P> How they entered the profession:  </P> <P> In 1987, 16.7% od secretaries entered the profession.  </P> <P> Occupational transfers: 6.7%  </P> <P> From unemployment: 2.4%  </P> <P> Not previously in labor force:  </P> <P> 7.6%  </P> <P> </P> <P> How they left:  </P> <P> To other jobs: 5.7%  </P> <P> To unemployment: 1.7%  </P> <P> Left workforce: 7.2%  </P> <P> </P></p>

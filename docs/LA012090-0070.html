			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOSTER CLUB MEMBER DEFENDS GROUP'S ROLE  </P> <P> As a member of the Huntington Beach (High School) Football Booster Club, I find  myself always a little perturbed by the way "we" seem to come off in almost  every article written that mentions our suit against the (Southern Section)  last November.  </P> <P> Our Booster Club is made up of intelligent, caring, supportive parents who felt  that a terrible wrong had been done to 66 young men who had set their sights on  a (Southern Section) championship from the first day of spring practice.  </P> <P> While I applaud (Southern Section commissioner) Stan Thomas' proposal to have  "in-service" sessions with the booster clubs so that everyone involved is made  aware of the rules, I would point out that the responsibility for informing  parents and players is in place in the (Southern Section), just not carried  out. As for the "control" issue, I believe boosters know what the function of  the club is -- financial and moral support.  </P> <P> One change I think would work is to initiate a committee of booster club  members who attend (Southern Section) general meetings after attending their  own league meetings. These representatives would be able to voice their  opinions on issues at hand but have no voting privileges.  </P> <P> Parents don't need to be threatened with expulsion from the (Southern Section)  or punished in any other way, because that will not silence the outcry nor  solve the problem. We see problems and want them solved.  </P> <P> LESLIE TAYLOR, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

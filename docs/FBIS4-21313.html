			<p>Trafficking   in Nepal   <F P=102> BK2104130394 Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES in English 16 Apr 94  p 7 </F>  <F P=103> BK2104130394 </F> <F P=104>  Delhi THE HINDUSTAN TIMES </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN   <F P=106> [From Arun Joshi] </F>   [Text] Madhubani, 15 April. The districts of Bihar  bordering Nepal appear to have become the major hunting ground  for the Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which has  stepped up its activities in the region in the recent past in a  bid to create dissension in India.    Indications suggest that the ISI which has been running  armed  training centres and well-managed bases in Bangladesh and Nepal  respectively, has infiltrated into these districts and begun its  exercise to lure target groups as a part of its long-term  strategy to fan subversive activities in the State.    Sources said Nepal, which has about a half a dozen ISI  bases,  provides a "free conduit" to the agents to enter the Indian  territory due to relaxed border regulations. The Himalayan  territory, the sources said, has of late become the main dumping  ground of drugs brought from Pakistan by the ISI. The money  earned through drug trafficking is converted into white money by  the Pakistani banks operating in Nepal and then transferred to  the names of charitable institutions or individuals operating in  the garb of social service.    In Madhubani district alone there are certain pockets having  considerable Muslim population where money flow to an average  family has witnessed unprecedented rise during the past couple  of years. Although some of the families have their members  employed in the Gulf countries, who regularly send money to  their dependents, there are indications that quite a few were  being regularly funded from "outside" in the name of religious  and social organisations. Intelligence reports suggest that  Disfi, Khajauli and Benipatti were the "most sensitive areas"  where the activities of certain fundamentalist organisations  were kept under constant vigil.    The Union Home Ministry, has recently alerted the bordering  district administration to keep watch on certain fundamentalist  organisations in view of the shift in the activities of the ISI  and its style of operation. "Although no specific incident of  any subversive kind has been reported so far, the district  administration is keeping constant watch on activities of  certain organisations and individuals. The ISI is very  professional in its functioning and it lures target groups on  long-term basis. We cannot take things for granted", Madhubani  SP [Superintendent of Police] Bhatti said.    On its part, the district administration has geared up its  resources to monitor the situation and prevent activities of any  such agency ought to create chaos in the district. A team of  Special Branch officials has been set up by the SP after a  directive received from the Home Ministry to keep vigil on  suspects having ISI links.    Reports said that the Ahle Hadees, a Muslim organisation  suspected in the Bombay bomb blasts has been regularly  organising "classes" after the Ayodhya incident at Disfi. Some  other fundamentalist organisations have also sent their  emissaries to this region to find "suitable recruits" for a  noble cause of avenging onslaught on their religious sentiments.  Significantly, two accused of the Calcutta bomb-blast case, of  whom one was arrested while other is still at large, belonged to  this area. Both of them were hired by men of Dubai-based Dawood  Ibrahim.    Eyebrows have been raised both by the police as well as some  local residents over opening of an English medium school at  Piprahi, a remote village under Ladania block of the district  along the international border, by a Kashmiri youth in  association with two Japanese women settled at Kathmandu.  Enquiries revealed that the Japanese women aged 45 years, owned  a leather garment factory in Kathmandu. The Kashmiri youth  Abdul Qayum Gilani and another Japanese girl stayed together  with the women in Kathmandu. It is learnt that the trio owned  one of the biggest leather factories with highest turnover in  Nepal.    Earlier they had plans to open the school at Murshidabad  along the Bangladesh border but they changed their mind after  lot of persuasion by a Muslim youth from the Piprahi village who  worked in their leather factory. The Dreamland English medium  school, as it is named has a four-roomed building on a piece of  three kathas [about one seventh of an acre] of land donated by  one Bindeshwar Chaudhary of this village. The school was  inaugurated by the former MLA of this area, Mahendra Narayan Jha  in the presence of several officers and senior citizens.    Abdul Qayum Gilani, however refuted allegations of opening  the school with any ulterior motive. Piqued over the police  raid the other day and the previous night, Mr. Gilani said that  the administration had no right to disturb a bona fide citizen  of the country like this when he was available for satisfying  the queries throughout the day. The two Japanese women were  also present when this correspondent visited the school.    Asked why he chose that remote village to run the school, he  said "since childhood I have been nourishing the wish to serve  the poor and the weaker section of the society. It was just a  chance that we selected this site. Moreover, a local Muslim  youth who happens to be an employee of our factory approached me  and offered a piece of land for the school."    Gilani, who is trying for Japanese citizenship, said that he  was adopted by the Japanese woman as her son about 12 years ago  and since then he had been living with her in Kathmandu. The  young Japanese girl, he said, was his fiancee and they were  likely to be married very soon.</p>

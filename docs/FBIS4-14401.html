			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maksim Yusin report: "Moscow Does Not Want To Fall Out </F> With Washington and Seoul Over Kim Il-song's Nuclear Ambitions"]    [Text] "There has been no change in Russia's position on  the Korean crisis. The main thing for us is for Pyongyang to  meet its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  If the UN Security Council considers a resolution requiring  North Korea to admit International Atomic Energy Agency  inspectors to its nuclear installations, Russia's representative  will vote in favor," Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr  Panov, who is responsible for the Far East region at the Foreign  Ministry, said during an interview with IZVESTIYA.    It was Panov's statement to journalists early this week that  caused a slight shock around the world. News agencies carried  flashes that Moscow intends to observe the 1961 treaty between  the Soviet Union and the DPRK and offer Pyongyang assistance "in  the event of unprovoked aggression."    "My words were taken out of context," Panov explained. "When  answering the journalist's questions I only reiterated our  position, which contains nothing new; it was formulated a year  ago. Russia as the legal successor to the USSR will fulfill its  commitments under the 1961 treaty. However, mindful of the fact  that the world situation is totally different now, we will act  on the basis of our own analysis, act in Russia's interests, and  take into consideration not only the treaty with North Korea,  but also our country's other international commitments,  including on nuclear nonproliferation."    You could see from what the deputy minister said that he  wanted to place the emphasis on the latter part of his answer  but journalists focused their attention on the first sentence.  As a result a distorted notion of Russia's approach developed.  Nevertheless, Panov asserts that both Seoul and Washington have  correctly appraised the situation.    Moscow quite possibly had to provide additional explanations  to ensure that. Be that as it may, U.S. State Department  spokesman Michael McCurry said Wednesday that his country does  not feel worried by what the Russian diplomat said. And South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam, acknowledging Russia's role in  settling the crisis, has decided to send Foreign Minister Han  Sung-chu to Moscow. According to reports from Smolenskaya  Square [Russian Foreign Ministry], the visit, the dates of which  have not yet been agreed, will presumably go ahead in the second  half of April.    While trying to exploit the situation on the Korean  Peninsula  to strengthen its positions in Asia, Russia is at the same time  by no means keen to fall out with Washington and Seoul over  Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions. Significantly, Moscow, unlike  Beijing, is willing to back a UN Security Council resolution  designed to step up international pressure on the "great  leader." Russia has no wish to gain a reputation as the patron  of a loathsome Communist regime. And however much people in  Pyongyang may recall a treaty dating back 33 years, its  significance should hardly be overestimated.    In conversation with IZVESTIYA Aleksandr Panov admitted that  "unprovoked aggression" by any state against the DPRK is  virtually impossible at the moment. Consequently there are no  grounds for talking, even hypothetically, about military aid for  Kim Il-song from Moscow.</p>

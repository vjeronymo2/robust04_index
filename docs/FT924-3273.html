			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Central bankers elect Dutch head EUROPEAN Community central bank governors yesterday elected Mr Wim Duisenberg, head of the Dutch central bank, as the chairman to take them further down the road towards monetary union, Reuter reports from Basle. The EC bank governors' committee, viewed as the embryo of a future EC central bank, appointed Mr Duisenberg to replace Denmark's Erik Hoffmeyer. Mr Hoffmeyer was appointed as an acting chairman last year to serve out the term of the then Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, after his resignation. Mr Duisenberg, 57, and a social democrat, is a late convert to the idea of government budgetary restraint which will be one of the main criteria for allowing EC members to join in an eventual single currency. He served as Dutch finance minister from 1973 to 1977 in a socialist-led government which tried to spend its way out of the effects of the first oil crisis. He left politics in 1978 after a brief stint in parliament to take a seat on the board of Rabobank, a co-operative bank for agriculture. The governors' committee has grown in power and influence since the first stage of the EC planned progress towards Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) in 1990. EC governments have given it some powers to co-ordinate policy. It can offer opinions on the monetary and exchange rate policy of member states and convey these to members and finance ministers. It is envisaged that the committee should later take on the role of an EC central bank in the second stage of full Emu, due to occur in 1997 at the earliest and 1999 at the latest. But after he was appointed a central bank director and then its president in 1981, he became one of the leading critics of what he saw as government overspending and expanding deficits. As head of the Dutch central bank he has successfully managed a low-inflation monetary policy very closely tied to that of Germany, the Netherlands' biggest trading partner. But in contrast to the Bundesbank, he has in the past argued that monetary policy should not be exclusively the preserve of central banks.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ CLAIMS PULLOUT, BUT FEW BELIEVE IT;  </P> <P> PERSIAN GULF: HUSSEIN SAYS MORE TROOPS WILL LEAVE KUWAIT THIS WEEK. OTHERS FIND  NO EVIDENCE OF A MAJOR WITHDRAWAL.  </P> <P> Iraq said that it began pulling its troops out of Kuwait on Sunday and promised  to withdraw more forces Tuesday, but officials outside the Persian Gulf emirate  said there was no evidence of any significant withdrawal.  </P> <P> Reaction ranged from skepticism to President Bush's flat accusation that the  Baghdad government of President Saddam Hussein had "lied once again."  </P> <P> Baghdad Television showed images of tanks being loaded onto flatbed trucks and  a long line of tanker vehicles, jeeps and trucks said to be headed home from  Kuwaiti territory. Diplomatic sources in the gulf said that northbound highways  in southern Kuwait were closed, and motorists were told that the closures were  to make way for Iraq-bound troops.  </P> <P> In a statement from the Iraqi capital, the official spokesman for Iraq's  general command gave no estimate of the number of troops claimed to have been  withdrawn, but he said that the pullout began at 8 a.m.  </P> <P> "After military units completed their withdrawal today," the spokesman said,  "and as security is stable in Kuwait, it has been decided to withdraw other  units the day after tomorrow, Tuesday."  </P> <P> Baghdad Radio said that people in Iraq's southern Basra province "lined the  streets to welcome the (returning) soldiers, greeting them with the victory  sign and cheers for Saddam Hussein."  </P> <P> Several government officials and diplomats in the region said there was no  indication that Hussein had withdrawn any major portion of his 100,000-strong  invasion force. Some reports said that thousands of troops from Iraq's newly  designated Kuwaiti "popular" army spread out into the tiny sheikdom throughout  the day.  </P> <P> "I have not seen any evidence that they are pulling out, and my personal belief  is that they are not," said an official in Cairo with access to intelligence  reports. "It means for some reason they are considering other alternatives,  which are legion -- none of them good."  </P> <P> In Washington, President Bush dismissed the new government set up by Iraq in  Kuwait as a "puppet regime" and said there was no indication that Iraq's  four-day-old occupation of its tiny neighbor is nearing an end.  </P> <P> Amid mounting international pressure on Iraq to end the invasion, the new  nine-man military government named by Iraq issued a warning to countries with  citizens living in Kuwait to carefully consider any sanctions. An estimated 1  million foreigners are believed to be working in Kuwait.  </P> <P> "Countries that resort to punitive measures against the provisional free Kuwait  government and fraternal Iraq . . . should remember that they have interests  and nationals in Kuwait," warned the new foreign minister, Walid Saud Mohammed  Abdullah. "These countries should also not expect us to act honorably at a time  when they are conspiring against us and our brothers in Iraq in an aggressive  way."  </P> <P> The Iraqi-installed government also announced that beginning today, it was  easing a blanket curfew in force since the invasion to allow people to move  about during daylight hours, Reuters news agency reported.  </P> <P> Some of the first information in several days trickled out of the Kuwaiti  capital early today from a group of Arab reporters escorted to Kuwait from  Baghdad by the Hussein government.  </P> <P> According to their reports, most Kuwaiti residents remained huddled in their  homes, and abandoned cars littered the streets in some areas, some smashed by  tanks seeking to clear the roadways. The Kuwaiti Ministry of Defense building  and a nearby military academy showed signs of heavy fighting, and residents  reported that while Iraqi troops had overrun the country in a matter of hours,  scattered gunfire exchanges could still be heard at night.  </P> <P> Estimates of the number killed and injured in the fighting have ranged from 300  to 800, and reports on Saturday said that invading Iraqi troops had penetrated  Kuwaiti territory clear to the "neutral zone" on Kuwait's frontier with Saudi  Arabia. Only a couple of parallel fences spaced about half a mile apart  reportedly separate the invaders from Saudi Arabian territory at that point.  </P> <P> In a statement carried by Iraq's official news agency, the new Kuwaiti  government said it planned to initiate immediate negotiations with "sisterly  Iraq" on such issues as the long-running border dispute between Iraq and Kuwait  -- one of the contentious issues cited as having provoked Iraq's invasion  before dawn Thursday.  </P> <P> "We hope to resolve (these issues) in the interests of ensuring and  safeguarding the security of Iraq and Kuwait, who together are bound by the  same fate," said the newly appointed Kuwaiti prime minister, Col. Ala Hussein  Ali.  </P> <P> Kuwait's exiled emir, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah, broke a three-day silence  since he disappeared from the Kuwaiti capital and, sheltered in an undisclosed  location believed to be in Saudi Arabia, broadcast an appeal over Saudi and  Bahraini television.  </P> <P> "What makes our hearts filled with sadness is that the source of this  unjustified aggression was not an enemy, but a brother and a close neighbor to  whom we have lent our support during his time of difficulty," the sheik said,  referring to the billions of dollars Kuwait loaned to Iraq to support its  eight-year war with Iran. "We have suffered a lot as a result of that," he  said.  </P> <P> A group of Kuwaiti officials, including four members of the Kuwaiti ruling  family who had been secretly shuttled out of the country, arrived Sunday night  in London and reported that Iraqi troops had engaged in looting, on occasions  ordering people out of their cars and taking their money. Various foreign  embassies in Kuwait have made similar reports.  </P> <P> In an interview from Amman, Jordan, acting Kuwaiti Ambassador Faisal Mukhaizem  said that one or more Kuwaiti F-1 Mirage jets bombed the headquarters of the  Iraqi military in Jahrah, near the Kuwaiti capital. Mukhaizem said the aircraft  were among a number of planes that the Kuwaiti government still controls, but  he declined to say where they are based.  </P> <P> "We are not going to specify from where those planes took off," he said. "For  political reasons, and strategic considerations, we would like to protect the  places where they have taken off from. It could be Bahrain, it could be Saudi  Arabia, it could be somewhere else. It could be from within Kuwait."  </P> <P> There was no independent confirmation of the report, and most diplomatic  sources were skeptical about it.  </P> <P> U.S. officials did not provide details about why they do not believe Iraq's  claim that it is withdrawing from Kuwait. White House Press Secretary Marlin  Fitzwater said there is "no independent or confirmable information" about the  claim, and he added that Iraqi President Hussein's "actions in the past raise  serious skepticism about his intentions."  </P> <P> Sen. David Boren (D-Okla.), Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told ABC-TV  that intelligence reports "do not indicate the Iraqis are moving out,  especially along the southern border. So if they are taking anybody out, it's  probably just a few people for show."  </P> <P> Iraq's first deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, told reporters after a  meeting with Turkish President Turgut Ozal that the troop withdrawal "will not  take long. Maybe a few days, maybe a few weeks." The two envoys presumably  discussed Western requests that Turkey shut down the pipeline through which  Iraq pumps more than half of its crude oil. Ramadan warned that a Turkish  decision to shut down the pipeline would "create mistrust" between the two  countries.  </P> <P> Iraq's intentions toward Saudi Arabia remained another unanswered question  Sunday, following the reports that thousands of Iraqi troops have massed near  Kuwait's southern border.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources in Saudi Arabia said there was still no evidence of an  imminent invasion across the Saudi border. Though there were some reports of  minor cross-border incursions, an official there said: "I have not seen a  single confirmed report of incursions across the border."  </P> <P> An American oil technician who recently returned from the border region told  the Associated Press that Saudi Arabia had deployed 200 to 300 tanks toward the  Kuwaiti border on Friday. But there have been no other reports of Saudi  military buildups in the region.  </P> <P> Jordan's King Hussein, trying to still fears of further Iraqi expansion, told  CBS News that Saddam Hussein does not intend to send troops south across the  desert border into Saudi Arabia.  </P> <P> Appealing to the West to stay out of the Persian Gulf crisis, King Hussein  said: "During the last few days there were pressures applied to bring not only  the majority of the world in line but to also influence Arab logic. Please  believe me . . . that intimidation does not work, that it could be  counterproductive and that we could be in a far worse situation than we are  facing at the moment."  </P> <P> More on Gulf Crisis  </P> <P> GETTING DEFENSIVE -- In a single stroke, Iraq has sparked new debate in  Congress over the shape and size of the U.S. military.A6  </P> <P> SYMBOLIC SLAP -- Economic sanctions seldom work, but they are popular in this  country because they make a strong statement.A6  </P> <P> RIPPLE EFFECT -- Governments along the Persian Gulf are feeling the shock waves  from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.A7  </P> <P> ARAB PRESSURE -- Middle East moderates are quietly backing outside economic  sanctions against fellow Arab Hussein.A7  </P></p>

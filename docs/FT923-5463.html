			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Banks want current accounts to pay their way: Customers have grown used to a free-if-in-credit banking regime. But the sharp fall in loan business during the recession means they are in for some changes FOR NEARLY a decade customers of the high street banks have been used to the idea that current account services come free if they keep their accounts in credit. This weekend the clearers indicated that they are considering reintroducing some charges. Mr Peter Radcliffe, banking director of Abbey National, one of the financial institutions that pioneered the present free-if-in-credit current accounts, believes that the end of this type of banking is less than three years away. During the past two years the cost of current accounts to those who pay for them - mainly customers with overdrafts - has been rising steadily. This month for example, National Westminster will increase its quarterly flat-rate fee for unauthorised overdrafts by 16 per cent, taking it to Pounds 55 per quarter for overdrafts of more than Pounds 50. This is typical of the way banks have been ratcheting up fixed-rate charges on overdrafts for many months. They have also been keeping overdraft interest rates at unprecedently high levels when rates generally have fallen by a third. In the summer of 1990 for example, the interest charge for an unauthorised overdraft on Midland's Orchard account or a Firstdirect account was 37.6 per cent. Today it is 37.4 per cent. Barclays' unauthorised overdraft rate has risen from 35.4 per cent a year ago to 37.3 per cent. Mr John Cheese, marketing director at Barclays, says: 'The fees for unauthorised overdrafts are designed to be punitive. From the bank's point of view it is not only that someone else is helping themselves to our money  -overdrafts are also a very high risk form of lending.' This does not entirely explain the steady upward march in overdraft charges. Nationwide's FlexAccount, launched in 1987, had no charges until April 1990, when it introduced fees of Pounds 10 for bouncing cheques and Pounds 7.50 for a warning letter. Since then the list of charges has grown steadily, though only for customers with overdrafts. In July this year Nationwide introduced a Pounds 10 monthly charge for unauthorised overdrafts on top of a battery of charges introduced in June, such as Pounds 6 for duplicate statements or stopping cheques. At the same time it raised its cheque-bouncing charge to Pounds 20. The charging system which emerged for current accounts in the 1980s has become difficult for banks to sustain in the recession as their balance sheets have been hit by bad debts. Consequently, customers with overdrafts have been bearing a steadily heavier burden of bank charges. The present charging structure dates back to the mid-1980s when the clearing banks began to compete more fiercely between themselves for customers and for the first time had to face a strong challenge from building societies for current-account customers. In 1984 Midland Bank introduced free-if-in-credit current accounts and the other clearers followed suit. Three years later, with the launch of Nationwide's FlexAccount, the market had its first interest-bearing, mass-market current account. This, and the interest-bearing current account launched by Abbey National the following year, swiftly picked up 1m customers each. To defend their customer bases, the high street banks felt obliged to offer their own interest-bearing current accounts. In January 1989 Lloyds led the way and the others soon followed. Although their interest-bearing current accounts were launched alongside old-style accounts, customers swiftly realised what they were missing out on. The arrival of the new generation of interest-bearing current accounts on top of free-if-in-credit banking meant that the banks were paying interest on accounts that were totally free to customers. The only category of customers who paid anything were those with overdrafts. The new accounts carried much steeper overdraft charges than before. By paying interest on current accounts, banks were deprived of their main source of current-account income - the interest earned by lending money in current accounts out at commercial rates of interest. So, for example, Lloyds estimates that 70 per cent of its current-account customers never pay any charges, while about 55 per cent have interest-bearing current accounts. The squeeze on the banks has been made harder by a sharp fall in the volumes of their business because of the recession. This leaves them with high fixed costs on their current-account operations, exacerbated by increased bad debts from lending in the boom years of the 1980s. Meanwhile lending activity - the side of their business from which their profits come in normal times - has shrunk. Mr Phil Nunnely, assistant general manager of retail banking at Lloyds, says: 'The banks' asset books are declining and their net interest income with it. So the banks are attacking the problem in two ways. One is to look very closely at their own cost bases and find ways of improving costs, while the other is to find means to boost their fee income.' One way forward would be to charge the customers whom the banks find most expensive, those who keep only small amounts of money in their accounts but make a large number of transactions. So far Halifax, the largest building society, has been the only large financial institution to grasp this nettle. Two years ago it introduced a charge for its 3.6m Cardcash account customers. They pay 60p each time they use a cash machine which does not belong to the society. Earlier this year it went further and introduced some transaction charges for Cardcash customers who keep less than Pounds 250 in their accounts. None of the clearing banks has yet done anything like this, but they have noted with interest that there was no tidal wave of complaints from Halifax customers about the charges. Banks have found various other ways of enhancing their income. For example a customer who takes out a loan today will almost certainly come under at least mild pressure to take out an insurance policy guaranteeing that it will be paid back - so ensuring that the bank gets a second stream of income from the premiums. People running small businesses are especially likely to find that any loan is conditional on buying insurance. The clearers have also quietly done research into the views of customers on possible methods of paying for current accounts. Their surveys tell them that most people would prefer a flat monthly charge over the return of transaction fees. One banker says: 'Banks could say to their customers that their current account would provide them with a monthly statement, a cheque book and five transactions free and thereafter a monthly charge of Pounds 2 a month.' So a two-step approach, beginning with charges for customers who do not keep a minimum of money in their accounts, followed by quarterly charges, seems to be under consideration. Some banks are examining possible 'sweeteners' - services for their wealthiest customers in return for charges. One possibility being examined by more than one high street clearer is a telephone service, modelled on Firstdirect, Midland's telephone banking arm. The plans under consideration would enable wealthy individuals to by-pass the bothersome business of doing all their banking through a branch during working hours.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT ACCOUNT SERVICES AND CHARGES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Account details*           Abbey      Barclays         First      Lloyds                         National      Interest        Direct     Classic                          Current        Option        Cheque                          Account                     Account  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Overdraft fees              None    Authorised:     1% of O/D     pounds                                    pounds 10pm        if over     8pm if                                        if over     pounds 250       over                                      pounds 50    Min. pounds     pounds                                   Unauthorised:            15    100 O/D                                    pounds 15pm   Unauthorised:                                     if between    pounds 20pm                                    pounds 50 &amp;    + pounds 5/                                     pounds 200            day                                   pounds 25 pm                                        if over                                     pounds 200  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Overdraft interest rate charge (APR)** Authorised                  24.4      24.1 EAR          20.7       23.8 Unauthorised                34.4      37.3 EAR          37.4       34.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Service Charges*** Stopping cheque             None      pounds 8      pounds 6    pounds 8 Bankers' draft              None     pounds 10      pounds 8   pounds 20 Duplicate Statement         None          None    pounds 4/5    pounds 6                                                    per sheet   per sheet Bounced cheque (B/C)      pounds     pounds 20     pounds 20   pounds 25                         20 ***** Receiving B/C               None          None          None    pounds 4 O/D letter                  None         None/     pounds 15   pounds 10                                         pounds                                       10 *****  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Account details*         Midland    Nationwide       NatWest       Royal                          Orchard   Anglia Flex       Current     Bank of                                        Account          Plus    Scotland                                                                     IPCA  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Overdraft fees            pounds        pounds   None if ave     None if                          7 pm if      10 pm if    balance is       under                       authorised  unauthorised   over pounds  pounds 100                        pounds 15        &amp; over      500 else  pounds 8pm                            pm if    pounds 100     pounds 20   if over                     unauthorised                    pqtr.

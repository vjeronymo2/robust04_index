			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Diplomatic baggage: Bruce Clark argues that the UK could learn from French diplomacy over Bosnia Events in Bosnia have brought home how much Britain has to learn from France about foreign policy presentation. The two countries have almost identical attitudes to the conflict, driven by an almost identical mixture of considerations. Both countries want to stop the war spreading; to wean the Serbs off chauvinism and reintegrate them into the European mainstream; to avoid looking bad in the eyes of an Islamic world concerned about the fate of the Bosnian Moslems; and to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. Unlike the US, both London and Paris are more concerned with containing the war than with 'punishing the guilty' or imposing a fairer partition. Both would agree that the status quo in Bosnia gives a disproportionate advantage to the Serbs, but neither believes that imposing justice is worth the tens of thousands of lives - and the breakdown of relations with Russia  -that full-blown war against the Serbs could cost. From an identical mixture of considerations, an almost identical mixture of policies has flowed: the maintenance, as long as possible, of a small peacekeeping force in Bosnia that eases suffering and frustrates - both directly and indirectly - the outbreak of full-scale war; the exercise, by economic and diplomatic but not military means, of pressure on the parties to compromise. Why, in that case, has Britain become the object of loathing among Bosnian officials and pro-Bosnian US politicians, while France is growing in diplomatic prowess? Asking this question is not just an exercise in petty cross-Channel bickering. At stake is Britain's long-term diplomatic credibility - its much-vaunted ability to 'punch above its weight' in international affairs. The mayor of Bihac, the Bosnian town beseiged by Serbs, refuses to speak to British reporters. Senator Robert Dole, the new majority leader in the US senate, blames 'the British and the French, particularly the British' for the situation in the Bihac enclave. General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is a hate-figure for the Bosnian government, while his French boss General Bertrand de Lapresle - whose thinking is virtually identical - is not. How have the French done it? The answer, put simply, is that they are far better than Anglo-Saxons at holding two almost irreconcilable positions at once, and also at striking rhetorical poses that bear little relation to reality. Britain and France have made precisely the same analysis of the situation in Bihac. As both countries see it, it would be a bad turn of events if the Serbs were to overrun the Bihac enclave. The fact that they may now do so is seen as an undesirable consequence of an ill-judged Bosnian government offensive. But the consequences of yielding to US demands for an all-out air attack on Serb positions around Bihac are judged even more undesirable in both London and Paris: it was felt there would be too high a chance of hitting the wrong people. So far, so much Anglo-French consensus. But when it comes to policy presentation, the differences between Gallic flair and Anglo-Saxon phlegm start to show. France staked out the moral high ground by proclaiming: 'Bihac must not be allowed to fall]' Britain was true to its plodding, empirical self by making the - undeniably accurate, but gloomy - observation that Bihac might fall. If Bihac does now fall, the world will say that it was not for lack of French trying; if that outcome is somehow prevented, Paris will claim a share of the glory. As for the French penchant for holding two contrasting positions at once, it is demonstrated by Paris's ability to sound both more pro-Serb and pro-Moslem than London. In September, while British officials were sternly stressing the absolute unchangeability of the existing peace plan for Bosnia, France floated the idea that the Bosnian Serb zone should have confederal relations with Serbia. That idea - heresy at the time - has been resurrected this week. France has balanced the effect of these pro-Serb statements by making high-sounding commitments to the security of Bosnia's Moslem enclaves, which are music to the ears of Senator Dole. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, makes weighty pronouncements such as: 'Europe cannot enjoy stability and peace in a context of confrontation with Islam . . . What is at stake in Sarajevo is the possibility of an open and tolerant Islam.' With the great sweep of French strategic thinking, he 'rejects the inevitability' of division in Europe between the Catholic, Orthodox and Moslem worlds. 'France's historical mission, from Richelieu to General de Gaulle, is to reject barriers erected in the heart of the continent,' he has proclaimed. A British minister who said something like that would be lampooned in satirical magazines. But to judge by the success that France's lofty rhetoric seems to enjoy, London ought to be sending its brighter young diplomats off to the grandes ecoles for a refresher course on Descartes and Voltaire.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy at </F> joint news conference with U.S. Secretary of Defense William  Perry in Kiev on 22 March -- recorded]    [Text] [Radetskyy] Esteemed ladies and gentlemen: Today we  are summing up the official visit of U.S. Secretary of Defense  William Perry to Ukraine. This is his first visit to Ukraine in  his capacity as the U.S. secretary of defense. We regard it as  a sign of dynamism in the development of relations between our  countries' military departments.    My view is that the negotiations were held in the spirit of  constructive cooperation, were fruitful, and achieved their aim.  They once again confirmed Ukraine's intention to travel the path  of democracy and openness to the world, which had not been  inherent in the position of the former Soviet Union.    The U.S. secretary of defense visited the 46th Missile  Division's combat positions, which was a historic visit since we  could not even think about this not so long ago. The  negotiations convincingly proved that the course towards  strengthening trust and understanding between the defense  departments of Ukraine and the United States, initiated by our  predecessors, is the right one and corresponds with the  interests of our states and of ensuring peace in Europe.    In the course of exchanging our opinions, our views on a  wide  variety of issues relating to mutual relations between Ukraine  and the United States coincided considerably. These issues are  closely linked to the problems of world and European security.    It should also be emphasized that this is the third time  that  the secretary and I have met in the last three months, and I  hope we understand each other well.    Ukraine has made its choice in respect of nuclear  disarmament. The world witnesses how Ukraine's good will with  regard to lessening the threat of nuclear confrontation is being  implemented in specific steps in practice. A certain number of  strategic missiles have already been deactivated and two  trainloads of nuclear warheads have already left for Russia on  schedule.    We are grateful to the United States for their diplomatic  efforts, thanks to which the trilateral statement by the U.S.,  Ukrainian, and Russian presidents on nuclear disarmament in  Ukraine became a reality in action. Financial aid from the  American side will no doubt ease the heavy burden of nuclear  disarmament on the economy of Ukraine, which is already in a  difficult state.    We have begun implementing conversion programs and you, Mr.  Secretary, have already had an opportunity to see it for  yourself. At the same time, you have come to know our scientific  and military industrial complex and its potential. We are a  rocket and space power, which is why the attitude towards us has  to correspond with the aspects of reality that have arisen. It  is in this respect that we hope for understanding and support  from the United States.    Our states are actively participating in peacekeeping  activities under UN auspices. We have reached complete  understanding with our American colleagues that any political  issues must primarily be settled by peaceful means.    A bloody crisis in the former Yugoslavia demonstrates that  efforts to prevent the flare-up of military conflicts are vital.    Attempts by certain political forces to play the so-called  Crimean card and provide support overtly or covertly for the  separatist movement on the peninsula cause concern in Ukraine.  Ukraine will take all steps required to preserve its territorial  integrity in a peaceful, civilized way.    The fact that the United States consistently stands for the  inviolability of the existing borders and is not indifferent to  the Crimean problem, and in particular to the future destiny of  the Black Sea Fleet, provides us with moral support in a complex  process of the political settlement of the issue.    We reached understanding with Mr. Perry on issues of the  Black Sea Fleet and the sequence of actions on its division.  This process should begin by making an inventory of all the  property and combat machinery the fleet owns.    Ukraine was the first CIS state to join NATO's Partnership  for Peace program. This demonstrates our sincere endeavors to  develop peaceful, good-neighborly relations with all  participating countries. The program, initiated by the United  States, gives hope for the strengthening of the European  security system. We are certain that within this system Ukraine  will occupy an important position befitting it. The value of  the Partnership for Peace program for Ukraine in particular is  that it gives our state an opportunity to establish multilateral  ties with every interested country. Ukraine can become a bridge  of understanding between East and West, the need for which is so  perceptible. And it is this circumstance that imparts  particular importance to fruitful bilateral relations between  the defense departments of Ukraine and the United States.    Now we have already achieved certain success in developing  these bilateral relations. Our ministries' working groups have  agreed on a work plan consisting of 17 paragraphs, each of which  contains specific programs for the development of contacts in  the military sphere. Some of them have already been put into  practice. In the very near future, we intend to establish with  our American partners a direct line of communications between  our states' defense departments. This step will undoubtedly  help resolve more promptly the problems that arise in our  relations.    We look forward to interesting meetings on a bilateral basis  and contacts at various levels. In future, we can see  participation in joint exercises and exchanges of military  servicemen right from combat subunits. All this inspires hope  that understanding between our countries' Armed Forces will  strengthen.    Mr. Perry's visit has lived up to the best of our  expectations. An important document was adopted: an amendment  to the agreement between our military departments on the  provision of Ukraine with materials, machinery, and  communications services in eliminating strategic nuclear  weapons. Under this amendment, Ukraine will receive an  additional $50 million towards nuclear disarmament, with the  total sum to be 185 million. A joint statement has been worked  out and signed on meeting Ukrainian Armed Forces servicemen's  daily life and housing needs, providing for aid in the amount of  $20 million for the construction of housing.    In general, the program of the visit was intensive. A  delegation from the U.S. Department of Defense had meetings with  our state's leadership, scientists, and representatives of the  military industrial complex.    I express the viewpoint of the Ukrainian side: We evaluate  the results of Mr. Perry's visit to Ukraine with satisfaction.  It is the continuation of a constructive dialogue between our  countries' military. This dialogue is now acquiring certain  qualities of a good tradition.    My deep conviction is that the development of bilateral  relations between the defense departments of Ukraine and the  United States will promote stronger peace and stability both in  Europe and worldwide.</p>

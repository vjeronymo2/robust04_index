			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Orion Publishing plans stock market flotation Orion Publishing Group, the general book publisher which in 1992 acquired George Weidenfeld Holdings, has announced that it is planning a stock market flotation. To that end, it has completed a Pounds 4m funding package, led by Baring Communications Equity, Europe's newest and largest media fund, to reduce its borrowings and provide working capital. It has also appointed as non-executive chairman Sir John Cuckney, chairman either previously or currently of many companies including Westland, 3i, Maxwell Pensioners Trust and Royal Insurance. Orion was co-founded at the end of 1991 by Mr Peter Roche, Ms Rosemary Cheetham and Mr Anthony Cheetham, now its chief executive. Orion stated that its operating profits more than doubled from Pounds 268,000 to Pounds 583,000 in 1993. Leading the sales increase were Vikram Seth's A Suitable Boy, Alan Clark's Diaries, Maeve Binchy's The Copper Beech and Nigel Mansell's Mansell and Williams. The paperback division contributed a first-time Pounds 3.7m to the sales figure; sales in the Orion division grew to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.1m).</p>

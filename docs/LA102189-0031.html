			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 29TH TIME IS CHARM FOR BUENA PARK  </P> <P> Buena Park High School accomplished something Friday night it hadn't done in  six years: It won a Freeway League football game.  </P> <P> Buena Park (2-4 overall and 1-1 in league play) rallied for 21 second-half  points to defeat Sonora, 21-13, at La Habra Stadium, ending Orange County's  longest league losing streak at 28 games.  </P> <P> Trailing, 7-0, in the third quarter, John Finohui tied the game for Buena Park  on a one-yard touchdown run on the Coyotes' first possession of the second  half.  </P> <P> After Sonora ran three plays and punted, Buena Park took its first lead when  Chris Medina capped a 51-yard drive with a three-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Sonora (2-5, 0-2) cut the deficit to 14-13 on quarterback David Stack's 25-yard  touchdown pass to Scott Sanders with 6:30 remaining in the game. But Lu Tasi  blocked Ryan Lewis' extra point attempt.  </P> <P> Buena Park put together a near-perfect 10-play, 69-yard drive that was  culminated by Finohui's 26-yard touchdown run.

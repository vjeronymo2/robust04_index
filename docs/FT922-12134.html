			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Shake-up of leases urged by CBI THE Confederation of British Industry yesterday launched an appeal for urgent reform of the law governing commercial property leases to prevent companies being forced out of business. The CBI wants a change in the law which allows landlords to require tenants who sell or assign leases to make good unpaid rent owed by a subsequent occupier. The Law Commission suggested changes to the law in 1988 but nothing has been done. Mr John Pollard, CBI company affairs policy adviser, said: 'Some tenants who have assigned leases have been sued for sums running into hundreds of thousands of pounds, covering rent, service charges and repairs after they assigned the tenancy with the landlord's consent. They can be put out of business by this liability.' In the 1980s landlords could re-let properties without loss, but they have been unable to do so during the recession and have had to enforce their rights against previous tenants to cut their losses, the CBI said. The directors of some small companies have been required to give personal guarantees so that if their company is not able to pay, then the individual directors are forced to. The problem is increased by the fact that an existing tenant can run up substantial arrears before the landlord notifies the previous tenant that anything is wrong. The landlord is under no obligation to notify promptly and does not even have to sue the non-paying tenant or evict him. Tenants can also find themselves facing demands for rents that are far higher than those which applied when they moved out. One company that was paying Pounds 355,000 a year on a central London office block was faced several years later with a demand for rent equivalent to nearly Pounds 800,000 a year when a subsequent tenant failed to pay the rent. 'Detailed consultations have been carried out by the Law Commission and a draft bill included in their 1988 report so the spadework has already been done,' the CBI said. 'The report should receive the immediate attention of the Lord Chancellor before more firms are forced out of business.'</p>

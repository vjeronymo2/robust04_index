			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / MPs may probe Touche Ross fees A committee of MPs is to consider holding an inquiry into the fees and conduct of the liquidators to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Mr Richard Caborn, chairman of the Commons trade and industry committee, confirmed yesterday that he had received a request for an inquiry and would raise it at a meeting later this month. Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, urged the committee to examine the fees of Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, which has so far generated more than Pounds 98m in fees for its work on the case. Touche Ross was not available for comment yesterday, but has previously said that its fees have been scrutinised and approved by the creditors' committee and by the courts.</p>

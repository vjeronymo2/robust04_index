			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIONS: CHARGE OF BRAINWASHING;  </P> <P> EASTERN UNIONS BRAINWASHING, LORENZO SAYS  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines boss Frank Lorenzo has accused the carrier's striking unions  of brainwashing members and has asked psychiatrists to study the materials sent  by strike leaders to the rank and file.  </P> <P> In a speech last Friday to students at Stanford University's business school,  Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., said the psychiatrists  met in Washington to examine the union literature.  </P> <P> Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said the company had no immediate comment on  Lorenzo's remarks. An account of Lorenzo's speech in Palo Alto was released by  the business school.  </P> <P> "We have people here (in the unions) who have been totally, completely  brainwashed," said Lorenzo, as quoted by a Stanford news release.  </P> <P> "We have, in fact, a meeting going on today in Washington, D.C., by a bunch of  psychiatrists and psychoanalysts who are going through the propaganda materials  that these people are being sent. And this is brainwashing in the style of the  '40s.  </P> <P> "What is being put into their heads gets them excited about giving up their  jobs and giving up their careers."  </P> <P> It was unclear from Lorenzo's remarks whether he had hired the psychiatrists  and, if so, how much he was paying them. It also was unclear how he intended to  use their analysis of the union materials.  </P> <P> Dan Ashby, a spokesman in New York for the Eastern pilots' union, called  Lorenzo's remarks "a continuation of his desperation tactics."  </P> <P> "We would suggest that Mr. Lorenzo sit down with these people (the  psychiatrists) and find out what his own problems are," he said. "We're very  sane people; we're very serious about what we're doing."  </P> <P> Since March 4, pilots and flight attendants at Miami-based Eastern have  supported a strike by the airline's machinists' union. Lorenzo put Eastern into  Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection March 9.  </P> <P> Protesters threw eggs in Lorenzo's direction before he entered the auditorium  to make his one-hour speech and called him "Hitler" and "greedy bastard" when  he left, the business school's news release said. It also said the 200 or so  protesters included pilots and machinists.  </P></p>

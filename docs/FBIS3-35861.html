In his statement, circulated on Monday, Chornovil expressed  hope that Leonid Kravchuk would use his presidential right to  abort any steps of the new pro-Russian Crimean president if they  contradict the Ukrainian Constitution.    The leader of the "Rukh" blamed the leadership of the  parliament for the outcome of the elections which he called "a  recurrent loss of the Ukrainian authorities".    Chornovil accused the Parliament Speaker Ivan Plyushch  personally of "stubbornly refusing to put onto the parliament's  agenda the question of bringing the Crimean laws into line with  those of Ukraine".</p>

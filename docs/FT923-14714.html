			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Survey of Italy (11): Uncertainties on the doorstep - Foreign and defence policy AT THE traffic lights of a busy junction on the outskirts of Rome, a child begs with a large grubby placard. Crudely written are the words: 'Sarajevo. Homeless. Father dead.' The civil war in the republics of former Yugoslavia is impossible to ignore in neighbouring Italy - even if the question of refugees has not acquired the proportions once feared or the scale of the shocking exodus from Albania last summer. This seemingly unstoppable conflict has added a dramatic and highly unpredictable element to Italy's security concerns. Unrest in the Balkans has not been the sole area of concern over the past 12 months. Events in Algeria and Libya have highlighted the potential vulnerability of Italy's dependence on these two North African states for oil and gas requirements. The past year has seen a military coup in Algeria to forestall the installation of an Islamic government and the threat of United Nations trade embargo against Libya. Such uncertainties on Italy's doorstep coincide with two broader international developments - the reassessment of Nato's role in the light of the collapse of communism and the prospects of both a broadening and deepening of the European Community. The Danish referendum rejection of last December's Treaty of Maastricht has raised the spectre of a looser structure for European integration. This is directly contrary to the entire thrust of policy conducted by the Andreotti government, which hoped to place Italy as an important broker in an increasingly federal Europe powered by France and Germany. In this sense, Italy was anchored securely to northern Europe. Any weakening of this process - and any weakening of Italy's ability to comply with the terms of closer integration - risks loosening this linkage with northern Europe. The new government's approach towards Europe will also colour the debate on defence. Until now, Italy has remained a strong supporter of Nato. Italy has also insisted that Franco-German plans to enhance the Western European Union and make it the centrepiece of future European defence co-operation must not be at Nato's expense. The outgoing government found on this it made common cause with the British. American pressure to continue to back Nato remains strong and also helps explain Italy's willingness to support new concepts of 'out-of-area' action by the organisation. But even without such pressure, the experience of the Gulf War and the break-up of the former Soviet Union have brought home the need for a more flexible and rapid defence policy. The concept of a flexible rapid response against multi-directional threats was the essence of proposals last November to carry out a major reorganisation of Italy's armed forces. The 'new model of defence', announced by Mr Virginio Rognoni, the defence minister, envisaged a sharp cut in the size of the armed forces and the first serious attempt to professionalise them. The aim is to cut some 90,000 civilian and military personnel from the payroll by the end of the decade. The cuts proposed would be equivalent to 23 per cent of the combined strength of the armed forces in 1990. However, the cuts would be unevenly spread - 28 per cent in the army, 20 per cent among civilian employees, 13 per cent in the air force and 12 per cent in the navy. This reflects the fact that the size of the army is swollen by conscription and it is the part of the military that is least professionalised and modernised. The army, with a new rapid intervention role accorded by Nato for the alliance's southern flank, would be remodelled around 15 brigades, instead of the current 25 brigades. Of these, five would contain frontline troops trained for rapid deployment, including out-of-area actions. Conscription would be reduced and more emphasis would be placed on attracting short-term volunteers. The navy, for its part, would have less of an ocean-going role and would concentrate more on coastal policing and tasks within the Mediterranean. The air force would lose six squadrons and the number of operational air bases would be cut from 24 to 20. The counter-balance to these cuts would be substantial investment in equipment, of which some 45 per cent will be out of date by the end of the century. Overall, the net additional cost to the defence budget could be L40,000bn. However, there would be an important shift in the nature of expenditure - away from personnel costs and onto materiel. The proposals have been greeted with alarm by some of the top ranks, and one senior general has resigned in protest. The complaints centre on plans to break up traditional units and establish new command structures co-ordinating the three (rival) services. There are also fears about lost jobs, an unacceptably high ratio of southerners (perhaps 80 per cent) in the armed forces ranks as volunteers and complaints that pay is unlikely to improve. All these problems will be an important item on the agenda of the new government. More immediate is the situation in former Yugoslavia which could result in Italy receiving a large number of refugees or being dragged into the fighting. Italy made ready for up to 50,000 refugees from fighting in Croatia and Slovenia late last year, but fewer than 5,000 sought formal assistance. As fighting spread to Bosnia this year, the Italian authorities adopted a new policy of seeking where possible to channel assistance so that Bosnian refugees were assisted in Slovenia and Croatia. This policy of keeping the refugees at arm's length appears to have been successful so far. Italy learned its lessons with refugees over Albania. The authorities were wholly unprepared for the 18,000 Albanians who last August packed in boats and sought to enter the port of Bari. This invasion was chaotically handled at the outset and Italy's international image was badly dented by scenes of starving Albanians being attacked by the police. Nevertheless, the Andreotti government saw that if they were given asylum as economic refugees, then the exodus from Albania would merely increase. All but some 1,500 who managed to escape from Bari were forcibly repatriated. In a little publicised follow-up policy, the government decided on a major increase in direct aid to Albania. By improving conditions inside the country - and tightening sea patrols - it was hoped Albanians would be dissuaded from a further exodus. In October Italy despatched some 750 military personnel to operate relief inside Albania, distributing by Christmas some L120bn of foodstuffs, medicines and building materials. The troops were to have returned around the new year, but their mandate has been renewed indefinitely and Italy has established itself, perforce, as the outside power controlling the affairs of Albania. Until the country's primitive economy begins to revive and the political situation stabilises after the March elections, the Italians will have to keep a close eye on Albania.</p>

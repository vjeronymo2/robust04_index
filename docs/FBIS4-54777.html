			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 4 May (MTI) -- According to the  experience of the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), most  Hungarians believe that the current government proved its  incompetence over the past four years, and rewarded loyalty  rather than expertise and skill, MSZP Chairman Gyula Horn told a  rally in Tatabanya, western Hungary, today. Furthermore, due to  their decreasing living standards, Hungarians would like May to  be a month of change, Horn said.    Referring to recent harsh attacks on Horn, a journalist  asked  the MSZP Chairman whether he was considering giving up his  political career. Horn replied:    "The support and encouragement I receive everywhere in the  country lends me strength. The idea of giving up my political  career because of a series of slanders has never occurred to me  at all. All the more because I know that this is what they  would like to achieve through these provocations. I do not  cling on to any office, but over the past four years my primary  goal was to bring the new, democratic, European left-wing to  victory in Hungary," Horn said.</p>

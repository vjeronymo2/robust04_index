			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Dec 10 (AFP) -- The French Atomic Energy  Commission (CEA) announced late Thursday [9 December] that  France had carried out 192 nuclear tests, saying that previous  reports of 161 tests were a mistake.    The announcement came in response to calls from  environmentalists Greenpeace to "lift the secrecy" surrounding  the number of French tests.    Greenpeace had said it was astonished that official and  parliamentary figures on the exact number had varied.    But the CEA admitted that the figure of 161 it had published  in a report had been a "material error" and that the correct  figure was 192 as stated in April by CEA director general  Philippe Rouvillois.    It said late Thursday that the number of French tests up to  a  moratorium imposed in April 1992 "was indeed 192."    The United States this week reported that it had not  revealed  some 204 tests.</p>

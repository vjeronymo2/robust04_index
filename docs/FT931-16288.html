			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate prospects sway continental trade INTEREST rate considerations moved a number of bourses yesterday. Milan, Madrid, Stockholm and Vienna were closed for a public holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS had a volatile and heavy day's trading as the CAC-40 went as low as 1,846.99 and as high as 1,870.44 before ending 8.85 higher at 1,859.63. A firmer franc and hopes of lower interest rates also supported the market. Turnover was a heavy FFr3bn, due to activity in leading stocks such as Societe Generale and Alcatel. Alcatel fell FFr13 to FFr675 on news that the company was calling in its series of 6 per cent convertible bonds issued in 1989 from February 3. The stock has also been downgraded by some brokers recently. Societe Generale dropped FFr9 to FFr608 and Paribas rose FFr11.20 to FFr351.70 on reports that Lehman Brothers had recommended a switch from Societe Generale into Paribas. Dealers added that Societe Generale was due for a correction after its recent gains. The hypermarkets group, Carrefour, rose FFr41 to FFr2,391 on news that its December sales had risen 7.9 per cent from December 1991 to FFr16.1bn. FRANKFURT was stopped in its tracks after the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, said in a speech in Oslo that German inflationary risks must be capped before interest rates could come down. This soured hopes that the Bundesbank would cut key interest rates at today's council meeting, following speculation of a rate cut on Tuesday when France and Germany pledged support for the embattled franc. German market turnover fell from DM4.1bn to DM3.4bn. The DAX index closed virtually flat, just 0.04 lower at 1,556.38 after Tuesday's 1.6 per cent gain. However, there was some movement in second-liners. AMB rose another DM37 to DM820, up DM70 this week on the sale of a majority stake in BfG to Credit Lyonnais. Escada dropped another DM17 to DM122, compared with a 1992 high of DM585, on worries about the fashion company's future following the death of its co-founder, Ms Margaretha Ley, last year. AMSTERDAM, encouraged by hopes of a cut in domestic interest rates today, enjoyed another strong day with the CBS Tendency index rising 0.9 to 97.4. Among the day's features, VNU gained Fl 3.10 or 3.5 per cent to Fl 92.50 as investors continued to react to Tuesday's report that it expected an 8 per cent improvement in 1992 net profit. Elsevier was Fl 2.40 stronger at Fl 124.30. Wessanen, the food group, advanced Fl 2.30 or 2.3 per cent to Fl 102.40 after it forecast a 12 per cent increase in 1992 earnings. Elsewhere, Nedlloyd advanced Fl 1.10 to Fl 34.50 and DSM was 30 cents higher at Fl 76.10. The financial sector went against the trend after recent gains with ING down 70 cents at Fl 56.30 and ABN Amro losing 10 cents to Fl 52.00. ZURICH featured an accelerated fall in CS Holding following confirmation of its planned takeover of Swiss Volksbank, the bearers finishing SFr120 or 5.7 per cent lower at SFr1,980. There were outside estimates of a 12 per cent dilution in CS Holding earnings for 1993 as a result of the Volksbank acquisition. Investors were encouraged to switch to other banks. SBC rose SFr13 to SFr326 and Volksbank closed at SFr1,100, up SFr380 from its pre-suspension close. The SMI index fell 3.5 to 2,124.4. BRUSSELS closed mostly lower as the retailer, Delhaize, fell another BFr32 to BFr1,248. Its US unit, Food Lion, is due to release its December sales figures today and Delhaize is expected to make a statement on its 1992 earnings tomorrow. The Bel-20 index fell 6.4 to 1,132.13 in turnover of BFr962m. Among other leading stocks, Petrofina saw its Tuesday gains wiped out as it fell BFr130 to BFr7,480, and Solvay eased BFr25 to BFr11,600. OSLO rose another 1 per cent, helped by expectations of lower domestic interest rates. After the market closed, the central bank said that it was cutting the overnight lending rate to 10.5 per cent from 11 per cent from today. The all-share index gained 4.12 to 394.93 in turnover of NKr338m. Among major stocks, Norsk Hydro and Kvaerner free shares both gained NKr4 to NKr163 and NKr169 respectively. ISTANBUL gained 1.1 per cent in selective trade based on year-end company profit expectations, and the 75-share market index ended at the highest close in more than three months, up 46.52 at 4,125.00. DUBLIN reflected the heavy speculation in the London and New York currency markets against the Irish pound. The ISEQ overall index rose another 20.49 to 1,295.77, extending its gain to 5.6 per cent in three days. Once again, five majors combining a domestic play with overseas earnings led the gains, Allied Irish Banks outdistancing Bank of Ireland, Irish Life, CRH and Smurfit with a rise of 8p to IPounds 1.82.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 6                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1091.33     1090.89     1089.81     1088.04 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1182.37     1181.39     1179.95     1177.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1092.35     1092.55     1093.48     1091.68 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1182.88     1182.18     1181.58     1179.18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jan 5     Jan 4    Dec 31    Dec 30    Dec 29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1090.07   1083.42   1083.35   1084.02   1086.47 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1180.16   1174.71   1169.11   1166.76   1167.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1093.58 ; 200 - 1184.12 Low/day: 100 - 1087.57  200 - 1177.76.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

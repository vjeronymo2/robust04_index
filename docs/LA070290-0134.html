			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GRAF TEACHES CAPRIATI HARD LESSON;  </P> <P> WIMBLEDON: DEFENDING CHAMPION'S POWERFUL FOREHANDS OVERWHELM 14-YEAR-OLD  CHALLENGER, 6-2, 6-4. BECKER BEATS CASH, EDBERG DEFEATS CHANG.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf showed Jennifer Capriati today how much the 14-year-old has to  learn about grass-court tennis.  </P> <P> Using powerful forehands, slicing serves and a rock-solid net game, the  top-ranked Graf beat her youngest challenger in straight sets in their first  meeting to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> Graf, 21, won an eagerly awaited Centre Court match, 6-2, 6-4. Refreshed by a  quick weekend trip to West Germany, the defending champion won the big points  and kept Capriati from setting the rhythm.  </P> <P> "I don't think she's old, she just has experience," Capriati said. Graf said  Capriati was much more advanced than she was at 14.  </P> <P> Capriati, the whiz-kid from Florida who at No. 12 was the youngest seed in  Grand Slam history, showed the type of play that has raised her so high in the  four months since she turned pro.  </P> <P> She served well, ran down shot after shot and matched Graf's firepower from the  baseline. But she rarely came to the net and Graf wrapped it up with her  trademark, a forehand flashed down the line and buried in the corner on her  third match point.  </P> <P> "The forehand. I had always heard about that forehand," Capriati said, her  voice filled with awe. "It's just a bullet. She moves so quick. I mean, there's  always a ball that comes back."  </P> <P> It was a smile of relief that covered Graf's face as she shook Capriati's hand  at the net. Her reign at the top has been under fire, with 16-year-old Monica  Seles beating her twice in a row and Capriati climbing fast. And then there is  the threat of 33-year-old Martina Navratilova, seeking a record ninth Wimbledon  title.  </P> <P> An autumn-like start of the second week of the Grand Slam tournament had 14  fourth-round singles matches, and most of the seeded survivors of this  upset-riddled event moved on.  </P> <P> Boris Becker and Stefan Edberg turned Centre Court meetings of champions into  routs, and Seles scored a quick and clean victory over an outmatched American.  </P> <P> Edberg, the 1988 Wimbledon champion and runner-up last year, beat Michael  Chang, the 1989 French Open winner, 6-3, 6-2, 6-1. Chang, who defeated Edberg  in five sets to win in Paris last year, held serve only three times in a dozen  games.  </P> <P> Becker, the defending champion who is aiming for his fourth Wimbledon title  overall, beat 1987 champ Pat Cash, 7-6, 6-1, 6-4. Cash was a wild-card entry  but had looked strong in the previous three rounds.  </P> <P> Seles won her 36th match in a row, taking just 45 minutes to beat Ann  Henricksson, 6-1, 6-0.  </P> <P> Next for Seles is No. 5 Zina Garrison, who eliminated 10th-seeded Helena  Sukova, 6-3, 6-3, and has not dropped a set so far.  </P> <P> Navratilova also won comfortably, making the quarterfinals for the 16th  consecutive year.  </P> <P> Navratilova, the women's second seed, registered a 6-3, 6-3 victory over  14th-seeded Judith Wiesner of Austria.  </P> <P> Ivan Lendl, the men's top seed, stayed on course to finally end his quest for a  Wimbledon title, but he had a tougher time than expected.  </P> <P> He beat Bryan Shelton, an American ranked 125th, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, in a match  suspended by darkness at one set apiece Saturday night.  </P> <P> The day's lone upset had Christian Bergstrom of Sweden beating 11th-seeded Guy  Forget of France 6-4, 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.  </P></p>

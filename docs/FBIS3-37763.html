The  parliament's session on Tuesday adopted a decision under which  the prime minister was granted the authority to alter the  composition of the government, to appoint and discharge the  government's members coordinating the decisions with the Supreme  Soviet's presidium and the appropriate parliamentary commissions.    However, the Supreme Council preserved the powers to appoint  and to discharge the leaders of the power structures and the  foreign minister, an Interfax correspondent in Minsk reported.</p>

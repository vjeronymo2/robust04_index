			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: Massaging expectations The Bank of England has a delicate task in presenting its latest views on inflation. It would not presumably wish to risk a row with the chancellor if he asks for interest rates to be cut in connection with the budget. But the underlying rate of price rises has accelerated over the past three months and the bank has to admit to the chance of the government's inflation target being breached as a result of tax changes due to come into effect next April. So it must also be concerned about its credibility in the fight against inflation. The report gets round this dilemma by forecasting that inflation will start to fall again in the middle of next year and that any rise meanwhile should be regarded as just a blip. That way the option is left open for a budget rate cut to offset any fiscal tightening, even if this goes against basic instincts. The bank's longer term forecasts, which show inflation slap in the middle of its target range, lead to the claim that rates are about right where they are. Well, it would say that, wouldn't it? The main worry is that of preventing a higher headline rate translating into higher inflationary expectations with consequent pressure on wages. The bank admits that a higher real exchange rate as a result of interest rate cuts abroad would help reduce inflationary pressures. It follows that it would be reluctant to do anything which might cause the exchange rate to wobble. Since Britain's manufacturing base is so atrophied, it might easily think any possible contribution to growth from exports boosted by a lower exchange rate is not worth the risk of higher import prices.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Test of Polish finance minister MR Karol Lutkowski, Poland's finance minister, will be under pressure today from spending ministries in the new centre-right government led by Mr Jan Olszewski. The outcome will be a big test of the prime minister's ability to restrain government spending and raise new taxes. Mr Lutkowski, a 52-year-old academic, is an advocate of stringent monetary policies in a government largely formed by critics of the International Monetary Fund-backed stabilisation policies run by his predecessor, Mr Leszek Balcerowicz. 'There is a conviction abroad that Keynesian methods of reinvigorating the economy are now appropriate,' he said in an interview. Mr Lutkowski was an adviser in the Finance Ministry under Mr Balcerowicz and over the last two years has taken part in the IMF talks. His appointment was meant to signify that no radical break with past financial policy was feasible. This is partly because last year's agreement with the Paris Club of official creditors. The accord lead to an end to over 50 per cent of Poland's Dollars 33bn (Pounds 18bn) official debt but is linked to compliance with the IMF performance criteria attached to a Dollars 2.5bn loan facility granted last April. The IMF suspended disbursements after the first tranche because the Finance Ministry overshot several key criteria, including the budget deficit. Mr Michael Deppler, deputy IMF head in Europe was in Warsaw last week for consultations. The government was reminded it needed an agreement with the Fund if it is to restructure its overall Dollars 46.5bn external debt - one third owed to western banks. With this in mind Mr Lutkowski said he wanted to halve this year's inflation rate from around 70 per cent in 1991, and contain the budget deficit at around Zl 60,000bn (Pounds 2.92bn) or 4.5 per cent of GDP.</p>

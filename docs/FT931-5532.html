			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Merchant takes stock: Matsushita is facing a fall in profits and a tarnished image The sales clerk in the Tokyo electrical retail shop was unusually blunt. 'Just because the name is Matsushita, it doesn't mean the product is good.' Across the city, in a small neighbourhood shop, the refrigerators on display were covered with photocopies of newspaper articles warning of defects to refrigerators made by Matsushita. Such incidents are part of an unprecedented reappraisal of one of Japan's corporate legends. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics group and owner of Hollywood's MCA film studios, has been for decades a model of the virtues of Japanese management. But with its reputation seriously tarnished by product defects and a financial scandal, the company appears to be losing its way. The problems are manifest in its trading performance. In the current fiscal year, to the end of March, post-tax profits are expected to fall by more than 60 per cent to about Y48bn (Pounds 285m). The most recent blow was delivered last week when Mr Akio Tanii, the group president, unexpectedly resigned after seven years at the helm. The official explanation for Mr Tanii's sudden departure was that he was stepping down to take responsibility for 'a number of regrettable incidents'. These comprised the revelation last year that Matsushita had sold 700,000 defective refrigerators, and the involvement of its National Lease subsidiary in a financial scandal which cost it Y20bn as a result of loans to a stock market speculator. But Japan's media have focused on the role played in Mr Tanii's fall by Mr Masaharu Matsushita, the Matsushita chairman and son-in-law of Konosuke Matsushita, the group's founder. According to the Japanese press, Mr Matsushita, unhappy at the decline in profits and the bad publicity surrounding the company, put pressure on Mr Tanii to resign and make way for the eventual rise to the presidency of his son, Mr Masayuku Matsushita. However, what the public clearly saw in Mr Tanii's departure was the seriousness of the problems afflicting the company. At their root, according to many industry analysts, is a cumbersome bureaucracy. A study carried out by the company found, for example, that only 20 per cent of working hours put in by marketing staff were directly related to business. Much work, not only at headquarters but among group companies, was being duplicated. The study reinforced a belief in the Japanese electronics industry that Matsushita may have grown too large to function effectively. With 315 subsidiaries, 138 of which are abroad, 24,000 affiliated retail shops and 24,400 employees, industry analysts believe Matsushita is suffering from dai-kigyo-byo, 'the disease of the big corporation'. Even Matsushita managers say they are concerned that their company has become bloated. They fear it has lost touch with its customers and drifted from its roots as a merchant of well-manufactured consumer electronics products with mass appeal. At a meeting of group executives in early February, Masaharu Matsushita warned his audience that 'it is no use talking about customers as number one unless that motto is put into practice. Matsushita itself is beginning to look in many ways like a company that has failed to do so.' Such concerns about serving customers are particularly worrying. In contrast with Sony and its other Japanese rivals, Matsushita has never been known as an innovator or a trend-setter. Instead, its strength has been as a reliable supplier of products through its extensive retail network. The discovery of product defects and its tarnished corporate image have, therefore, undermined its traditional advantages. Matsushita has also suffered, along with the rest of the Japanese electronics industry, from the constant expansion of its product range. The company's philosophy, propounded by its founder, has been to provide a wide range of products that are 'as cheap and readily available as tap water'. However, its preoccupation with launching new models has led to excessive investment in existing product areas. 'At one point there were 220 types of TVs and 62 types of VCRs across the industry but only 10 per cent of these sold,' says Mr Jiro Aoki, general manager of Matsushita's domestic sales planning office. 'When the company finally began paying attention to what consumers were saying, it found out that they didn't want 20 buttons on a VCR. We began to question our whole manufacturing philosophy.' Faced with such questions and with the sharp decline in profitability, the group is responding. Last year, a restructuring programme was introduced in an attempt to maintain profits. Technical and marketing support is being reduced for loss-making and less profitable outlets. The group's system of extending financial support to retail outlets has been discontinued in an attempt to cut costs. Distribution has also been reformed and inventories throughout the distribution chain are being reduced from three months to one month. There is also a greater focus on product development and product ranges are being reduced. The 72 types of Matsushita rice cookers which existed in 1989 have been reduced to 38. The management is also trying to instil a new corporate philosophy that places less emphasis on producing cheap and readily available products. To this end, Mr Yoichi Morishita, the group's new president, has adopted a new slogan: 'creativity and challenge'. The company is also determined to regain the confidence of Japan's consumers. 'Among Japan's electronics companies, Toshiba was known as the samurai, Mitsubishi as the feudal lord and Matsushita was the merchant,' says Mr Aoki from the planning office. 'We must go back to our roots as a merchant, that means being customer oriented.' Despite such initiatives, the size of the group and its entrenched relationships with suppliers and retailers are likely to limit the pace of change. But perhaps the biggest obstacle to recovery will be its weak record of technological innovation. A survey of employees at Matsushita conducted by the Nikkei Business magazine showed that the majority felt that the most critical issue facing the company is the development of products that are capable of building new markets in the depressed consumer electronics industry. This, and the avoidance of any further 'regrettable' incidents, will determine whether Mr Tanii's successors can restore the merchant's fortunes.</p>

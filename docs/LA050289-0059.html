			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> New York City students barricaded parts of four more City University campuses,  pushing the total to 14, as sit-ins protesting proposed tuition increases and  budget cuts entered a second week. State University students in Purchase, N.Y.,  mounted the first serious solidarity protest. Gov. Mario M. Cuomo had until  midnight today to sign legislation authorizing the universities' budgets. By  vetoing a budget increase, Cuomo would force cuts in faculty and services.  Leaving the budget language unchanged would allow trustees to enact a proposed  $200-a-year tuition increase. Full-time CUNY students now pay $1,250 a year.  </P></p>

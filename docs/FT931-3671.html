			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Congress looks to Deng's reformist legacy: China's rubber-stamp parliament is meeting at a significant time WHEN delegates of the rubber-stamp Chinese parliament convene today, the event will be of more than its usual significance. It may well be their last chance further to strengthen legislative support for the reformist legacy of maximum leader Deng Xiaoping. About 3,000 delegates to the National People's Congress, theoretically representing a quarter of mankind, will be asked to endorse a revised constitution to enshrine economic reforms and to approve personnel changes designed to ensure that Mr Deng's work will be carried on after his death. As China prepares for transition - Mr Deng is 83 and has aged noticeably in the past year - formal events like the Congress assume special importance; they provide an opportunity for the dominant faction to strengthen its grip through new appointments and constitutional reform. Congresses run for five-year terms, meeting annually. The timing of this eighth Congress, marking a new cycle, is perhaps fortuitous. It coincides with accelerated efforts to prepare for an orderly passage to a post-Deng regime, although personal ambition and ideological differences make the likelihood of such a smooth transfer problematical. Much emphasis in these next two weeks will be given to strengthening the underpinnings for the collective leadership to rule after Mr Deng goes to 'meet Karl Marx', words he sometimes uses to refer euphemistically to his death. Thus, the consensus figure of Mr Jiang Zemin, party boss, is expected to assume the dual role of president, or head of state: Mr Li Peng, the premier, who is identified with the conservative faction, will be 'elected' to a second five-year term; reformist economic tsar Mr Zhu Ronji, heir apparent to the premiership, is tipped to be designated 'senior', or executive, vice-premier, to distinguish him from the other four vice-premiers. In this leadership soup, Mr Deng and his supporters no doubt hope that a reasonable balance will have been achieved between various trends, ranging from the cautious Mr Li to the adventurous Mr Zhu. Mr Jiang, referred to in the official press as the 'core' leader, is expected to mediate between competing trends, a role Mr Deng, with his immense authority, has been performing since his re-emergence from political disgrace in the late 1970s. It is a moot point whether the 67-year-old Mr Jiang, who has no reputation for banging heads together, is capable of mediating effectively. But his elevation to the presidency is obviously designed to increase his authority and reflects concerns about the fairly urgent need to find someone capable of settling disputes among squabbling officials in the post-Deng period. The promotion of Mr Jiang, to go with the general secretaryship of the Communist party, marks something of a step away from an earlier commitment to separate, where possible, functions of party and state. In fact, this Congress will be marked by a strengthening of the party's hand in state business, a sign that it is determined to retain both symbolic and actual control in a period of accelerated economic reform. The other main task of the Congress, apart from endorsing revised economic growth targets for the coming year, is to approve a re-drafted constitution (a fifth version in China's post-1949 history) to incorporate China's commitment to a 'socialist market economy', or, in Mr Deng's words, 'socialism with Chinese characteristics'. Both these phrases appear in the draft and reflect key resolutions adopted by the 14th Communist party Congress last October, which gave the party's somewhat belated formal blessing to the move away from rigid central economic control that had been under way for some years. The importance attached to the market, as opposed to planning, in the new draft is indicative of the revolution that has taken place in Chinese thinking. Thus, simple new wording - '(China) practises socialist market economy' - has been substituted for the previous (1982) version, which relegated the role of the market to one quite subsidiary to 'economic planning'. Much attention will probably focus on Premier Li's 'work report', which will effectively be China's policy blueprint for the coming year. Mr Li has made no secret of his worries about recent high rates of economic growth of more than 12 per cent last year leading to overheating. The Chinese-language press in Hong Kong has suggested that Mr Li was resisting a four-square endorsement of the Deng faction's insistence on accelerated reform. But, perhaps, he has been obliged to fall into line as a price of holding on to his premiership for another five years. Still, his report seems certain to mention dangers of excessive growth. This Congress is not expected to produce any surprises. It will be carefully stage-managed. Failure to adhere to the script would almost certainly ensure delegates would not be returning next year.</p>

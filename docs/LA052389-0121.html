			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: VETERAN PROSECUTOR SUSPENDED WITH PAY  </P> <P> A veteran Los Angeles County prosecutor has been suspended amid charges of  deliberate misconduct in an attempt to gain a tactical advantage in a 1988  robbery trial.  </P> <P> Rosalie Morton, a deputy district attorney in the San Fernando Courthouse, was  suspended with pay based on a preliminary review of the case by U.S. Magistrate  Volney Brown, said Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson.  </P> <P> The allegations stem from a robbery trial in which Morton, 66, introduced  evidence in her opening statement to the jury that the judge had ruled  inadmissible. A mistrial was subsequently declared and Morton filed a motion to  disqualify the trial judge, Judge Dana Senit Henry.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys then filed a plea with Henry charging that Morton forced a  mistrial in an attempt to have the case tried again before a new judge that  would admit the suppressed evidence.  </P> <P> Morton is a 19-year-veteran of the Los Angeles County district attorney's  office.  </P></p>

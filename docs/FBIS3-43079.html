The  Story of an Item in the State Budget is Coming to a Head'']    [Text] For the first time in the almost 260-year history of  the RAN (Russian Academy of Sciences) eight of its institutes in  December announced their intention to cease work if they do not  receive dependable state funding. It is true that for the time  being it seems that this threat has not been carried out. At a  conference of the RAN Presidium with the directors of the  scientific institutions of the Moscow region, Yuriy Osipov, RAN  president, reported that Viktor Chernomyrdin gave him the ``word  of the prime minister'': in the very near future the Academy  will be paid the 24 billion rubles which are due it. It is true  that the Academy president shared with a SEGODNYA correspondent  serious doubts that the money in actuality would be forthcoming.    In the budget for the fourth quarter it was provided that  the  RAN be allocated the sum of 36 billion. But the scientists have  received only 12 billion. And such a situation cannot be called  chance because it has already been repeated several times. As is  emphasized by presidium members, even if all the promised money  is paid, it is nevertheless inadequate. That minimum of the sums  which science will receive from the state budget goes  exclusively for salaries of specialists and payment for communal  services. Scientists are simply beginning to forget about the  purchase of instruments, materials and reagents.    Moreover, in the draft budget for 1994 there is no item for  funding the RAN as an independent organization, as has been the  recent practice. An individual line in the budget enabled  scientists independently to distribute the scanty allocations in  accordance with their own needs and considerations. The  present-day draft ``means the virtual abolition of the RAN,''  assert its leaders.    Not having received money for the fourth quarter, the  leadership of the Academy lost patience. The RAN has now already  long waged ``trench warfare'' with the Ministry of Science and  Technical Policy, which implements state scientific policy and  handles the ``science money'' passing through its hands. Indeed,  one of the principles of the strategy of the Ministry of Science  is the concentration of financial resources in the most priority  fields and the organization of federal scientific centers, as  follows from this, in which this money will be concentrated.    Now the RAN Presidium has decided to speak out openly  against  the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy. ``The RAN  Presidium regards the prevailing state of affairs not to be the  result of the random course of circumstances but a manifestation  of systematic work on abolition of the Russian Academy of  Sciences,'' it states in its resolution. ``If the prevailing  state of affairs is not rectified in the very immediate future  the RAN presidium in the name of rescuing Russian science will  be forced to take an extreme step -- publicly expressing its  lack of confidence in the Minister of Science and Technical  Policy and the Minister of Finance, whose actions in essence are  directed to the destruction of the RAN and national science.''    Even now the leadership of the Academy has decided to ask  the  president and prime minister of Russia to establish a State  Council for Science, Scientific-Technical Progress and Education  under the president of the Russian Federation as a higher  consultative agency for working out a strategy for a state  scientific and scientific-technical policy. It is recommended  that the council ``be made up from among outstanding scientists  having the recognition of the international scientific  community,'' evidently having in mind members of the Academy.  Moreover, the RAN presidium considers it desirable ``to  transform the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy into a  State Committee for Science and Technology,'' substantially  abridging its functions, and keeping under its oversight only  ``matters relating to organization, structuring and oversight  over implementation of state scientific-technical programs.''    It is difficult to say how the officially declared war of  the  two science families will end. Its outcome will depend to a  great extent on the personal disposition of the higher  leadership of the country. For the time being it resembles a  ``pendulum,'' swinging first in one direction, and then in the  other.    Meanwhile, as strong worlds quarrel one with the other, a  great many so- called academies are appearing, specializing in  all possible branches, and ever-wider spreading their wings.  Organized as independent structures, they now are more and more  frequently having success in wrangling budgeted money from the  state. Just what are these academies? As a example it is  possible to cite an excerpt from the unusual publicity  prospectus of the MIA (International Academy of Information  Science), recently promoting a forum on information science:  ``The enterprises, organizations, institutions and private  individuals participating in conducting of the forum for a  sponsor's fee in the amount of 300 thousand rubles are elected  without competition to regular membership in the MAI and the  director is elected as an honorary member of the Academy.''</p>

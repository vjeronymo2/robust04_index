Abkhazians won  the war, but it's the temporary victory", Valerian Advadze,  Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Georgia to  Russia, told yesterday March 15 at his press-conference in  Moscow.    According to Valerian Advadze, the danger of separatism  exists not only for Georgia but also for the other countries of  the world. "The separatism in Abkhazia should be curbed,  otherwise it will bring to civil wars".    So, the Russian Federation should support Georgia otherwise  Russia will solve the same problems.    Mr. Advadze considers the visit of the Georgian leader  Eduard Shevardnadze to the UN "very successful". The main aim  of the visit was to convince world community of the necessity to  introduce the peace-making forces into the zone of the conflict,  to get the economical aid and political support of the  Shevardnadze's course.    [Yerevan SNARK in English at 0916 in a similarly datelined  report adds: "Abkhazia is the land of Georgia. It's necessary  to recognize Abkhazia as a part of the Georgian state to prevent  the possible bloodshed, Valerian Advadze, Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary Ambassador of Georgia to Russia, told in his  exclusive interview to SNARK.    ["According to Mr. Ambassador, Abkhazia is guilty in  torpedoing peace negotiations as she doesn't recognize the  territorial integrity of Georgia.    ["'World speaks for Georgia and the Shevardnadze's visit to  the UN confirms such attitude. There doesn't exist any state  which recognizes the independence of Abkhazia. Abkhazians speak  against the will of the whole world community', Mr. Advadze  said."]</p>

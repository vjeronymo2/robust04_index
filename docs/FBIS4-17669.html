			<p>BFN     [Text] The Commander-in-Chief of the Ukrainian Navy, Rear  Admiral Vladimir Bezkorovainyy, has described relocating the  Ukrainian navy from Sevastopol as "unrealistic."    In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine Monday, he said "in  this case it would be necessary to relocate about 4,000 families  of officers and midshipmen of the Ukrainian Navy." "Under the  current economic situation in Ukraine, this is practically  impossible," Bezkorovainyy said.    A top-ranking Ukrainian Navy officer told INTERFAX-Ukraine  that stationing the Ukrainian navy in Balaklava was impossible.  The officer added that "in the bay of Balaklava there were only  17 moorages, 15 of which were already occupied by border guards'  boats."    Prior to this, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said the  Ukrainian navy could be stationed in Balaklava.    The same source was quoted as saying that "vessels with a  displacement of more than 1,000 tons presently built for  Ukraine's fleet -- patrol boats and small anti-submarine vessels  -- cannot enter the bay."    To ensure the fleet's normal functioning, it also needs to  use the Streletskaya and Karantinnaya bays situated within  Sevastopol's city line, a source in the Ukrainian navy  headquarters said.    The same source supposed that the Ukrainian navy could  jointly use 17 infrastructural installations of the Black Sea  Fleet located in Sevastopol. "Only in this case the Ukrainian  navy will be able to develop normally," the officer added.</p>

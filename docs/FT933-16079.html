			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Six Tories back Labour on pits plan THE GOVERNMENT secured a majority of 22 in the Commons last night to shrug off a revolt by six Tory backbenchers who voted for a Labour motion condemning the closure of pits which were expected to secure a reprieve through increased sales of coal for electricity generation. In a hard-hitting speech Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme) attacked the government for not providing any evidence that it had the will or determination to widen the market for coal. Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (C Batley and Spen), Mr Richard Alexander (C Newark), Mr William Cash (C Stafford), Mrs Ann Winterton (C Congleton) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield) also voted against the government. Several Conservative MPs abstained. The Labour motion, which claimed that the government had encouraged the belief that 12 pits facing early closure would be reprieved, was defeated by 308 votes to 286. A government amendment backing the introduction of legislation to privatise British Coal was carried by a majority of 22 (307-285). In closing a boisterous debate Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, sought to placate the Tory critics by stressing that the government would support the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in organising employee-management buyouts. He said the government would provide 50 per cent - up to a maximum of Pounds 200,000 - of the costs incurred by each employee-management team in engaging consultants and advisers to enable them to compete with other bidders. Mr Eggar claimed jeers by Labour MPs sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers showed that they were not interested in Nottingham miners having a chance to buy the pits in which they worked. He told those Tory MPs who were critical of the electricity generators for refusing to sell unwanted coal-fired stations at a price below the cost of new gas fired installations that the director-general of electricity regulation was reviewing the matter. Responding to demands that the government should increase the demand for coal by requiring the electricity generators to limit the rundown of their stockpile of 33m tons Mr Eggar warned that whatever decision was reached it would be unlikely to make a significant impact for at least the next few months. Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, insisted that government had not given any guarantee that the 12 pits could be saved. Shadow trade secretary Mr Robin Cook argued that with the market 'rigged' against it British Coal could not be blamed because, even with the new subsidy offered by the government, it had so far failed to secure additional orders from the electricity generators.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Flood of gilts leads to a bout of indigestion UK GOVERNMENT bonds fell by up to  3/4 of a point at the long end as the recent heavy supply weighed on the gilt market. After last Wednesday's Pounds 3bn auction of 20-year stock, the Bank of England issued Pounds 600m of 10-year gilts, and on Friday it announced a further Pounds 650m of conventional and index-linked stock for sale. Dealers said a call for Pounds 1.8bn on partly-paid stock yesterday provided an additional burden for the market. 'The market is coming to terms with the fact that about Pounds 5bn of calls fall due in the next six weeks,' said Mr John Kendall, economist at Baring Sterling Bonds. Mr John Shepperd, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, said: 'The auction was well-absorbed, but the new tranches came a bit to soon - there's been some consolidation and now there's some indigestion.' The two new tap stocks announced on Friday include Pounds 250m of the 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 and Pounds 150m of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2020. Dealers reported some buying of both stocks, although neither tap stock was exhausted. The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 fell  1/8 of a point to 102 1/16 by late afternoon while the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 dropped  23/32 to 106 19/32 . Separately, figures released yesterday by the Bank showed that foreigners bought Pounds 1.03bn of gilts in February, following two months of net selling of UK government debt. GERMAN government bonds ended firmer, ignoring comments from the Bundesbank president that short-term interest rates were unlikely to be cut imminently. Mr Helmut Schlesinger was quoted in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung as saying that the Bundesbank should not undertake too rapid an easing of key interest rates. Bund futures opened at 95.28 and traded in a range of 95.24 to 95.49, ending the day at 95.34. US TREASURY prices were slightly higher and the rest of the yield curve mostly flat as traders marked time before US consumer and wholesale price data is released later this week. The recent rise in long-bond yields has focused attention on inflation risks. The US will report its index of March wholesaler prices on Thursday. On Friday, a market holiday, data on March US consumer prices will be reported. Traders expect both figures to be up 0.3 of a percentage point. By late afternoon, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  11/32 higher at 101 5/32 , yielding 7.028 per cent. Among shorter-dated maturities, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99 7/8 to yield 3.924 per cent, and the 3-month Treasury bill was also down  1/16 at 2.90, yielding 2.94 per cent. The Federal Reserve executed three-day system repurchase agreements today, injecting liquidity into the banking system. The federal funds were trading at 3 1/8 per cent late in the day. Traders said the Fed requested fixed collateral for the repos, a factor that is tied to the fact the US is bumping up its congressionally-mandated debt ceiling. A Republican fillibuster in the Senate over President Bill Clinton's stimulus package continues to block action to raise the debt ceiling. As a result, today's weekly sale of Dollars 22.4 bn in 13-week and 26-week Treasury bills has been postponed. JAPANESE government bond prices fell back, taking their cue from the continued rally in the stock market and uncertainty over the extent to which the government's supplementary budget would be funded by bond issuance. The futures contract opened at 108.31, down from Friday's close of 108.53, and fell to a low of 107.97 before ending at 108.16 in Tokyo. The bond market remained weak despite the yen's continued strength against the US dollar. The yen/dollar rate firmed to a new high of 113.30 before moving back to 113.75.</p>

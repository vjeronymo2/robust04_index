			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / TVR to boost sports car production TVR, the Blackpool-based independent sports car maker, is doubling the size of its manufacturing plant and starting its first night shift to build a third range of cars and expand production. The company said last night that it had taken orders worth Pounds 10m for the Cerbera, a new 2 + 2 coupe model exhibited at last week's UK motor show which will enter commercial production before the end of the year. The Pounds 33,000 car will be the first to use an engine of TVR's own design and manufacture, a 350 horsepower V8. TVR said the Cerbera would help lift its output to above 1,000 cars this year for the first time in the company's 40-year history. The company said: 'The Pounds 10m covers the supply of 276 cars and means that production next year could well rise to 1,350 to 1,400.' TVR produced 827 cars last year, and just over 500 in the first seven months of this year. Mr Peter Wheeler, the company's chairman and owner for the past decade, has been cautious about expansion because of the notoriously cyclical nature of the specialist car market. However, TVR's image as a sports car maker has been raised sharply since 1990 by the launch of the two-seater models it has in production, the Griffith and Chimaera. The bigger Cerbera is regarded as providing a sufficiently broad product range for higher output. An additional 100 workers - bringing the total to 300 - have been trained in its manufacturing processes in the past 18 months, with more jobs yet to be created. The additional number is not expected to be large, however. Most of the higher production will come from increased efficiency as the result of acquiring a big ware-house adjoining the main factory. TVR said it would double the available area for assembly and eliminate production bottlenecks.</p>

SADF spokesman Maj Frank Halforty told SAPA on Tuesday the  requirement for 1994 was 5,000 volunteers. If this figure could  not be attained, an electronic ballot draft system would be  applied to school leavers to make up for the shortfall.  However, at this stage it appeared the target of 5, 000  volunteers would be reached. He said 200 of the volunteers  would go to the navy and the rest would be mustered into the  army unless the air force required volunteer manpower.    The new volunteer intake would be recruited over two to  three  days, Maj Halforty said. He added the basic standards  applicable to national servicemen of old, such as basic  educational qualifications and health requirements, would apply  to volunteer recruits of all races. When asked whether recruits  would be expected to answer questions about military experience  gained in formations such as Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing], Maj Halforty said he did not think  this would be the case.    He said the volunteers would be required to complete a  year's  full-time military service after which they would have to attend  eight 30-day camps spread over eight years.</p>

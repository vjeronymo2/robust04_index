			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There are approximately 869 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 147 airplanes of U.S. registry would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by this proposed AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> It would take approximately 122 work hours per airplane to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed replacement of fuse pins with bulkhead style pins. The average labor rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact on U.S. operators who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace fuse pins with bulkhead style pins is estimated to be $7,320 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> It would take approximately 140 work hours per airplane to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed replacement of fuse pins with third generation pins. The average labor rate is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact on U.S. operators who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replace fuse pins with third generation pins is estimated to be $8,400 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> It would take approximately 1.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed inspections (in addition to the work hours necessary for fuse pin replacement).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on U.S. operators for the proposed inspections is estimated to be $90 per airplane per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The cost of required replacement parts would vary from airplane to airplane,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depending upon the current airplane configuration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The number of required work hours, as indicated above, is presented as if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of the proposed inspection and replacement actions were to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted as ``stand alone'' actions. However, in actual practice, these actions, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most part, would be accomplished coincidentally or in combination with normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled airplane inspections and other maintenance program tasks. Therefore, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual number of necessary additional work hours would be minimal in many instances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, any costs associated with special airplane scheduling would be minimal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintaining safe aircraft, prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they were not required to do so by the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this proposed AD. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as in this proposed AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original cost-beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD would be redundant and unnecessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0011 horztab --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act.

In the message he sent to the heads of governments and  states, Demirel stated that the Sarajevo massacre proves once  more that its inhabitants are left to the mercy of the Serbian  aggressors. Demirel said the international community should  initiate a military operation against the oppressors, thus  stopping the bloodshed and making the aggressor accept a just  and lasting peace.    Recalling the resolutions reached at the United Nations and  NATO, Demirel asked NATO to act within the framework of these  resolutions in order to end the suffering and tragedy in Bosnia  as soon as possible. Demirel also asked the UN Security Council  to provide the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina their most natural  right -- the right to defend themselves.</p>

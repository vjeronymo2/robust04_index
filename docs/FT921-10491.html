			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Bush takes message on economy to businessmen PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday intensified his campaign to persuade Congress to approve his economic recovery plan, urging the business community to send legislators a message of 'no more delay, no substitutes'. Speaking to the Small Business Legislative Council, he asked for support in his 'rifle-shot approach to stimulate this economy'. It was the latest in a series of appearances to promote the programme in his State of the Union address last week. The president emphasised the themes in his plan: a 90- day moratorium on new regulations 'that destroy jobs and weigh down business'; a lowering of capital gains tax; a 15 per cent investment tax credit; penalty-free withdrawals from individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and other measures to boost housing; and a new health plan, to be unveiled today in Cleveland. Congress is not ignoring the president's programme or his deadline of March 20. Senate majority leader George Mitchell yesterday was said to be prepared to ask senators to work through their scheduled March 9-13 recess. However, with polls showing little voter enthusiasm for the president's plan, the Democrats are working on their own versions in both the House and the Senate. The House Ways and Means Committee has begun to mark up legislation providing a Dollars 200 (Pounds 111) to Dollars 400 middle class tax refund over the next two years paid for by higher taxes on the wealthy. It may also include a narrowly focused capital gains tax cut, an investment tax credit and liberalisation of IRAs. In Congress as a whole, the Democrats have yet to achieve a consensus. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate finance committee, will hold hearings later this month starting with his own tax credit and savings proposal. He would finance his scheme by higher cuts in defence spending.</p>

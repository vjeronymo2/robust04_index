			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: HOW TO HANDLE FITS OF ANGER  </P> <P> It's said that people have more difficulty coping with anger than with any  other single problem. How much do you know about handling resentment and rage?  Here's a chance to test your views. Answer true or false.  </P> <P> 1. The healthiest, best way to cope with anger is to ventilate it -- "let it  all hang out."  </P> <P> 2. Fantasizing can help people deal with anger.  </P> <P> 3. Humor and anger are incompatible.  </P> <P> 4. If you're really angry, stop what you're doing, get down to the business of  talking, and settle matters once and for all.  </P> <P> 5. Being totally honest at all times is a way to avoid and overcome anger.  </P> <P> 6. Children who abuse their toys or who bully other children may be making a  statement about their inability to handle anger.  </P> <P> 7. Everybody feels better after expressing anger.  </P> <P> 8. Passion and anger are basically the same.  </P> <P> ANSWERS:  </P> <P> 1. FALSE. This is usually not a constructive way to cope with rage, for  although the time to "let it all hang out" may be right for you, it may be  wrong for the other person. You may end up worse off than before.  </P> <P> 2. TRUE. Daydreaming or fantasizing about what you'd like to do to your boss,  your ex or even to a bad-tempered child won't hurt anyone, and it can be a  safety valve. You never need to feel guilty about your fantasies as long as you  don't act them out.  </P> <P> 3. FALSE. While laughter is often a good release for anger, most humor has a  certain amount of rage at its core. Many jokes are disguised rage.  </P> <P> 4. FALSE. This may not be a good idea because if your emotions are too charged,  you may not be able to be rational. Often, it's better to wait, take time out,  count to 20, walk around the block or go to a movie, before attempting to  confront the issues.  </P> <P> 5. FALSE. As Laura Singer, past president of the American Assn. for Marriage  and Family Therapy, pointed out, to be honest at all times is really to act out  a lot of aggression and hostility.  </P> <P> 6. TRUE. Such youngsters often attack toys, animals or other children because  they're afraid to express any negative feelings to parents or other adults. The  child who is too sweet, too perfect with adults may be sitting on a mountain of  rage.  </P> <P> 7. FALSE. This is a dangerous myth. Often people feel worse after blowing up  and letting all their rage fall where it may. This kind of freedom of  expression usually ends up exacerbating the problem.  </P> <P> 8. FALSE. Often people like to excuse destructive displays of temper with the  excuse that they're passionate. Passion doesn't mean a lack of control, but  rather an intensity of feeling.  </P> <P> If you answered six of these questions correctly, you're better informed than  most on this subject.  </P></p>

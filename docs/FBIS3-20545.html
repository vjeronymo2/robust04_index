Key To Further  Advance Lies in New Actions Says Ge Hui (2047 6540), the Officer  in Charge of the National Machinery and Electronics Products  Export Office, in Response to Correspondents' Questions"]    [Text] National Machinery and Electronics Product Export  Office officer Ge Hui recently said in response to  correspondents questions about the country's exports of  machinery and electronics products during 1993 that exports of  these products totaled $22.5 billion, up 13 percent from the  previous year. He added, however, that the key to further  advance lay in new approaches and new actions.    In reviewing the golden age of machinery and electronics  product exports from 1986 to 1992, Ge Hui told the  correspondents that thanks to the enormous growth during this  seven-year period, the country's foreign exchange earnings from  machinery and electronics products exports shot up from $1.62  billion yuan in 1985 to $19.55 billion in 1992, an average  annual 42 percent rise. China's exports of machinery and  electronics products also increased from 0.3 to 1.3 percent of  world trade in machinery and electronics products. Exports of  machinery and electronics products also rose from 6.1 to 23  percent of the country's foreign trade exports, machinery and  electronics products now ranking second after textiles  (including clothing) among the country's exports.    While evaluating the overall trend of development of China's  exports of machinery and electronics products in 1993, Ge Hui  stressed the need to look at them in the following two ways:  First, machinery and electronics product exports continue to  rise between 5 and 6 percentage points relative to foreign trade  exports. Second, the 13 percent increase in machinery and  electronics product exports during 1993 is far lower than the 40  percent of the previous year. After seven years of high speed  growth of machinery and electronics product exports, hidden  worries about insufficient export strength have begun to set in  again.    What are the reasons? Ge Hui believes there are five  reasons:    First is the impact of the overall climate. During  1993 the domestic market made a good showing. Demand was very  brisk for commodities of an investment nature, such as machinery  and electronics products for direct use in capital construction.  This intensified the strain between the international market and  the domestic market.    Second, too brisk domestic demand caused excessive rise  in the prices of raw and processed materials such as steel. This  led, in turn, to a rise in foreign trade enterprises' export  costs, which impaired exporting firms returns from exports and  increased export business difficulties. In addition was the  good domestic market prices of machinery and electronics goods.  The problem of returns from export sales not being as good as  those from domestic sales became more glaring. Many production  firms put greater emphasis on domestic market sales.    Third was further intensification of foreign trading  firms' funds shortage. During 1992 and the first half of  1993, the country's financial order was somewhat chaotic. Bank  discounting of loans in violation of regulations was rampant.  This also meant that the banks could not fully ensure a supply  of funds for foreign trade enterprises. Some foreign trade  corporations and industrial and trading corporations also tied  up fairly large amounts of money in real estate and stock  speculation.    Fourth, failure of state agencies concerned to enforce  foreign trade export business policies also directly impaired  the zeal of large numbers of export business. Examples  include inability to offset renminbi payments when paying  foreign exchange to the government, burdensome export tax rebate  procedures, and inability to get tax rebates promptly. Of  course, the situation improved following rectification of  financial procedures and greater macroeconomic regulation and  control during the last half of 1993.    Fifth, the export mechanism shows no formation as yet  of a mechanism whereby enterprises can make their own business  decisions, be responsible for their own profits and losses,  restrain themselves, develop themselves, and expand exports as  they like. New problems also occurred in the course of  reform. Some foreign trade corporations unilaterally construed  the "primarily one business but running multiple businesses"  that state policy permitted to mean making money mostly inside  the country. They did not put much effort into the fundamental  task of earning foreign exchange for the country. During 1993, a  substantial number of foreign trading corporations and  industrial and trading corporations showed zero or negative  increase in exports.    Ge Hui said that after an analysis and validation by units  and locations concerned based on actual circumstances in China  and the trend of world economic development at the All-China  Machinery and Electronics Products Export Work Conference held  in early 1993, a three stage development goal was set for  China's machinery and electronics products exports: This was to  export approximately $30 billion worth of machinery and  electronics products by 1995 by meeting two years ahead of  schedule the State Council proposed $20 billion export goal by  the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan; exporting approximately  $60 billion worth by 2000, machinery and electronics products  thereby becoming China's first major category of exports; and  exporting approximately $150 million worth in approximately 15  years beginning now.    Ge Hui emphasized that attainment of this magnificent goal  will require new approaches and new actions. He discussed this  issue from several angles.    First is the export products question. Vigorous  efforts must be made to adjust the export product mix, truly  creating a number of primary export products such as complete  factories, ships, motor vehicles, and electronic products. If  these products are to become the country's dominant exports,  China will have to formulate corresponding industrial policies,  draw up concrete methods, increase investment, speed up  technological transformation, improve its product development  capabilities, raise the level of its technology, and improve  testing.    Second is the export market question. Today,  international markets are the weakest link in the expansion of  machinery and electronics products exports. The urgent task of  the moment is further improvement of ability to open up  international markets. This means both focusing on the opening  of important markets that have a large capacity, and  simultaneously paying attention to places that have market  potential (such as Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa),  doing all possible to create conditions to enter these areas.  This is the only way of forming an all-points, diversified  market pattern to reduce export risks. Henceforth, we will have  to fashion a composite force made up of designated foreign trade  corporations, production firms that do their own exporting, and  foreign owned concerns for joint opening of international  markets. We must gradually build a number of primarily  industrial or primarily trade export enterprise blocs to pursue  a course of greater internationalization, greater  industrialization, and greater commercialization.    Next is the trading methods question. Trading  methods must be more flexible. We must further develop the  importation of materials for processing and re-export and  develop OEM methods, i.e., use the manufacturing techniques,  blueprints and materials of foreign firms to manufacture  products bearing the trademarks of foreign forms, and using  foreign firm commercial channels to sell them in international  markets. We must operate joint ventures or produce and design in  cooperation with foreign firms, investing in the operation of  plants abroad to develop CKD and SKD assembled exports to expand  exports of machinery and electronics products.    With the steady intensification of our foreign trade system  reforms, the domestic market will gradually dovetail with the  international market. Some methods used in China that are not in  keeping with international practice will gradually weaken. Ge  Hui emphasized that the role of finance and banking in  supporting exports will becoming increasingly important. He  believes that the state should intensify financial support for  machinery and electronics products exports. While ensuring the  short term operating funds needed to expand exports, the state  should more greatly increase intermediate and long term export  credit, grant preferential credit interest rates for sellers,  and support exports of large and complete plants and equipment,  as well as aircraft, and ships. Formation of a Chinese  import-export bank should be accelerated. We should learn from  the experiences of Japan and South Korea in export and import  banks support for the export of complete plants. Once China has  founded an export-import bank, it should assume the credit risks  that ordinary commercial banks do not want to assume or are  unable to assume, preferential credit being used to increase the  competitiveness of China's machinery and electronics products in  international markets.    Ge Hui said that the gradual intensification of reform  should  bring about the quickest possible formation of a mechanism  whereby enterprises are responsible for their own operation, for  their own profits and losses, for limiting themselves, for  developing themselves, and for expanding exports. Truly  effective policy measures should be formulated to arouse the  interest of exporting enterprises in expanding exports. Ge Hui  also especially emphasized the need to make the most of the role  of the coordinated guidance and consulting services that the  Machinery and Electronics Product Export Chamber of Commerce  provides in building a regular export order. As government's  function changes, not only will the Chamber of Commerce  coordinate export prices, customers, and markets, but export  quota assignments and preliminary examination of export licenses  will gradually come to be handled by the Chamber of Commerce.  The Chamber of Commerce must substantially improve its  organizational structure to meet the needs of deepening reform.  He said that a "Foreign Trade Law," and "Regulations for  Punishing Sales of Exports at Low Prices" must be drawn up as  quickly as possible, legal methods use to prevent a chaotic  situation. Punishments must be particularly emphasized,  violations of the law dealt with according to law, severe  punishments meted out depending on the seriousness of the  offense, and for causing severe economic losses for the country.    Reportedly, acting in the spirit of State Council structural  reforms, a National Machinery and Electronics Products  Import-Export Office organized from the merger of the former  State Council Machinery and Electronics Products Export Office  and the State Council Machinery and Electronics Equipment Import  Coordination Office is to become the functional unit of the  National Economics and Trade Commission. Ge Hui said that the  new organization will formulate support policies as reform  steadily intensifies. Just as in the past, it will be in charge  of needed macroeconomic regulation and control measures to move  ahead and spur healthy development of the machinery and  electronics products import-export trade.    The CPC Central Committee's listing of the machinery and  electronics industry as a principal industry in the national  economy has greatly encouraged the millions of staff members and  workers on the machinery front. "Close involvement in reform,  hastening development, vigorous development, and making the most  of the national economy's dominant role," have become action  slogans for stimulating an all-out effort throughout the  industry. The development program for invigorating the machinery  industry that the Ministry of Machinery has drawn up has been  revised many times and will soon appear.    Human talent is the keystone in dominant industries. One  important aspect of the invigoration of the machinery industry  is good management and good use of all kinds of specialists and  technical talent to improve the caliber of the rank and file  throughout the industry.    Survey data show that as education, the economy, and science  and technology develop, and as society and enterprises  increasingly respect science and technology as well as  scientific and technical talent, the speed of growth of  technicians in the machinery system has been markedly higher  than the total number of staff members and workers. Statistics  from 10 dominant enterprises show an 8.6 percent increase in the  total number of staff members and workers between 1988 and 1991,  but a 20.8 percent increase in the number of technicians. At the  same time, the caliber of technicians as a whole has also risen  markedly, and the percentage of graduate students, and college  undergraduates has increased by varying degrees. An environment  of respect for human talent, respect for knowledge, and respect  for contributions is gradually taking shape.    However, by comparison with needs in invigorating the  machinery industry, numerous problems in need of immediate  solution continue in the training and use of human talent.  <H5>  Human Talent Utilization Efficiency Not High </H5>   A questionnaire survey of 201 scientific and technical  personnel shows that only 5.5 percent of scientific and  technical personnel in the machinery and electronics industry  personnel feel that their skills are being used to the full;  39.8 percent feel they largely apply their talents; and 17.4  percent believe their talents are not being used at all. In  another survey of engineers in large and medium size  enterprises, 72 percent felt they were being held back, 80  percent felt work unsatisfying, and only 5 percent put in  overtime. Such a slack and easy going state of affairs naturally  creates not very high work efficiency. Some comparative data for  1988 is shocking. In Japan, per capita gross output value of  engineers in the machinery industry was $350,000, while it was  only $84,000 in China. This is to say that in machinery  industries having the same output value, China used 4.1 times  the number of engineers as Japan.    There are both structural reasons and conceptual reasons for  this state of affairs. Examples include out of date products,  antiquated organizational methods, softening of demand for  technology and for technical personnel, and being accustomed to  the expansion of extensive inputs primarily, using large amounts  of money and manpower; and a serious shortage of development  funds that leads to having a large number of technical personnel  in name but not in reality, which makes the development of new  products very difficult, and makes it even harder to translate  scientific research achievements into production. (The money  provided for technical progress in some developed nations  generally runs between 3 and 5 percent of total sales. In strong  Japanese enterprises, it runs as high as 10 percent. In China,  by contrast, many enterprises invest less than 1 percent.) A  Shanghai survey shows 70 percent of new research achievements  have not been translated into the development of products. The  value of knowledge is not fully appreciated. Many enterprises  continue to treat scientific and technical personnel like  organizational cadres, their average bonus being between 10 and  30 percent less than workers on the front line of production.  Egalitarianism in distributions is a serious problem. "It makes  no difference whether one works or does not work," or whether  one "does not work and also takes few risks." This situation  results in scientific and technical personnel not doing their  best; production efficiency in the enterprise itself is not  high; and overstaffing is the general rule, etc.  <H5>  Serious Flight of Human Talent </H5>   Surveys show that despite the increase in technicians in the  machinery and electronics industry in recent years, in  state-owned enterprises -- particularly in large- and  medium-sized enterprises -- the dropping out of skilled  personnel, the aging of human talent, and the flight of human  talent is extremely serious. It is mostly middle age and young  permanent scientific and technical cadres that leave. A sample  survey showed a decline from 24.6 to 19.28 percent in the number  of scientific and technical personnel between the ages of 30 and  40 between 1986 and 1991. Another survey showed the flight of  more than one-third of the young scientific and technical  personnel during the past five years from large- and medium-size  machinery and electronics enterprises. More than 60 of the best  graduates of institutions of higher education assigned to the  Dalian Municipal Machinery Bureau were snapped up by the three  kinds of partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Between  1984 and 1990, 4000 university graduates were assigned to a  Beijing machine tool plant. More than half have already left.  The problem in frontier regions is particularly serious. Survey  statistics from 287 enterprises show only 7.92 percent of  technicians in enterprises today are between 31 and 35 years of  age, and 14.5 percent are between 26 and 30 years old. The  flight of human talent not only weakens enterprises technical  strength, but also damages continuity. It tends to create a  vicious cycle.    The main reasons for the flight and dropping out of human  talent are that large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  are in the least favorable position in the intense competition  for human talent. They cannot compete with the three kinds of  partially or wholly foreign-owned enterprises, or with township  and town enterprises, in earnings. In the probability of making  a name for oneself and opportunities to travel abroad,  state-owned enterprises cannot compete with educational and  scientific research units. In housing, working conditions, and a  feeling of being respected, state-owned enterprises cannot  compete with administrative institutions. In work freedom, work  environment, and income, state-owned enterprises cannot compete  with companies of all kinds. Yet another important reason for  the flight of human talent is that technicians can more easily  put their talents to use in the three kinds of partially or  wholly foreign-owned enterprises, and in township and town  enterprises, unlike in some large- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises where seniority and age play a role, and where  people are not used to the full. This corrodes people's spirit  and enthusiasm.  <H5>  Accelerate Building of a Human Talent Corps </H5>   Informed people believe that the priority task in  invigorating the machinery industry is accelerating the creation  of a high caliber specialist corps that combines ability and  political integrity, and that is sensibly composed. The human  talent strategy that the Ministry of Machinery espouses is  "maintenance of continuity in the corps, optimization of the  make-up, improvement of caliber, and speedy selection for  promotion and training of middle agent and young permanent  technical cadres and academic leaders so that new technical  personnel will be available to replace old technical personnel  over the next 10 years. It wants to build a technician corps of  good political quality, that has fine professional skills, whose  make-up is rational, that is highly trained, and that is imbued  with vitality to meet the needs of reform and opening to the  outside world, scientific and technical competition, and social  development."    The specific measures that the Ministry of Machinery has  proposed to attain this strategic goal are the founding of a  human talent bank, including the establishment first of a high  level specialized talent bank, accelerated training of  three-in-one talent (technology, management, and sales), and  four-in-one talent (technology, management, sales, and foreign  language); founding of a human talent exchange center,  improvement of enterprises competitiveness, using fair  competition as a basis for accurately guiding rational exchanges  of human talent; formulation of preferential policies for the  importation of scientific and technical management talent;  founding a rewards system, increasing investment in education,  etc. In short, "human talent engineering" is imminent.</p>

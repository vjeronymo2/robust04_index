Official Algerian sources had spoken of 900 prisoners  escaping in Thursday's break-out from the Tazoult jail, located  400 kilometres (240 miles) southeast of Algiers, near Batna.    The prisoners escaped when a force of Islamic guerrillas  stormed the jail at dusk just as the evening meal was being  served.    According to the Front spokesman, all those who escaped were  "political prisoners of the FIS rank-and-file". Four hundred  were serving life sentences and 350 had been condemned to death  by special courts, he said.    Other sources had earlier indicated that the escapees  included some common criminals.    In Algiers, security forces said Monday they had killed 24  and recaptured 79 of the prisoners. The hunt for the others was  continuing and "a large amount of arms" had been found, they  said.    According to the FIS spokesman, the authorities responded to  the break-out by launching air-attacks using napalm in the  western Aures region, to which the prisoners fled before  "fanning out all over the country".    In Thursday's guerrilla attack against the Tazoult jail, one  warder was killed, four were wounded and seven abducted,  according to official Algerian sources. Two prison employees  were accomplices, the Interior Ministry said.    The spokesman for the FIS abroad also said that at least 61  members of the security forces had died in clashes with armed  Islamic groups between February 28 and March 5, mainly in the  Algiers region.    An earlier toll spoke of 187 killed in the period February  13-28.    The FIS said 105 soldiers had been killed at the beginning  of  February in an ambush at Sidi Bel-Abes, south of Oran.    Moslem fundamentalists launched an armed insurgency against  the Algerian authorities two years ago, after the cancellation  of general elections which the fundamentalist FIS had been  poised to win.    The Interior Ministry announced Monday that an overnight  curfew imposed more than a year ago but eased during the Ramadan  period would return to normal hours from Tuesday and run from  midnight (2300 GMT) to 4:00 a.m. (0300 GMT).    During Ramadan Moslems fast during the day, only taking  their  first meal at nightfall, which is thus a moment of relaxation.  That was the moment the assailants stormed the prison, FIS  sources said.</p>

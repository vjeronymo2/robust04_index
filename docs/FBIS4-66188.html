			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Collection of essays: "An Investigative Report on China's </F> Surplus Rural Labor Force; Exploring the Sources, Part III --  Can They Leave Home But Not Their Roots?"]    [Text] Toil for Six Months, Idle for Six Months--by  Lu Yaogang [4141 6460 0474]    Huxia village is right next to the Zhegan railroad and the  Qingping highway and Huangcha highway; it is very accessible.  The county party committee secretary Du Shuiyuan [2629 3055  3293] told me that Huangtugang is considered a poor town in  Zhangshu City and Yichun Prefecture, but compared to the rest of  the county, Huxia Village is average in development. On the days  I was there, it was in the midst of the pig-slaughtering season,  but it was quiet everywhere. I was told by the villager that it  is easier to go to town to buy pork than to raise pigs.    Villager Zou Liuya [6760 2696 5370] has a family of four.  They only eat meat at New Years and on special occasions. On the  day I visited, his house was filled with the aroma of meat  cooking. He uncovered the piping-hot pan and said, "This is  someone's dead pig. It died of some disease and was buried. I  just dug it up." He said it is the luck of the poor--they can  eat anything and will never get sick from it. How many in Huxia  are living like Zou Liuya?    The villagers say things are much better for the last decade  or so. Prior to 1977, Menghe River which passes through the  village overflew almost every year, and in bad years, one could  earn only a few cents for full-time work. But two things have  changed things around. In 1977, massive water conservancy and  capital construction work was undertaken. Back then, Qingjiang  County (renamed Zhangshu County in October 1988) made a vigorous  effort to straighten out Menghe River and built a large dam,  radically solving the flood problem. Secondly, after the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee,  family-based farm allotment was implemented, which at last gave  the people enough to eat and to keep warm. But a decade later,  Huxia village's people are still just "fed and warm" but have  made no further progress. There has been no increase in  farmland, but population has increased and the labor force has  increased. Huxia's village party committee estimated that of the  village's 633 workers, at least one-third are surplus and the  other two-thirds are farm workers who "toil half a year and sit  idle half a year." Can any village absorb a labor force nearly  half of which is idle?    After land was alloted to individual households, the  tractors  and other machinery and equipment owned by the original  collectives were sold. Every family, no matter how poor, now  keep oxen, and people keep to the old traditional farming  methods and mix of crops. Besides a small amount of rearing and  breeding (a fish pond, 60-some pigs, and 50-odd cattle) and the  three families that make sugar (and brew rice wine at the same  time), there is no other sideline production. At one time,  people grew fruit trees on a fairly large scale, but because of  theft, damages, and mismanagement, they failed. It is fair to  say that the land has reached beyond its limits.    Huangtugang town has a labor force of 11,900 but only 13  township enterprises of different sizes which can only  accommodate a little more than 2,000 people. More than half of  the town's surplus workers are working out of town. Because of  uneven regional economic development and various limitations in  the township enterprises, it is not likely that the town can  absorb more of the rural surplus labor in the near future so  that the people can leave the land without leaving their homes.    To Huxia village, poverty is not only a consequence, it is  also the cause of deterioration in the community. Standing on  the river bank, one can see the pigs and the cows boldly  munching on rape and the vegetables. Rats run amuck in the  village. But from the county party committee secretary to the  average villagers, they all tell me that one of the reasons they  cannot destroy the rats is that people may use killing rats as  an excuse to settle private scores and poison their neighbors'  chickens and ducks. Even worse are the high cost of getting  married, the concept of freedom of love and marriage, and the  closed community life. Since 1982, Huxia village have ignored a  thousand-year-old taboo and have allowed marriages within the  same clan and between families of the same surname. This trend  has taken off, and since 1982, 15 young couples have married.  What will happen in the future? What will be the consequences?  <H5>  Enterprises' Broken Dreams--by reporter Mao Hao [3029 3185] </H5>   Once Guozi village's 28-year-old Mayor Bo asked me, "Is a  place without mountains, without water, and without roads like  ours doomed to be poor forever?" This question sums up the  concern shared by every person in the hilly countries which make  up more than 60 percent of Sichuan's total area.    Actually I have learned in Guangan that like the rest of the  country, there have been several rounds of township enterprise  craze here, but they failed every time, leaving many unfinished  projects with very few benefits. I checked Hengsheng town's  enterprise list and discovered that most are brick factories and  breweries. Only this kind of enterprises that requires little  investment and can sell their products locally can survive. The  town party committee's secretary Jiang was talking on the town  government's only local battery telephone while telling me that,  "In the past, occasionally someone would think about opening a  plant here, but after they looked at the communications system  and the roads, and they looked at the food and lodgings here,  they left. Today, we are doing work of the 1990's but using  equipment of the 1950's."    Hengsheng holds an open-air market three times a week, and  on  market day, villagers from Guozi village will come to town early  in the morning, carrying their goods in baskets at the ends of  their bamboo poles and walking for an hour (the highway is not  finished). Prior to 1989, this was their only source of  sideline income. The development of Hengsheng's country market  is very incongruent with its population of 36,000, and its  service industry especially is out of step. In the beginning I  wondered why the vegetables in the restaurants in the rural  towns are more expensive than that in the county towns. Later I  learned that people here still have the habit of eating only  what is in season. If cabbage is in season, everybody eats  cabbage, and if turnips are in season, everybody eats turnips,  and if you want something different, you will have to go out to  buy it, which naturally will cost more. A noodle shop owner  complained, "It is hard to take precious money from the  villagers' pockets!" Thus, Hengsheng town which is so close to  the highway and could have made some money from the travelers is  losing out; the townspeople would rather spend a few more hours  on the road to get back to town even late at night.    Last year, Mayor Bo was all ambitious about opening a noodle  factory to fill the vacuum, because Guozi village had no  enterprise. But after looking around, he was completely  discouraged. Guozi village has a poor transportation system; its  products can only be sold in nearby localities, but the  neigboring localities have a rich tradition of being  self-sufficient and have little purchasing power anyway, so who  is going to buy their noodles?    This is a vicious cycle. They are poor, and so they cannot  afford to build infrastructure, and without infrastructure,  there is no investment and no project, and without money and  project, they cannot vigorously develop township enterprises,  and without township enterprises, there is no place for the  surplus labor to go, and if the productive forces cannot be put  to use, purchasing power will decline, and in turn the economy  cannot keep going, and so everybody stays poor. In recent years,  some more fortunate localities (such as Guangan's Hua and  Yuechi) have been able to take advantage of their natural  resources to break this vicious cycle. But for a hilly area like  Guozi village, prior to 1989, it seemed they would never get out  of this strange endless circle. Thus, when Liu Yanlin [0491 1693  2651] and Shao Yuanshou [6730 0337 1108] left town, in fact they  were paving a new way by creating a chain of workers-for-hire.  That is, people can use the most primitive capital--labor--to  earn their initial fund, skills, and experience.    When I was in Guizi village, Secretary Liu and Mayor Bo were  working on opening another brick factory. "Many people are  building houses nowadays. Selling the bricks is no problem. We  lack capital, but we have sent a letter to Boss Liu asking him  to invest some money here." I wish them luck with their  enterprise dream.  <H5>  Northern Jiangsu and Southern Jiangsu in Sharp Contrast--by </H5> reporter Dai Yuanzhi [2071 5913 2388]    Dagang village is situated in the town of Goudun. In the  office of the town government, young Comrade Zhang, in his "full  capacity as representative of the town party committee," was  receiving reporters. Someone told me that Comrade Zhang is the  secretary.    When Zhang talked about the town's 2,000-strong contingent  in  the service and business sector, his eyes lit up, and he said  proudly, "You all know about Beijing's Wangfujing Boulevard. It  is Beijing's most prosperous commercial street. There you will  find 184 of our Guodun natives. It is also known as `Guodun  Street.'"    Later, he spoke in a more serious tone, "From the long-term  perspective, the more workers we export, the worse off it will  be for the economy at home, and compared to the advanced  regions, the gap will only get bigger. Those who work in  southern Jiangsu are creating wealth for the south; most of  their money is taken away by the southerners."    In his office, Yancheng's mayor Xu Qiyao [1776 0366 5069]  told reporters that exporting labor can promote fresh ideas.  People not only make money and learn new skills, but their minds  are broadened, and they become more conscious about competition  and about the commodity economy.    This government official is also a high-ranking economist.  He  said, "Labor export promotes economic development and prosperity  among the people. Today, two-thirds of the people are working in  the fields, and so we must lead the surplus labor out of the  fields. When they find work elsewhere, they will have income,  and when they get rich, they can set up joint-household  processing and develop diversified management and earn even more  money, and in the future, when the economy is developed, they  can come home."    Guodun Town's Secretary Zhang has actually answered his own  question. Guodun Town has a labor force of 27,000 people and  92,000 mu of arable land. At an average of more than a mu per  person, there is plenty of surplus labor. The town has set up 29  enterprises and the village has 10 mainstay enterprises--"the  per capita income is comparable to that in farming" and they can  only "absorb a little over 3,000 people." Today, just those  working out-of-town in construction, remodelling, water  transport, and the service industry are numbered no less than  8,000. Each year, construction work generates 14 million yuan in  income.    In Chen Liang's [7115 0081] hometown, the villagers of  Dagang  have already figured out that of the village's 980 workers, only  500 are needed in the farms, and discounting the 100 who engage  in diversified management and family-based factory work, it  still leaves 380. Given their lack of funds and skills,  exporting labor is one solution.    In Yancheng, Cheng Jianjiang [4453 1696 3068], assistant  manager of the city's labor market, eagerly told the reporter  the following story:    Xiangshui County's Zhouji Township sends its surplus labor  north and south. Between the end of the year before and the  beginning of last year, more than 80 women workers were sent to  work in a factory in Wujiang in southern Jiangsu, and in return,  the factory set up a silk factory in Zhouji. It selected a group  of mainstay workers from among the young women who had gone to  work there and sent them back home, and in only a few month's  time, the factory was able to get into production and showed  some profit. It is fair to say that without the labor export,  there would have been no new silk factory.    Zhouji village has also organized nearly 600 people from  more  than 200 households to set up camp in Beijing to work on wheaten  food processing and services. In the first half of 1993, the net  amount of money remitted through the post offices from Beijing  to Zhouji increased by more than 400,000 yuan compared to the  same period a year ago. Beijing's utility workers even took the  initiative to install a program-controlled telephone for the  village party committee.    Those with insight in Yancheng feel that people in the  economically well-developed southern Jiangsu can leave the land  without leaving home, but in northern Jiangsu where the economy  is less well-developed, "to get rich, one solution is to export  the surplus labor."    Jiangsu is a prosperous coastal province. Although it has  920,000 township enterprises which can absorb 9.06 million  workers, it still has 340,000 surplus laborer to export. Of its  contingent of 1.28 million construction workers, 550,000 have to  find work elsewhere.  <H5>  There Is Sunshine to the East and Rain to the West--by </H5> reporter Liu Jian [0491 0256]    As soon as I got back to the village, several old men from  my  grandfather's generation gave me the "news": A fortune-teller  passing through the east end of the village exclaimed, "This  village is going to get mighty rich!" Quite a few villagers  believe in him, because in the last 10 years, Liujiaguanfang  village has produced more than a dozen state cadres who were  "champion growers." No other village came close. But still more  and more of Liujiaguanfang's young men and women are leaving the  village every year.    In the first few years, the village had a fairly decent  industrial project--a brick factory. The factory director was  hired from out-of-town. At the end of 1992, the factory and the  factory director got into a lawsuit in the village, and the  factory shut down, leaving the village with a sum of debts, and  adding interests, today, the amount is in excess of 20,000 yuan,  and adding the village's other debts, it owes no less than  300,000 yuan. With this 300,000-yuan burden, the village in fact  cannot start any more collective industrial and sideline  projects. First of all, it cannot get bank loans, and second, no  amount of money it earns can pay off its debts.    In recent years, the village has another big burden--cotton  subsidies. The village had not planted a single cotton plant in  almost 20 years, but in the last two years, the higher  authorities have changed their minds. Those who plant cotton are  rewarded, and those who don't are penalized. The rewards alone  cost the village several hundred thousand yuan.    A few years back, the village complied with the "six  complete  projects" to rebuild a fancy elementary school. It was abandoned  after only a few years. According to the authorities' new  program, village children in first and second grades and those  in third, fourth, and fifth grades are separately sent to two  nearby village schools. Money invested in building schools just  went down the drain.    Development of the individual economy has also run into  serious problems. They do not have sufficient accumulation funds  to set up factories. They can get into the tertiary industry  which may be easier. But then everybody begin to come up with  the same idea. A few years back, five families opened up small  department stores in the village. In the tiny little village,  where would the business come from? Before long, three of them  went out of business. The villagers have limited purchasing  power. Liu Hanming's best cigarette in his canteen is the  "Qingzhou" cigarette which costs 1.2 yuan a pack. He can't sell  two cartons in a year.    The most reliable is still the traditional handicrafts  handed  down from previous generations. The village has several old  carpenters; their crafts are handed down from father to son.  Today, 19 of them are making furniture for families in the  county towns and nearby barracks for people who "hold government  jobs." They earn a fairly good income. A carpenter's son is  almost of marrying-age, and people are breaking down their door  offering marriage proposals.    Another business that has attracted many young men is  driving  small, 12-horsepower tractors. These small tractors are  inexpensive, and they can haul and plow. Liujiaguanfang already  has 24 of these small tractors. Their main function is to haul  bricks and gravel for the construction plants and construction  units and peasant households. During the plowing season, they  can also make some money by doing some plowing in their own  villages. During the busy season, they can make a good sum of  money, but when there is no work and the machines stop running,  they must pay out of their own pockets, because they still have  to pay road toll.    Another market has only just developed in recent years, and  that is in the construction service industry. In the old days,  when the peasants built houses, their friends and families would  help out, and the host would provide the food and drinks; nobody  paid money; it was a personal favor. Today, may be people have  lost this kind of human touch or perhaps they are getting too  mercenary, and anyway, everybody is having a difficult time, and  when building houses, nobody ask their friends and relatives  anymore; they hire constractors, and they negotiate prices  beforehand and pay them off in one payment. Thus there is a  construction team that is partly well-organized and partly  not-so-well-organized, and that is a good sign.  <H5>  The One, Two, Threes of Enterprises--by reporter Sun Kai </H5> [1327 0418]    Xinzhuang village's Huang Erhu [7806 0059 7579] who spends  all year selling clothes in Xinjiang may be only 23 years old,  but his weather-worn face says it all. He told the reporter,  "There is so little land, and there are few township enterprises  to give us jobs. If we don't get out and make a go at it, how  are we going to survive?"    The reporter has learned that not just in Xinzhuang village  but in the entire Liufeng Township there is hardly a single  township enterprise. Today, most township enterprises are  construction companies and construction engineering teams that  work out-of-town year-round. When I asked why nobody has opened  industrial enterprises there, Xinzhuang's peasants said, "We  have many province-run and county-run enterprises in the county,  but most are failing and can't even pay wages. What peasant  would dare set up enterprises?"    Xinzhuang village's clerk, Huang Shengzhao [7806 0524 2156]  is the village's learned man. He said, "To set up enterprises,  one, we need money; two, we need projects; three, we need  skills. When it comes to money, to be honest, Xinzhuang's people  probably have some, but nowadays it is difficult to pick a good  project. So many enterprises that have been around for so many  years are failing. We are backward, and information is hard to  come by. Who dares to run an enterprise?"    Director Zhang of Gangu County's Labor Services Office said,  "We export labor and often have to travel abroad. I contacted a  Hong Kong businessman. I worked hard to recruit him to invest in  Gangu and build a factory here. I told him that Gangu's workers  are good and abundant, and labor cost is low, and he is bound to  make money if he invests and builds his factory here. But he  said even if our workers worked for free, he wouldn't build a  factory here. He said that our county didn't even have a  direct-line telephone (it was installed at the end of 1993), and  if anything should happen, he would simply worry sick.  Furthermore, he has a factory is in the Zhujiang Delta, and his  products can get to Hong Kong in no time, and whatever new  product Hong Kong has, information travels fast and he can react  immediately. But to build a factory in Gangu, the products would  have to be transported by train, through Baoji and then  Zhengzhou and so on, and who knows when they would reach Hong  Kong. That is why he would rather pay more to hire our workers  to go to work in the Zhujiang Delta."    Ganzu County's party committee vice secretary, Li Pingding  [2621 1627 1353] said, "The county worked hard at one time and  mobilized people to set up township enterprises and collective  enterprises. But at a meeting, some leading individual business  units said, `Many enterprises are failing these days. We should  be careful, for if we are reckless, if we fail, it would affect  some people, and so we ask the county not to be too demanding.'  The county leaders agreed with that reasoning and took Gangu's  actual conditions into consideration, and that is why it is not  emphasizing number but are striving to build one enterprise at a  time."    Xinzhuang's peasants say, "We hear that the peasants are  having no trouble setting up enterprises down south and that  they are always successful, which is something we can't measure  up to. It will be great one day when we too can build that many  factories, because then we will not have to suffer night and day  by working away from home."  <H5>  Appendix </H5>   Item/Village    Shandong:          Gansu:           Jiangxi:    Sichuan:    Jiangsu:                  Liujiaguangfang    Xinzhuang        Huxia       Guozi       Dagang                  village            village          village     village     village   village's own   300 people         more than 300    190         350         480  surplus labor    village-run     0                  4                0           0           0  enterprises                        (construction                                     work; work                                     out-of-town                                     year-round)   local           5                  3                13          7           29  township                           (construction  enterprises                        work; work                                     out-of-town                                     year-round)   township                           more than 800    2,029       142         more than  enterprises'                                                                3,000 (not  employment                                                                  including                                                                              those in                                                                              construction                                                                              and                                                                              transport)   village         11 (not include    more than 10     0           0           no data  employment      sideline                  productions)</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Record year for Border Television Border Television, the Carlisle-based independent television company, reported record profits for the first full year under the new franchise arrangements with a 32 per cent increase in profit from Pounds 1.25m to Pounds 1.64m. Turnover for the USM-quoted company fell to Pounds 9.87m (Pounds 11m) as a result of the loss of Channel Four airtime sales. Earnings per share came out at 12p (8.3p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.4p makes an increased total for the year of 4p (3.3p). Mr Melvyn Bragg, chairman, said that in the second quarter of this year the company's share of ITV advertising had grown significantly and he looked forward to a gradual improvement as the year progressed. However the costs of setting up the two commercial radio stations in which the company is involved, Central Scotland Radio and Radio North East, were expected to have an impact on the results for the year.</p>

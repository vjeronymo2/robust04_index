			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Henlys fights off Cowie's Pounds 32m bid HENLYS, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, yesterday succeeded in fighting off a Pounds 32m hostile takeover bid from rival T Cowie. By the close of the bid at 1pm yesterday Cowie had acceptances from or owned shares totalling 42.6 per cent of Henlys' share capital. Henlys' shares fell 5p to 62p and Cowie's rose 5p to 126p after the outcome was announced. The failure of the bid was put down partly to Henlys' spirited defence, and also the fall in the stock market since the bid was launched at the end of June. The all-paper bid had a partial cash alternative which would have given Henlys shareholders 20p in cash per share. After this and the lapsing of Kalon's bid for Manders, the paint group, there is a feeling that paper bids cannot succeed in current stock market conditions. Mr Robert Wood, chief executive of Henlys, said he was delighted with the outcome. He was aware that Henlys' shareholders would now expect him to improve the performance of the company, which lost Pounds 6.8m pre-tax in 1991 and is forecast to make a small loss in the current year after exceptional costs. Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive of Cowie, said he was disappointed not to have won. However, he said: 'Henlys' management has made claims about future performance and as a major shareholder in Henlys, Cowie will watch with interest to see if these claims are fulfilled.' During the bid Henlys announced orders for its loss-making bus and coach building plant in Scarborough, north Yorkshire, and forecast a 70 per cent operating profit improvement for its motor division in 1992. Cowie has a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys, bought last week at 73p a share. Mr Wood said he would treat Cowie like any other large shareholder. Mr Hodgson said that although the income it would receive from the Henlys stake was less than it could get on cash, Cowie planned to keep the stake. Henlys' defence costs are likely to be around Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 900,000 while Cowie's are expected to be in the Pounds 600,000 to Pounds 650,000 range. If successful, Cowie would have had to pay success fees, taking its costs to Pounds 941,000. Lex, Page 14 Observer, Page 13</p>

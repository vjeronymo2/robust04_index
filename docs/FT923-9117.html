			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Enthusiast set on avoiding pitfalls of runaway success - The launch of a new model has widened TVR's appeal. But its owner is not fazed MR PETER Wheeler increased his output of cars by a quarter and quadrupled his profits last year in the depth of the UK car markets slump. The Pounds 750,000 profit might just have covered the cost of developing a new door handle for a volume car maker. It was achieved on output of 800 cars and turnover of Pounds 14m, a sum which General Motors generates world-wide in an hour. But it is not financial performance which is preoccupying Mr Wheeler, a former account-ant who bought TVR, the Blackpool-based sports car maker, a decade ago. TVR is suddenly being taken seriously by a wider world than the die-hard enthusiasts who have kept it in business - through several owners and sometimes precariously - since it first began making sports cars in 1954. Mr Wheeler had already overseen the launch of several new models and a steady increase in output since he took over. Then came the 1990 UK motor show and the display of a prototype which, only weeks previously, had been simply a sketch on his cigarette packet. The motoring press fell over itself to praise the car. The internationally-respected Car magazine compared its styling favourably with Ferrari. Called the Griffith, after a 1960s TVR two-seater, it has just gone into production and well-known owners already include Mr Creighton Brown, head of McLaren's road car project. Mr Wheeler's problem is what to do about a lengthening order book, which leaves would-be owners with waits of up to a year. This year TVR's 200 employees should be able to squeeze between 950 and 1,000 cars out of its motley collection of buildings at Lytham St Annes, on the outskirts of Blackpool. But orders for the Griffith alone are approaching this level, and it is only part of a range of TVR cars. Additional capacity would thus appear to be a safe investment, and fairly cheap because TVR tubular steel chassis are welded manually and bodies are moulded from glass-reinforced plastic, avoiding the high cost of metal machine tooling. But Mr Wheeler says the motor industry graveyard is overflowing with small sports car makers whose optimism overtook their judgment and he has no intention of joining them. So he does not envisage TVR ever making the 2,000 a year some suggest as a target - 'times will certainly get worse again.' Also, he points out, obtaining skilled labour is difficult in a region better known for tourism than industry. By intensive training of very small groups of extra workers, Mr Wheeler thinks annual output of 1,500 might eventually be feasible. But he pro-fesses another reason for caution: 'I've never made anyone redundant in my life. And I don't intend to start now. I'd put prices up rather than do that.' That might sound naive, but TVR does not follow normal 'what the market will bear' pricing policies. 'We cost the car, put a small margin on it, and then the dealer margin. We don't even look at other cars to fix the price; so the customer gets a cost-plus car.' The result, in the case of the Griffith, is a Porsche 944-sized two-seater with essentially a racing car chassis and performance similar to a Ferrari. Its Pounds 26,000 price 'is because we haven't spent any money persuading anyone that it's worth Pounds 45,000. We're not paying any money for marketing machinery; with others you're paying for the Le Mans reputation, not the car itself.' TVR's marketing policy, observes Mr Wheeler, 'is zero; it doesn't exist.' It produces brochures, but leaves promotion to its dealers. Its management traditions reflect the cars: simple and slightly raw-edged. There is no finance director - 'the company secretary looks after all the accounts.' With Mr Wheeler answerable to no shareholders, TVR is fuelled by earnings and bank borrowings. 'So we have to generate a small amount of profit to keep everyone happy. In the past few years we've usually made about Pounds 250,000 net. Now it's much closer to Pounds 1m.' Mr Wheeler professes to care little about bottom lines - only that there should be adequate development cash. 'During the whole of the past 10 years TVR has never seriously tried to make any money. We've tended to spend every penny on development - and probably not been cautious enough with the pennies.' It seems an extraordinary way to run a business. But then Mr Wheeler, having become wealthy enough to retire from the chemical engineering business in his 40s, says he bought the business out of an interest in cars, not commercial ambition. 'My life plan was to retire the day I bought this place. The end result is that 10 years later I have wound up working harder than ever before in my life. You've got to know and love building cars, and I suppose we're trying to do what GM does, but with no resources. That's got to be the most challenging thing going.' Despite his carefree air, financial monitoring in reality is tight. No cars are built for stock and Mr Wheeler insists that the company makes, and is audited to make, profits each month. One claimed reason for TVR's survival should, according to motor industry convention, actually be sinking it. A high proportion of cars and tooling are made 'in-house', whereas larger car makers are increasingly curbing costs by becoming assemblers of out-sourced parts. 'We would wind up paying ridiculously high prices for 1,000 components a year from motor industry suppliers ordinarily used to 60,000 a year', says Mr Wheeler. 'Either that, or we would have to accept very high stocks. So it really does pay us to stock raw material and fabricate it using our own labour, no matter what anyone else might say.' Profitability should be much increased by the Griffith, which is designed for much easier construction - 200 man-hours against more than 400 required by some predecessors. The Griffith has no visible body seams, being produced in a few very large moulds in which the glass fibre has to be laid by hand. 'The Japanese, or anyone else, can't copy it, or make anything like it, unless they're prepared to make it by hand as well.' TVR buys V8 engines and gearboxes from Rover, but they are built to specification and made much more powerful by 25 employees at TVR Power, a subsidiary in Coventry. There are distributors in Germany, Japan, France and Italy, but not in the US. 'TVR's been in and out of there four times, and it's been the ruination of countless European companies. It's worse than the Middle East - you've got to be as strong as GM or forget it.' TVR would like more UK dealers than its current 18, but finding them is difficult. 'What we need is enthusiasts with money; what's usually on offer is large companies with plenty of money but no enthusiasm, or enthusiasts with no money.' Mr Wheeler does not rule out eventually selling TVR or taking it public, but regards both as a distant prospect. 'Taking it public would certainly be an exciting gamble. But then I suppose you'd have to have all those glib-talking finance directors  ..'</p>

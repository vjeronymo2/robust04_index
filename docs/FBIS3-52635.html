			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ismael Iraqi] </F>   [Text] Kabul, Jan 5 (AFP)--A loose grouping of rival Afghan  forces called Wednesday for the resignation of President  Borhanoddin Rabbani, as heavy fighting raged through the capital  for the fifth day.    "Rabbani should resign in the next 48 hours in order to have  peace and stability in Afghanistan," began the four-point  statement released in Islamabad.    The communique was issued under the names of Rabbani's main  rivals Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar, ex-communist  militiaman General 'Abdol Rashid Dostam, and two other factions,  calling themselves the "Supreme Coordinating Council of forces  fighting Rabbani."    The other three points called for an assembly of mojahedin  leaders to nominate a replacement for Rabbani, the establishment  of an immediate interim government, and the appointment of joint  commissions to run the Finance, Interior and Foreign Ministries.    The communique, released by Hekmatyar's Islamabad spokesman  Mengal Hoseyn, also "welcomed" any delegations from Pakistan,  Iran or Saudi Arabia to come to the embattled Kabul capital to  evacuate those wounded in the bloody five-day fighting.    Factional fighting has plagued Afghanistan since the  mojahedin overthrew the Afghan communist rule of president  Najibollah in April 1992.    An Afghan Ministry of Public Health official Tuesday  estimated that more than 1,000 people -- mostly civilians --  have yet to receive medical treatment for shrapnel and gunshot  injuries.    Although the joint communique released in Islamabad implied  it, Mengal Hoseyn was careful to distance the battlefield  relationship between Hezb and Dostam's Junbish or National  Islamic Movement.    "So far there is no coalition -- we are fighting Rabbani  forces and Dostam is fighting Rabbani forces," Mengal Hoseyn  said.    He said Hezb was fighting in many different parts of Kabul,  including "in the vicinity of Bala Hissar," which is the ancient  fortress guarding the eastern approaches to Kabul, and Dostam's  main military post in the capital.    Bala Hissar has been under severe jet bombardment Wednesday,  and it is believed that Hezb forces have joined with Dostam's  defenders there in order to hold off an infantry attack by the  Shora-e-Nazar forces of Rabbani's strongman, former Defence  Minister 'Ahmed Shah Masud.    In coordination with retaliatory jet attacks on Kabul by  Dostam's airforce based in northern Mazar-e-Sharif, Hezb gunners  subjected the city to a fresh wave of artillery salvos Wednesday  evening from their mountain strongholds in the southeast.    In this shelling, from Zamborak mountain close to Bala  Hissar, the AFP office in the northern suburbs took a direct hit  which caused extensive damage but no staff were injured.    This intensified artillery attack by Hezb-e Eslami [Islamic  Party of Afghanistan], combined with the unexpected  participation of Junbish's jets, is seen as a move to counter  intensive military pressure from Masud's fighters.    The sound of light weapons heard inside the central city  late  Wednesday could be a sign of the shifting frontlines, and the  ever changing fortunes of the factions battling for control of  the Afghan capital.</p>

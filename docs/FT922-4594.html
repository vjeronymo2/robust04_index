			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Council review CAUTION and pragmatism, not wholesale restructuring according to some pre-ordained blueprint, are to be the guiding lights for the Local Government Commission, soon to set about its business of reviewing the structure of local councils in England. Despite statements made by Mr Michael Heseltine last year, Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, said yesterday that the commission is to harbour no prior assumptions as to the superiority of unitary authorities. Instead, efficiency, coupled with local sentiment and tradition, are to be the criteria for reform, and Sir John Banham and his colleagues are to be given several years to complete their work. Operating table This is to be welcomed. Britain's local government has spent most of the last 20 years on Whitehall's operating table. Convalescing as it is from the poll tax, it remains in intensive care with further council tax traumas in the offing. Root and branch restructuring is the last thing it needs. Where manifest anomalies are identified, let them be tackled. Some of the larger cities currently stifled within county councils might well benefit from restoration of county borough status. But if it works, and the local community is other than strongly dissatisfied, don't try to fix it. Nonetheless, local government's structure cannot be divorced from its functions - and central government may be about to make such an approach impossible by significantly reducing those functions. Steady increase All depends on the education white paper due next month, which is to set out the future organisation of state schools assuming a steady increase in the number opting out of local education authority control. Even without direct control of schools, local education authorities could retain important functions relating to monitoring and the planning of local provision. But there is a strong Tory lobby which wants to withdraw even those functions from local government. Since county councils are primarily education authorities, most of their raison d'etre would disappear if ministers opt for the radical course. The case then for a single-tier structure would be well-nigh unanswerable. The future of the education service will thus have more bearing on the future shape of town halls than will anything else. This only strengthens the case for the commission to proceed with caution.</p>

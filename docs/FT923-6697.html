			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: Regulating party profit Sir, If the government is to tighten the law governing trade unions' political funds - requiring a union to get written authority from each member before using any portion of his contribution for political purposes - perhaps it should simultaneously amend company law. Individual shareholders cannot stop directors giving part of their profits to a political party and, unlike union members, they cannot opt out. A shareholder should have a right similar to a union member, namely to allow only a portion of a company's profits to be given for political purposes. A company's political contribution should be deducted, in proportion to the shares held, only from the dividends of those shareholders who expressly wish it.

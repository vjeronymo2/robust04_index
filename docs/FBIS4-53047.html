			<p>CSO     [Text] Fuji Kiko, a Nissan Motor-affiliated medium-sized  parts manufacturer, will open a new plant to produce truck  steering wheel mechanisms in the United States at the end of  this year. With the economic recovery in the United States,  truck demand is rapidly increasing and since orders are too much  to handle just with the existing U.S. plants, they will  establish another plant exclusively for this mechanism. They  will invest about 1 billion yen and begin production in 1995.  After two years, the production of truck steering wheel  mechanisms in the United States will increase to 3 billion yen,  double that of today.    In order to raise production capability quickly, "We will  purchase a new or used ready-built plant for the new plant"  (President Michihiko Yamabe). The Michigan or southern U.S.  areas are favored for the location, and matters are scheduled to  be decided by summer. They will make use of leasing for  introduction of equipment and start with 200 or 300 employees.    Fuji Kiko purchased the U.S. auto parts manufacturer Douglas  Autotech (Michigan) in 1991, and has come to use the Douglas  plant as the production base for steering wheel mechanisms in  the United States. This new plant is also scheduled to be opened  via its Douglas subsidiary.    The item produced is a steering wheel mechanism where the  wheel height and angle can be changed manually. It is a product  that has over a 50-percent share in the U.S. large truck market  where carrying capacity exceeds 30 tons. Besides delivery to the  major U.S. truck manufacturers, Navistar and John Deere, they  also are studying supply to local Japanese manufacturers and  export to Japan.    Along with the opening of the new plant, they will also  increase production of steering wheel mechanisms for passenger  cars that are being produced in the Douglas plant. They say that  "We have also decided to supply U.S. Ford Motor recreational  vehicles (RV), with whom we have not previously done business"  (President Yamabe). Fuji Kiko sales for the March 1993 quarter  were 56.4 billion yen, and business with the Nissan group such  as Nissan Motor, Nissan Diesel, and Nissan Body exceeds 80  percent. Since Nissan sales have been sluggish, however, they  have been pressed to open up new markets.</p>

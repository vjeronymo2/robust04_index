			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Forte/Compass The breakdown of talks over the sale of Forte's Gardner Merchant catering business to Compass is plainly an embarrassment to both parties. In particular, the Pounds 530m on the table would have done much to soothe Forte's nervous shareholders, who have seen their investment underperform the market by some 20 per cent in the last two months. Whether Forte's shares deserve to fall further on Monday is open to question. Much of the recent weakness has been in line with the sector, as the market has come to realise that an upturn in the UK hotel industry is still some way off. While the cash would have been very handy in securing a dividend which looks like being uncovered by earnings, the fact that Forte could walk away suggests it was not quite essential. The much-publicised plan to expand in Europe is not yet concrete enough to require large-scale funding. Nor is it impossible that the other buyers supposedly in the wings will come up with the goods. But the failure of the deal may say something about the market for equity funding. It appears that Compass would have had to rely on a rights issue for at least a third of the money. In a week marked by difficult issues from MFI and The Telegraph, this must have been thought-provoking, especially for a company whose shares have been suspended for the past month while the deal was thrashed out. And while Forte explicitly rules out a rights issue now the deal has fallen through, it is bound to reflect that it may have little choice in the matter.</p>

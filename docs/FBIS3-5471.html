The present situation:    Our party great national unity strategy in the present  situation is designed in such a way that it can exploit and  develop our traditional concepts while renovating various  aspects to suit developments at home and abroad.    1. "In the present international situation, nationalism has  become a very important factor. The developing countries must  carry out a very difficult and complicated struggle to extricate  their countries from poverty and backwardness while opposing the  reactionary forces to protect national independence,  sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Nations are facing  global, pressing issues related to the common fate and destiny  of mankind such as maintaining peace, protecting the  environment, reducing the population growth rate, and preventing  and eradicating serious diseases." (excerpt from resolution no.  07-NQ/TU of the party Central Committee)    We all know that mankind is making preparation to conclude  its tasks in the 20th century to embark on the 21st century  against the background of swift changes in the international  situation that have dramatically affected the old world order  while paving the way for a new one. The upswing in the  scientific-technological revolution has brought about new  results in the computer, electronic, communications, and  biochemistry domains, thus helping to accelerate the pace of  production development. Socioeconomic reform programs have been  launched in a wide and far-reaching scale in various countries,  thereby seriously affecting the fundamental social issues in  each nation (these include the issues of ownership, political  system, democracy, and social justice)    It is necessary to say that while there are conflicts,  racial  and religious crusades, starvation, diseases -- especially AIDS  -- destruction of the ecology, and environmental pollution in  certain countries that are threatening the daily life of  millions of people, new conditions and opportunities emerge  eleswhere. These include the trend of peace and stability in  our region, the dynamic development in the Asia-Pacific zone,  the trend of increased cooperation in the world, and the  vigorous development in universalizing the economic life in many  nations. These are developments that have created new favorable  conditions and opportunities for accelerating the developmental  pace in our nation.    In our efforts to join the international community, we have  faced numerous difficulties caused by our poor economy and  backwardness. However, as a country lagging behind, we have the  chance to learn from the experiences of other nations. As a  result, while facing numerous ordeals we are in a position to  vigorously and quickly develop our socioeconomic situation.  Thanks to our foreign policy -- one of independence,  sovereignty, and diversified diplomatic activities -- our  country can firmly advance forward despite acute difficulties  and ordeals. This has enabled us to continue to expand  relations with other nations while combining our national  strength with that of the world and our traditional strength  with that of the era.    2. Implementing the renovation process set and led by our  party, our people have scored initial yet very important  achievements, thereby creating a new condition for national  development. This is a very favorable condition for  strengthening the all-people national unity to help extricate  our country from poverty and backwardness to advance further.  While enjoying this new condition we also face many new  problems that call for our great efforts to overcome them.    The renovation process set by our party is basically in line  with the trend of the era, the social evolution law, the reality  of our nation, and the aspiration of our people. This has been  proven as true by our initial achievements and by our ability to  overcome numerous difficulties and ordeals.    However, in reality, we still have many weaknesses. While  our economy is still poor and backward, we are facing the danger  of lagging behind economically compared to other countries in  the region, thus causing an adverse effect for us in various  domains. This is a great ordeal of the era and a danger to the  vitality of the nation. As a result, we must strive to bring  our self-reliance tradition into full play while closing our  ranks to overcome all difficulties.    3. Vietnam has a population of more than 70 million, who  have  a good background and are composed of various strata,  nationalities, and religious groups living at home and abroad.  Although they have different backgrounds, different living  conditions, and different religions, they are proud of their  Vietnamese origin. Their nation has several thousand years of  history and the tradition of unity to build and defend the  nation. They have but one common aspiration to reunite the  country to make the people prosperous, the nation powerful, and  the society just and civilized, to be able to join in the  international community and surge forward to catch up with  developments of the era.    In view of the above-mentioned characteristics, Vietnamese  citizens should realize their historic duty toward the nation,  bring into play their wisdom and creativity, uphold their sense  of responsibility, and strengthen the great national unity bloc.  Let them make every effort to enrich themselves while at the  same time contributing to making the country more powerful.    II. The objectives and tasks under the policy of great  national unity.    As specified under the "economic stabilization and  development" strategy, in the years ahead, efforts must be made  to help the country "tide over a crisis situation and stabilize  the socioeconomic situation." Steps must be taken to lead the  country out of poverty and underdevelopment, improve the  people's living conditions, consolidate national defense and  security capabilities, and create conditions for the country to  reach a higher level of development by the start of the 21st  century.    The resolution of the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth  Session has set forth the orientations and tasks for 1994 as  follows: It is necessary to firmly safeguard the achievements of  the renovation process, develop the industrialization and  modernization program a step further, and grasp all  opportunities to quickly increase the economic growth rate and  shift our country to a new stage of development. At the same  time, it is imperative to effect important changes on the  cultural and social fronts, firmly maintain political stability,  safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and  broaden diplomatic relations.    To fulfill that arduous task, it is more important than ever  to strengthen unity among Vietnamese countrymen, bring into full  play the strength of the national community, and strengthen the  all- people great unity bloc a step further.    The general tasks of the National United Front at present  are  "to develop the tradition of patriotism, national pride, and  spirit of sufficiency and self-help; motivate all Vietnamese  countrymen to participate in the renovation undertaking to  firmly defend national independence, unification, sovereignty,  and territorial integrity; strive to fight poverty and  backwardness; surge forward to achieve the goals of making the  people rich and the country powerful and of bringing about  justice and civilization in society; and implement President Ho  Chi Minh's sacred testament, which calls on everyone to "build  Vietnam into a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic,  prosperous, and powerful country and contribute to the cause of  peace, independence, democracy, and progress in the world."    Acting in line with the above-mentioned objectives and  tasks,  the Political Bureau has set forth major policies as follows:    1. Great national unity calls for efforts to strengthen  unity  among people in the great family of the Vietnamese nation --  which is composed of various strata, classes, ethnic and  religious groups, and people at home and abroad -- to make the  above-mentioned goals come true. To achieve unity, we must  share similarities and at the same time must accept differences  that are not at variance with the common national interests. We  must strive to overcome prejudices, complexes, and hatred; look  toward the future; and promote the spirit of solidarity,  openness, and mutual trust. Everyone should work toward the  goals of national independence and freedom and of happiness for  the people.    2. Great national unity constitutes the fundamental line of  our party and state. The concept of great national unity must  be reflected in all lines, policies, and regulations of the  state and must be included in all political, economic, cultural,  social, national defense and security, and diplomatic  activities. This is aimed at meeting the legitimate interests  and aspirations of people of all strata. We must link rights  with duties and personal interests with citizens' duties and  must bear in mind that the national interests come first. It is  necessary to create favorable conditions for releasing the  production force and encourage all individuals and economic  sectors to bring into full play their energy, talents, and  creativity to increase production, expand business, and enrich  themselves through honest means. We must encourage the people  to practice thrift and build and protect the nation and must  make constant efforts to improve the material and cultural life  of the people. At the same time, we must encourage the people  to satisfactorily implement various social welfare policies  through the movement to repay those who have rendered  meritorious services to the nation, participate in public  utility projects and humanitarian activities, help one another  to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, and develop the  tradition of benevolence and righteousness of our fathers and  forefathers.    3. We must build a clean and strong people's government  with high efficiency to make it a real law-governed state of,  by, and for the people. The people's government must protect  the people's legitimate rights and interests, firmly maintain  the state order and law, perfect and execute the policy of  multisectorial economic development with the state management,  and outline and execute social welfare policies. It must  preserve and develop the national culture together with efforts  to acquire the essence of the world culture. It must build new  men, strengthen the national defense and public security, and  broaden its external affair activities.    4. We must expand our great national unity block via  diversified activities. We must organize and develop mass  movements at different levels, create more activities suitable  to all social strata, and improve the positive role of exemplary  people in different social classes, ethnics, and religions. We  must direct our activities to villages, subwards, and  households. We must strengthen the alliance between the workers  with the peasants and intellectuals to make it a foundation for  our great national unity block.    III. Main Ideas on Policies for Great National Unity.    1. The initial achievement of the renovation undertaking has  offered opportunities for everybody to actively build their life  and to contribute to the cause of national construction and  protection. The policy for great national unity, on that basis,  needs to encourage and create more favorable conditions for the  people to develop further. Our party and state have and will  create equal opportunities for everyone: peasants will be  granted the right to use their land, workers will possess shares  in their enterprises, and the public will be provided loans for  their business operation so that everybody will have a fair  chance to improve their life, making the poor become better, the  average become rich, and the rich become richer.    For the people who have rendered a meritorious service to  the  nation such as the families of fallen combatants and injured  soldiers and the people who have been in national service for  many years with outstanding performance, our party and state  have given them privilege treatment and have launched public  movements to help them. However, we must pay more attention to  provide better assistance and conditions to them so that these  people can have a living standard at least equal to that of  average people in the same residential area would enjoy. We  must not leave them struggling permanently in the poverty line.    For the workers, we must provide them with additional  technical and professional training so that they can adjust  themselves in the industrialization and modernization process.  We must train our contingent of workers for new technologies  and accelerate our technical training in service management,  tourism, languages, accounting, statistics, and so forth...  according to the market demand. We must introduce the  share-holding system in state enterprises and business, provide  loans for the workers to set up their share-holding enterprises,  and widely apply the quota contract system for our workers. We  must provide enough jobs for workers and establish a cooperative  relationship between employers and workers to improve the  business productivity, quality, and efficiency. On the  foundation of respecting the law, we must guarantee the workers'  legitimate interests and fulfill our financial obligations to  the state.    For the peasants, the national industrialization and  modernization will create great effects for rural areas,  agriculture, and peasants. The infrastructure construction must  concentrate in rural areas, especially the development of public  roads, electricity, postal and communications, culture, health  care, and education to narrow the gap between cities and rural  areas. The government must continue to perfect its policy to  grant the right of land use to peasants. It must also introduce  policies to develop the reasonable relationship between the  industry, agriculture, and service. It must increase investment  for the development of barren land, empty hills, water surface,  and coastal areas. It must develop processing industry,  industries, and handicrafts and expand our market relation to  quickly consume products made by peasants. Particularly, we must  pay attention to improving peasants' knowledge and upgrade the  cultural, medical, and education service in rural areas.    Regarding the intelligentsia, it is necessary to make  everyone realize that for the struggle to make the goals of  making the people rich and the country powerful and of bringing  about justice and civilization in society come true, along with  helping our nation integrate into the world community at an  early date, the key factor does not rest with the fact that our  country is large in size and rich in natural resources but with  the fact that it is endowed with wisdom and a fine cultural  heritage. If a country treats its think tank badly or plays  down its role, that country will have no conditions for  development or a bright future. There exists a causality  between deterioration and waste of the think tank and depletion  of natural resources and socioeconomic sluggishness.    To develop our national cultural heritage, learn from the  cultural quintessence of the times, have access to modern  science and technology, and complete projects to benefit our  country and people, we must rely ourselves on our highly  knowledgeable intellectuals. Therefore, we must put the  intellectuals in an important position and encourage them to  apply their knowledge to scientific and technological research  work a step further. It is necessary to get rid of the evils of  narrow-minded attitude toward and prejudices against the  intelligentsia. It is important to treat our intellectuals in a  spirit of democracy and equality and to pay greater attention to  their aspirations. Resolute measures must be taken against  science monopoly. It is necessary to rely on the intelligentsia  to discover and select talents and formulate lines and policies,  particularly policies toward science and technology. Steps must  be taken to broaden international relations in science and  technology and create favorable conditions for scientists to  maintain contact with the outside world and work or participate  in research projects or training courses overseas. It is  necessary to keep in mind that it is the objective of the policy  toward intellectuals to make our country ready to enter the 21st  century, which marks the start of a new era, the era of wisdom.    As for religions, it is important to regard them as  necessary  elements that have made their long-lasting presence felt in  society. Religions meet both the spiritual and cultural needs of  the people. By nature, religions do not act at variance with the  nation and socialism. Instead, they exert a positive impact on  society. It is necessary to pay due attention to the policy  toward religious and nonreligious people, respect the people's  right to believe or not to believe in a certain religion along  with the concepts of love of mankind, humanitarianism, charity,  and merit-making of the various religions.    On the one hand, it is necessary to respect the right of the  various religions to perform their activities. It is forbidden  to violate places of worship or interfere with the internal  affairs of the various religions. It is necessary to protect  churches, pagodas, and temples. It is important to keep the  various religious organizations within the people's mastership  system. On the other hand, stern measures must be taken to deal  with attempts to take advantage of religions to undermine the  great national unity bloc and violate state law.    As for people of different ethnic groups, it is necessary to  give them equal treatment based on solid principles. Special  efforts must be made to help ethnic minority compatriots  eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. Plans must be worked out  to help them with medical treatment, disease prevention, and  anti-illiteracy work. Practical steps must be taken to apply  birth control education to each region and each ethnic group.  Due efforts must be made to care for children, especially  newborn babies. A number of ethnic groups is facing the danger  of extinction. Therefore, it is necessary for the state to  adopt urgent measures to preserve and develop them.    It is necessary for the state to work out prompt measures to  resolve once and for all the allotment of forest and forest land  to peasant households. It is important to make concentrated  investment in the expansion of key communication networks, water  conservancy projects, public healthcare facilities, small-scale  hydroelectric power plants, and information and postal services.    Plans must be worked out to expand the work-study school  system. Sightseeing trips must be organized for ethnic minority  compatriots to visit cities, mountain regions, sea areas, and  foreign countries. Steps must be taken to preserve and develop  the cultural quintessence of people of different ethnic groups.  It is necessary to respect the spoken dialects, writing  systems, and fine customs and practices of people of different  ethnic groups.    It is necessary to supervise the operations of sectors  directly under the management of the central government. It is  important to increase personnel in charge of areas inhabited by  ethnic minority compatriots and key services like public health,  communications, water conservancy, culture, and education. It  is necessary to work out separate programs for hilltribe people  and see to it that practical measures are adopted to implement  them. Severe measures must be taken against sectors and  individuals who violate the state nationalities policy.    Regarding the private industrial, commercial, and  agricultural sectors, the state must strengthen its relations  with them and must firmly grasp their aspirations,  circumstances, and capabilities. Incentive measures must be  worked out to encourage the private sector to make bold  investment in production and business activities.    The private industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors  constitute an important part of the multisectorial economy.  Once they are sponsored by or have joint ventures with the  state, the private sector will develop itself into a major  production force and play a positive role in socioeconomic  development.</p>

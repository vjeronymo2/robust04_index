			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 22 Apr (INA)--Nabil Sha'th, the  Palestinian president's adviser, has criticized the evasion by  the U.S. Administration and other Western countries of their  pledges to extend needed financial aid to the Palestinian  self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho.    Sha'th told the IRAQI NEWS AGENCY correspondent in Cairo  yesterday that the United States and other Western countries  halted the extension of the pledged financial aid to the  Palestinian side. Expressing regret over this deceitful retreat,  he said that reality has shown that these pledges were merely  promises.    The Palestinian official asserted that, for its part, the  Zionist entity has also tried to evade its pledges in the  Washington agreement on Palestinian self-rule in Jericho and  Gaza.

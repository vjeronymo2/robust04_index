After entering a Euclid Avenue house through an unlocked back door,  Thompson said, he saw the body in the hallway.  </P> <P> "There was blood all along the wall," he said. "I could see her head had been  damaged awfully bad."  </P> <P> Jackie Birch, a landscaper for whom Roberts worked, testified that Roberts  called July 12 to say he couldn't report to work because he had to meet with a  parole officer.  </P> <P> The hearing will continue today with testimony expected from the coroner who  examined Orchulli.  </P></p>

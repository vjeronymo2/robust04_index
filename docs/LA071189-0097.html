			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW ACCORD ALLOWS SOVIET, U.S. GEOLOGISTS TO WORK TOGETHER  </P> <P> Soviet and U.S. scientists reached final agreement Monday on an accord that  will allow geologists from both countries to work together on a wide range of  projects.  </P> <P> "Our geologists are eager to get started," Dallas Peck, director of the U.S.  Geological Survey, said in a brief ceremony during the International Geological  Congress, which is meeting here through July 19.  </P> <P> Y. A. Kozlovsky, who negotiated the agreement for the Soviets while he was  serving as minister of geology, accepted the memorandum of understanding on  behalf of the Soviet Union. The documents actually were signed May 6 but Monday  was the first opportunity for the scientists to exchange documents and sit down  together and talk about future projects.  </P> <P> Under the agreement, U.S. scientists will get core samples from the Earth's  deepest well, which is now more than seven miles deep, on the Soviet Union's  Kola Peninsula. The Soviets are drilling 11 deep wells, and scientists in this  country are anxious to study samples from several miles below the surface.  </P> <P> By contrast, the deepest research well in the United States is scarcely two  miles deep. It is in the Cajon Pass east of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Peck said that the Soviets have learned a lot from their deep wells, including  the fact that much of their understanding about the geophysics of the area was  wrong. Soviet scientists had expected to find the Earth highly stratified at  such depths, he said, but the well proved that expectation wrong.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three Projects Approved  </P> <P> Paul Hearn of the Geological Survey's international division said that three  U.S.-Soviet projects already have been approved. They include geological  studies of the area between Siberia and Alaska and the exchanging of  ophiolites, rocks formed at spreading centers where two tectonic plates are  being pushed apart.  </P> <P> U.S. scientists also plan to study a spreading center in Siberia, and Soviet  scientists want to look at a similar area in the Southwest's Rio Grande Valley.  </P></p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Plan for opt-outs from state pension A PLAN to allow millions of people to opt out of the state retirement pension is being examined by senior ministers as part of the government's wholesale review of the welfare state. The scheme is one of a number of radical measures being studied by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. It aims to build on the right to opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme which has been taken up by 4.5m people since 1988. Ministers are aware that a big hurdle to any change would be a sharp increase in costs to the Treasury in the early stage of a transition. This would see revenues from National Insurance Contributions fall without any parallel reduction in pension payment liabilities.</p>

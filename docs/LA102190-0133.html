			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEXAS BLOWS PAST ARKANSAS IN 4TH QUARTER, 49-17  </P> <P> Texas handled a strong wind, Arkansas didn't and that was a major difference  Saturday as the 19th-ranked Longhorns blew away the Razorbacks, 49-17.  </P> <P> Quarterback Peter Gardere guided Texas to four touchdowns, throwing for one  score and running for another, to cap two 80-yard drives into a wind that  gusted as high as 38 m.p.h.  </P> <P> The victory before 72,657 and a regional television audience raised Texas'  record to 4-1, 2-0 in the Southwest Conference.  </P> <P> Arkansas, which will switch to the Southeastern Conference for the 1992  football season, fell to 2-4 and 0-3 in the SWC.  </P> <P> "We moved the ball pretty well against the wind. That was a turning point,"  Texas Coach David McWilliams said.  </P> <P> Leading 20-17 after three quarters, the Longhorns rolled up 29 points with the  wind at their backs for their largest point total against Arkansas since they  defeated the Razorbacks, 52-0, in 1916.  </P> <P> "A lot of things went wrong and they went wrong late. Our plan was to win the  game in the fourth quarter," said Arkansas Coach Jack Crowe, the first-year  coach at Arkansas who has yet to win a conference game.  </P> <P> Adrian Walker's two-yard scoring run climaxed a 48-yard touchdown march as  Texas widened its lead to 27-17 in the fourth quarter, and a four-yard run by  freshman Butch Hadnot with 10:20 to go sealed the victory.  </P></p>

Sergey Dubinin and Viktor Gerashchenko Have Been Tasked To  Respond to Them"]    [Text] On 4 February the State Duma intends to hear from  acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman  Viktor Gerashchenko. Dubinin and Gerashchenko will apparently  have to report on budget guidelines for the first quarter. Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin yesterday met with the premier and  apparently discussed with him plans for the lower house's work  on the budget and economic course.    Similar "working" negotiations with Boris Yeltsin, according  to Ivan Rybkin, concerned the address the president intends to  make in the Federal Assembly at a joint session of its houses on  18 February. Rybkin refused to disclose its specific  propositions.    Rybkin "relates calmly" to the president's address to  parliament, in which the latter is accused of violating  constitutional norms, in particular in electing the Duma  speaker. "We have developed normal working relations with Boris  Nikolayevich," Rybkin stated.    Indeed, during his first few weeks in the high post the  speaker has distanced himself a little from the communist  majority in the Duma to which he owes his election. Intensive  talks with the president and the premier will apparently have a  greater impact on Rybkin's position than his party affiliation.  The meetings with the premier are especially important: Rybkin  can become the most active supporter of the new government's  economic initiatives in the Duma.    The speaker displayed "party indiscipline," which is  becoming  increasingly characteristic of him, when he supported the  candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora for the post of Duma apparatus  chief. The leaders of the Russian Federation Communist Party,  the Democratic Party of Russia, and other factions of communist  orientation rejected that proposal, saying the Vladimir  Podoprigora, being chairman of the Federation Council's Foreign  Relations Committee, cannot be chief of apparatus in another  house. In spite of the obvious juridical nonsense, however, the  Duma speaker continued to insist on the Russia's Choice  candidacy.    No preliminary agenda for the State Duma plenary session,  which is due on 4 February, has been defined yet. Faction  leaders practically unanimously sent the declaration on the  succession of the Federal Assembly to be reworked. As Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin stated yesterday, "before the draft reaches  the stage of discussion at the session, it will undergo  substantial changes." According to Rybkin, the document will be  executed as a declaration without any political, let alone  scandalous, implications.    Members of the Duma Council failed to reach agreement on the  issue of amnesty timed to coincide with the adoption of the new  constitution. Fearing that any decision on the number and  nature of crimes falling under the amnesty will cause censure in  various parts of society, the faction leaders decided to  postpone the discussion of the edict indefinitely. The same sad  fate befell the Criminal Code, which was originally to be  discussed as a package with the amnesty law.</p>

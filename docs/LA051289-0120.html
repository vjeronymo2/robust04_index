			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORNOGRAPHY CASE RULING  </P> <P> Is it any wonder that sexual crime is on the increase in our society?  </P> <P> Like thousands of other residents of the Los Angeles area, I was appalled to  hear U.S. District Judge David Kenyon say he is unable to determine whether  violent, degrading pornographic films violate community standards ("Porno Case  Is Dismissed; L.A. Diversity Cited," Part I, May 4).  </P> <P> Whether Kenyon recognizes it or not, there are standards of morality and  decency that are held sacred by a large majority of people in this community.  </P> <P> His decision to dismiss charges brought by the federal government against one  of Los Angeles' most blatant and repulsive distributors of hard-core  pornography is a slap in the face of the fine, decent folks who believe in and  want to uphold and maintain high standards of morality in their communities.  </P> <P> In granting acquittal, Judge Kenyon has come down on the side of immorality and  indecency.  </P> <P> Shame on you, Judge Kenyon!  </P> <P> JERRY B. McCLUN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

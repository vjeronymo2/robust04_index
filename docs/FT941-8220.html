			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Honda may hold the ace when cards are revealed / The future of Rover as talks between BMW and Honda start today In the three weeks since Rover was sold to BMW, the German car maker and Honda Motor, Rover's partner for 15 years, have been eyeing each other closely to see which will blink first. The poker game begins in earnest today in Tokyo as Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, BMW's chairman, begins talks with Mr Nibuhiko Kawamoto, Honda's president. Both parties have powerful cards to play. Honda's wounded pride and loss of face caused by British Aerospace's sale of its 80 per cent stake in Rover might suggest a complete severing of Honda's links with Rover. Honda, in fact, has the power in its Rover agreements to shut down much of Rover. It can give seven days' notice to cancel its key contracts if Rover was sold to another party. That, however, would fly in the face of commercial common sense, at least in the medium term. It has too much to lose from selling parts to Rover and, anyway, the relationship cannot physically be unpicked overnight. But BMW's wish that 'in this new scenario Rover Cars will naturally continue its agreements with Honda in every respect', is just as unlikely to come to pass. BMW wants Rover, for example, to give it a market presence in the lower-medium front-wheel drive sector. Rover plans to launch next year a replacement to its 200/400 series, jointly developing the model with Honda in Project Theta. Yet, the partners are understood to have failed yet to sign a full production agreement, and Honda could baulk. Honda sees the German car maker as one of its most potent rivals in the world car market, and it is impossible to expect that Honda's doors can now remain as open to Rover. Assuming Honda does not plump for the 'doomsday' scenario, there there are three levels of collaboration between Honda and Rover, which the Japanese car maker and BMW must now address: licensing agreements on original Honda products; the selling and buying of components; production and technology transfer from Honda to Rover. These links are cemented by Honda's 20 per cent equity stake in the whole of the Rover vehicle operations (including Land Rover) and Rover's 20 per cent stake in Honda's UK assembly plant at Swindon. Licensing: Most of Rover's cars are based on or dependent on Honda designs and are produced under direct licence from Honda. These agreements can be terminated at three months' notice. Whole vehicles subject to them are the Rover 600 and 400 models. But Rover has greater leeway on the 200 hatchback. Because the 200 was a jointly developed vehicle, Rover enjoys component supply contracts for as long as it builds the current model. This anomaly arose because the Honda Concerto model, on which the Rover 200/400 range is based, appeared in Japan first as a saloon, and the 400 was licensed directly from it, whereas the 200 was developed jointly. Typical of critical component issues is the gearbox used on Rover's own two litre engines. This is a Honda product made under licence by Rover at its Longbridge plant in Birmingham. Withdrawal of its licence could disrupt much of the rest of Rover's car range apart from the ageing Montego, Maestro, Metro and Mini models. The 800 executive car range would be affected even though the car itself has long since diverged from the Honda Legend, on which it was based. However, Honda must supply other key components in it - notably the 2.7 litre Honda V6 engine - for as long as Rover wants to build the car. Buying and selling components: this is a normal arm's length customer-supplier relationship for most components, involving two-way transactions of close to Pounds 400m a year. For example, Honda sells facias to Rover for the Rover 600 and Rover sells Honda the body panels  - produced at Rover's Swindon stamping plant - for the Honda Accord, which Honda produces at its own assembly plant in Swindon. The contracts state supplies must continue for as long as each partner is producing a particular model. However, these contracts are subservient to the licensing agreements. Honda considers that it could legitimately pull the plug on much of Rover's model range, even though Rover could still be legally required to continue providing body panels for the Accord. But pulling the plug would severely disrupt production at Honda's own plant in Swindon. Manufacturing and technology transfer: much of the equipment and tooling used by Rover to build the 600 and 200/400 were developed and supplied by Honda. The equipment was replicated and transferred into Rover's Longbridge plant, thus saving Rover heavy expenditures on developing production facilities for new models. A highly sophisticated multi-welder for body shells, for example, is from Honda Engineering. If Honda terminated the relevant agreements, however, Rover could maintain the equipment adequately for the life of current models. Another key element of the relationship is the maintenance of the component supplier base. Honda manages its supplier base of 160 companies on behalf of itself and Rover, and Rover does the same with its suppliers feeding Rover's plants and Honda's at Swindon. The overall appearance of cars might not change but their parts are updated constantly as part of the Japanese-inspired philosophy of continuous improvement. Lack of access by either partner to the database which keeps track of 20,000 parts could bring chaos to production lines as component mismatches proliferated. One measure of the trust Honda and Rover had developed is that the database for the Accord/Rover 600 is managed and maintained only by Honda at Swindon. Working relationships: Honda believes BMW may not have understood how dependent Rover is on Honda, and how close working relations had become. 'Honda-Rover is not only a business-based corporate relationship', according to one senior Honda executive in Europe. 'So many engineers, so many managers and so many production people have worked closely together for 15 years. This working together is a quite unique experience for the Japanese people as well as the British and I believe that it could create very good mutual understanding between our two cultures. 'For most of the people involved in this collaboration it has been not only their job but their life, including their families.' Some 150 Rover personnel went to Japan to learn production start-up techniques for the Rover 200/400. And some 40 Japanese Honda staff and their families went to Birmingham to stay for nearly three years in getting the project off the ground. When Honda asked Rover to build its Concerto model at Longbridge, Honda opened its factories to Rover staff to allow them to feed back quality information. The information exchange has accelerated ever since. 'So there is not only information exchange in the conference room there was hand-to-hand working together on the shop floor', the Honda executive said. For its part, BMW can offer Honda the lucrative opportunity of continuing to work with Rover and, for example, to supply Land-Rover Discovery four-wheel drive vehicles with Honda badges for the Japanese market. But Honda is sure of its bargaining power. As one senior Honda executive put it informally: 'We hold a card hand of nine aces - but the British public does not know this fact.'</p>

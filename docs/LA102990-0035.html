			<p><P> October 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CAPRIATI EARNS FIRST PRO TITLE, BEATS GARRISON IN PUERTO RICO  </P> <P> Jennifer Capriati won her first professional tournament by beating top-seeded  Zina Garrison, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, in the finals of the Puerto Rico Open Sunday at  San Juan.  </P> <P> Since turning pro in March, the 14-year-old Capriati had reached the finals of  the Virginia Slims of Florida and at Hilton Head, S.C., but lost both times.  </P> <P> Capriati got in only 41% of her first services and committed 26 unforced errors  compared to Garrison's 76% service accuracy and 32 errors. Capriati, however,  committed only eight unforced errors in the last two sets.  </P> <P> Boris Becker, playing one of the best indoor matches of his career, breezed to  a 6-4, 6-0, 6-3 victory over top-ranked Stefan Edberg in the championship match  of the Stockholm Open.  </P> <P> Becker turned an early hard-hitting duel into a rout in the second set and  destroyed any hopes of what was supposed to be a dream final between the  world's Nos. 1 and 2 players.  </P> <P> The German, who also won the event in 1988, served and returned to near  perfection on the fast Supreme Court at the Globe Arena.  </P> <P> Becker earned $137,450 for his fifth ATP Tour title of the year. He also beat  Edberg in the Sydney Indoors final earlier this month.  </P> <P> Edberg, playing his 50th career final, dropped to 9-17 in career meetings with  Becker.  </P> <P> Steffi Graf won her ninth tournament of the year, beating Helena Sukova, 7-5,  6-3, in a $350,000 indoor tournament at Brighton, England. It was Graf's 17th  consecutive victory over Sukova.  </P> <P> Sandra Birch upset her Stanford teammate and doubles partner, Debbie Graham,  6-2, 3-6, 7-5, in the final of the Riviera Country Club's All-American Tennis  Championships at Pacific Palisades. Graham, from Fountain Valley, is the NCAA  singles champion.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Shutang (1728 0647 1016]) </F>   [Text] Beijing, 27 Jan (XINHUA) -- The State Council's  Committee for Women and Children's Work held the second plenary  session of its Second Committee here this afternoon to review  women and children's work in 1993 and make work plans and  arrangements for 1994.    Peng Peiyun, state councillor and chairman of the State  Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work, asked the  committee to carry out two major tasks and concentrate on  several major issues to produce greater results in women and  children's work. She said: The first major task is to  comprehensively implement the "Outline of Development Plans for  Chinese Children in the Nineties." This outline constitutes a  commitment to China's vast numbers of children and to the  international community made by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the  Chinese Government. All units should enhance their sense of  mission and urgency, spell out the yearly targets on the basis  of established overall goals, and institute a system of target  management to ensure fulfillment of each goal set forth in the  outline.    She said: The second major task is to complete the draft of  the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the  Nineties." The outline is intended to regulate, guide, and  promote the development of Chinese women, safeguard their rights  and interests, raise their standards, and enable them to  participate more successfully in promoting equality,  development, and peace and play a role worthy of the "other  half" in China's modernization. The outline is also designed to  help achieve the goals set for in the "Nairobi Strategy" and to  greet the opening of the Fourth World Women's Congress in 1995.    Peng Peiyun also called for continuous efforts to publicize  and implement laws and regulations on children and women,  safeguard women's rights and interests in child-bearing and  labor, launch targeted struggles against kidnapping and  prostitution, and conduct experiments in the "three quality  projects" [quality birth, upbringing, and education].    Liu Hairong, director of the general office of the State  Council's Committee for Women and Children's Work and vice  president of the All-China Women's Federation, gave a report on  the committee's work in 1993 and its plan for 1994. Committee  members and representatives from various units discussed ways to  further promote women and children's work.    It was learned that the State Council's Committee for Women  and Children's Work made progress in safeguarding women and  children's rights and interests and promoting women and  children's causes last year. The committee coordinated and  organized activities to publicize and implement the law on  safeguarding women's rights and interests. After an  investigation into implementation of the law in seven provinces,  it presented its views and suggestions on existing problems and  future work and urged departments concerned to adopt measures  for resolving the problems. Today, two-thirds of the  governments at the provincial level in China have established  agencies for protecting women and children.    Last year, together with the Central Committee for  Comprehensive Management of Public Security, and based on the  experience of the last two years in the struggle against  kidnapping and prostitution, the State Council's Committee for  Women and Children's Work put forward requirements for carrying  out the struggle in the next stage. This has helped deepened  the struggle. In addition, the committee also worked actively  to implement the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese  Children in the Nineties," made good preparations for enacting  the "Outline of Development Plans for Chinese Women in the  Nineties," and presented specific proposals on making overall  arrangements for society to bear the burden of child-bearing  expenses for women workers.</p>

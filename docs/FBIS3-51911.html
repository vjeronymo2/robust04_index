			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Polls"] </F>   [Text] The polls have turned into a source of confusion  rather than clarity, particularly during the pre-election  period. We believe that when well-conducted, they are a  good--and necessary--tool for measuring public opinion trends  and preferences with respect to a given candidate, product,  issue, or current event. However, what has been happening with  the latest surveys of voting intentions in terms of presidential  candidates could undermine the indispensable credibility that  pollsters must have in order to perform their task with all due  responsibility.    Last week, we Colombians learned of two opinion polls  concerning the presidential race, polls conducted by the same  firm (although one of them had been subcontracted) that yielded  very different results. In the poll ordered by precandidate  Andres Pastrana, Pastrana led, while the other one, contracted  by this daily newspaper, showed Ernesto Samper in the lead. A  few days later, the polling experts said that while the results  were apparently contradictory, they actually reflected similar  trends and that, with respect to most of the figures obtained,  the disparity could be explained by the margin of error.  Whatever the case, the campaigns of presidential candidates very  frequently include polls in which the person ordering them  generally fares very well. Inversely, when such polls are not  favorable to them, there is an attempt to conceal them, an  attitude that could be considered legitimate from a propaganda  viewpoint, but one that is not very honest to a public assaulted  and confused by this war of disinformation.    It is important to dispel any doubt about what some of our  fellow citizens generally think of the polls: that they are  manipulated in favor of those ordering them. That is why we  applaud the decision of the National Election Council (CNE) to  require the various polling companies, domestic or foreign, to  register with it and abide by certain minimum rules before the  media may divulge their work on the political preferences of  potential voters. The CNE also prohibits the publication of  polls conducted directly by the media without complying with  such requirements as total disclosure of the poll, the sources  of funding, type and scope of sampling, estimated margin of  error, and other factors.    We are sure that the CNE's decision to intervene in these  matters results from the necessary transparency that polls and  surveys must have, particularly when they concern such delicate  issues as stating which presidential candidate has the greatest  chance of winning that office. We hope that the technical  commission that is to be appointed to oversee compliance with  the provisions contained in the CNE's resolution will not become  a shelter from the citizens' right to be well-informed and that  it will begin, as we once tried to do, to filter the  questionnaires and content of the polls.    As we approach the final stretch of the presidential  campaign, it is important to set clear rules of play that must  be followed by the different polling firms in order to prevent  public opinion from being disoriented by the election  preferences of the Colombian people. Polls are unquestionably  beginning to be a fundamental part of our political culture, but  we must take great care to prevent them--rather than ideas and  proposals--from becoming the center of the debate that will  occur this year. It is a debate that will enable us to select  the man best prepared to govern our country's destiny rather  than simply the man found to be most attractive, as if it were  merely a beauty contest rather than an election for the highest  office in the land.</p>

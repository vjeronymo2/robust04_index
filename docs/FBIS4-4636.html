			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu said Monday that his government has never  considered de-linking inter-Korean dialogue from Pyongyang's  refusal to open fully its nuclear sites to international  inspection. Asked about his position on remarks made Sunday by  a senior South Korean Foreign Ministry official that Seoul was  considering separating the nuclear problem from an envoy  exchange, Minister Han said, "it seems to be his personal  opinion."    While meeting reporters at the South Korean Embassy here,  Han  stressed that "Pyongyang must expose its nuclear sites to  additional inspections by the International Atomic energy agency  (IAEA) and allow an exchange of special envoys between South and  North Korea if it wants to hold talks with the United States."    He said that "it is up to the IAEA" to make a decision on  further checks of North Korea's suspect nuclear sites. However,  "it will be between one month and six weeks after the United  Nations Security Council adopted the chairman's declaration on  March 31."    Han will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  in  Moscow on April 14 to discuss the nuclear problem.</p>

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets: Tough budget to put muscle into Madrid  -Tom Burns says that the government attack on public spending should be good for growth stocks A restrictive 1994 budget approved in cabinet yesterday is likely to inject new muscle into the Spanish stock market. Investors have received a very clear signal that the government is going to tackle public spending seriously, and this implies an upgrade for quoted companies with good earnings prospects. 'In the mid-term the Bolsa has only one direction to move and that is up,' says Mr Juan Bastos, managing director of the Madrid stockbrokers, Ibersecurities. Echoing a view shared widely among senior Madrid professionals, Mr Bastos believes that domestic interest rates will come down again, perhaps by another half point before the end of the year. At worst, rates will be a neutral factor for the foreseeable future. It was expectations of falling rates, following the collapse of the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism, that pushed the Bolsa's general index above the 300 mark in August. Early this month the Bank of Spain delivered a bold half a point cut to bring its key intervention rate down to 10 per cent, the lowest since the early 1980s. A feeling of fatigue, brought on by so much previous discount enthusiasm, stopped the rally subsequently but the brokers hope that they have found a good support base at 280. Barring worsening developments in Moscow and the export of Russian-bred bearishness to the global markets, it would seem that the the Bolsa has corrected itself. Looking ahead, analysts see share price prospects as domestic institutions switch from lower yielding fixed income stocks into equities. At present, Spanish funds have some Pta8,000bn in their coffers, and a paltry Pta50bn invested in stocks. A switch of just 1 per cent of these funds, or Pta80bn, into equities would represent a week's trading on the Bolsa. Yesterday, the index fell 1.05 to 281.35, taking its decline on the week to 1.3 per cent. The expectation is that it will remain within a 280-290 range over the short term and that, sooner rather than later, an 'earnings rally' will take over from the previous 'interest rate rally'. The Madrid securities house Benito y Monjardin is forecasting an average increase in profits for major quoted companies of 11 per cent for 1994. Such an outlook suggests what Benito y Monjardin calls a dichotomy in its strategy recommendations for Spain. Equity investment could be reduced short term because of the market's present exhaustion but sight should not be lost of the basic upward movement that lies ahead. 'Spain, at present, is worth a 10 per cent correction,' says Mr Bastos of Ibersecurities. 'Anything more than that, and you should sell.' The cabinet's approval of the 1994 budget will almost certainly firm up the bullish expectations. The market was waiting anxiously for the good news, that the government intends to be tough. There are several business friendly features to the new budget, such as a set of fiscal incentives for investments, for the creation of new companies and for exports, but its single most important aspect is a planned 1994 wage freeze for public sector employees. The wage freeze, which is coupled to an undertaking not to enlarge the number of public employees, sets the scene for a much more ambitious government target which involves a three-year agreement with the unions on strict salary moderation. Salary rises negotiated in collective bargaining agreements in the first half of this year were in the order of 6 per cent, a level 1.5 per cent above the inter-annual inflation rate. In the new climate of a public sector wage freeze, the private sector will be expecting to contain salary increases to below 3 per cent next year. Potentially, the outlook for companies in Spain could not be better. They have the cheapest borrowing costs in years and good reason to expect further rate cuts; they have the benefits of three devaluations in the past year which have allowed the peseta to stabilise finally after depreciating by more than 20 per cent against most main currencies; they have a clear prospect of sharply reduced labour costs next year and, possibly, through to 1996. The missing link in such an outlook is of course a vital one - Spain's continuing recession. The latest serious data in this respect came with an August report by the Bank of Spain on the domestic economy in the second quarter of the year. The central bank verified that the deep recession had troughed although there was no sign of the beginning of a recovery. In this context the early September rate cut by the Bank of Spain was very encouraging, undertaken independently of the Bundesbank (which kept its intervention unchanged) and well ahead of the cabinet's decision to stick to its austerity programme. The cut indicated that the monetary authorities believed that the conditions were right to kick-start the economy. There is therefore every reason to believe that in the months ahead, as the budget passes through its parliamentary process and austerity begins to bite, further cuts will be in the offing.</p>

			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BREAKING NEW GROUND;  </P> <P> SANTA MONICA USES GREEN THUMB TO PUSH WATER-SAVING GARDENS  </P> <P> Silver bells and cockleshells might have done the job in Mary's garden, but in  Santa Monica, city landscapers have something else in mind.  </P> <P> Over the last few weeks, workers have uprooted the grass in three gardens near  City Hall and replaced green turf with Australian bluebell creepers,  bougainvillea and other "drought tolerant" plants.  </P> <P> The $10,000 demonstration project is designed to promote an increasingly  popular method of gardening called "xeriscape." From the Greek word xeros, for  dry, xeriscaping uses a combination of stones, mulches and plants that need  little water.  </P> <P> A xeriscape can save up to 40% of the water that would be used by a  conventional garden or lawn, officials say. And in Southern California, 50% of  the average household's water bill goes to outdoor uses.  </P> <P> The concept of xeriscaping has been around for years, but the public -- until  recently -- resisted exchanging lush green lawns for water-thrifty gardens  planted with desert flora. Advocates of xeriscaping have had to dispel the  notion that water-thrifty plants are generally drab and ugly.  </P> <P> "We want to show people that xeriscape landscaping can be nice-looking and  colorful and not just consist of cacti and sage brush," said Stan Scholl,  director of General Services for Santa Monica, the office that is overseeing  the city's xeriscape project.  </P> <P> Although last year's drought -- which led to emergency water-conservation  measures in dozens of Californian cities -- is now considered over in most of  the state, water management officials are encouraging homeowners, developers  and other water users to permanently adopt water-conservation habits, such as  xeriscaping.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, a new law requires that xeriscaping be used in all commercial  and multifamily construction that includes landscaping.  </P> <P> The concept was first developed in Denver. Its slowness in catching on locally  is perhaps ironic, given the fact that much of Southern California originally  was an arid land of chaparral and tumbleweed.  </P> <P> But over the decades, hordes of Midwesterners and Easterners moved to Southern  California, and they wanted the same kind of verdant front yards they had back  home.  </P> <P> "We are trying to move people away from that mentality and toward a more  natural landscape, toward plantings that are native to Southern California and  to arid zones," said Jay Malinowski, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Water  District of Southern California.  </P> <P> The agency, which provides just over half of the water used in Southern  California, is about to launch a $2-million campaign to promote water  conservation.  </P> <P> Malinowski said the tide has turned and that people are being persuaded to try  xeriscaping. A conference on the subject in Orange County drew about 40  participants five years ago, he said; the same conference this year attracted  about 600.  </P> <P> "As the word spreads that xeriscaping is less expensive, less labor intensive  and can be just as pretty, if not prettier, it's becoming very, very popular,"  he said.  </P> <P> Landscapers point to dozens of species of flowering plants, shrubs, vines and  even edible crops that can be used in a water-conserving garden. In Santa  Monica's project, plants include Australian bronze ajuga, blue fescue, eve  coffeeberry and strawberry trees.  </P> <P> Features that make a plant "drought tolerant" include long roots that can reach  deep water sources and hairy or thick leaf surfaces that retain water. And some  plants go semi-dormant in summer.  </P> <P> In addition to using certain species of plants, a xeriscape employs efficient  irrigation that allows water to permeate the soil before running off and groups  plants with similar water requirements. It limits grass areas, since turf  requires a lot more water.  </P> <P> Scholl said the city will offer tours of its xeriscape gardens during Water  Awareness Week, starting May 1.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WATER-THRIFTY PLANTS  </P> <P> The features that make a plant "drought-tolerant" include long roots that can  reach deep water sources and hairy or thick leaves that retain water. Some  plants become semi-dormant in summer.  </P> <P> Water-thrifty plants include:  </P> <P> Lily-of-the-Nile  </P> <P> Lemon  </P> <P> Bottlebrush  </P> <P> White Rockrose  </P> <P> Manzanita  </P> <P> Gazania  </P> <P> Heavenly  </P> <P> Bamboo  </P> <P> Rosemary  </P> <P> Bougainvillea  </P> <P> Trumpet Creeper  </P> <P> Australian  </P> <P> Bluebell  </P> <P> Creeper  </P> <P> Creeping  </P> <P> Mahonia  </P> <P> Guinea Gold Vine  </P> <P> Passion Vine  </P> <P> Woolly Yarrow  </P> <P> African Daisy  </P> <P> Wallflower  </P> <P> Pineapple Guava  </P> <P> California  </P> <P> Grape Holly  </P> <P> Australian  </P> <P> Tea Tree  </P> <P> Sand Strawberry  </P> <P> Strawberry Tree  </P> <P> Bronze Ajuga  </P> <P> Blue Fescue  </P> <P> Eve Coffeeberry  </P> <P> Holly Oak  </P></p>

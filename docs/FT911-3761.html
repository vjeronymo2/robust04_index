			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / De Klerk urges more UK links PRESIDENT F W de Klerk of South Africa last night appealed to Mr John Major the UK prime minister to help him win investment as apartheid is steadily dismantled. It was the two leaders' first meeting. At a working supper at the British premier's official residence in London Mr Major told him efforts to end race policies should be rewarded by the scrapping of sanctions and the sports boycott which has left South Africa isolated. Mr de Klerk, on a two-day visit to London, earlier held a private meeting with representatives of banks and financial institutions, at which he called for the strengthening of trade and investment links between Britain and Pretoria. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Bank of England governor, was among senior bankers present. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank and Sir John Quinton, his Barclays Bank counterpart, are also believed to have attended the meeting. Mr de Klerk is accompanied by his deputy foreign minister, Mr Leon Wessels, who met Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, in the afternoon. Today Mr de Klerk will address the conference of the Institute of Directors, and speak at the Royal Institute for International Affairs. He leaves tomorrow for Denmark, before flying to Ireland on Thursday and back to London on Friday to speak to the Confederation of British Industry and the UK-South Africa Trade Association. Amnesty International, the human rights organisation, yesterday criticised what it called 'the lack of accountability' of the South African security forces. Amnesty said there was 'a pattern of unlawful behaviour by members of the security forces' which lent weight to 'allegations of unprovoked use . . . of lethal force.' The statement called on the government 'to bring to justice those members of the security forces responsible for human rights violations'.</p>

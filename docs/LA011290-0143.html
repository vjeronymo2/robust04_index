			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS' ESSAY DETAILS WAYS TO HEAL THE POOR  </P> <P> With an article in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn., three UC  Irvine doctors and a Costa Mesa health advocate have written a primer on  strategies for helping the poor to get medical care.  </P> <P> Their essay describes the history of a 4 1/2-year-old, 50-member group, the  Orange County Task Force on Indigent Care, and its battles with local  bureaucrats to make medical care available to some of about 400,000 county  residents who have no health insurance.  </P> <P> Although their article details the efforts of one local group, the authors --  Howard Waitzkin, F. Allan Hubbell and Lloyd Rucker, all UCI internists, and  Vicki Mayster, a health advocate with the SOS Free Medical Clinic in Costa Mesa  -- say some of their tactics could be used around the nation.  </P> <P> "Every community is different, but there are some things that transfer," said  Mayster, a former seminary student who, with Waitzkin, heads the health group.  </P> <P> According to the article -- titled "Legal Advocacy for the Medically Indigent:  Strategies and Accomplishments in One County" -- the doctors, medical  residents, lawyers, clergy and civic volunteers in the group have used a  three-pronged approach toward making "modest improvements" in medical programs  for the poor.  </P> <P> Members have written medical journal reports documenting the difficulties that  poor residents face in finding basic medical care in one of the nation's  wealthiest counties. They have taken political action, testifying before county  and state officials. And sometimes, the article said, they have turned to  lawyers to argue their case.  </P> <P> In all, "they have been a thorn in the side of bureaucrats," noted Chauncey  Alexander, chairman of United Way of Orange County's Health Care Task Force,  who has worked alongside the group's members.  </P> <P> But several county officials who saw an advance copy of the article said it  overstates the group's gains.  </P> <P> "I'm not even sure who they are," said Marianne Maxwell, special projects  director of the county Health Care Agency, who started the county's Indigent  Medical Services health insurance program.  </P> <P> Cautioning that she had only briefly reviewed the article, Maxwell said she  believes that other community groups such as United Way deserve more credit for  changing county policies toward the indigent than Waitzkin's and Mayster's.  </P> <P> Mayster responded: "I don't want to claim we're taking credit for things other  people were involved in."  </P> <P> She added that the article repeatedly describes her group's members as working  with other community groups.  </P> <P> For instance, the article notes, her group contributed to well-publicized and  highly critical reports on local health care by the League of Women Voters and  United Way.  </P> <P> The group also conducted studies of its own. One, published in the 1989  American Journal of Medical Science, showed that 94 patients, or 5% of one UCI  clinic's caseload, did not receive such needed care as surgery, medication or  ultrasound studies because they could not afford them.  </P> <P> The article also credits the Task Force on Indigent Care with helping persuade  county officials to sharply increase prenatal services to poor women and to  streamline eligibility requirements for the county's Indigent Medical Services  (IMS) program.  </P> <P> It also says the group's members took part in "targeting health-care  institutions." In 1985 and 1986, they helped "organize a broad coalition" that  successfully opposed the sale of UC Irvine Medical Center to a for-profit  corporation.  </P> <P> Also, the article says that the group lobbied to prevent medical center  administrators from closing satellite and pediatric clinics and has used  "limited" legal actions. An attorney for the group recently persuaded county  officials to make a major policy change in the IMS program, for the first time  allowing immigrants approved for amnesty to be covered by that health  insurance. That change, the article says, "makes health care available to  thousands of immigrants in the county."  </P> <P> For all the pluses, the article also concludes that each tactic has some  weaknesses. For example, political activity "remains basically defensive. . . .  Efforts to maintain services at a minimum level do not lead to more creative  and proactive programs" that would improve overall health care.  </P> <P> In the end, the article says, organized advocacy is a "piecemeal approach" that  will not produce a well-organized health care system. Only a national health  care system can do that, the authors say, and in the meantime, "we and other  health advocates can only continue to hold the line."  </P> <P> Actually, Waitzkin and Mayster said, since the article was accepted by the  medical journal, health care for Orange County's poor has deteriorated. One of  the county's four trauma centers closed in December, poor women still have few  places they can go to deliver their babies and, Waitzkin said, "There's been a  whole bunch of commissions and task forces, and the only thing that has  happened is an exchange of words."  </P> <P> He and Mayster said their group is so upset with county officials, especially  county supervisors, that they are thinking of changing strategy and becoming  more "confrontational."  </P> <P> What do they intend to do? Both declined to say.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Minister dismisses criticism of government's human rights stance Sir, Ann Clwyd in her letter (February 12) alleges that the government allows short-term interests to overrule concerns on human rights. This is unworthy. We have shown ourselves perfectly willing to take action in recent months on Kenya and Sri Lanka - and in both cases this has had a beneficial effect, although these countries have more work to do before the international community will be fully satisfied. Before that, we cut off aid to Burma, Sudan and Somalia. The point is that we did so as a last resort. There are many ways in which we can make our views known, and we must make the best use of these to achieve our aims - not simply move to cut off aid as a rhetorical gesture. Mrs Clwyd cites the case of Indonesia in the light of the appalling events that occurred in East Timor on November 12. She alleges that the government only reacted following pressure of world opinion. The truth is quite different. As she knows, the Indonesian ambassador was summoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on November 13 to be told of the government's grave concern at the killings. President Suharto has expressed his shock at the Dili incident. He has removed the military commanders from their posts and promised there will be no repeat. The Indonesians have accepted a visit by the UN secretary general's personal representative, Mr Wako, to clarify the Dili incident. At their meeting on February 5, Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, told the Indonesian foreign minister that he welcomed the action that had been taken so far but sought assurances that they would complete, as promised, the next stages of the investigation to bring to justice those responsible, search for the missing and take measures to prevent a recurrence. Indonesia remains one of the 50 poorest countries with the fifth largest population. It has a well deserved reputation for sound macro-economic management and for making effective use of aid. It has considerably reduced the incidence of absolute poverty over the last 15 years. Following the shootings in East Timor on November 12 the donor countries concluded that projects already agreed with the Indonesian government should continue as planned. Our projects include a number relating to tropical forestry (its tropical forests are second in size only to those of Brazil), energy efficiency and the environment. These are key areas.

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (9): Scotland report shows need for cash Just under a quarter of Scotland's houses fall at the low end of the national scale in efficient energy use. That is around 400,000 homes falling well below the national average, writes Deborah Hargreaves. 'Something must be done to encourage these households to save energy - if you just wait for a turnover in the housing stock, you'd wait 100 years,' said Mr Jack Miller, director of AHS Emstar, the Contract Energy Management group, which has completed a study on the Scottish energy scene. The study, which was partly sponsored by the European Union, highlights the need for the government to kick start energy efficiency projects if it wants them to take off. 'A lot of companies take a very short term approach to energy efficiency: if a project takes four to five years to pay for itself, many company accountants are reluctant to go for it,' said Mr Miller. The energy study stressed Scotland's wealth in natural resources which could produce far more of its electricity from renewable energy, but the country has lagged behind the rest of Europe. The study lays out a series of action plans which could form the basis of an energy policy for Scotland in coming years. In the household sector, it recommends establishing a rating programme for homes that awards marks on the basis of energy efficiency. This system should take into account the Scottish climate. In addition, the study called for a revision of Scottish building regulations. It highlighted a number of key energy efficiency projects such as saving energy in public libraries. At the same time, the study also called for a design for a wind farm. But at the heart of many of its recommendations is the need for additional cash. 'Conservation still happens because of investment and if that investment is not happening on its own, the government should try and make it happen,' said Mr Miller.</p>

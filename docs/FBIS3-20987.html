			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Nuclear Accident as Experiment"] </F>   [Text] Marseilles/Paris (DPA/AP)--At the nuclear research  center in Cadarache near Marseilles they are trying to  deliberately bring about a meltdown of the sort that occurs  during a presumed major accident in a power plant. The  researchers hope to gain clues from this experiment as to how to  improve the safety standards for future nuclear reactors. The  experimental plant in Cadarache was provided with additional  safety equipment to prevent radioactivity from escaping from it.  Moreover, the experimental reactor contained only a small  fraction of the amount of fuel in reactors of the customary  size. That is why critics of the experiment have doubts as to  whether the results obtained here in the laboratory can be  applied to the conditions in large nuclear power plants. There  were contradictory statements with regard to the duration of the  experiment, which might also indicate that the experiment could  have been prematurely terminated on Thursday of last week. It  further means that the results of the experiment will be  reported on in the course of this week. The institute wants to  undertake five more experiments of this kind over the next few  years.</p>

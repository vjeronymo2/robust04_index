			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: Southwest Air stays cool in ticket war - Three of the top four US reservation systems have said they will no longer handle bookings for the airline Last year Southwest Airlines was the most profitable airline in the US. In the first quarter of the current year, it looked like staying that way: net profits shot up 68 per cent to Dollars 41m. But has its luck turned? In the last few days, three of the four computer reservation systems that dominate airline ticketing in the US have announced that they will no longer handle Southwest bookings. Investors fear passengers will give up trying to buy Southwest tickets and turn to competing airlines instead. The shares have lost about 10 per cent of their value over the past week. At first sight, the incident looks like a nasty case of bullying. Southwest has grown big and successful by offering ultra-low air fares, heavily undercutting its competitors on short-haul routes. It is surely no coincidence that the reservation systems now ejecting Southwest are owned, or at least part-owned, by its rivals. System One is owned by Continental Airlines; Apollo is owned by Galileo, a consortium of 11 carriers including United Airlines and USAir; and Worldspan is owned by a consortium of four companies including Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Trans World Airlines. Yet the reservation companies have a point. Other airlines pay them a fee of Dollars 2.50 per ticket for using their computer booking systems. Southwest, as part of its policy of paring costs to the bone, has steadfastly declined to make any contribution. The reservation companies say it is time to end the freeloading. Southwest's argument is simple: it says it does not pay the reservation companies because it never asked to join their systems in the first place. They only started including Southwest's flights to help promote their systems to US travel agents. So although both sides may be irritated over the course of events, neither side seems to have been wronged. But will Southwest be hurt by the outcome? Perhaps not as badly as the stock market fears. Although more than 80 per cent of airline tickets in the US are sold through computer reservation systems, only 55 per cent of Southwest's are sold in this way: and a large proportion of those are sold through American Airline's Sabre computer reservation system, the one system to which Southwest subscribes. As for the rest, Southwest's consolation is that travel agents do not need computer reservation systems to make airline bookings: they can look up the schedule in a timetable, make a reservation over the telephone, and write out a ticket by hand. A potential difficulty is that, because travel agents make their money by charging a 10 per cent commission on tickets sold, their rake-off on a Southwest ticket is much smaller than it would be on a higher-priced ticket. If the work has to be done manually, it is unlikely that they will be able to cover their costs. Yet travel agents dare not stop issuing Southwest tickets because the airline's low fares are so popular. Faced with the choice of losing customers to rivals still offering Southwest tickets, most agents will feel compelled to keep offering Southwest's tickets whatever the cost. Oddly, then, they rather than Southwest are in danger of emerging as the real losers. Southwest has taken some steps to ease the agents' plight. It is equipping its busiest agents with personal computers and ticket printers hooked up to its internal reservation system. It says it is studying other technological solutions to the problem, the details of which it refuses to discuss. Meanwhile, it has set up a telephone hotline that passengers can use to order tickets by mail. It says ticket sales have not missed a beat since the affair began. But this is not likely to be the end of the matter. American Airlines' Sabre system is already reported to have started trying to poach the other systems' customers. The travel agents are furious and pressing for some sort of accommodation. Meanwhile, many in the industry are asking why anybody should need a ticket to fly in any case, given that a confirmation number is all that is needed to rent a car or book a hotel room.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Survey of Ontario (6): Drink to me also with thy skills - A look at Ontario's increasingly successful wine industry TWENTY years ago, the British wine expert Hugh Johnson pronounced Ontario wines barely palatable. Today he would have to drink his words. Small, quality-driven wineries and shrewd marketing have put Ontario wines on the map. Now the province's big three - TG Bright &amp; Co Ltd, Cartier Wines &amp; Beverages Corp and Andres Wines Ltd - are joining them, emphasising vinifera or hybrid vintages rather than bulk table wines. Today there are more than 20 wineries in the Niagara Peninsula, a short drive from the famous falls. Others are to be found on the north shore of nearby Lake Erie and Pelee Island. They include Inniskillin Wines Inc (now part of Cartier) which pioneered the 'boutique' trend in 1975; Hillebrand Winery Estates; Cave Spring Cellars Ltd; Stonechurch Vineyards and Reif Winery Inc. In the 12 months to November 1992, Ontario produced 2.2m cases of wine, up from just over two million cases a year earlier. About two-thirds of this was white wine, reflecting consumers' preference for lighter drinks. Ontario's climate - 'Algerian summers and Siberian winters,' says veteran winemaker Paul Bosc of Chateau des Charmes - and wine-makers' technique come together in icewine. This rare and expensive wine is one of the province's specialties, winning prizes at international competitions such as Bordeaux's VinExpo. To make it, the grapes are left on the vines after harvest time, and the semi-dried fruit is picked only when the temperature drops below minus 7C, usually just after Christmas. It is pressed while still frozen. The result is a powerful essence of wine, concentrated but not over-sweet despite its high residual sugar. Last November, in a pre-Christmas promotion, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario released icewines from 15 wineries. More than half the 2,800 cases on offer have been sold, reports Chris Layton, spokesman for the Liquor Control Board of Ontario, the monopoly that sells and distributes wine in the province. Icewines, he says, are 'moving up quite well,' given the recession and the high prices (about CDollars 35 to CDollars 50 a half-bottle). Robert Joseph, editor of Britain's influential Wine magazine, says Canadians have overtaken the Germans as masters of icewine-making because of their attention to detail. 'When you make sweet wines, wine-making skills pay off. The character of the grapes is less important.' Such skills are also in evidence in other Ontario wines. 'Canadians are producing more and more handcrafted wines,' Robert Joseph says. But because Ontarian winemakers recognise the limitations of their climate, which is something like Germany's (only more extreme), they are concentrating on white wines, crafting Rieslings and Chardonnays which have drinkers coming back for more. The problem now is to establish a distinctive character to the wines - between the fat, buttery taste associated with California wines and the steel of French Chablis. Jean-Laurent Groux, the French-trained winemaker at Hillebrand Estates Winery, in the Niagara Peninsula, is proud to describe his Chardonnays as 'Canadian,' with subtle essences of citrus and pear. He is also producing impressive red wines, part of Hillebrand's Trius line of vineyard-designated Cabernets and Chardonnays. Ontario winemakers' credibility has been strengthened by the Vintners Quality Association (VQA), a programme run with the provincial government. Mr Don Ziraldo, a co-founder of Inniskillin, dreamed up the idea in the mid-1980s. His original idea was for an alliance of small producers who would concentrate on top quality wines. It has now been expanded to cover Ontario's three main winegrowing areas. Modelled on the French appellation controle system, the VQA has established strict criteria for certifying a wine. Most important, wines must be made from varietal or hybrid grapes - eliminating labruscas, which give Ontario wines their much maligned, foxy taste. Sales of VQA wines rose by 72 per cent in the year ending September 1992: 474,000 litres, up from 276,000 litres the previous year, according to the Canadian Wine Institute. This helped to increase Ontario wines' market share to 42 per cent - after years of losing ground to imports. Inniskillin is represented in Britain by Averys of Bristol, and Hillebrand is distributed through London-based wine merchants Corney &amp; Barrow, which sells its barrel-aged Chardonnay and Brule blanc.</p>

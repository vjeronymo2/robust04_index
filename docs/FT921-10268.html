			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Relief in sight for asthma sufferers A BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of severe asthma could open up the way for a new range of anti-asthma drugs. Doctors at the Royal Brompton National Heart &amp; Lung Hospital and the London Chest Hospital have found that cyclosporin A, a drug used to suppress organ rejection after transplant surgery, produced a marked improvement in chronic asthma sufferers. At the moment most patients need high doses or oral steroids, which can produce side effects. The cyclosporin A drug works by suppressing the T lymphocyte immune cells in the body. Researchers at the Royal Brompton hospital have suspected for some time that these white blood cells play an important role in causing asthmatic symptoms. The results of their research, published in this week's The Lancet, mean drugs could be developed in the future which treat asthma effectively but are less toxic and more selective than today's treatments.

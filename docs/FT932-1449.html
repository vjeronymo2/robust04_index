			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (16): Spartan bill of fare - Privatisation A CYNIC would say that the biggest loser of this month's general election was not Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the conservative leader who will remain in opposition, but the investment banking community which was expecting a defeat of the socialist government and a consequent rush of privatisations similar to the ones that have been outlined in neighbouring France. Mr Aznar, who believes that private is better, was prepared to sell off 'everything that could be bought'. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, returned to power for a fourth term, is not explicitly doctrinaire on the subject but in practice he has only sanctioned partial privatisations - and then only when he was pressed into them by budgetary constraints. The growing deficit burden has pushed Mr Gonzalez's government into the disposal of 13.3 per cent of Repsol, the energy group, and of 25 per cent of Argentaria, the state-owned banking corporation this year. Between them they realised some Dollars 2bn which was comfortably over the Dollars 1.3bn that the government expected to net through partial privatisation according to the 1993 budget. The issue now is whether Mr Gonzalez, heeding pragmatism rather than doctrine, will travel further down the disposal road. This of course begs the question of what exactly the budget deficit might be. The point is that although more has already been raised to ease the burden than was initially anticipated, it may not be enough. The government hopes to rein-in the deficit at 4.5 per cent of GDP, which is a repeat on last year and overshoots the Convergence targets for Monetary Union, but it could be anything up to a full point higher according to independent estimates. If that is the true situation then a renewed bout of disposals is on the cards - and the question then is which companies. Unlike France which has a very rich menu of public sector companies to whet market appetites, Spain has a spartan bill of fare. It is extremely unlikely, for example, that even the wealthiest and most patriotically motivated of Iberia's highly-paid pilots would buy shares in the loss-making national airline. What the Spanish government can credibly offer to the international markets, as Mr Aznar would no doubt have discovered had he been elected into office, is Repsol and Argentaria, the electricity utility, Endesa, Telefonica, the telecommunications group, and the tobacco company Tabacalera. All five are already publicly quoted, the first three of them as a result of the partial privatisations undertaken under Mr Gonzalez's previous governments. Repsol and Argentaria, having gone to the markets in the first half of this year, are not due to do so again until next year at the earliest. Only a real budgetary emergency would justify their imminent return to the international investor roadshow circuit. Their equity would nevertheless be no doubt welcomed for both their public issues earlier this year were heavily oversubscribed. Endesa and Telefonica are surer bets. A public share issue of just 10 per cent of Endesa, which is 67 per cent owned by the state-holding conglomerate Instituto Nacional de Industria, could realise something close to Dollars 900m. Telefonica, which has a huge market capitalisation and high liquidity, could raise a similar amount if the Finance Ministry, which owns about a third of it, were to reduce its stake in the company by just some 3 per cent. The telecommunications group would almost certainly be the first to go the market. Endesa has a number of question marks over it from the market point of view because it is currently involved in asset swap negotiations with its private sector rival Iberdrola and, in any case, the entire domestic electric utility sector is still awaiting a new legal framework that will adapt it to EC deregulation directives. Should the INI conglomerate, Endesa's main shareholder, find itself severely affected by cutbacks in the subsidies it receives from the state budgets it may nevertheless be hurried into seeking capital gains from its money-spinning utility. INI has traditionally been held in check by its lame ducks and its cyclically-based companies are likely to punish horribly its consolidated balance sheet this year. Tabacalera, which is 54 per cent state-owned, would raise a far more modest sum, perhaps Dollars 175m, were it to publicly issue 20 per cent of its equity. It is not, from the investor point of view, at its most appetising at present for its results are sagging and it is, for good measure, in the middle of selling off its food division. In all likelihood a partial privatisation of Tabacalera would involve direct equity sale to one or more big tobacco groups and bypass the markets.</p>

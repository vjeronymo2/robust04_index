Matsuda, T. Nakayama, H. </F> Yamashita, K. Kimura, and H. Ino, Department of Material  Science, University of Tokyo; Y. Murakami and H. Suematsu,  Department of Physics, University of Tokyo; and I. Higashi,  Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN)]    [Text]  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Superconducting alkali-metal doped f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/]  attracts experimental and theoretical interests. While, among  the icosahedral boron solids, both _a_- and _b_-rhombohedral  boron have crystalline structures similar to that of f.c.c.  C[.sub]60[/] in their dimensions, as well. The disparities,  however, between them are listed as follows.     -  The interaction between the soccer-ball clusters is  covalent in _b_-B.    -  The soccer-ball cage of _b_-B is not empty  (2 icosahedra are in it).    -  As for doping sites of _b_-B  rhombohedron, two tetrahedral sites have almost the same size as  those in f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/], while octahedral site is  occupied with another boron cluster (there are two other kinds  of sites in _b_-B).    This paper reports the study on the electronic properties of  icosahedral boron solids in the way of doping electrons from  alkali metal and other groups of metal.  <H5>  Experimental </H5>   Alkali metal was evaporated and doped into _b_-B crystal  in  sealed glass tube.[.sup]1[/] Cu and Al doped samples were  precipitated from B, Cu and Al melts (I. Higashi, et al.). X-ray  diffraction analysis was carried out for structural  investigation, conductivity was measured in van der Pauw method  and magnetic susceptibility was obtained by SQUID.  <H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>   The measured conductivity showed a variable range hopping  type conduction rather than thermal activation type one, and the  values at room temperature increased with increasing Cu and Li  concentration. The magnetic susceptibility obtained was the  superposition of diamagnetic component and Curie-Weiss type  paramagnetic one. Up to about 2at.% of Cu concentration  and  after Li doping, doped electron showed little contribution to  each component.    To clarify these properties, the band scheme of _b_-B is  drawn qualitatively as follows. A localized intrinsic acceptor  level islocated above the valence band. This level is thought to  be originated from a split-off intramolecular orbital of an  electron deficient B[.sub]12[/] distorted by the Jahn-Teller  effect. Since doped electron occupies only this level, neither  metallic conduction nor magnetism (Pauli paramagnetism as in the  case of alkali metal doped C[.sub]60[/]) is observed. In  addition, formation of singlet bipolaron at the level may  prevent the electron to contribute to localized magnetic moment.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   The crystalline structure of _b_-rhombohedral boron is  essentially similar to that of f.c.c. C[.sub]60[/]. Doped  electron in _b_-B shows variable range hopping type conduction  and hardly contributes to magnetic susceptibility up to several  atomic percentages. The electron occupies an intrinsic acceptor  level originated from B[.sub]12[/] icosahedral cluster and  may form bipolaron.  References    1. R.C. Haddon, et al., NATURE, Vol 350, 1991, p 320.</p>

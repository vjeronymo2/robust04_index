This is the content  stressed by Chen Xitong, secretary of the municipal party  committee, in his speech made at the municipal work conference  on 16 December on training and promoting minority cadres.    The work conference is chiefly aimed at discussing and  arranging the work of how to do a good job in training and  promoting minority cadres in the course of accelerating reform,  opening up, and economic construction in the 1990's. It is  aimed at summarizing and exchanging the achievements and  experience gained by the municipality in the work of handling  the affairs of minority cadres and at putting forward specific  opinions and demands for the municipality to train and promote  minority cadres.    In his speech Chen Xitong pointed out: A fraternal relation  is existing among various nationalities throughout our country.  Both minority nationalities and Han Nationality are the member  of the large Chinese national family and are brothers-in-arms.  An equal relation also exists among them. Therefore, they  should support and assist one another and in commonly become  prosperous, developed, and well-off. It is imperative to deal  with the relationship between minority nationalities and Han  Nationality correctly. By no means should we indulge in Han  chauvinism.    Chen Xitong said: Beijing Municipality has 410,000 persons  of minority population that accounts for 3.8 percent in the  total municipal population. The residence of minority people in  Beijing has significance. Success with Beijing, the country's  capital, in dealing with the relation between Han Nationality  and fraternal minority nationalities will influence the country  as a whole and even the world. Localities throughout the country  are watching whether our country is as good as its word in  enforcing its policies on nationalities' affairs. If Beijing is  successful in enforcing the policies on nationalities' affairs  that will be a good influence on the unity among various  fraternal nationalities throughout the country. Localities that  have minority residents should encourage their cadres of Han  Nationality to do a good job with relations between them and  minority cadres, and in fostering unity between them. This is a  sign indicating whether or not leading personnel at all levels  have the art of leadership.    Chen Xitong stressed: The work of training and promoting  minority cadres relates to the whole situation. The hostile  forces are adopting various measures in an effort to whip up the  national split and to endanger the social stability,  nationalities' unity, and the country's unification. Only by  realistically enhancing the party's leadership and making  efforts to train a large number of minority cadres who have both  ability and political integrity, resolutely support the  country's unification and nationalities' unity, maintain a close  tie with the mass, and are reliable in leading the minority  people and fostering unity among them, will we be able to  withstand many a storm or test. The harmony in the people of Han  nationality, minority nationalities and the family style unity  fostered by them in Beijing are just. Because of them, there are  a large number of representative personages and leading cadres  of minority nationalities, who have done a great deal of work in  safeguarding the country's unification and nationalities' unity.  During the forum sponsored by Chen Xitong with voters in Xuanwu  district, a compatriot of Hui Nationality said: There are  bounds among various nationalities but there are no bounds in  serving the people. Such splendid words from him have fully  reflected that the compatriots of minority nationalities in  Beijing are conscious. Party committees at all levels in  localities with minority population should attach special  importance to training and promoting minority cadres and further  expanding the proportion of minority cadres, including the  proportion of deputies to people's congress and leading cadres.  Efforts should be made to train new successors for these  minority cadres and to adopt realistic measures to vigorously  train the younger cadres of minority nationalities. The  religious circles, the specialized organs in charge of minority  nationalities' affairs, and the governmental organs at all  levels should pay great attention to the work. They should  formulate a work plan at an early date and must create a new  situation when training minority cadres next year.    Chen Guangwen, deputy secretary of the municipal party  committee, presided over and addressed the work conference. In  his speech he urged various fronts and departments to summarize  their work in training minority cadres, to find out their  shortcomings, to define the work emphasis for the future, and to  do a good job in conducting the work in a planned manner and in  line with the set programs.    Delivering reports at the work conference were Shen Daoren,  director of the united front work department under the municipal  party committee; and Sha Zhyuan, director of the municipal civil  affairs commission.    Attending the work conference were Chen Hong, vice minister  of nationalities' affairs, and Li Zhijian, deputy secretary of  the municipal party committee.</p>

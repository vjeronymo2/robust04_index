			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Management: Learning to trust others in China - A Japan-based outdoor training course that is not the usual hell A small cultural revolution is taking place in the shadow of the Great Wall of China, in hilly country two hours' drive north-east of Beijing. China's first outdoor management training centre opened there this month near the remote hamlet of Jin Shan Lin. The centre, which has the government's blessing but is operated by an independent foreign firm, is a microcosm of the country's economic liberalisation. It is run by I Will Not Complain International, a training company based in Chiba, near Tokyo in Japan. Its mission is to nurture western management values such as innovation, independence and originality among the entrepreneurial leaders of China's economic expansion and the staff of multinationals in the region. If IWNC's recent experience in helping unthinkingly loyal Japanese executives to think for themselves is any guide, this latest western idea to enter China has a good chance of taking root. IWNC had already worked for a US-Chinese joint venture before opening a base in China. The first customers at the centre will be Reuter's Japanese sales team in July followed by the Asia-Pacific regional managers of Smirnoff in October. IWNC's founder, Anthony Willoughby, a professional explorer and former salesman, opened his Japanese outward bound centre five years ago to strike a civilising challenge to the 'hell camp' style of traditional Japanese outdoor training centres. Since start-up, 5,000 staff have been through the IWNC course at Chiba, mainly from foreign groups such as Du Pont, Reuter and American Telephone and Telegraph, but also including a handful of Japanese groups such as Kanematsu, the trading house. In spite of Japan's deep recession, the number of participants rose 30 per cent to 1,500 last year, of which four-fifths were repeats or direct referrals. Willoughby believes the recession may have helped him by encouraging Japanese companies to question the value of blind obedience, thereby improving management productivity. Annual turnover exceeds Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) and a Kenyan centre, operated under franchise, is to open in July. Willoughby had the idea of launching a training school five years ago, after taking part in a Japanese-style course. It included early morning cold showers and ritual screaming of slogans such as 'to think you will be liked by your subordinates is wishful thinking'. He had hoped to sharpen his own talents as a leather goods salesman. But the experience also suggested that there might be a Japanese market for a more creative kind of training, along western lines. Japan's hierarchical management tradition demands loyalty, but it does not always breed trust, observes Willoughby. The subordination of individual needs to those of the company, as embodied in hell camp training, can also stifle original thought, preventing executives from fulfilling their potential, he argues. Accordingly, the physical tasks Willoughby has chosen for his three-day course are light enough to make the experience fun, but demanding enough courage to reinforce participants' trust in themselves and each other. While the Chinese have never been noted for lack of self-confidence, they could benefit from another of IWNC's aims - to break down social barriers between different nationalities in the same management team. In one task, for example, team members must climb an 8m pole and leap from the top to catch a trapeze, while colleagues hold their safety harness. In another, members take it in turns to fall backwards off a 2m platform into colleagues' arms. At the end of the day, participants gather for a large and liquid meal in the courtyard of an old farmhouse with a view of the Great Wall. The discussions that take place at these events, as formerly reticent participants relax, can be the most valuable part of the course, says Willoughby. Equally, senior managers can retire for a board meeting in an open 17th century stone turret with a commanding view of the Great Wall and surrounding hills. The course strives for an un-Japanese light-hearted tone, embodied in the company's name. This comes from the promise not to grumble that Willoughby has extracted from members of his various exploration expeditions since a trip to Papua New Guinea was spoilt by someone who griped when food ran low. One clause is: 'I will not complain if I get eaten or trodden on by animals.' Another is: 'I will not complain if two porters/camels/ horses are employed with the sole responsibility of carrying wine.' Joking apart, the IWNC name is supposed to underline self- reliance, a theme that parallels the Japanese admiration of uncomplaining perseverance. Indeed, one Japanese businessman has praised the expedition rules as a philosophy of life. As in Japan, IWNC's main customers in China are likely to be foreign companies or joint ventures seeking to instill team spirit into teams of mixed nationalities and backgrounds. Its first, last year, was an alliance between SmithKline Beecham, the US pharmaceuticals group, and the Chinese government. The group asked IWNC to run an outward bound course for 70 Chinese salesmen at its own headquarters in Tianjin. Their response was mixed; some thought the course taught them to achieve higher goals, but others, mainly older members, would have preferred to spend the money on buying presents for customers. True to the contract, however, they did not complain.</p>

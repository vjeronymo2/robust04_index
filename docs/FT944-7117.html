			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Austria's new coalition agrees big spending cuts Seven weeks after suffering big losses at the hands of disillusioned voters, Austria's two main parties agreed yesterday to form a new coalition government and make large cuts in government spending. Weathering protests by trade union and various interests groups, the Social Democratic party and the conservative People's party agreed to cut spending by Sch250bn (Pounds 14.5bn) over four years, curtail several social programmes and make some steps toward more flexible labour laws. In an all-night negotiating session, the two parties resisted pressures to drop key parts of their austerity plan, but left some details open for future talks with the trade unions. If fully implemented, the cuts would mark a significant departure from Austrian traditional policies of big government spending and generous social benefits. Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a Social Democrat, and conservative leader Erhard Busek are hoping to reduce the budget deficit, which is projected at Sch117bn next year, and bring it in line with the convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty. Austria will join the European Union on January 1 and wants to be in the core group for monetary union. Among the most painful measures is a pledge to limit public sector pay rises to 2 per cent in 1995, below the projected inflation rate of 2.5 per cent. The key positions in the new cabinet will remain unchanged, however, despite promises of a new start and a reshuffle by both parties. In the elections last month, the Social Democrats dropped from 80 seats to 65 seats in the 183-seat parliament, and the conservatives fell from 60 to 52 seats. The big winner was the right-wing Freedom party, which capitalised on voter disillusionment with the abuse of power and patronage by the governing parties. It gained nine seats to 42 seats. The Freedom party leader, the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, is hoping to break the coalition before its regular term ends in 1998 and become chancellor after the next elections. Public discontent with the spending cuts could hurt the governing parties in the short term. But the accord should also help maintain market confidence in the Austrian economy and its currency. The two parties also resolved a dispute over who should be in charge of EU policy.</p>

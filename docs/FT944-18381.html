			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Arts: Today's Television The highlight of the evening should be Alan Bleasdale Presents (Channel 4 at 10.00). The successful creator of Boys from the Black Stuff, and more, tries his hand as producer of four films, showing off new writers, in this case Andrew Cullen, and established stars (Jane Horrocks and John Gordon Sinclair). Self Catering is a black comedy involving the five survivors of a plane crash who assume the personalities of their screen idols. One looks forward to Horrocks as Monroe. Every wildlife film is the same but they offer relaxing viewing with a salutary lesson: it is hard to feel sentimental about animals after watching yet another lion stalk its prey. The Savage Paradise (BBC 1 at 8pm) follows a herd of elephants as they make their annual progress around the waterholes of north Botswana. A rapid repeat of The Three Tenors in Concert 1994 the warbling that heralded the World Cup Final, on BBC 1 at 10.15. Wasted windfall (Channel 4 at 9pm) tells the story of North Sea oil and wonders what happened to the economic regeneration it promised.</p>

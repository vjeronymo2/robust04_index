			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / French lorry blockade worsens THE French government yesterday stepped up its efforts to end the lorry drivers' dispute as many main roads remained blocked, causing shortages of food, fuel and medical supplies across the country. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, warned the truckers, who are protesting against new rules to curb dangerous driving, that their licences would be suspended unless the road blocks were removed. Peugeot, the car company, blamed the dispute for its decision temporarily to lay off 12,000 workers at a factory in Sochaux-Montbeliard, because of a parts shortage. In Britain, Peugeot Talbot, its UK subsidiary, said it had been forced to cancel a day's production at its two assembly plants near Coventry because of serious disruption in the supply of parts from France. Some 2,000 workers on last night's and today's shifts were told to stay at home on full pay. The company said production was expected to resume on Monday. In France, petrol rationing started at some filling stations in Paris, Toulouse, Saint-Etienne and Lyons. Hundreds of tourists were trapped at Channel ports and the borders with Spain, Italy, and Germany. Seven police and one protester were injured when police charged a demonstration by truckers and other workers at Cherbourg. The government is today launching a special committee of inquiry into the new rules, whereby French motorists are awarded six points on their licences and lose points if they commit driving offences. Any driver losing all six points automatically forfeits his licence. The truckers say they should be allocated extra points because, as professional drivers, they spend longer on the road. Mr Beregovoy said the lorry drivers could make their case to the committee, providing the protest stopped. 'We cannot negotiate while millions of tourists and millions of French people are being held hostage,' he said. However, the government yesterday made a concession by saying that the information on speed and driving time contained in the 'black boxes' installed in their cabs would not be used as evidence for driving offences. The authorities had limited success in persuading the lorry drivers to remove road blocks. A barricade of 800 lorries on the A6 motorway south of Paris dispersed during the morning, and roads in Brittany were clear by lunchtime. But the truckers stepped up the dispute in other areas by concentrating on specific targets such as petrol depots. Two of the biggest depots in the Paris region, at Val d'Oise and Gennevilliers, were sealed off by lorries. Britain's Freight Transport Association described it as the 'worst blockade ever experienced', and said it was 'concerned that drivers are being lured into blockades by the action of motorway toll attendants, or through lack of adequate information in English'. 'There are reports of French nationals tampering with vehicles, turning off refrigeration motors,' said Mr John Hix, of the FTA's international department. 'My advice to drivers who are stuck is to keep calm.' British holidaymakers were yesterday still being advised to keep away from French motorways, but Europ Assistance, the emergency recovery organisation, warned drivers to check their holiday insurance before cancelling a holiday outright. Around 50 per cent of insurance companies would not pay out for holidays cancelled only because of the threat of delays, it said.</p>

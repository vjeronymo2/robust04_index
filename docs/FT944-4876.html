			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Survey of Swiss Banking (7): Fund managers stay healthy - In private banking, the country is undisputed world leader If there were any doubts about the importance of private banking to the Swiss financial centre, they have been dispelled this year. At a time when profits from securities trading have been depressed by unexpected market turns, when new issue activity has been minimal, when margins on lending remain under heavy pressure, it is once again the commissions and fees from fund management - mainly for wealthy private clients - that are keeping many Swiss banks healthy. Take Swiss Bank Corporation, for example. Its pretax profits slid 45 per cent in the first half of this year, but commission income was up 11 per cent to SFr1.34bn. At Union Bank of Switzerland, it was the same story, with pretax profit off 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn but commission income up 10.8 per cent to SFr2.14bn. Although the big three universal banks rank among the world's largest portfolio managers, private banking represents only roughly a third of their activities. For many other Swiss banks, and virtually all of the foreign bank outlets except the Japanese in the country, it is vital. For example, at Vontobel, the Zurich family-controlled bank, 55 per cent of consolidated operating income came from commissions last year, and most of the rest of earnings from lending and trading were generated from the private banking business. Switzerland remains the undisputed world leader in the international private banking sector. Mr Bruno Gehrig, professor at the Swiss Institute for Banking and Finance at St Gallen, has recently revised upward his estimate of the total volume of funds held under management in the country to about SFr3,000bn. Bankers generally agree this represents about 40 per cent of all funds held by investors outside their home countries. In the past few years, leading banks from many countries have looked increasingly covetously on the international private banking business, and many have either moved into it or invigorated existing units. Mr Raymond Baer, a director of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, says this is not a surprising trend. 'It is true that this is an attractive business in the long term. If you have a stable base, you can get a stable, more or less riskless income. And we are all looking for that because the quality of earnings from other banking activities is declining,' Mr Baer explains. Another advantage of this business, and one which is probably to the fore in a year when financial markets have been depressed, is that most clients are unlikely to make a fuss even if they feel that their funds have not been well managed. This is because they do not want to draw the attention of their home tax authority to the existence of their Swiss accounts. At first glance, the influx of non-Swiss banks to international private banking might appear to be a threat to Switzerland's domination. In fact, however, such is the reputation of the country in this sector that most of the newcomers feel the need to have an outlet there. Mr Walter Haydock, general manager of Goldman Sachs Bank in Geneva, which opened recently, says a base in Switzerland is essential for anyone seriously committed to international private banking. 'We like the infrastructure, the tradition and the high quality investing talent,' he says. 'Clients do not come here just for bank secrecy.' A more interesting question is whether an increase in competition from foreign rivals is a threat to the Swiss private banks. The Swiss themselves seem fairly relaxed, claiming that there have been periods in the past when foreign banks became interested in private banking, but soon retreated. Banks that are not prepared to wait at least seven years for success should not even start, Mr Baer advises. 'How many who enter this business are really willing to do that?' he asks. Other Swiss private bankers argue that the increased foreign presence in Switzerland is an entirely positive phenomenon, apart from the pressure it puts on personnel costs. 'The day they are no longer interested in Switzerland I would be worried,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, a managing partner of Lombard, Odier in Geneva. Foreign banks bring new ideas and prevent the Swiss from becoming insular, he says. Mr Jacques de Saussure, a managing partner of Pictet in Geneva, adds that the foreign banks introduce new clients to the Swiss market. 'Gradually, these people may become clients of ours, too.' For all its present attractions as a private banking centre, Switzerland's future in this sector is not altogether secure. The banking community has been totally supportive of efforts to put into place a series of measures in recent years to discourage and prosecute money laundering and funds with criminal connections. However, the country's bank secrecy law, which is a main attraction for foreign investors, has inevitably been weakened in the process. The Swiss will still not co-operate with investigations by foreign authorities into cases of tax evasion. This is because tax evasion is a civil offence in Switzerland, but not a criminal offence. However, they will now co-operate in cases of tax fraud. Also, a few months ago, Mrs Carla del Ponte, the Swiss federal prosecutor, passed on a request to the country's banks on behalf of the Italian authorities for information on the accounts of a number of Italian nationals suspected of involvement in drug money laundering. Swiss bankers balked at this request, saying it was too general and made at too early a stage in the investigations. Normally, legal assistance is provided only in cases where individuals have been duly charged with a criminal offence. 'If this is allowed, then anyone can ask for anything,' one Swiss banker said following the request. The Swiss Bankers' Association has appealed to the federal cabinet to block it. In the longer term, the Swiss may also have to face pressure from the European Union to desist from harbouring its tax evaders. As the average age of EU citizens advances, tax revenues of member countries are going to be squeezed anyway, so they will become more resentful of an aloof neighbour that seems to profit from the stresses that they suffer.</p>

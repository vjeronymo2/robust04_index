"Japan is deeply concerned about this issue," the official  quoted Hosokawa as saying during a meeting with U.S. Senators  Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar at his official residence. "But  dialogue between the United States and North Korea seems to be  going in a favorable direction, and we are closely watching its  development," Hosokawa reportedly said.    Washington said Wednesday that Pyongyang has agreed to allow  international inspections of all seven of its declared nuclear  facilities. Hosokawa also spoke of the need for Tokyo's close  contact with Seoul and Washington to get North Korea to erase  international suspicions about a clandestine nuclear program,  the official said in a briefing to reporters.    Nunn, who is chairman of the U.S. Senate Armed Services  Committee, called Japan-U.S. security one of the most important  issues in the world and said it must be further enhanced.    Hosokawa, echoing Nunn's view, reportedly vowed Tokyo's  continued host nation support for U.S. forces in Japan, saying  Japan wants to do everything it can in the field.    Earlier in the day, Nunn and Lugar met with Defense Agency  Director General Kazuo Aichi    Nunn and Lugar, a senior member of the U.S. Senate Foreign  Relations Committee, arrived in Japan from Russia on Thursday  for a three-day visit. They will leave for South Korea on  Saturday.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: RADIO STATION KBET-AM FILES FOR REORGANIZATION  </P> <P> KBET, the only radio station in the Santa Clarita Valley, filed for  reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy laws.  </P> <P> The July 23 filing "will allow us to catch our breath and reposition the debts"  of the 1,000-watt station on 1220 AM, said Carl Goldman, a consultant brought  in to oversee the station's restructuring.  </P> <P> Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it  works out a strategy to pay its bills.  </P> <P> The station listed assets of $275,000 and debts of $2.3 million.  </P> <P> KBET, owned by Canyon Broadcasters Inc. in Canyon Country, has struggled under  financial and legal problems since it debuted in mid-1989. Last month, it  indefinitely laid off several on-air personalities and switched to a format of  playing only Beatles songs. The station switched formats again last week and  now plays "oldies" music.  </P> <P> Canyon Broadcasters is attempting to sell the station, which plans to retain  its "oldies" format at least until it is sold, Goldman said.  </P></p>

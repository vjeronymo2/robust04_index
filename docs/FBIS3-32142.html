I am  speaking to you from Havana, Cuba.    [Alarcon] Good evening, Comrade Mejias.    [Mejias] Well, we would like to learn something about the  results of these first three working days in Germany and about  the various activities you have been carrying out there.    [Alarcon] By all means. In fact, I am here at the embassy  for  a meeting with the chairman of the federal parliament. This is  the first meeting we held with her, but tomorrow we are going to  meet again in the morning. Representatives from all German  political parties participated in this meeting tonight,  including congressmen, representatives from the Foreign  Ministry, from the research center, and from the cooperative  development program.    [Mejias] Comrade Alarcon, have you talked about the  possibility of increasing trade and the possibility of German  investments in our country?    [Alarcon] Yes. I also wish to stress the fact that the  German  minister was already waiting for our visit, and that we were  treated in a warm and friendly manner. The German people are  also aware of our visit due to the broad coverage of the  meetings. Germany is today the second country in the world and  the first in Europe as to number of tourists visiting our  country. There are also, as you know, some German investors who  are participating in the construction of hotels in our country.  There are some prospects as well for joint ventures with German  companies in the pharmaceutical area. The talks also touched  upon other areas of cooperation. These were the main subjects we  discussed today with members of the Foreign Ministry. The legal  instruments that would facilitate and promote German investments  in our country are being discussed, and we are also discussing  economic cooperation.    [Mejias] Thank you very much, Comrade Ricardo Alarcon de  Quesada for these exclusive remarks for Radio Rebelde.    [Alarcon] Thank you, Mejias, and greetings to all.    [Mejias] Greetings to you as well.</p>

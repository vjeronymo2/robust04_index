			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: CULVER CITY;  </P> <P> COURT LETS MALL PLAN STAND  </P> <P> Culver City will prepare a supplemental environmental impact report for the  proposed Marina Place shopping mall, but will not have to rescind its overall  approval of the project, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge decided last week.  </P> <P> Both sides claimed victory in the first hearing of what could be a long court  battle over construction of the 1-million-square-foot mall on Washington  Boulevard, where the western tip of Culver City juts into Los Angeles near  Marina del Rey.  </P> <P> Culver City Atty. Joseph Pannone said the city had planned to do a supplemental  environmental study anyway, and that Judge Kurt J. Lewin's decision to allow  the approvals to stand upholds the city's right to establish its own zoning  standards.  </P> <P> Debra Bowen, an attorney representing the Venice Town Council, which along with  the city of Los Angeles filed suit last September against Culver City  contending that the environmental report was inadequate and threatened public  access to the beach, said the neighborhood group got what it was asking for in  the preparation of a new study.  </P> <P> In April, the Venice Town Council rejected a settlement offer by the mall's  developer, Prudential Insurance Co., which consisted of $6.7 million in road  improvements and other measures to ease traffic flow and a $5-million trust  fund to build affordable housing.  </P> <P> But the talks fell through when the group demanded a 50% reduction in the size  of the project. Prudential officials made it clear that the size of the project  was not negotiable.  </P> <P> Before the court hearing late last week, the Culver City Council approved the  scope of work for the supplemental report. A draft of the new report, which is  expected to cost about $61,000 and is to be paid by Prudential, is expected to  be ready by late summer.  </P></p>

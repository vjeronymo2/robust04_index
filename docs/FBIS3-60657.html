			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "India's Missile Program"] </F>   [Text] India successfully test fired the surface-to-surface  missile Prithvi [Earth] the other day. This 250-km-range  missile had undergone a series of tests earlier, and the one  carried out the other day was the last of the series. After the  acquisition of the Prithvi missile, the Indian army's combat  capability will increase many times, which will endanger the  security of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and other small  countries besides Pakistan. These countries are relatively weak  compared to the tremendous military potential of India.    According to Western media reports, India possesses a  nuclear  weapon, and it has amassed plutonium to the extent that it could  make 25 to 30 bombs. India launched its missile program a  decade ago, and since then it has experimented with various  types of missiles, of which Prithvi and Agni [Fire] are top of  the list. Agni is a long-range missile, whose range is 2,000 to  3000 kms. Although the Agni is in its early stages, after the  successful test launch of Prithvi, Indian experts are now fully  concentrating on Agni, and they will soon test-fire it  successfully.    It is a strange thing that the United States took serious  note of Pakistan's acquisition of missiles from China and  imposed sanctions against China. Pakistan has already been  subjected to similar, even more stringent, sanctions. However,  India's nuclear program, which deserves serious notice, was not  given such a consideration. Now, it is understood that the  United States has asked both Pakistan and India to roll back  their missile programs. In this case also, Pakistan is being  subjected to the same injustice in its nuclear program and  missile production, which is justified by the Pressler  Amendment. Those at the helm of affairs in the U.S.  Administration also have now realized that the restrictions  imposed on Pakistan under the Pressler Amendment are not  justifiable. From this, it can be rightly expected that the  United States will soon move to redress this injustice and end  the discriminatory treatment on Pakistan.</p>

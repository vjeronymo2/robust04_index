			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on bank sector Financial sectors again took the brunt of the downside pressure in the market as marketmakers responded to yet more scare stories that the big clearing banks, investment banks and other financial institutions have had to absorb heavy losses on market trading operations during the latest sharp setback in bond and equity markets. However, dealers pointed out that these sectors would also respond sharply to any return of confidence in international markets. The most damaging of the scare stories concerned one of the US investment banks and was largely discounted around the trading desks, but there remained lingering worries that plunging gilts and bonds have wrought havoc at some of the big international trading firms. The clearing banks, exposed to bond markets via treasury operations, took a substantial hit shortly after the opening when marketmakers chopped prices to head off any attempted selling in the wake of the German money supply figures. Similarly, merchant banks and financial services stocks were given a mauling as dealers pre-empted selling. The latest slide on the Hong Kong market exacerbated the weakness in the two Far Eastern-influenced banks, HSBC and Standard Chartered, the latter closing a further 29 off at 1130p, after touching 1115p, and the former 24 cheaper at 844p, after 828p. National Westminster Bank, whose shares plunged after the disappointing dividend news last week, was in the forefront of the market rally, ending a net 4 ahead at 489p, closely followed by Abbey National, a penny up on the day at 490p. Among the UK merchant banks, SG Warburg, one of the UK's largest biggest bond and equity market dealing firms, dropped to 849p before finishing 34 down on balance at 854p. Schroders non-voting shares, also viewed as a possible candidate to drop out of the FT-SE 100 when the FT-SE Steering Committee meets next Wednesday, gave up 40 to 1113p. Close Brothers dropped 35 to 455p but Kleinwort Benson held up well to end only 5 cheaper at 550p. Smith New Court, the independent securities house and London's biggest marketmaking firm, lost 8 to 402p. Discount houses showed Gerrard &amp; National and Cater Allen down 30 apiece at 410p and 570p respectively. Commercial Union was the best of the composite insurers, closing 3 firmer at 609p.</p>

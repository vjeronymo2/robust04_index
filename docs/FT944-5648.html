			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / The man is the message: A look at a change of corporate culture One of the first things Mr Soren Gyll ordered at Volvo after the sudden departure of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar as chairman was the opening of the big double doors that lead from the lobby at Volvo's hilltop headquarters outside Gothenburg into the inner sanctum of executive management offices. The opening of the doors, previously closed to all but a chosen few granted a coded key card, was intended to symbolise a more accessible style of management in a company dominated by Mr Gyllenhammar for more than two decades. 'Such things are small details,' says Mr Gyll, Volvo's chief executive. 'But they send signals.' Mr Gyll is seeking a change of culture at Volvo to match the wholesale change of strategy undertaken since the breakdown of the merger with Renault. The emphasis is on openness and dialogue. Under Mr Gyllenhammar, whose authoritarian style earned him the nickname 'the Kaiser', strategy and orders came from only one quarter, the top. Since the merger fiasco, Mr Gyll has consolidated his position at the head of a senior management team that has undergone remarkably few changes, given the trauma the company underwent. Most of the present Volvo executive management team were closely involved in the merger plan, and two of its members were to have been top-level executives in the merged Renault-Volvo. Like Mr Gyll, they took part in the public battle to win approval for the merger, advocating its merits. Yet in the end several top managers joined an internal revolt which, once endorsed by Mr Gyll, delivered the coup de grace to the merger. The way some team members quickly embraced a strategy entirely at odds with the one to which they had previously been committed might have strained their credibility, but they have retained the confidence of investors and of the new board headed by Mr Bert-Olof Svanholm, chief executive of the Swedish arm of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish engineering group. The main reason for this may lie with the burly, shirt-sleeved Mr Gyll. He was hired by Mr Gyllenhammar in May 1992 from Procordia, a food and drugs conglomerate then jointly controlled by Volvo and the Swedish state. Under Mr Gyllenhammar's active executive chairmanship, Volvo had run through four chief executives in eight years. But by the time the Renault merger was announced in September 1993, Mr Gyll had managed to assert a strong authority over Volvo's senior managers, who responded to his straight-talking, open style. 'The management team had become Soren's team,' says Mr Mats Ringesten, now head of Volvo group strategy after being brought by Mr Gyll from Procordia. 'It was a Volvo team, but with Soren at the helm - and it was that total team that transformed its opinion (of the merger).' Shareholders worried by the deep slide into losses Volvo had experienced in the early 1990s were also reassured by Mr Gyll's firm approach. When it emerged last year that Mr Gyll and his senior colleagues shared their opposition to the merger, the shareholders were happy to see them continue to manage the company. Mr Gyll, 54, has quickly emerged as the new dominant figure at Volvo. Although his only previous experience of the motor industry was a short spell as a car salesman in his youth, his record of restructuring Procordia is said by his supporters to equip him well for the task of refocusing Volvo on its core vehicle operations and shedding its non-core interests. Mr Gyll has been careful to avoid direct criticisms of a man who was 'Mr Volvo' for 22 years. But he has no hesitation in agreeing that Volvo is undergoing a change in culture. 'I hope so,' he says. 'At the moment we are working hard on that. A company doesn't work if it doesn't have open communication between people.'</p>

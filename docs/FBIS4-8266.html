			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 11 (CTK) -- The Civic Democratic  Party (ODS) Executive Council, at its meeting today, rejected a  document submitted by Chairman of the Civic Democratic Alliance  (ODA) Jan Kalvoda to ODS Chairman and Czech Premier Vaclav  Klaus, ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Cermak told journalists.    The document to serve as a basis material for coalition  talks  on higher self-administrative units was bad and the ODS  Executive Council was disappointed with it, Cermak said.    He said that the document "did not reflect things which had  been long agreed upon" and was not acceptable to the ODS. The  document "was conceptually empty, incomplete, not oriented  towards the future and practically makes it possible for higher  territorial administrative units to start functioning only  around the year 2000," Cermak added.    If the political will to agree on the system of elections to  the Senate, the as yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech  parliament, is shown, the ODS will not object to senatorial  elections being held this autumn simultaneously with local  elections, Cermak said. Judging by the state of preparation for  the establishment of higher self-administrative units the ODS  considered the elections to these units being held in 1996, as  proposed by the ODA, unacceptable, he said.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses hit by more bad company news MORE bad news from the corporate sector weighed on German, Dutch and Swedish equities, while a drop in French interest rates failed to support the Paris bourse, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was also upset by higher inflation data and the DAX index tumbled below the 1,500 level to close down 16.66 at 1,493.64. Turnover fell to DM4.8bn from DM5.9bn. While the Bundesbank's decision not to lower interest rates came as no surprise, a bigger-than-expected CPI figure from Hesse did. Taken together with data from other states, west German inflation is now running at its highest level since June, at 3.8 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent a year earlier. The chemicals sector fell heavily as BHF Bank joined the growing number of analysts who expect the big three to cut their dividends this year. BASF lost DM7.50 to DM208.50, Hoechst fell DM6.30 to DM236 and Bayer declined DM3.30 to DM263.50. Steels were undermined by heavy first-half losses from the Dutch group, Hoogovens. Thyssen was down DM2.50 at DM153 and Preussag lost DM3 to DM302.50. Porsche slid DM10 to DM455 after Wednesday's late announcement of a DM65m loss in the year ending July 1992 and the company's forecast that it expects a further decline in earnings in the current year. BMW, down DM1.50 at DM480, attracted sell notes after the company said that earnings prospects will be affected by the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. AMSTERDAM fell after very poor interim results from DSM and Hoogovens. The CBS Tendency index closed down 1.7 at 102.9. The DSM third-quarter figures, which showed a 55 per cent fall in profit, were much worse than expected and the shares slid Fl 7.80 or 9 per cent at Fl 77.20. The group said that earnings had been affected by guilder strength and continuing overcapacity in the petrochemical industry. Akzo fell Fl 3.20 to Fl 127, in sympathy. It was even a worse day for Hoogovens, after reporting a Fl 70m first-half pre-tax loss after Wednesday's close. Its shares closed down Fl 6.30 or 23.5 per cent at Fl 20.50. The group said that restructuring costs would also depress second-half results. Fokker was suspended at Fl 17.80 ahead of news that Dasa had reached agreement with the Dutch government on the terms by which it would take a majority stake in Fokker. PARIS ended 1.1 per cent lower as news that the government planned to sell off part of its majority stake in Rhone-Poulenc eroded early gains inspired by the Bank of France's cut in its 5-10 day lending rate. The CAC-40 index fell 18.99 to 1,730.87 as turnover remained modest at FFr1.8bn. Although the partial privatisation of Rhone-Poulenc had long been expected, the company's CIs fell FFr20 or 3.7 per cent to FFr523 on fears that the issue of new paper would depress the price. Generale des Eaux lost FFr72 to FFr1,926 in spite of reporting better-than-expected first-half results. News that it was injecting FFr150m into the real estate company, Lucia, through a planned recapitalisation, fanned worries that it faced further problems from its property interests. STOCKHOLM dropped 1.7 per cent on disappointment about SKF's bigger-than-expected loss and higher domestic money market rates. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 12.10 or 714.0 in turnover of SKr484m after SKr302m. B shares in SKF dropped SKr8 or 11 per cent to SKr65 in heavy trading after news after the close on Wednesday that the ball bearing company made a loss of SKr361m in the first nine months, compared to expectations of a loss of around SKr290m. MILAN bucked the continental downtrend, but dealers detected some nervousness as the market approached 430, seen as a resistance level on the Comit index. The index closed 1.41 higher at 428.51 in turnover estimated at L170bn after L194bn. Shares in the state-controlled food group SME fell L69 or 1.4 per cent to L4,780 as comments by the prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato that plans to privatise state industries could not be rushed prompted profit-taking after the recent rally. Dealers reported some demand in Italcable which rose L70 to L4,710. ZURICH weakened in active trading as the SMI index lost 4 to 1,905.0. Ciba-Geigy came under pressure after it was reported that the stock had been downgraded: the bearers lost SFr11 to SFr609. Roche went against the trend as its certcificates put on SFr30 to SFr3,620.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 29                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Open     10.30     11.00     12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1026.63   1025.30   1025.22   1020.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1091.11   1087.24   1088.99   1085.53                          13.00     14.00     15.00     Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1025.89   1027.40   1024.97   1025.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1088.25   1089.55   1087.08   1086.76  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Oct 28    Oct 27    Oct 26    Oct 23    Oct 22 FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1028.09   1038.79   1038.16   1034.38   1021.53 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1091.64   1100.79   1104.46   1108.83   1095.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1027.75; 200 - 1091.26 Low/day:  100 - 1020.90  200 - 1082.90  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

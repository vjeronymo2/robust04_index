			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANCTIONS SEEN FAILING TO GAIN U.S. GULF GOALS;  </P> <P> STRATEGY: ANALYSTS FEAR TIME WILL WORK FOR IRAQ. A DEADLINE FOR LAUNCHING  MILITARY ACTION IS URGED.  </P> <P> Government analysts have told President Bush that economic and political  sanctions alone will not achieve his goals in the Persian Gulf crisis, and he  is under mounting pressure to wait no more than four to six weeks before using  military force against Iraq.  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies, convinced that sanctions ultimately will not  work and fearing that time will begin working in Iraq's favor, are pressing the  Bush Administration to launch a military attack by mid-October to drive Saddam  Hussein's troops out of Kuwait and cripple his vast military machine, according  to U.S. sources.  </P> <P> However, Bush himself has not shown publicly any sign that he is concerned that  the sanctions are not working. In fact, on Tuesday he told Congress that Iraq  "is feeling the heat," although he made clear the United States will take  military action if necessary.  </P> <P> Government analysts agreed that sanctions are squeezing Hussein at the moment  and will hurt him for some time to come. But ultimately, they said, sanctions  alone "will not topple him."  </P> <P> Saudi sources suggested Thursday that if sanctions show no signs of working  within four weeks, the United States and its allies with troops stationed in  Saudi Arabia would consider resorting to a military option.  </P> <P> Already the allies are debating whether to supplement their naval blockade with  an air blockade of flights carrying supplies to Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait,  the sources said. An air blockade, which the sources acknowledged would be  potentially "very dangerous," could turn into a flash point for military  hostilities.  </P> <P> A senior U.S. government official denied that there is any "timetable" for  determining whether to resort to military force. He said a decision on that  matter could come earlier or later than mid-October, depending upon the  circumstances and whether Iraq has taken any provocative actions.  </P> <P> "There are things that could prove to be provocative before that time," said  the official, who stressed that the rapprochement between Iraq and Iran has  caused serious concern among Persian Gulf strategists. "I would keep my eye on  Iraq and Iran," he added.  </P> <P> Another senior government official confirmed that the United States will  consider a military option if it concludes the sanctions are not working but  denied that there is any deadline or "magical date at the moment" for making  that determination. He said a decision to abandon the sanctions or to stick  with them for a longer period could come earlier or later than four to six  weeks.  </P> <P> "We're constantly evaluating, and right now the sanctions are working," this  official said. "If there was a situation where certain countries would announce  they are not going to adhere to the sanctions and the sanctions are seen as not  working, then we'd look at the options. No one wants to stick to sanctions  unless we have confidence they're doing the trick."  </P> <P> Regardless of whether a deadline has been set, the Saudis as well as some U.S.  analysts believe time will work against the United States and its allies and in  favor of Hussein. The longer the military standoff continues, they argue, the  greater the chance that the fragile coalition of Western and Arab allies  aligned against Hussein will begin to come apart.  </P> <P> In fact, one high-level Saudi official predicted Thursday that some countries  in the coalition will drop out as soon as any hostilities begin. He expressed  the hope that the coalition could hold together at least until then.  </P> <P> "Our objective is to keep everybody, or as many people as possible, with us  until D-Day minus two hours, probably, or two minutes," the official said. "We  really would like to see this solved peacefully," he added. "But at the same  time, even if we have intentions to go for military action, we must pursue all  peaceful venues" in order to "maintain the unity."  </P> <P> In Saudi Arabia, Lt. Gen. Jimmy Adams, the Air Force deputy chief of staff for  operations, suggested that Hussein could withstand the sanctions longer than  the allied coalition could survive.  </P> <P> "We can cause a lot of damage, but he can take a lot of pain," Adams said. "How  long can we keep this fragile coalition together? He can survive an embargo for  four or five months. Can we keep our unity that long?"  </P> <P> The Saudi official said if an ultimate decision is made to launch a military  strike against Iraq and Iraqi forces in Kuwait, the attack would be "fast and  massive."  </P> <P> "But I can assure you," he added, "there are a lot of brains being wracked now  to do it right, proper, legal and convincingly after exhausting other options."  </P> <P> U.S. Air Force officials in Saudi Arabia confirmed that within four weeks they  will have enough forces in place to carry out a massive assault.  </P> <P> The U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf already exceeds 145,000,  including soldiers, Marines and Air Force personnel based on land and sailors  and Marines in the gulf. There are three aircraft carriers in the gulf region  and six wings of combat aircraft, made up of more than 400 planes, from Stealth  fighters to B-52 bombers.  </P> <P> Air Force commanders clearly are preparing for possible early combat action,  and they have told reporters it would be advantageous to see action sooner  rather than later if there is to be a war.  </P> <P> "We're very close to being prepared to carry out a wide range of offensive  missions," said Lt. Gen. Henry Viccellio Jr., the Air Force deputy chief of  staff. "Our forces and people will be in place by the end of September. Then  we'll be in a posture to do whatever we're asked to do."  </P> <P> Talking to U.S. flight crews at the Riyadh Air Base, Gen. Michael J. Dugan, Air  Force chief of staff, said, "When the time comes, do it right and it'll be a  short tour."  </P> <P> For now, with diplomacy still the order of the day, the Administration and its  allies are encouraging as many emissaries as possible to go to Baghdad to try  their hand at finding a peaceful way to end the crisis, officials say. In part,  they note, the invitations are designed to ensure that if a military move  comes, no country will be in a position to say that it could have averted a  crisis if only it had been asked.  </P> <P> So far, officials note, the diplomatic moves have been unavailing. Jordan's  King Hussein, for example, was firmly rebuffed by Saddam Hussein during a  recent trip to Baghdad. The Iraqi leader flatly said he would not withdraw from  Kuwait, according to diplomatic sources.  </P> <P> The Jordanian monarch is "depressed" as a result of the trip and has been  uncharacteristically silent since returning to Amman, one source said.  </P> <P> At least some senior Administration officials continue to say that they believe  the sanctions can prevail and that a military move against Hussein would be too  dangerous and too unpredictable in its outcome for the United States to  deliberately follow that path.  </P> <P> But Bush also has been receiving the opposite advice from Arab leaders, from  Israel and from at least some of his own advisers, who present three basic  arguments in favor of using force.  </P> <P> The first argument is that sanctions ultimately will not be able to force Iraq  out of Kuwait.  </P> <P> "No one knows with precision how far down you can drive subsistence" in a  society that is being placed on a war footing, said one senior U.S. analyst.  Hussein may be able to exploit "all kinds of little leaks" in the sanctions and  force his people to accept a lower standard of living long enough to outlast  U.S. patience, the analyst said.  </P> <P> The second argument is that over time, the U.S. position in the gulf will  become far more difficult to sustain. Further, as the stay of American troops  lengthens, frictions with the far different Saudi society are bound to  increase.  </P> <P> For now, the Saudi source said, there is little sign that such frictions have  become a problem.  </P> <P> "Ninety percent (of the troops) are nowhere near" Saudi population centers, he  said. But if the American military were to remain in the kingdom beyond the  beginning of the New Year, at that point "time definitely is against us," the  official said.  </P> <P> A final argument is that even if Hussein ultimately were to withdraw peacefully  from Kuwait, he would remain too much of a threat to the security of the region  to be allowed to remain in power.  </P> <P> "Saddam Hussein with all his force intact and chemical capability and nuclear  potential intact is the most menacing thing that could happen in the Middle  East," the Saudi source said.  </P> <P> If Hussein were to withdraw peacefully from Kuwait, those who would like to see  Iraqi military power eliminated would face political difficulty in staging  military action.  </P> <P> But, he noted, Hussein has shown no signs of being that flexible, adding, "I  just have not seen anything yet that convinces me that Saddam is willing or  ready to extract himself and put us in a position to face that question.  </P> <P> "We have an obligation to ourselves, to our people, to go the peaceful route as  much as we can, until everybody is convinced that this is not an option," the  source added. "But then if military action has to be taken, this will be, or  ought to be and could be, a short war."  </P> <P> Staff writers David Lauter and John M.

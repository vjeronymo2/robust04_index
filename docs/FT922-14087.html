			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Vung Tao cargo in high demand: Saleroom A PAIR of blue and white beakers, with covers, part of a cargo of late 17th-century Chinese export porcelain that lay hidden on the sea bed for 300 years, sold for Fl 44,850 (Pounds 14,059), eight times its estimate, at Christie's in Amsterdam yesterday. The beakers were one lot among 28,000 pieces of porcelain rescued from the sea off Vietnam and dubbed by Christie's the Vung Tao cargo. As in the celebrated Nanking cargo of export porcelain, which Christie's sold for Pounds 10.1m in 1986, there was great popular demand, with private collectors bidding keenly against dealers. The total for the first day of the sale was more than Pounds 2m, twice the estimate for the entire two-day auction. The beakers went to a Taiwanese dealer. A private buyer from Monaco paid Fl 32,200 (Pounds 10,094) for four blue and white tazze (cups) while a French dealer paid an equivalent sum for another pair of blue and white beakers with covers. Thirteen blue and white cylindrical vases with covers were bought by a Scottish private collector for Fl 31,050 (Pounds 9,733). All those prices were far above target. The Asian trading vessel went down in the early 1690s and was discovered by fishermen in 1989. The porcelain was destined for Amsterdam, not for use but for display, to dress a room. Each item has been marked by Christie's and much of the porcelain will appear soon in antique shops throughout Europe and the Far East. Prospective collectors should be warned that although the items are very decorative, if the Nanking cargo provides a precedent, the blue and white beakers, bowls and cups are unlikely to appreciate in price. In London, Christie's sold a pastel by Sir Thomas Lawrence for a record Pounds 82,500 to a private bidder on the telephone. It had carried a top estimate of Pounds 30,000. It is a portrait of Mrs Ayscoghe Boucherett, her two children, and her half-sister. It had been lost for almost a century, since it sold at Christie's in 1896 for the impressive sum of 1,000 guineas.</p>

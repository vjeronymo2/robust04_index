			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Management: Why smoking is a burning issue - Health Check Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of preventable disease. It is one of the biggest contributors to the number one killer in developed countries: heart disease. The average smoker lives five to eight years less than non-smokers. Smoking one packet of cigarettes a day increases the risk of heart disease threefold, and that of lung cancer fivefold. Cancers of virtually every part of the body are increased by smoking cigarettes: mouth, larynx, oesophagus, stomach, bladder and so on. Women who were once relatively safe from heart disease until they reached the menopause, are now approaching and surpassing men in some cancers because of smoking. According to a study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine (USA), one woman smoker in 10 can expect to contract stomach cancer over the next 12 years. One need not even be smoking actively to suffer the consequences: evidence published in the American Heart Association Journal, Circulation, revealed that in the US alone, 53,000 non-smokers die each year from diseases caused by the passive inhalation of tobacco smoke. Office workers are particularly vulnerable. How do cigarettes kill us? There are more than 4,000 identifiable substances from cigarettes and their filters going into the lungs of smokers. The lists includes ammonia (detergent), cyanhydric acid (used in the Nazi gas chambers), acetone and toluene (solvents), methane (swamp gas), carbon monoxide (a constituent of car exhaust gas), DDT (insecticide) and at least 10 cancer-causing substances, including polonium (which is radioactive) and cadmium (a heavy metal used in car batteries). The danger is starting to be appreciated in the west, but only very slowly. According to the World Health Organisation, between 1970 and 1985, smoking fell by 9 per cent in the US, and 25 per cent in the UK. However, in developing regions, the trend is in the opposite direction with smoking up by 42 per cent in Africa and 22 per cent in Asia. Cigarette companies are fighting hard to make sure people continue smoking. According to Advertising Age, in 1986 Philip Morris and RJR Reynolds were the second and third biggest buyers of advertising space. Tobacco companies target children with emotionally powerful messages, aimed at turning them into life-long consumers and faithful clients. But what is to be done for those who want to stop? BEFORE QUITTING Develop a new reward system. Stop viewing cigarettes as a reward for a long day or a job well done. Buy yourself something, or treat yourself to a massage. Plan some activity for the times that you smoke. Many managers smoke during lulls in the action because of boredom. Giving up while on holiday is a bad idea: most people start again as soon as they get back to the office. Keep a smoking journal. Most smokers underestimate how much they smoke. Make a note of each cigarette you have, putting a star next to any you enjoyed. Most managers who smoke seem to enjoy only about one in 10 of the cigarettes they smoke. Never smoke blindly. Smoke only to the exclusion of all other activities, being aware of what you are doing to yourself. Smoke your first cigarette an hour later every day. ONCE YOU HAVE QUIT Stand up for your new rights. When people ask you if you mind if they smoke, say 'yes'. View yourself as a long-term non-smoker. You have to stay vigilant forever: if you fall off the wagon and have a cigarette, don't use it as an excuse to have a second and a third. When you feel like smoking, don't drink alcohol which lowers your resistance to cigarettes. Compensate for previous damage from cigarettes with exercise.

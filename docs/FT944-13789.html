			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Peace prospects frayed at the edges: Palestinian grievances are increasing tensions again in the Middle East Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, will be conspicuous by his absence at today's triumphant signing of the Israel-Jordan peace treaty in the presence of US President Bill Clinton. Jordan, which is at loggerheads with the PLO over rival claims to the Islamic sites in Arab East Jerusalem, did not include the Palestinian leader among the 5,000 guests. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, went further, telling Mr Arafat, officially and publicly, that he was 'not welcome'. The landmark accord signed by Israel and the PLO last September marked a turning point in Middle East peace. Since then, Israeli peace with Syria and Lebanon has moved within grasp; Morocco and Tunisia have established formal ties with the Jewish state; the Arab economic boycott of Israel has been eroded; and, on Sunday, political and business leaders from Israel, the Arab world, the US, Europe and Japan will meet in Casablanca to take the first step towards creating a Middle East common market. But the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement that made all this possible is in serious trouble. Against the backdrop of economic deterioration in the Gaza Strip and delays in the peace negotiations, Palestinian discontent is rising, and there has been a series of horrific attacks on Israelis by Palestinian Islamic guerrillas. Indeed, Mr Arafat's advisers are now openly questioning the feasibility of the peace process. 'The situation is very fragile and sensitive at the moment in terms of stability. Anything could happen,' said Mr Nabil Abu Irdainah, a senior official in Mr Arafat's office. 'We still hope it will work, but it could fail.' Israel and the PLO knew that their peace agreement was a risky venture. In return for Israeli recognition of the PLO and a commitment to a five-year process of negotiations, Mr Arafat settled for limited autonomy in a tiny, impoverished part of the land claimed by Palestinians. He hoped he could eventually win the state the Palestinians want, in all of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including Arab East Jerusalem. Palestinians were sceptical about Mr Arafat's deal, which seemed to surrender the three burning causes that have sustained the Palestinian struggle since 1948: the return of up to 4m Palestinian refugees; the recovery of all land occupied by Israel; and a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital. But a slim majority gave the veteran PLO leader the benefit of the doubt. The signatories to the deal hoped that this fragile Palestinian support would be consolidated as the peace process gained momentum, with Mr Arafat gradually expanding his rule across the West Bank and holding elections to pave the way for discussions on statehood, Jerusalem and refugees. Support would also grow, they believed, as Palestinians experienced a speedy change in their economic situation. However, 13 months after the signing of the agreement, ordinary Palestinians have seen little evidence of the fruits of peace. The peace process is six to nine months behind schedule. Israel has reneged on promises to release thousands of Palestinian prisoners and appears reluctant to take the next big step in the process: redeployment of Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank to allow Palestinian elections. Israel is also insisting on complex security arrangements to protect the 120,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, and pushing the PLO to bar the Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement from participating in the elections. The poll should have been held last July, but now seems unlikely before mid-1995. Israeli control over the pace of the peace negotiations and the nature of any concessions to the PLO is fuelling support for Mr Arafat's opponents, who maintain that Israel never intended to hand over the West Bank. 'The delay in the application of the agreement only helps to inflame the situation, and will help extremists to explode the peace process,' said Mr Yassir Abed-rabbo, who holds the Palestinian portfolio for culture. And on the economic front, the chaotic transition from Israeli to PLO rule in the Gaza Strip may even have caused a downturn. In an economy with 50 per cent unemployment and years of infrastructure neglect, only a fraction of the Dollars 720m of emergency aid promised by international donors and the World Bank for 1994 has been released. The UN Works and Relief Agency has spent Dollars 52m on projects since September last year, but the only other large project under way is a Gaza clean-up campaign, funded by Japan and the European Union, which has created just 3,000 jobs. A Dollars 128m emergency housing project is slowly taking shape. As a recent UN internal memorandum observed: 'Despite its significance, almost no significant investment activity has occurred in the Gaza Strip since (Israeli) redeployment.' The private sector remains unwilling to inject capital, the UN says, 'into an economy where the political situation remains unstable and no regulatory framework yet exists'. Recent evidence of irregular business deals in cement, petroleum and telecommunications, negotiated by a coterie around Mr Arafat without open public bidding, has also deterred the private sector. The World Bank blames the PLO's lack of accountability and Mr Arafat's refusal to delegate economic decision-making for these problems. There has been political infighting in the PLO, as four senior officials have competed for control over economic policy, with Mr Arafat as the only court of appeal. The PLO blames the World Bank and other donors for bureaucracy and failure to see the political imperatives of speedy disbursement of aid. 'We are suffering from donor fatigue, donor myopia and donor arterial sclerosis,' said Mr Nabil Shaath, one of the Palestinians responsible for aid negotiations. 'Unless you burn yourself completely, like Rwanda or Somalia, it seems donors are not interested.' Some bilateral donors believe the truth lies in the middle. While they support the World Bank in its criticisms of the PLO, they say the bank has concentrated too much on long-term projects and has proved incapable of finding alternative ways to release aid and to work with the PLO. Mr Terje Roed Larsen, UN under-secretary general co-ordinating aid to the Palestinians, said: 'The UN and World Bank agree that it is now acutely necessary to have both a short-term and long-term focus and to put in motion high-impact job-creating projects, because if there is no significant improvement of living conditions in the next six to eight months, the support and legitimacy for the process and the Palestinian authority will evaporate.' Matters have been made worse by Israel sealing the borders with the Gaza Strip and West Bank at least four times since September last year. The most recent closure, imposed last Wednesday after the Hamas suicide bombing of a Tel Aviv bus, which killed 22 Israelis, is still in place. The closure has put 65,000 Palestinian migrant labourers, whose income forms the backbone of the dependent Palestinian economy, out of work. It will also hit Palestinian exports to Israel and Palestinian Treasury revenue, as well as deterring investors and tourists. These costs, together with the continuing economic hardship, appear to be strengthening the hand of Hamas. Mr Mahmoud Zohar, the organisation's leading Gaza spokesman, welcomed the return of Mr Arafat and the PLO to Gaza because their failures, he said, would encourage Palestinians to turn to Hamas. 'Arafat's return hastens the coming of the Islamic state,' he said. Many Palestinians refuse to condemn the recent Hamas attacks, in view of the continuing Israeli occupation and Mr Arafat's apparent weakness. The simmering tension between the two rival Palestinian groups has moved into open confrontation, with Hamas challenging the PLO for the political leadership of the Palestinian cause. Mr Arafat dares not move against Hamas while he has so few political and economic gains from the peace process and fears the eruption of civil war. 'We did not make peace with Israel to make a civil war among our own people,' said Mr Shaath. 'Hamas cannot be defeated by security alone. We need a judicious mixture of political and economic change.' But Israel, backed by the US, is insisting that Mr Arafat deal a severe blow to Hamas, and implying that further progress in the peace talks will depend on a crackdown on Islamic guerrillas. Mr Arafat's dilemma, and the possibility of a break-down in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, could yet derail progress towards peace in the Middle East. Despite today's signing with Jordan, many Arab states are holding back or making further ties with Israel conditional on progress on the Palestinian issue. Until that happens, hopes of wide-ranging peace in the region look far-fetched.</p>

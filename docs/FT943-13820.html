			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Sikes sees electronic pie in the sky Alfred Sikes, former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, last week denounced most of the talk about electronic superhighways as hype, fantasy and crystal ball gazing. He told a Financial Times multimedia conference in London that, as a result, many companies were defying the law of gravity 'by having multiples of earnings before there are any earnings, or even well conceived predictions of any.' The former FCC chairman, now president of Hearst New Media and Technology, said that as far as the eye could see television revenues would continue to be spread across broadcasting, cable, video and, in some countries, satellite delivery. 'I am also convinced that, over the long run, today's retailers will capture the bulk of home-shopping revenues, not the network providers,' Sikes said. Change would almost certainly be evolutionary and much of television would remain the same - although gradually much more would be available through the creation of advanced networks. Sikes forecast that: 'Advanced networks will increasingly come along with virtually unlimited capacity, supported by consumers-friendly search tools. The viewer will be master.' There could be thousands of new information providers, although some would never get off the ground and others would remain niche players. He predicted that the information and programme content equivalents of companies such as Apple and Microsoft would also develop. 'I can't tell you for sure how advanced networks are going to develop or how many there will be,' said Sykes, who added he thought there would be more than one. 'I do know that bandwidth (channel capacity) will be cheap and that the days of scarcity are over,' he concluded.</p>

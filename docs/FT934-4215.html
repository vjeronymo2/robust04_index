			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Finance and The Family: Doubts over child grant - Social security / The Budget and You Child care allowance was the only social security measure announced in the Budget to get a welcome from interested bodies on the day. But enthusiasm cooled as its restricted scope became plain. Essentially, the allowance will apply only to the poorest lone parents, mostly women, and can be claimed only by someone on family credit. If the individual is spending money on child care, the DSS will 'disregard' up to Pounds 40 of their earnings when calculating the credit. Under the complex credit rules, that translates into a maximum benefit of Pounds 28 a week. It will be available only to people working at least 16 hours a week and paying registered child-minders for care of under-11s. 'Does it meet the full cost of paying child care for a 37-hour week? No, of course it doesn't,' said Treasury financial secretary Stephen Dorrell. He explained that the allowance was aimed at getting people back into the work force: women with relatively low earning potential now deterred from taking work by the cost of child care. The allowance could, however, have the side effect of saving the government from a further appearance in the European Court. The Child Poverty Action Group had been backing an action claiming the government discriminated unfairly against women by not taking account of child care costs when calculating family credit, since far more women than men have responsibility for children. A CPAG spokeswoman said the plaintiff would have to decide whether to go ahead with the case. Introduction of an incapacity benefit caused anger and consternation among organisations representing disabled people, who said it was wrong of the government to target savings of Pounds 1.5bn rather than aiming to meet needs. One of the benefit's most controversial aspects is the new medical assessment. Social security secretary Peter Lilley said medical controls for the invalidity benefit - which it will replace - had been weakened by the fact that, in deciding whether someone was incapable of work, 'non-medical factors such as age, educational qualifications and labour market conditions have to be taken into account.' But Marilyn Howard of the Disability Alliance said such factors were an essential part of deciding ability to work, adding: 'It has been recognised in law since 1946 and the National Insurance Act, and even prior to the first world war, that incapacity for work must have regard to the work an employer would be prepared to pay for and the work someone could be expected to do.' Meanwhile, the CPAG believes the 'job-seekers allowance' - to replace unemployment benefit in 1996 but with a new maximum of six months - could land the government in the European Court because, inevitably, it would discriminate against women. The CPAG said someone who lost her job and failed to find another within six months would be unable to claim income support if she had a partner who was employed.</p>

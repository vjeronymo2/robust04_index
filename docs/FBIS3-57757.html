			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Brodskiy report: "First Deputy Minister for CIS </F> Affairs Appointed. Post of Minister Still Vacant"]    [Text] Vladimir Mashchits, former chairman of the State  Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS Countries, was  appointed by government decision yesterday as acting chief of  the new Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries with  the rank of first deputy minister.    Vladimir Mashchits is 39 years old. Before his appointment  as chairman of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation with  the CIS Countries [State Cooperation Committee] he was Russia's  authorized representative on the Inter-Republican (later  Inter-State) Economic Committee; earlier he worked at the  Central Economics and Mathematics Institute.    Vladimir Mashchits' new appointment can be interpreted as  follows: the agency he heads is growing, acquiring new  functions and objectives, whereas the former State Cooperation  Committee chairman himself is unable to keep pace with the  expansion.    In fact, figures who not long ago were in charge of Russia's  economic relations with the former USSR republics have changed  completely. Typically, both Aleksandr Shokhin, recently deputy  prime minister and chief supervisor of economic relations with  the CIS countries in the Russian Government, and Vladimir  Mashchits were relegated to lower rungs of the government  hierarchy. In this context it is worth noting that Vladimir  Mashchits belongs to the first, "Gaydar" government draft, a  fact that could not but influence his effective demotion,  although he has never stood out too much.    On the whole, however, there is no doubt that Russian CIS  policy will have new guidelines. One may even discern what they  will be like to a high degree of certainty. To all appearances,  geopolitics will take precedence over economic calculations, and  integration -- under Russia's aegis and based on resuscitating  the ruble zone -- will come to the fore.    The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries  (apparently modeled on the British Ministry of Commonwealth  Affairs) has an important role to play because it has been  entrusted not only with economic, but also with political  functions. And while Vladimir Mashchits performs the duties of  an acting minister, a new candidacy is apparently being picked  at the political kitchen, a person whose political clout and  views should correspond to the new objectives of a new stage in  Russia's relations with the former Soviet republics.    [Article includes the following boxed passage]    -- The State Committee for Economic Cooperation with the CIS  Countries was an agency accumulating proposals from all Russia's  economic agencies on the development of cooperation with the  former USSR republics. Particular importance in the committee's  activity was attached to the credit and financial aspects of the  cooperation.    -- The Ministry for Cooperation with CIS Member Countries,  while retaining all the functions of its predecessor, has also  taken over political support for the integration.</p>

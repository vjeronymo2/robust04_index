			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) For properties being offered with mortgage insurance, priority will be given to owner-occupant purchasers, as defined in &sect;291.5, for a period of up to 30 days, as determined by HUD. For all other properties (i.e., properties not offered with mortgage insurance), priority will be given to governmental entities and nonprofit organizations prior to other owner-occupant purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Earnest money deposits.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The amount of earnest money deposit required for a property with a sales price of $50,000 or less is $500, except that for vacant lots the amount is 50 percent of the list price. For a property with a sales price greater than $50,000, the amount of earnest money deposit required in the area is set by the Field Office, in an amount not less than $500 or more than $2,000. In determining the amount of earnest money deposits, a Field Office considers comparable practice in the locality, area real estate market conditions, the type of offers generally received, and the ability of the area's typical buyers to secure financing. Information on the amount of the required earnest money deposit is available from the Field Office or participating real estate brokers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Section 291.110 is amended by revising paragraph (a) and revising the phrase ``field office manager'' to read ``Field Office'' in paragraph (b)(1), to read as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;291.110  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Other sales procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Direct sales of properties without mortgage insurance to governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) State and local governments, public agencies, and qualified private nonprofit organizations that have been preapproved to participate by HUD, according to standards determined by the Secretary, may purchase properties directly from HUD at a discount off the list price determined by the Secretary to be appropriate, but not less than 10 percent, for use in HUD and local housing or homeless programs. The amount of the discount may vary, depending on the area, the type of sale, or the number of properties purchased and closed in a single transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)(i) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must designate geographical areas of interest, by ZIP code, to appropriate HUD Field Offices. Upon request, for those properties not eligible for mortgage insurance, and before they are publicly listed, Field Offices will notify governmental entities and nonprofit organizations in writing when eligible properties become available in the areas designated by them. Field Offices will coordinate the dissemination of the information to ensure that where more than one purchaser designates a specific area, those purchasers receive the list of properties at the same time, based on intervals agreed upon between HUD and the purchasers. Properties will be sold on a first come-first served basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Purchasers under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must notify HUD of preliminary interest in specific properties within five days of the notification of available properties (where notification is by mail, the five days will begin to run five days after mailing). Those properties in which purchasers express an interest will be held off the market for a ten-day consideration and inspection period. Other properties on the list will continue to be processed for public sale. HUD may limit the number of properties held off the market for a purchaser at any one time, based upon the purchaser's financial capacity as determined by HUD and upon past performance in HUD programs. At the end of the ten-day consideration and inspection period, properties in which no governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed a specific intent to purchase will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process. Properties in which a governmental entity or nonprofit organization expressed an intent to purchase, during the ten-day period, will continue to be held off the market pending receipt of the sales contract. If a sales contract is not received within a time period of up to ten days, as determined by HUD, following expiration of the ten-day consideration and inspection period, and no other governmental entity or nonprofit organization has expressed an interest, then the property will be offered for sale under the competitive bid process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In order to ensure that properties purchased at a discount are being utilized for expanding affordable housing opportunities, HUD may require, as appropriate, periodic, limited information regarding the purchase and resale of such properties, and certain restrictions on the resale of such properties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * *  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;291.135 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> [Amended] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ISSUES IN NEWPORT-MESA SCHOOL BOARD ELECTION  </P> <P> Re Newport-Mesa Unified School District Election:  </P> <P> Our current school board, working cooperatively with our community members,  site administrators and district officials, has built an exemplary educational  system that we do not wish to see undermined. Yet two of the challengers  seeking election to the school board have accepted the support of a  single-issue group committed to censoring the curriculum in our public schools.  </P> <P> We are ready to stand up and be counted as angry at the insistent call for  "reinstatement of traditional Christian values." The Christian values that we  were taught include love of mankind and tolerance of others' views. We resent  the intolerance of this group and the insinuation that people who do not accept  their views on certain specific issues have suspect values.  </P> <P> TAYLOR GRANT  </P> <P> CANDI GRANT  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

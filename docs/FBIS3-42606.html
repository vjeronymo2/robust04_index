			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valerian Advadze, ambassador extraordinary </F> and plenipotentiary of the Republic of Georgia to the Russian  Federation, by I.M.; place and date not given: "Gamsakhurdia's  Death"]    [Text]    [I.M.] The death of Zviad Gamsakhurdia is shrouded in  mystery; rumors and different versions abound. Why has  everything happened in such a strange way? Why did we learn  about his death only several days later?    [Advadze] Because he himself lied all his life. And so his  death also ended up wrapped in lies.    [I.M.] Did Gamsakhurdia's wife ask that he be buried in  Tbilisi, on the territory of the estate?    [Advadze] I do not know. There were such reports in the  Moscow press, but to the best of my knowledge nobody made such a  request officially to the government of Georgia. Again,  everything is on the level of rumors. The same rumors have it  that Manana Gamsakhurdia allegedly said that she is afraid that  his grave in Tbilisi would be defiled and therefore wants to  move his body and rebury it in Groznyy.    [I.M.] This dragging the body from one grave to another  resembles Abuladze's famous film. It looks as if the director  had a tragic foresight regarding the future of his people. If  Gamsakhurdia is indeed buried in Tbilisi, would it have any  repercussions on the political situation?    [Advadze] No. The funeral may attract a crowd of gawkers and  people who remain fanatical supporters even after what he has  done to Mengrelia, after the fratricidal war he plunged Georgia  into, after the rampage of his gangs. There are not too many  people left, however, who would even die shouting "Zviad!  Zviad!" and they will no longer be able to influence anything.  The Georgian government learned of his death from Russian  information, and this also says a great deal. First of all that  his own confederates--the people who most likely did him in  anyway--kept a lid on the news of his death. His entourage got  tired of his whims and of the defeat. It appears that those who  had been counting on coming back to power on his coattails,  whose hopes were dashed, eventually disposed of him.    [I.M.] Which peculiarities in the popular psychology, in the  nation's historic fate, was Gamsakhurdia able to exploit?    [Advadze] There are two kinds of nationalism. There is  constructive nationalism, capable of taking a nation on the road  of progress. This is the sense of national dignity. And there is  an aggressive, animalistic, destructive one. It is the latter  kind that Gamsakhurdia exploited, and, unfortunately, many fell  for it, for the slogan "Georgia for Georgians!" One can find an  explanation for it: when people over a period of two centuries  are deprived of statehood, dream of it, and suddenly get a real  opportunity to attain it, speculative ideas easily gain support.  Time helps us see their real value.    As to the "recognized leadership," these figures--some say  95, some say 87 percent--that constantly are being brought up  with respect to his election as president, are also a complete  lie. It was an unprecedented falsification. Ballots were  switched, voting took place under submachine guns aimed at  people, and many other things occurred. Even on the wave of the  prevailing mood there could not be more than half of the  population who would have voted for Gamsakhurdia. We, the Union  of National Accord and Revival of Georgia, published a  memorandum, "Democratic Elections: Myth and Reality," in the  TBILISI newspaper on 20 April 1992, in which we proved that no  democratic election could possibly take place, and that all the  so-called data are a result of skillful falsification. On 5 May  we reprinted it in SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA--the most popular  newspaper in Georgia--and invited opponents to disprove our  arguments. Nobody responded! Nobody! His one-year rule proved  that both he and his Roundtable were simply incapable of running  the state. Suffice it to recall the absurd economic policy--for  instance, declaring an economic blockade of the USSR? Can you  think of anything more stupid? And when he was already on the  run, the entire campaign of civil disobedience, all the  explosions, sabotage, the war against his own people? Who could  still harbor any illusions? Then the march on Samtredia and  Kutaisi--bringing with them foreign marauders, together with  whom his "army" plundered, killed, and destroyed.    [I.M.] Some commentators--Yevgeniy Kiselev of "Itogi" among  them--say that with Gamsakhurdia dead, the idea of, so to say,  an official opposition on which much could be blamed also died,  and now Shevardnadze will have to deal with a real and strong  opposition in the parliament, which has its own score to settle  with the authorities.    [Advadze] The current parliamentary opposition has long lost  its "Gamsakhurdia" colors. Many of them retain, however, what I  would call a "Roundtable" mentality: anti-Russian leanings;  rejection of the idea of joining the CIS; the hope that the West  will show concern over the fate of Georgia, despite the fact  that the West is in no hurry to open its arms to us--or to  Russia for that matter. I think that to a certain extent this  opposition can be explained by the desire to stand apart, to  "shine" in the public background, to not get lost. Most of the  time their complaints about the authorities are vague, their  proposals not thought-through, and they still do not have any  idea how the economy functions and why we need ties with Russia.  This is not serious. For instance, Natadze, chairman of the  parliament's commission on defense and security, says we should  declare a war on Russia over Abkhazia and that we could even win  it.    [I.M.] There was this funny Georgian joke about Guria  deciding to declare a war on China, and how the next morning all  the women in the little Guria put on their mourning clothes and  got ready to bury a billion Chinese. It is frightening when a  joke holds the threat of becoming a tragedy. That the tragedy is  real, that the situation is unstable, one can see from the  constant clashes taking place, for instance, in Tbilisi.    [Advadze] These are clashes between mafia groups who are  dividing the spheres of influence and redistributing profits. To  call things by their proper names, this is rampant gangsterism.  We have to put an end to this runaway gangsterism, plundering  and violence against the civilian population.    [I.M.] How?    [Advadze] By force.    [I.M.] The army?    [Advadze] The army. But a hired one. Since a Georgian  militiaman finds it difficult to shoot a Georgian gangster, and  since everybody is armed to the teeth, we have to invite those  who will be able to bring it under control.    [I.M.] The Russian Army, for instance?    [Advadze] The Russian military, but on a contract basis.  This  is not the Russian Army.    [I.M.] But this will only complicate relations between  Russians and Georgians inside the country.    [Advadze] No. If they work on contract, and on top of that  in  tandem with the Georgian militia or army, this is normal.    [I.M.] A new round of negotiations has begun in Geneva. What  is your forecast?    [Advadze] I do not expect anything to come of it. The  Abkhazian side behaves like the winner; they are intent on  attaining Abkhazian independence. The world community--and not  even the world community, but specifically Russia--can stop  them. Russia must openly recognize the territorial integrity of  Georgia and demand the return of Georgian refugees to Abkhazia.  But Russia is still behaving in a vague manner. Actually, it is  difficult to demand a firm position of Russia right now, and I  understand this. And while everybody is vacillating and  negotiating, the Georgian population in Abkhazia is being  literally exterminated in the physical sense. True genocide.    [I.M.] Georgia is not going to reconcile to the loss of  Abkhazia. Does this mean war?    [Advadze] There is a political solution to this problem. The  key to it is in the hands of Moscow.</p>

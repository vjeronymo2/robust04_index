			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Company News: Screen-based trading moves ahead in Italy Italy's move to fully computerised share trading gathers pace today with the transfer of 70 more stocks to the screen-based network, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. This follows a more important shift earlier this year, when some of the most heavily-traded stocks transferred to screen-based trading. The latest transfer brings to 152 the number of shares traded on-screen. It marks the fifth switch of shares to the screen-based system since computer-based trading made its debut in November 1991 with shares in five companies. By early next year, the bourse hopes computer-based trading will cover almost all the 331 separate issues listed. From next January, 32 lightly-traded warrants and the four foreign stocks listed in Milan will be covered by the new five-day settlement period, compared with up to six weeks at present.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Bank governor's warning on growth A WARNING against dramatic measures to stimulate growth in the UK and world economies was given last night by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England. Speaking at the annual banquet of the Overseas Bankers Club in London, Mr Leigh-Pemberton said governments should keep their nerve and react cautiously to calls for further substantial reductions in interest rates, concerted fiscal stimulus or changes in rules governing bank lending. The industrial countries 'should not lose faith' in the underlying strategy they had pursued since the early 1980s. The best recipe for a durable recovery was 'based on the restoration of price stability and the pursuit of stable budgetary policies as the preconditions for sustainable growth', he said. Mr Leigh-Pemberton did not rule out 'selective, well-designed measures' to improve the responsiveness of economies to the basic strategy or in response to changing circumstances. But he underlined that policymakers must aim for lasting expansion rather than rapid short-term recovery. The governor expressed his support for the German central bank's counter-inflation policy that has included a sharp rise in interest rates. Britain's long-term interest lay 'in matching, or even exceeding the standard of price stability set in Germany'. Only in that way could the UK pave the way for sustainably lower interest rates and durable non-inflationary growth. Britain and the US had suffered long-running recessions because of the large-scale financial imbalances built up during the 1980s. Another negative factor had been falling confidence. But the governor said he expected growth in the industrialised countries would be close to the underlying growth rate of their productive potential by the end of this year. 'I am quite convinced that once companies and individuals have brought their borrowing back into a more comfortable relationship with incomes and profits, confidence will begin to revive and they will once more turn to expenditure deferred during the recession,' Mr Leigh-Pemberton said. He warned against moves to accelerate this trend. 'To short-circuit this process would, I believe, be of dubious effectiveness and ultimately unwise.' The Treasury is reconciled to a weaker economic performance this year than had been expected after recent industrial production and retail sales figures have pointed to virtually no growth in the final quarter of 1991. The next forecast of the economy will be given by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his Budget on March 10. Last night Treasury officials dismissed as 'complete and utter nonsense' suggestions that they were releasing details of the economy ahead of the Budget to pave the way for tax cuts. But they admitted that the economy could have contracted by around 2.5 per cent last year, compared with the Autumn Statement forecast of a 2 per cent fall in gross domestic product. This, combined with the delay in the recovery, would mean growth this year would be lower than the 2.25 per cent forecast by the government last November. A Budget lament to Lamont Page 9</p>

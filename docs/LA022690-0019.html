			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE SWIMMING;  </P> <P> PAC-10 CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> STANFORD WINS 4TH CONSECUTIVE WOMEN'S TITLE  </P> <P> The Stanford women's swimming team won four more events Sunday night to seal  their fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championship at  the East Los Angeles College Pool.  </P> <P> Stanford totaled 1,717 points. California finished second with 1,238, followed  by UCLA (1,143), Arizona State (1,075) and USC (936).  </P> <P> Stanford's first victory came in the first event when freshman Janet Evans  lapped the field in the 1,650-yard freestyle, setting a conference record of  15:53.77.  </P> <P> Although victories are almost becoming routine for Evans, who had won two  events in earlier sessions, she was excited by her effort.  </P> <P> "My goal was to go under 16 minutes and I was very happy to do it," she said.  </P> <P> Susannah Miller, a Stanford senior, led a Cardinal sweep in the 200-yard  backstroke. Miller, who touched with an NCAA qualifying time of 2:01.29, was  followed by Jody Smith and Dede Trimble.  </P> <P> Kristin Stoudt, a sophomore at UCLA, won the 100-yard freestyle with a  conference record of 49.93. Michelle Thompson of Arizona State was second.  </P> <P> Stoudt, who won the 50-yard freestyle Friday night, swam her best time ever.  </P> <P> "My goal was to break 50 seconds," Stoudt said. "I'm confident going to NCAA's  because I know I can go faster."  </P> <P> In the next event, the 200-yard breaststroke, Stanford freshman Lori Heisick  led from the beginning on the way to her second championship with a time of  2:15.82. Her teammates, Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert, were second and  third, respectively. Heisick won the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday night.  </P> <P> Stanford's final victory came when freshman Janel Jorgensen joined Evans as a  three-event winner with a victory in the 200-yard butterfly. Jorgensen's time  of 1:58.75 was just off Mary T. Meagher's conference record of 1:57.4, but well  under the qualifying standard.  </P> <P> Jorgensen was happy with the victory, but had hoped for Meagher's record.  </P> <P> "I knew about the record, but I wasn't sure if I could get it tonight,"  Jorgensen said. "We'll see, with a couple of weeks of rest, whether I can get  her other marks."  </P> <P> Meagher also holds the American records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly  events.  </P> <P> UCLA added another championship by winning the 400-yard freestyle relay with a  time of 3:23.29. Stanford was second and USC third. All three teams qualified  for the NCAA championships to be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas.  </P> <P> For Stanford, the relay was merely icing on the cake. Stanford, the defending  national champion, is top-ranked this year, and after this weekend's  performances is in good position to repeat.  </P> <P> For UCLA and USC, the result of the relay was a great way to end the meet.  </P> <P> "We had a great Pac-10's," UCLA Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "The last relay  just topped it off."  </P> <P> At the Pac-10 diving championships, Jill Campbell of California won the  10-meter platform event, defeating Kristin Jensen of Stanford, 360.30-350.50,  at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC. Katie Connor of Stanford, who won the  one- and three-meter springboard championships, was third.  </P> <P> Brian Earley of USC won the men's 10-meter platform with 543.80 points. The  victory was Earley's second of the meet; he won the three-meter springboard  Saturday. Chris Dudka of UCLA finished second.  </P></p>

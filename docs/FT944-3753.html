			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Labour accuses ministers of short-termism over Northern Ireland economy Labour yesterday accused ministers of short-termism over the Northern Ireland economy and called for a degree of government input into private sector investment in the province, David Owen writes. Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow Northern Ireland secretary, said ahead of this week's international investment conference in Belfast that measures taken on the economy were crucial to the stability of the peace process. Voicing concern about the government's economic strategy in Ulster she warned that an important opportunity would be missed unless ministers thought 'strategically and long term' about economic regeneration and restructuring. Aid packages from Europe, the US and elsewhere were 'crucial pump-priming resources', she said. But co- ordination was vital to make sure that money was not just 'thrown at high-status projects which do not assist infrastructure growth'. She said public investment was bearing the brunt of cuts in the government's public spending plans for Northern Ireland, unveiled last week, which would result in a Pounds 75m real terms reduction in the budget by 1997-98.</p>

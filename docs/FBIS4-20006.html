			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Comit Board Named; Siglienti Not on </F> It"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Milan, April 23 -- Shareholders of IRI's  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] privatised Banca  Commerciale Italiana (Comit), meeting for the first time here  today, approved a new expanded board of 14 members largely  proposed by managing director Luigi Fausti, in which outgoing  chairman Sergio Siglienti was notable by his absence.    The new board is: Lionello Adler, Giancarlo Cerutti, Giacomo  D'Ali' Staiti, Diego Della Valle, Michel Francois Poncet, Albert  Frere, Gianfranco Gutty, Giuseppe Lucchini, Klaus Peschek, Axel  Von Rudorffer, Vincenzo Sozzani, Giuseppe Stefanel, Enrico  Beneduce, and Fausti. The board is expected to meet on Tuesday  [26 April] to appoint executives and confer powers.    Only two of the directors are re-appointments: Fausti and  Poncet, the representative of the big Milan-based bank's  historic and now major stockholder, Paribas. Beneduce, proposed  by Fausti and Siglienti, was promoted from central director.    Fausti said the predominance of new entries on the board,  representing some of the cream of European banking, was due to  the fact that "we will have to knock on their doors for the  money needed to make the bank grow" in a capital increase that  had already been aired by Siglienti.    The appointment of Albert Frere, chairman and CEO of the  Groupe Bruxelles-Lambert, was a surprise to some. Those of  Poncet, Peschek (from Austria's Creditanstalt) and Von Rudorffer  (Commerzbank of Germany) were less so. Most observers had also  expected the entry of D'Ali' Staiti, a Comit partner in the Bank  of Sicily. Hardly surprising, also, was the naming of a  representative of one of Comit's other historical partners,  Trieste-based insurance giant Generali, in its managing director  Gutty.    Then there are the industrial partners: Adler for Cartiere  Burgo, the paper-maker that raked together almost 11 percent of  Comit shares; Cerutti for engineering group Le Officine  Meccaniche Giancarlo Cerutti; Della Valle for the footwear group  of the same name; Giuseppe Lucchini, son of "steel king" Luigi;  Sozzani for the Pirelli tire and cable group, taking the place  of Leopoldo Pirelli; and Stefanel of the clothing group.    The 15 biggest shareholders present at the meeting (in  brackets, the ordinary shares held, also as a percentage of  total capital) were: Paribas Europe (30.9 million, 2.97  percent), Commerzbank AG (26.99 million, 2.59 percent),  Frere-Bourgeois SA (20 million, 1.92 percent), Assicurazioni  Generali (19.21 million, 1.84 percent), Creditanstalt (18.11  million, 1.74), Cartiere Burgo (10.7 million, 1.029), Ema Srl  (10.56 million, 1.01), Gemina Investments (10.39 million, 1),  Gefina (10.3 million, 0.99), Muenchener Rueckversicherung (10  million, 0.96), Lucchini (9.9 million, 0.95), Fondigest Fondo  Delta (6.39 million, 0.61), Sibad International (6.15 million,  0.59), and Cofilp Sim (5.93 million, 0.57).    Gefina is a company in the Generali group; Ema is rumoured  to  be controlled by Diego Della valle; Cofilp is a merchant bank of  the Banca Popolare Novara group. The referents of  Frere-Bourgeois, Muenchener and Sibad are unknown. [passage  omitted]</p>

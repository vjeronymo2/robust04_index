			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Crest will leave the private investor with crumbs only Sir, Kevin Goldstein-Jackson ('Diary of a private investor: Unanswered questions', April 30) details further problems with the proposed Crest share settlement system as far as the private investor is concerned. In this regard it is interesting to note that, buried in appendix III of the task force report is the fact that 67 per cent of bargains by volume are done by or for individuals accounting for 14 per cent by value. The private investor makes a considerable contribution to the functioning of the market. I can answer his question on what weight is given to views submitted to the Bank or Treasury - none. After corresponding with both august bodies over a period of four months it was the task force report which finally indicated why my representations were getting nowhere; Mr Iain Saville, who heads the Crest project at the Bank, was sticking strictly to the recommendations in the report and nothing was going to make him deviate from it. A long-shot letter I sent to Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, produced a reply on his bahalf which reiterated so many of the views expressed by the Bank that we are unlikely to get any redress from the Office of Fair Trading. I am afraid the private investor is going to have to accept the crumbs dropped from the table of the fat cats. The problem arises because Crest has been designed by and for the convenience of institutions; any so-called concessions to the private investor are a sop to divert criticism until Crest is introduced, when it will be too late to make any changes.

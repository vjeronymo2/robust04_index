			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Analysis" by Yang Shulin (2799 2885 2651): "Why the </F> United States and Britain Insist on Imposing Sanctions Against  Iraq"]    [Text] It has been learned that, the UN Security Council  is going to review the oil sales embargo on Iraq in the middle  of this month. On this issue, the United States and Britain do  not agree with countries such as France and Russia. The former  two are in favor of continuing the oil sales embargo, while the  latter maintain that, since the Iraqi Government is cooperating  with UN weapon inspectors and showing some progress in its  attitude, lifting the embargo should be considered.    The oil sales embargo on Iraq was an important part of the  overall sanctions against Iraq imposed by the UN Security  Council when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Oil is the  main source of Iraq's foreign exchange income and an important  underpinning of the national economy. Cutting off its oil sales  channels undoubtedly spells disaster to the recovery and  development of Iraq's national economy and its people's  livelihood.    To solve its predicament and break the blockade, Iraq has  repeatedly called for the Security Council to end the sanctions  and has adopted a positive, cooperative attitude in accepting  the United Nations' destruction of its long-range missiles and  chemical and biological weapons, as well as the organization's  long-term supervision of its ordnance production. Not long ago,  Iraqi culture and information minister Hammadi made a public  statement to the outside, saying that Iraq has long dropped its  territorial claim on Kuwait, and the Iraqi National Assembly has  also withdrawn its decision to annex Kuwait, which was approved  by Iraq's supreme power organ, the Revolutionary Command Council.    It was in the hope that the Security Council would end its  sanctions against Iraq at an early date that Iraq made those  efforts and took those positions. What is worth mentioning here  is that the Security Council initially also cited the  above-mentioned conditions, stating that, as long as Iraq could  meet those requirements in its behavior, it would lift the  sanctions. The relevant sources pointed out: The efforts Iraq  has made in the above-mentioned areas have reached and satisfied  the conditions set down by the Security Council at that time;  therefore, lifting the oil sales embargo should be considered  and Iraq should be released. France argues that the Security  Council must stand by the agreement. In other words, once  Baghdad has satisfied the requirements raised at that time, the  oil embargo should end. At present, the Iraqi side is launching  a new diplomatic offensive and is sending out important  officials in all directions to explain that Iraq's efforts have  met the requirement for scrapping the sanctions, thus putting  pressure on the Security Council.    But the United States and Britain have taken exception to  the  positions of France, Iraq, and other relevant parties. They  have ignored all dissenting views and have insisted on  continuing the oil embargo against Iraq, splitting opinion on  the matter. Some say that Iraq deserved the sanctions earlier  because it had invaded Kuwait and was in the wrong, but, now  that Iraq has admitted defeat and bowed to justice, if one again  made a futile effort to convince people with one's arguments or  was actually scheming about something else, it would indeed be  absurd. [sentence as published]    The Western media pointed out: The Americans want to use  sanctions to stop the Iraqi Government from persecuting the  Kurdish people and the southern Shiite Muslims in the country,  but the oil embargo resolution did not cover these issues. It  is common knowledge that the Kurdish and Shiite Muslim problem  is purely Iraq's internal affair.</p>

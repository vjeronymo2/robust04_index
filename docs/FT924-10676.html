			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Unita troops blockade Angola's second city TROOPS of the former rebel movement Unita blocked all entrances to Angola's second city Huambo yesterday and shelled the nearby town of Caala throughout the day, Portugal's TSF radio said, Reuter reports from Lisbon. Huambo airport was closed and local businesses shut down, the radio said in a report from the Angolan capital Luanda. Civilians in Huambo were looking for safe places in the event of possible fighting and some had gone to the airport in the hope of leaving the city, it said. Angolan state radio said the attack on Caala was part of a Unita attempt to lay siege to Huambo 12 miles away. The ruling MPLA (Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola) has accused Unita of massing troops in the interior and occupying several towns since last month's elections. Unita, led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, lost last month's UN-supervised general elections that were due to set the seal on a peace agreement last year ending 16 years of civil war. Talks between Unita and the MPLA to pave the way for a peace summit between Mr Savimbi and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos have reached an impasse.</p>

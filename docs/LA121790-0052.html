			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> MAYOR TAKES OVER DISASTER TEAM POST  </P> <P> Ojai Mayor Nina V. Shelley has replaced retired county Fire Capt. Ed Gutierrez  as head of the disaster committee for the Ojai Valley chapter of the American  Red Cross.  </P> <P> "There is no reason I cannot work with the Red Cross as a mayor," Shelley said.  </P> <P> "The duties of the disaster committee chair have more to do with making sure  the team is in a mode of readiness long before the disaster occurs."  </P> <P> The geography of the Ojai Valley, which isolated it from Ventura during the  1969 floods, is one reason that residents have maintained the only separate Red  Cross chapter in the county, Shelley said.  </P> <P> Its board of directors and volunteers work closely with the Ventura County  chapter, Shelley said.  </P> <P> Gutierrez, who headed the committee for 14 years, will continue to coordinate  emergency shelter operations and help families who lose their houses to such  disasters as fire, flood or earthquake.  </P> <P> A former captain in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve, Shelley served on the  Ojai chapter's board for three years while taking other emergency management  training. She recently spent 20 hours updating her first-aid skills.  </P> <P> Shelley was mayor during the 1985 fires that surrounded Ojai, caused mass  evacuations, the loss of houses and burned 119,000 acres of Los Padres National  Forest.  </P> <P> "The mayor's duties are not clearly defined. You're just expected to provide  leadership," she said. Her appointed mayoral post ends in April, but she will  remain on the Ojai City Council until her four-year term is up in 1994.

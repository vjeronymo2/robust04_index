			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] San Pedro Sula TIEMPO in Spanish on 10  March, page 5, reports that on 9 March after meeting with the  Honduran Exporters Association, Hugo Noe Pino, president of the  Central Bank of Honduras, said the reactivation of public  investment will decrease this year. Noe Pino said this will be a  difficult year for Hondurans because of the high fiscal deficit  left by the previous government. Noe Pino said it will also be  difficult because price freezes will be lifted and fluctuations  are expected in the exchange rate. Noe Pino added, however, that  the family basket tax will not increase. An tax increase on  luxury items is being analyzed, he noted.</p>

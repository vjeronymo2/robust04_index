			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SITTER SENTENCED TO PRISON IN DEATH OF INFANT  </P> <P> During an emotional hearing, baby sitter Vickie Maas was sentenced Monday to  eight years and eight months in prison for involuntary manslaughter in the  death of a 6-month-old baby and the abuse of two other infants.  </P> <P> Maas, 28, who had been calm and expressionless through most of the five-week  trial, buried her face in her hands and cried as San Fernando Superior Court  Judge Howard J. Schwab announced the sentence, the maximum for that crime.  </P> <P> "In all my years as a judge this is the most aggravated case of amorality that  I have ever seen," Schwab said. "This case will haunt me for the rest of my  life."  </P> <P> A San Fernando Superior Court jury found Maas guilty Dec. 16 of killing David  Allen Duncan, aged 6 months. David died Jan. 8, 1988, of brain injuries two  days after Maas had shaken him violently because he was crying.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Counts of Abuse  </P> <P> Maas was also found guilty of three counts of felony child abuse. One count was  related to David's death and the others to injuries received by 6-month-old  Travis Hoyt, whose ear was bruised in August, 1987, and 7-month-old Nicholas  McNerny, who suffered a broken leg in June, 1987.  </P> <P> The families of the three infants attended the sentencing. They wore buttons  with David Duncan's picture. Some broke into applause and embraced, while  others wept tears of joy after Schwab handed down the sentence.  </P> <P> "This is my birthday and this was the best present ever," said Karen Duncan,  David's mother.  </P> <P> "I feel that the judge really did the right thing by us and by society" said  Larry Duncan, David's father. "We can't bring David back, but it does relieve  some of the pain."  </P> <P> Maas' in-laws said the sentence was unnecessarily harsh. "I don't think the  maximum was correct at all," said Ronald Maas, Vickie Maas' father-in-law. "Two  wrongs don't make a right.  </P> <P> During sentencing, Larry H. Layton, Maas' attorney, called psychiatrist Hugh  Wilson Ridlehuber to testify about a neuropsychiatric impairment from which he  said Maas suffered.  </P> <P> Ridlehuber, who began treating Maas in March, concluded that she had a rare  neuropsychiatric ailment known as "intermittent explosive disorder." He said  the condition, caused by brain damage, led to periodic bouts of violent  behavior, similar to seizures.  </P> <P> "With stress, with particular types of stress, she can explode and react  violently," Ridlehuber said. He said loud noises often triggered the reactions,  noises such as a telephone ringing repeatedly and the sound of babies crying.  </P> <P> He said that after the explosive episodes, Maas could not remember details of  the incidents.  </P> <P> Ridlehuber also said that Maas had used marijuana and cocaine in an effort to  "self-medicate" her psychiatric condition.  </P> <P> "Her use of these drugs was an attempt to treat herself," Ridlehuber said. A  titter ran through the crowd of about 45 in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Schwab expressed doubts about the psychiatrist's assessment, saying specific  details in Maas' testimony about the shaking of David and the injuries of the  two other infants indicated she was lying.  </P> <P> "Her statements were inconsistent with physical evidence," Schwab said. Maas  testified that she shook David "gently."  </P></p>

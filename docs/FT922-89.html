			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Heavy hand exacerbates fundamentalist dissent: Arab leaders may be more wary of democratic consultation THE results of the first round of the Algerian elections at the end of last year added fuel to what had already been a politically explosive year in the Middle East. The Arab world, while adjusting to the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the consequences of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, saw in the Algerian election another threatening challenge to established political order in the region. Whatever organisation takes responsibility for the assassination of Mohamed Boudiaf, the rest of the Arab world will assume it is the work of Moslem fundamentalists. By cancelling the second round of voting in January, the Algerian government denied the Islamic Salvation Front victory, the Middle East of its second Islamic republic and, for many, set the path for violent confrontation between the military and the Moslem activists. Political assassinations in the Middle East need not provoke turmoil. When President Anwar Sadat of Egypt was murdered in October 1981 his enemies predicted an uprising. Not only did Egypt remain calm but Hosni Mubarak smoothly assumed power and to this day follows the broad foreign policy lines laid down by his predecessor. President Mubarak, who last year expressly warned the Algerian regime of the dangers of holding elections which could be manipulated by the opposition, will be in the forefront of those Arab leaders watching to see whether yesterday's assassination heralds the start of a wider attempt by Algerian religious extremists to confront the military-led government. Throughout the Middle East there have been lesser signs of extremist activity, accompanied by lurid warnings from a few Arab commentators who believe the US, robbed of communism as its main international enemy, is elevating Islam to take its place. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its subsequent defeat divided the Arab world more sharply than was then apparent. With the probable exception of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, the satisfaction derived from the setback to Saddam Hussein was more than offset by the suffering caused to the Iraqi people and the danger of further extremism being bred by Arab humiliation. There are always dangers of taking isolated Middle East events and drawing them into an ordered and ominous picture. There is no immediate linkage between recent murders carried out by Islamic extremists in Egypt, the increased militancy of right-wing religious police in Saudi Arabia and the challenge to the PLO by Hammas in the Arab territories occupied by Israel. But in each case a religious channel is being used to articulate real grievances or simple political ambition. Equally, yesterday's events in Algeria will be used by conservatives to block or delay even modest moves towards greater accountability in government and the introduction of political pluralism. The ruling al-Sabah family in Kuwait, tested by fundamentalists in the 1980s, is likely to be more than ever determined that its supporters win the October elections. The names of those who will serve on Saudi Arabia's new Consultative Council may not be known for some longer period. The confrontation in Algeria will, if anything, make more difficult the process of political evolution and make more probable the employment of Islamic fundamentalism as the most potent vehicle through which to exploit dissent.</p>

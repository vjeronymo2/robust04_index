			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / MEPC announces Pounds 221.9m rights issue MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday announced a Pounds 221.9m rights issue, bringing the total raised by property companies in the equity market this year to more than Pounds 1bn. The announcement, two weeks after MEPC's interim results, is likely to complete the recent round of fund raising by the UK's largest property companies. MEPC is taking advantage of a sharp increase in its share price, which will allow it to issue new shares without greatly diluting its assets. The shares have risen from 190p last September to close yesterday at 414p, down 8p on the day. The proceeds of the one-for-five rights issue, which is priced at 350p per share, will be partly used to refurbish and redevelop property within its portfolio. MEPC said the issue would also allow it to make selective property or corporate acquisitions as opportunities arose. The money will initially be put on deposit, which will reduce MEPC's gearing from about 80 per cent to 60 per cent. The rights issue was criticised by some City analysts yesterday for reducing the company's gearing at a time when property values were starting to improve. But Mr James Tuckey, managing director, denied that the rights issue was a degearing exercise. He said that the group's programme of disposals, which was partly designed to reduce borrowings, would proceed at a slower pace. MEPC has sold Pounds 159m of property since the end of the last financial year. Mr Tuckey said the decision to make the rights issues was taken after the Board became convinced market prospects were improving. The company said there was 'evidence beginning to emerge in certain areas of the UK of new demand from occupiers. This, coupled with evidence of institutions returning to invest in property, provides the potential for a return to growth.' The Co-operative Insurance Society, which owns 16.7 per cent of the company, is taking up its full entitlement, as are MEPC's directors. The balance has been underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The company predicted the dividend would be maintained at 14.75p (net) for the year to end-September. Lex, Page 20</p>

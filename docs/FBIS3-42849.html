Gutu, first vice president and general </F> director of the Union of Industrialists of the Republic of  Moldova, by Ya. Guryevich; place and date not given: "`I Remain  a Communist, But...'"]    [Text] His is the typical biography of a party  official who has traveled a long route from local Komsomol  officer to the highest pinnacles of power. The memorable August  of 1991 found him in the office of second secretary of the  Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee. Now I.T. Gutu is  first vice president and general director of the Union of  Industrialists of the Republic of Moldova with, as might have  been expected, his own vision of the social and political  situation in the republic, his own understanding of the problems  that have risen to confront it, and his own view of a way out of  the present situation.    This is the subject of our discussion.    [Guryevich] Does it not seem to you, Ivan Timofeyevich, that  we have today essentially been driven into a corner, from which  we can neither get things moving nor extricate ourselves?    [Gutu] If we consider the wholesale impoverishment of the  people, this is not a corner but a dead end, perhaps. But this  is what was to have been expected, it was this that was forecast  right from the start, when many decisions and legislative  instruments were adopted in forced manner, under pressure from  the street and the period of demonstrations, which led not to  the appeasement of society but to the even greater  destabilization of the situation.    [Guryevich] But new people, who declared themselves true  democrats and who knew well what the ordinary people needed,  came to power at that time....    [Gutu] There were not then nor are there with us now  democrats in the true sense, unfortunately. Even less can people  with extremely radical views be such. So we acquired, in fact, a  new elite, even more avid for power and uncompromisingly brazen,  inasmuch as it had emerged on the wave of national  self-awareness, and shamelessly bent on distributive functions  and the satisfaction of personal, primarily material, ambitions.  Apartments, country cottages, automobiles, overseas travel--I  shall not give examples, they are there for all to see.    [Guryevich] Well, we assume that the former authorities did  not short-change themselves in this respect either....    [Gutu] Had this been combined with constructive work, as  before, but everything moved in the entirely opposite direction.  What did Mircea Druc and his government do? What in practice  could they have done? They drove away the skilled personnel,  destroyed the machinery of state, and engendered an atmosphere  of violence, lawlessness, national discord, and intolerance in a  formerly peaceful and materially prosperous republic. Not only  did they not do anything of substance, they were even powerless  to offer some in any way constructive program.    [Guryevich] Yes, but the acquisition of sovereignty and  independence and recognition in the United Nations and the CSCE  and entry into the world community come from that same period....    [Gutu] Of course, these were necessary and very important  stages of the formation of the young state. The exchange of  embassies and delegations, treaties.... But real recognition  comes only via internal stability and the material well-being of  society. But we have neither stability nor well-being but, in  addition, the unresolved problems of the South and the eastern  regions.... We still do not know, incidentally, the true  inspiration behind both the memorable campaign against the  South, when bloodshed was avoided only by a miracle, and the  Bendery tragedy, which cost us hundreds of human lives,  thousands of devastated futures, and many billions of rubles of  material damage. We are all still making do with a half-truth....    [Guryevich] You believe, Ivan Timofeyevich, that the new  governing elite had, aside from elements of populism and  political intriguing, nothing to its name? And that our main  scourge today is the absence of professional know-how and  management skills and incompetence?    [Gutu] If we are speaking of the first governments,  undoubtedly. The material base, which had been created over  decades, was thoroughly undermined, and highly professional,  technically equipped industrial outfits partly broke up and  partly switched to semi-crafts production (if only to  survive!)--and not only in "defense" either: machine building,  instrument making, and electronics, without which we could, at  the very least, still hold on somehow--but also in the  traditional sectors of vital importance to us--light, food,  processing. And if today some enterprises are still managing to  stay afloat, it is only thanks to the inconceivable doggedness  and self-sacrifice of the corps of directors.    [Guryevich] I have to agree, nonetheless--not in defense of  the present rulers but solely from an aspiration to  objectivity--were the previous authorities more competent?    [Gutu] Without a doubt!    [Guryevich] What, then, about the Ribnita metallurgical  giant, which had still been deprived of a raw material base even  then? And the Pamyat Ilichu Interkolkhoz Nursery, the "biggest  in Europe"--whereas the vegetable repositories and processing  industry were incapable of accepting even one-half of the  produce cultivated there? And the triumphal laying, to victory  fanfares, of the canal from Lake Yalpug, into which billions had  been poured and which, upon inspection, resulted in an  environmental catastrophe? Not to mention the dozens of not so  costly but no less odious construction projects, in the capital  included.    [Gutu] It is more appropriate to speak here not of the  degree  of competence but, rather, of the volitional methods of  leadership--after all, scientific potential was always enlisted  in the preliminary consultations....    [Guryevich] But it was, ultimately, one person who  decided....    [Gutu] Voluntarism, as a style of leadership, was condemned  by the party itself....    [Guryevich] Following the ouster or death of the latest  leader? So even then there was not at the time of decisionmaking  a whiff of democracy even?    [Gutu] Nonetheless, compare if only the authorities with  which the cities and districts of the republic were endowed at  that time and today's essentially total anarchy of the official  structures. Is this not the reason also to some extent for the  troubles that have come crashing down on our capital--the  menacing state of the engineering utilities, health care, urban  mass transit.... Decrees were adopted twice formerly at the top  level, in the CPSU Central Committee, on the development of  Chisinau, and they were implemented. But whose business of  anyone's is this now? Who would venture to forecast what awaits  the capital's 700,000-strong population in the near future? So I  would not censure our past indiscriminately--what was positive  and constructive in it was not that insignificant. Now, on the  other hand, privatization has been mounted at a forced pace, and  this will, in my view, produce no appreciable improvement in  people's lives. This can already be seen clearly in the example  of services.    [Guryevich] Should this be understood to mean, Ivan  Timofeyevich, that you are opposed to radical reforms in the  economy altogether?    [Gutu] Nothing of the sort, I am opposed to certain methods  and their forced implementation. I am profoundly convinced that  small business cannot occupy the predominant place in the  economy and that the fate of the latter is decided by  large-scale enterprises. Even to take a look at foreign  experience, we would be better suited by the Chinese  method--state regulation with elements of a market economy....    [Guryevich] With the guiding and directing role of the  Communist Party?...    [Gutu] At least they have managed to feed more than 1  billion  people and raise national income immeasurably. And on this path  we could, if not achieve the former level, in the next two or  three years at least approach it and stabilize the situation.  For this it is essential, first, that the economy cease to be a  hostage to policy, second, to restore the broken economic ties  to the countries of the CIS, and, third, determine precisely  what kind of industry and what kind of products we need for the  foreign market, and what kind, for domestic consumption.    [Guryevich] Well, the Union of Industrialists holds the  cards, as they say....    [Gutu] Our union does not possess power functions, it can  only offer its vision of the present situation and its forecasts  for the future and the corresponding recommendations. Which,  generally, is what we have been doing since the recent  conference of the union. Specifically, we believe that the state  should display initiative in the organizational restructuring of  industry and provide for the elaboration and realization of  sector-by-sector outlines and industrial joint labor in  multilateral cooperation with Romania, Ukraine, Russia, and  other countries of the CIS and Europe. We, on the other hand,  are prepared to help the government in the realization of our  proposals.    [Guryevich] And?    [Gutu] I would like to hope that the new government will  give  this and our other recommendations due attention.    [Guryevich] But if blame for the severance of economic  relations could be imputed to the former government, this cannot  be said about the present one. Or, come to that, about the  president, who signed the documents on entry into the CIS, on  the formation of the economic space, and so forth. So where does  the problem lie?    [Gutu] Yes, they should be given their due for this. But  many  questions remain, and, it seems to me, it would be highly  appropriate for the deputies, who are intending once again to  run for the new parliament, to address them now, in the election  campaign. And not only in economics. It would not be  inappropriate, I believe, for the new parliament to also  reconsider certain previous legislative instruments--on the  national anthem and so forth, in particular.    [Guryevich] Well, it remains to be hoped that the new  parliament and the new government will prove receptive to a  mutual exchange of ideas and be more decisive in the pursuit of  a balanced policy.    [Gutu] That's what I say: Much will depend on who sits in  the  old chairs. The abundance of parties and movements with similar  programs and the like ambitions of their leaders could seriously  disorient the electorate.    [Guryevich] Have you remained in the Communist Party?    [Gutu] I was and remain a Communist. But in a renewed party  which, together with the modified name (it is now the Party of  Communists of Moldova), is also jettisoning certain tenets of  Marxism-Leninism and adopting new, approved methods of political  activity.    [Guryevich] Frankly, it had always seemed to me that by no  means a secondary role had been made ready for you also in the  new elite which came to power at the end of the 1980's. But two  "gaffes," which in the thinking of the "true democrats" damaged  your image somewhat, made themselves felt, evidently. I refer to  the summer of 1990, when you, together with the entire party  upper stratum, appeared at the Zelenyy Theater before a  thousands-strong meeting. Although, incidentally, as mayor of  the capital, not a party functionary at that time, you could  have diplomatically declined. As did Nicolae Tau, while even  first secretary of the capital's city party committee in those  days....    [Gutu] It was impossible for me to decline for one reason:  It  was I who had the whole time been stirring up the republic's  party leadership, calling on it to show up at the  demonstrations, enter into a dialogue with people, and explain  its position, not sit it out in offices.    [Guryevich] Very well, the second "gaffe"--the office of  secretary of the Communist Party of Moldova Central Committee,  when the party's affairs were already on very shaky ground?    [Gutu] Not long before that the decision had been made in  Moscow that the republic's party organization would be headed by  P.K. Lucinschi. It was only by keeping this in mind that I  agreed: I had known Lucinschi a long time and believed that in a  team with him something could still be done....    [Guryevich] Now, apparently, there is a Communist Party once  again, only renewed.... But this party will not take part in the  parliamentary elections inasmuch as it was not in time to  register before the start of the campaign. So you will,  consequently, have to call on your supporters to vote for the  slates of other parties, will you not?    [Gutu] Yes, ahead of us are a congress and the formulation  and adoption of a program and only then involvement in assertive  political activity. Meanwhile, we will, indeed, support other  parties at the elections--those that advocate a strengthening of  Moldova's independence and sovereignty, an immediate  normalization of the situation in the South and in the eastern  regions, the ratification of all economic agreements within the  framework of the CIS and the conclusion of beneficial bilateral  treaties with these countries, national referenda on problems  that are fateful for the state and, most important, an increase  in our people's prosperity.    [Guryevich] And what parties are these?    [Gutu] Not all have made their election platforms public as  yet. But judging by what is already known about their intentions  and final goals, they are the Agrarian-Democratic and Socialist  Parties.    [Guryevich] And are you not embarrassed by the fact that the  platform of the Socialist Party, say, is once again interspersed  with certain decrepit ideological myths--like free housing and  low rent and free education and health care--although even the  youngest schoolboys now know that there is in fact nothing that  is or can be free, that the resources for the so-called  "freeness," and considerable ones at that, were shamelessly  taken from the working people themselves....    [Gutu] Yes, some of the wording is, truly, embarrassing. But  the right to free housing, education, and health care for a  particular section of the needy population should, indeed, be  guaranteed by the state.    [Guryevich] Our interview is coming to an end, and I will,  therefore, ask you a question that is by no means new but highly  popular in such situations: If you could begin everything all  over again....    [Gutu] I regret nothing, and nothing in my life inspires in  me feelings of awkwardness or shame.</p>

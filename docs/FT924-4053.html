			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / World Trade News: EC near oilseeds accords with small exporters THE EC hopes to reach accords on oilseeds with nine smaller exporting countries by mid-December, following settlement of its dispute with the US last month, officials said yesterday. The move, announced at the annual meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva, was welcomed by the countries involved. The US estimates that the nine, which include Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Poland and Pakistan, may have lost trade worth Dollars 1bn (Pounds 658m) a year because of the EC's oilseeds subsidy regime, in addition to the Dollars 1bn lost by American farmers. Negotiations under Gatt auspices were broken off last September when the US and others rejected as inadequate EC offers of compensation for trade losses. The US/EC deal, the legal details of which have yet to be settled, according to US officials, does not directly cover other oilseeds suppliers. Meanwhile, trade officials from the 108 countries taking part in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks are gearing up for an intensive schedule of bilateral and multilateral meetings designed to produce a final package of agreements by the end of the year. There is a widespread belief that Japan and South Korea will not hold out against liberalisation of rice imports, which could otherwise prove a big stumbling block now that the US and EC have largely settled their farm trade differences. European suggestions that US 'section 301' legislation for unilateral trade action could provoke a confrontation were yesterday played down. 'We are willing to enter into an agreement that would commit us all to an effective and binding set of multilateral rules with multilateral enforcement,' said Mr Rufus Yerxa, US Gatt ambassador. Mr Andras Szepesi, Hungary's Gatt ambassador, is to be chairman of Gatt's governing council next year, the first official from a former Communist country to hold such an influential position in Gatt.</p>

			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Write-downsat ADT and Attwoods hit Laidlaw LAIDLAW, the North American waste services and transport operator, has cleared the way for the disposal or rationalisation of its interests in ADT, the international security and vehicle auction group, and Attwoods, the UK-based waste services company. The group has sharply written down the carrying value of its investments in the two companies. The write-down of the 24 per cent stake in ADT and the 35 per cent interest in Attwoods totalled USDollars 243.8m (Pounds 161.4m). Laidlaw is the largest single shareholder in both companies. The moves were part of a house-cleaning exercise which appears to signal a more active role in Laidlaw's affairs by its Montreal-based controlling shareholder, Canadian Pacific. Laidlaw also named Mr Jim Bullock as chief executive to replace Mr Donald Jackson, who was asked to resign last week. Mr Bullock was formerly president of Cadillac Fairview, a large Toronto-based property developer. The write-downs pushed Laidlaw to a loss of USDollars 334.9m, or Dollars 1.21 a share, in the fourth quarter to August 31, compared with net income of Dollars 24.9m, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose 10 per cent to Dollars 467.5m but income from continuing operations dipped to Dollars 3.9m from Dollars 24.9m. Laidlaw also set aside Dollars 105m to cover closures, delays and falling values at several landfill and hazardous waste facilities in the US and Canada.

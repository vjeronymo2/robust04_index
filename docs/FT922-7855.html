			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / GrandMet 7% rise exceeds forecasts GRAND Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, topped market forecasts with a 7 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 402m. The result was helped by a Pounds 12m bonus from favourable exchange rates - but trading profits from continuing businesses in the six months to the end of March grew 11 per cent in sterling terms and 6 per cent in local currencies. Earnings per share rose 5.6 per cent to 13.3p. The interim dividend is raised 9.5 per cent to 4.6p. GrandMet's share price responded with a gain of 7p to close at 499p. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, who predicted three months ago that first-half profits would be in line with last year's Pounds 377m, said: 'Trading conditions in our major markets continue to be testing.' Recovery had begun in the US and there were signs of improvement in the UK, he said. Analysts are forecasting full-year profits of about Pounds 1.04bn. GrandMet's drinks division, IDV, contributed 54 per cent of the group's Pounds 437m trading profits. IDV brands achieved an 18 per cent growth in profits to Pounds 235m on turnover of Pounds 1.4bn, up from Pounds 1.17bn. In spite of contraction in the North American market, IDV profits rose 14.3 per cent in dollar terms and 24.2 per cent in sterling to Pounds 77m. Profits in Europe and the rest of the world were up 15.3 per cent at Pounds 158m. The group's food businesses recorded a Pounds 4m increase in trading profits to Pounds 141m on turnover of Dollars 1.56bn, up from Pounds 1.45bn. Profits of Pounds 120m from the North American operations rose 2.4 per cent in dollar terms; but European earnings dipped from Pounds 29m to Pounds 21m after large expansion costs in building the Haagen-Dazs, Pillsbury and Brossard brands. Trading profits at Burger King rose 13 per cent in local currency terms to Pounds 48m on the back of increased sales and improved margins. However, losses at the Pearle eye-care stores rose from Pounds 5m to Pounds 13m. Profits from the group's managed pubs and property business rose Pounds 4m to Pounds 26m but there was a loss of Pounds 7m on IEL, the GrandMet/Courage pubs joint venture. There was an extraordinary profit of Pounds 139m from the sale of the Express businesses in the UK and Ireland. Lex, Page 20</p>

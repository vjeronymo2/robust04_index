			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Airplane jacking is achieved by either lifting on the airframe or on the landing gear. In some instances, the airplane has either slipped off the jacks or been blown off during gusty wind conditions. Also, some transport category airplanes have tie-down provisions to restrain the airplane during high wind conditions. Damage to primary structure could result if the tie-down provisions were not designed to withstand likely wind gusts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most manufacturers of transport category airplanes provide information and instructions concerning jacking operations in addition to providing appropriate jacking points on the airplane. However, currently there is no requirement in the airworthiness standards for transport category airplane designs to account for jacking or tie-down loads. In the absence of specific standards, some manufacturers have used jacking and tie-down criteria contained in military specifications to design the airframe and landing gear of commercial transport category airplanes. Others, primarily the manufacturers of smaller transport category airplanes, have requested design criteria for jacking and tie-down loads. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FAA is not aware of any existing airplanes that are inadequately designed with respect to jacking and tie-down provisions, it is conceivable that an airplane with inadequately designed jacking and tie-down provisions may be certificated in the absence of specific regulatory requirements. Structural damage at the jacking or tie-down points could pose an immediate hazard while the airplane is on the ground. Even if an airplane does not fall off the jacks, there is the possibility that damage to primary structure could occur from the static loads applied at inadequately designed jacking points. In addition, there is a danger that the damage could remain undetected and lead to a catastrophic structural failure during a subsequent flight. Undetected damage from inadequately designed tie-down provisions poses a similar hazard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These concerns resulted in Notice 90&hyph;3 in which the FAA proposed to require transport category airplanes to have suitable provisions for jacking. In essence, standards consistent with current industry practice were proposed to provide protection of primary airplane structure from loads imposed during probable jacking conditions. As there is no requirement for tie-down provisions, the FAA also proposed to adopt standards to provide protection of primary airplane structure in the event such provisions are provided. This standard is also consistent with current industry practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been given an opportunity to participate in this rulemaking and due consideration has been given to all matters presented. Comments received in response to Notice 90&hyph;3 are discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed standards are based on established military and commercial airplane standards and on current industry practice and therefore received general support from all commenters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The European Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) suggest the requirements of JAR 25.519 (Joint Airworthiness Requirements) be adopted as &sect;25.519 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), offering as justification the favorable service history associated with the JAR. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JAR standards differ from the proposals in Notice 90&hyph;3 in that the load factors used in establishing the vertical and horizontal jacking forces are slightly less. The wind force used to establish the tie-down loads is also slightly less. Although the JAR standard is less conservative than the proposed FAR standard, there is sufficient satisfactory service experience based on the requirements of JAR 25.519 to justify its adoption as the basis for the FAR standard. Additionally, some clarifying changes from the current JAR standard are made in order to define clearly the structures to which the jacking load factors apply. The word ``surrounding'' is changed to ``local'' to differentiate between local structure and the entire airplane structure. Also, since the maximum design weight, in this case, is the maximum ramp weight, the rule is revised to avoid any confusion over the weight to use in analyzing the support structure. These minor changes in the final rule will more fully harmonize the FAR and JAR requirements. The JAA also suggests that the introduction of jacking requirements in &sect;25.513 of the FAR, which corresponds with requirements in JAR 25.519, could cause confusion. The FAA agrees, and for consistency with the JAR, the jacking requirement has been moved from proposed &sect;25.513 of the FAR to &sect;25.519. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommends that consideration be given to incorporating a design requirement to improve the airplane's ability to maintain contact with the jack head. The FAA has determined that the high side load requirements for the jack fittings achieves this objective and should provide ample protection against an airplane slipping off the jacks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter recommends the development of standards requiring the use of jacks when working on aircraft with known landing gear problems. The commenter cites an instance in which an airplane that had made a gear up landing was parked with the gear down in an unrepaired condition. Two pilots, while inspecting the airplane for damage, were crushed when the gear collapsed. The FAA considers the concern expressed by the commenter to relate to maintenance or salvage procedures. Since such procedures are not the subject of certification requirements, they are beyond the scope of the notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One operator suggests that the regulation include a requirement for the manufacturer to provide specific jacking requirements in the Structural Repair Manual and the Maintenance Manual, and that these requirements include specific loads at each jack pad for various empty weights and center of gravity locations. The manufacturers generally do provide jacking instructions, including jack pad load limits, in the maintenance and structural repair manuals which are approved as part of the overall maintenance program. While the FAA does not consider it necessary to mandate where the manufacturer places this information, the final rule has been revised to require that load limit information must be provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

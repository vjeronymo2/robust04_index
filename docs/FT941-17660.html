			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities There was undoubtedly a lot of froth behind the FT-SE 100's 50 point rise on Wednesday - as is shown by its virtual evaporation in the subsequent two trading days of a holiday-shortened week. That lends weight to the view that the market's run-up in the closing weeks of the year was fuelled by stock shortages and squeezes related to the expiry of futures contracts and options. If so, one must be wary of expecting too much by way of a new year rally. The market may have derived some satisfaction from the still anecdotal evidence of a reasonably strong Christmas in the shops. Then again, the better the economic news, the less reason to expect an interest rate cut early this year, something which the market has hitherto been assuming. Indeed, the government's natural temptation may be to defer any rate cut until its tax increases start to bite in the spring. The chance that rate cuts in Europe followed by a rise in sterling might force the government's hand must still be regarded as an outside one while the recovery remains on track. So is the possibility that the authorities may decide to smooth inflation by allowing a rate cut before annual mortgage rate reviews at the end of this month. Uncertainty over timing may cause the equity market to pause for breath, but it should not undermine the basically positive trend. While rate cuts are on the agenda over the next few months, the flow of retail funds into the equity market should continue - and the new highs reached by Hong Kong are a reminder that international liquidity flows remain as strong as ever. Wednesday's record FT-SE close of 3,462 may not hold for long.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Sophie Huet report: "Joint RPR-UDF Platform"] </F>   [Text] The RPR [Rally for the Republic] and UDF [Union for  French Democracy] delegations which met again briefly yesterday  afternoon at RPR headquarters in rue de Lille, in the presence  of Jacques Chirac and Valery Giscard d'Estaing, put the  finishing touches to the negotiations on the drafting of a joint  majority "European plan." As expected, during this final  meeting the two parties' delegations agreed on a document of  around 20 pages which will be published today after the meeting  of the UDF political office followed by an extraordinary meeting  of the RPR political office.    "We have reached agreement on a document which will  constitute the joint UDF-RPR platform in the European  elections," RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe said, expressing  the view that this is an "extremely positive step." Stressing  the significance of this "responsible approach," UDF Secretary  General Francois Bayrou added: "We have chosen not to compete  with each other on the European plan" and to find an agreement  on "the slight differences between our two parties." This  document, which is "pragmatic" according to Pierre Lellouche  (RPR) and which deals with many subjects (the expansion of the  Community, the institutions, the Economic and Monetary Union,  unemployment, defense), advocates "a Europe which is stronger in  its political decisions," UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin  explained. Only by reading the document will we know what  concessions each party has made with a view to this agreement,  whose significance is primarily political. At all events, the  pleased expressions on the faces of the various negotiators  prove that everybody is satisfied by it.    Alain Juppe stressed that all the right conditions had now  been established for "the joint RPR-UDF list to be drawn up."  "We have the same concept of Europe," the RPR secretary general  said, and "we have pledged to sit in the same group in the  European Parliament." That leaves the question of who will head  the list, which has still not been decided, although  Jean-Francois Deniau, currently the big favorite, was at rue de  Lille yesterday, as was Dominique Baudis, another standard  bearer of the European cause.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] As of 1 June the most-favored-nation trading status  between Russian and Latvia comes into force. The Latvian  foreign ministry press center reported today that a note  received Monday from the Russian foreign ministry expresses the  hope that in the near future Latvia will ratify agreements  regulating the withdrawal of the Russian army from Latvia, as  well as the social guarantees for Russian military pensioners  and their family members. The assigning of most favored trading  status means that each country will refrain from imposing  unequal conditions on its trading partner with respect to import  and export customs duties, as well as regulations affecting the  imposition of duty on goods, transit, and other regulations  connected with foreign trading relations.    The mutual exchange of goods by the two states will be  increased, effective since 15 March this year, when the Russian  government set a range of higher import tariffs on goods, as  export to Russia has become unprofitable for Latvia. At present  Russia is still Latvia's biggest trading partner. Goods  manufactured in Latvia and exported to Russia account for about  thirty percent of the total volume of Latvia's exports. Latvia  is the first Baltic country to actually attain  most-favored-trading status with Russia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Also in 1993, the Farm Credit Banks' Presidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Planning Committee (PPC) authorized an initiative to review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA regulations and make recommendations concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those that the System believes are not directly related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and soundness or unduly restrict the full exercise of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities granted by the Act. This initiative produced a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System work group on related services (PPC work group) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included representatives from associations and banks in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AgriBank, Baltimore, Columbia, Springfield, and Western Farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Credit Districts. In July 1993, FCA met with the PPC work  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group to hear its concerns and objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PPC work group completed its study on November 2,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, and provided the results to the FCA Board for its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration in this proposed rule. The study recommended:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Elimination of existing prior approval requirements;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) revision of coordination requirements to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased flexibility in providing intra- and inter-district  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) revision of the requirement for bank annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of service programs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) increased flexibility in how  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks and associations administer related service programs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) various technical and clarifying changes in subparts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A and B.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On April 4, 1994, the FCA received a ``Petition for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking to Revise 12 CFR part 618_subpart A, Concerning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financially Related Services'' (hereinafter referred to as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``FRS petition''), submitted by a Washington, D.C., law firm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on behalf of one agricultural credit association (ACA),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three Federal land credit associations (FLCAs) and five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production credit associations (PCAs) in California and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Michigan. The petitioners supported the PPC work group's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations, but suggested that, in light of the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board's February 17, 1994 Policy Statement on Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Philosophy (59 FR 32189), the FCA should consider a broader  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking proceeding and more fundamental changes in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation than may have originally been contemplated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petitioners focused on areas where expanded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities could be considered and requested that the FCA:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Define related services (although no definition was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) authorize the offering of other services for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a fee; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) provide for a non-exclusive list of approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) eliminate the prior approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) eliminate the annual bank review of related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service programs; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) encourage innovative means for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering related services that meet borrower needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On May 4, 1994, the FCA received a petition from an ACA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Michigan (hereinafter referred to as ``Insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petition'') asking the FCA to reconsider the requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Member Insurance regulations (subpart B) that insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only be sold to members who have a debtor/creditor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above petitions and System input,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over the past 18 months the FCA has received prior approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests and technical/interpretive questions that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raised issues regarding what types of services are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized, what types of institutions can offer services,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and who the recipients of these services can be. Issues  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included questions about incidental authorities, sale of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance out-of-territory, and sale of fee appraisals other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than directly to members or borrowers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Regulatory Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> System institutions desire greater flexibility to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their statutory authority for providing related services in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order to serve the evolving needs of farmers and ranchers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and to meet competitive pressures. Although the FCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understands the System's desire to expand current related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service activities, the agency's primary concerns continue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to focus on safety and soundness issues and whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> System remains within the limits of current statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Underlying these proposed regulations, is FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that, under most circumstances, it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate to replace the current prior approval  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement with specific criteria for determining what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services can be offered and under what circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the FCA, in its role as a safety and soundness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulator, wishes to reserve the right to review new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in order to ensure that they would not present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive risk to the System. Because it is difficult to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foresee what types of new services will be proposed, it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impracticable to prescribe specific regulations for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services that have yet to be offered by the System. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA, therefore, proposes to remove as much of the regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden as possible, while maintaining its ability to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statute, achieve regulatory objectives, and preserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility. The FCA has also reduced the role the funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bank is required, by regulation, to play in overseeing such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. This allows the institution offering a service to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> take the primary responsibility for the related services it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed regulation in part 618 defines terms and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes specific authorizing criteria so that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution can evaluate the services it would like to offer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its customers. Thus, the proposed regulation clarifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FCA's primary safety and soundness concerns and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguishes between the types of services that can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offered and the programs for delivering these services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subpart A has been rewritten and reorganized because of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wholesale nature of the regulatory changes proposed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA. In proposed &sect;618.8000, the FCA sets forth a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``related service'' which includes insurance and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encompasses activities previously referred to as technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance, financial assistance, or financially related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The proposed regulation also details regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility requirements for recipients of such services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / UK Company News: LUI offshoot wound up as financial support ends HS WEAVERS (Underwriting) Agencies, the insurance agency which is part of London United Investments in administration, was yesterday wound up on the instructions of Mr Roger Borley, the remaining director. Mr Ray Hocking, a partner with Stoy Hayward, has been appointed to manage a creditors' voluntary liquidation on behalf of the company. The decision was taken after Walbrook, another subsidiary of LUI, entered provisional liquidation earlier this month. Walbrook was a significant creditor of Weavers, and provided it with limited financial support. Its winding up made it impossible for Weavers to continue operating. Mr Hocking said he expected to present a full report on the history of the company and its financial position to a meeting of creditors on August 24. He said it was inevitable that litigation would ensue between Weavers and Walbrook, other LUI subsidiaries and third parties, including other creditors.</p>

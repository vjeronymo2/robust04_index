			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Tropical storm disrupts Geest's banana supplies Banana supplies to Geest, whose shares fell sharply early in the year following disease on its Costa Rican plantations, have been hit by a tropical storm in the Windward Islands. Shares in the group fell 30p to 211p, almost half the year's high of 375p. Tropical Storm Debbie hit the islands a week ago, causing extensive flooding around St Lucia and damage to roads and bridges. Geest, which is under contract to ship all the islands' bananas, estimates that output will be 40 per cent down. It expects to load only 2,400 tonnes a week, compared with a normal load of 4,000 tonnes. The islands, which usually provide more than half the group's total banana volume, are not expected to return to full production until the end of next year. The EC's Banana Management Committee, which meets next Wednesday, will consider how the disaster should be treated under the banana import regime. Mr David Sugden, Geest's chief executive, said the group was lobbying the European Commission to allow it to buy bananas from other sources to make up the shortfall, and import them into the UK at the same tariff. He attacked the political uncertainty still surrounding the regime, as it is unclear whether the commission has the power to determine the tariff on alternative supplies. 'It is a nonsense that, a year into the regime, we are sitting here in this position because of an incident that was eminently foreseeable.' He is expecting some support from the French as the banana industry in Martinique also suffered from the storm. Geest will announce its interim results next Thursday. The City is expecting about Pounds 12m, against Pounds 3.5m, following improved banana prices.</p>

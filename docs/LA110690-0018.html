			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> IN THEIR INTEREST  </P> <P> Many minorities are unfamiliar and sometimes uncomfortable with the cultural  values and norms of corporations -- and few are given the opportunity to learn  and adjust. Traditional methods that corporations use to find, recruit and  prepare people for management will not be adequate considering the changing  demographics of the work force.  </P> <P> It's imperative, therefore, that corporations supplement current training and  recruiting methods.  </P> <P> It behooves companies to act early and hire promising minority high school  seniors and college students for summer positions. It's an opportunity to groom  them for future full-time employment. It's also an opportunity to introduce  them to the corporate culture -- an environment that must be understood if one  is to become a leader.  </P> <P> It's incumbent on companies to make investments in people now. It's a matter of  self-interest.  </P></p>

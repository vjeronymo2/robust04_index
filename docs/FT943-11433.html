			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Rise in expenditure approved The Japanese cabinet yesterday approved a 3.8 per cent increase in public expenditure ceilings for the 1995-96 fiscal year, the first rise for three years. The initial plan for 1995-96, published earlier this year, proposed a cut in the ceilings. However, the revised plan represents an increase of 4.8 per cent over the initial plan. General operating expenditures - the core budget, excluding debt service costs and grants to local government - are to total Y42,820bn (Pounds 284bn). Special factors, such as costs related to next year's upper house elections and the national census, will account for much of the increase. But the new coalition government of Social Democrat, Liberal Democrat and centrist Sakigake parties agreed to allow investment-related spending to rise by 5 per cent to stimulate the fragile economy. Current spending is to be cut by up to 10 per cent. The principal feature of the budget allocations is a new Y300bn special investment fund to allow the government to target priority areas such as farming assistance and telecom systems. The tightest financial squeeze will be at the defence agency. Defence spending requests are to be held to an increase of just 0.9 per cent, the smallest rise since ceilings were imposed in 1961. Other figures yesterday showed the government deficit in 1993-94 was Y566.3bn, the second consecutive annual deficit. The figure is expected to increase sharply this year as substantial income tax cuts take effect, increasing pressure on the government to reach agreement on a consumption tax rise.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Arts: The angels who fell to earth - Cinema Angels fly about the air in Faraway, So Close, Wim Wenders' 'sequel' to Wings Of Desire, seeking landing strips on a troubled Earth. Beguiling and maddening in equal measure, this film about a state of crisis in modern Europe embodies the state of crisis in modern European cinema. Where can those angels we call movie-makers - messengers from one zone of wisdom to another - land in the new chaos of dissolving cultures? And how do you achieve touchdown when air traffic control is run from the Tower of Babel? Tremble at the mixed-nation cast. Germany's Otto Sander and Bruno Ganz play the volunteer 'fallen' angels who try to help the lives and loves of post-unification Berliners. Russia's Mikhail Gorbachev guests through as himself, musing about peace, political harmony and the 'sense of existence.' And from America Peter Falk and singer Lou Reed play themselves while Willem Dafoe snarls suavely as a symbolic Mephistopheles figure called Emit Flesti (spell it backwards). When Icarus, mythology's most famous 'angel', flew too near the sun he burned his wings and fell to earth in a Brueghel painting. Much the same is happening today to Wenders. With this film following Until The End Of The World, Germany's finest living director strives to soar but instead tends to achieve a series of bizarre, offshore splashdowns. Faraway, So Close starts with intimations of mortality and ends with imitations of Alastair McLean. We begin with angel Otto Sander taking human form to help the needy in conflict-ridden Berlin: where the Wall's fall has unified a polis but not a people. Then the film marches on towards its jaw-droppingly dotty last act. A raid on an arms vault by an army of trapeze artists; a hi-jacked barge; a mid-air shoot-out; and dear Horst (The Magnificent Seven) Buchholz brought out of seclusion to play chief baddie. Two-and-a-half hours is a long time in European movie-watching. We have metaphysical warblings about time and memory. We have a swell of subplots touching on motherhood, bereavement, Nazi guilt. And via Reed and Falk, we have Wenders re-airing his love-hate feelings about American pop culture. The movie's aim is to be a massive fable about detente. But what is its effect? With all this multi-thematic flying about, the characters seem less like angels in action, more like bees dementedly sipping at every pollen source in the geo-cultural garden. Next time round, the director of Alice In The Cities, Kings Of The Road and Paris, Texas should surely give us once more a film in which we feel the terra firma of a unified theme and story and a set of believable, terrestrial people. But summer madness is hitting everyone. Like Wenders, Spain's Pedro Almodovar has fallen in love with his own repertory troupe - and repertory tropes. Kika is another tale of sex, murder and runaway production design from the director of High Heels and Women On The Verge Of A Nervous Breakdown. Lollipop colours scream from the walls as the well-known divas flit through the excuse for a plot. Victoria Abril is the camera-helmeted, Gaultier-dressed reporter from a TV true crimes show; Rossy De Palma is the lesbian maid; and Veronique Forque is the freelance scatterbrain who undergoes the marathon rape scene which is this film's claim to notoriety. (Every Almodovar movie must have one.) Newcomer Peter Coyote looks confused as the hero, an American writer dubbed into Spanish. But then what chance does any fresh acting face have in the oeuvre of a man whose work has come to resemble one long blood-and-sperm-spattered fashion show? No need to look for the guilty person in any of these plots. The director did it, aided by his designers. For a superior example of New Spanish Cinema, try Bigas Luna's Golden Balls. This too has a sex scene every five minutes; this too is shot as if by a contortionist with a craze for primary colours. But unlike Luna's last film, the inchoate hymn to machismo Jamon Jamon, this movie is choate and even anti-macho. A young man (Javier Bardem) longs to build tall buildings, to match his vaunting virility. But in a tale of funny, fateful symbolic eclat  -watch out for the eggs and lobsters - he is undone by his own dreams and by the sharply-characterised women in his life. Commended. Modern dietary wisdom tells us that all food that is good for you tastes awful and vice versa. Cinema is the same. Newest addition to the revisionist Western trend that has given us such flavourless PC epics as Dances With Wolves and The Ballad Of Little Jo is Bad Girls. This shows what happens when four saloon prostitutes decide they have had enough of male exploitation and hit the then little-developed highway known as Old Feminist Trail. Madeleine Stowe ties on a holster to sort out bandit and ex-flame James Russo. Mary Stuart Masterson eggs the girls on towards Oregon where she has a land claim. (But gosh-damn the MCP lawmakers] She learns she cannot claim it without a husband.) Andie MacDowell escapes from jail and thinks of setting herself up on a farm. And Drew Barrymore has a score to settle with some men in her life. And then there is the dialogue. 'If your laws don't include me, then they don't apply to me either.' We had that line in Little Jo: will it be compulsory in every feminist western? And, as the four women sit round a camp-fire dreaming of owning a sawmill: 'We sell our bodies - why can't we sell wood?' They certainly spend most of the film selling old saws. It took five people to write the story and script for Bad Girls: four to type, presumably, while the other fished around in old fortune-cookie wrappings for moral quips and mottoes. Jonathan Kaplan directs, as if he had never made a good feminist movie like The Accused and Heart Like A Wheel. The Getaway wins the Pointless Remake of the Year award. The 1972 Peckinpah film with McQueen and McGraw was no masterpiece; but at least its tale of a hoodlum couple zigzagging across the West with a bundle of bank loot and an unholy alliance of pursuers (FBI posse, rival hoodlum) allowed us two hours of harmless disbelief-suspension. The new film defies credibility. Alec Baldwin, expert at citified spivs, is the runabout open-air anti-hero. Kim Basinger, she of the lymphatic pout and 'Take your time, dear' acting talent, is expected to provide the hair-trigger reaction shots. Between them, as they pound across Arizona/New Mexico in a gas-guzzling script by Walter Hill and Amy Jones (based on Jim Thompson's novel), this couple has all the outlaw charisma of a pair of runaway tax-dodgers seeking a night at a Days Inn. You may as well shrug off hope for better American things and see Lightnin' Jack. This hit-and-miss comedy Western about a man, a young black hostage-turned-sidekick (Cuba Gooding Jr) and an unreconstructed saloon girl (Beverly D'Angelo) has never heard of political correctness. But it has heard of charm and jokes. And it brings back Paul 'Crocodile Dundee' Hogan as writer-star, never letting too many minutes go by without putting another quip on the barby.</p>

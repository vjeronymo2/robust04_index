			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Observer: London's rubbish tip Even the Tidy Britain Group is surprised at the findings of its latest survey. London emerges as Europe's second cleanest city - after Berne, but before Paris, Brussels, Rome and Madrid. How can this be? Mostly, it seems, by omitting entirely the masters of civic cleanliness. 'We are aware that Germany is a large and powerful country,' says the Wigan Pier-based charity, 'but these projects have a long lead-time.' When the survey was being planned 'Germany had not decided on its new capital'. While London's ranking may still astound its residents, TBG only combed a radial area of half a kilometre around respective parliaments. For London, that means parts of Lambeth and Westminster, for which the study's sponsors, MRS Environmental Services, just happens to have the cleaning contract.</p>

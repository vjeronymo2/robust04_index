			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sagging rubber prices put pact in jeopardy - Next week's crucial meeting between producers and consumers THE FUTURE of the International Natural Rubber Agreement will be decided next week when producing and consuming countries meet here to make one last attempt to avert the collapse of one of the world's more enduring commodity pacts. The negotiations - under the auspices of the International Natural Rubber Organisation - come at a time when rubber prices have slumped to their lowest level in real terms for more than 30 years, partly because of uncertainties about the future of the agreement. 'I just hope some compromise can be worked out,' said a delegate from one of the consuming country members. 'When it comes down to it the abandonment of Inra is in no one's interests - the producers are going to suffer the most if it collapses.' The early signs are not good. Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Nigeria and the Ivory Coast, together accounting for about 80 per cent of global natural rubber production, are on one side of the Inro negotiating table. On the other side are the European Community, the US, Japan, China, the Commonwealth of Independent States and some smaller consumers. The producers see pricing as the main issue. They say that the agreement, which has been in existence in one form or another since the late 1970s, has not been effective in ensuring fair prices to rubber growers, particularly over the last five years. Malaysia, until recently the world's biggest producer, has seen its production fall in each of the last four years as low prices have forced plantation owners and farmers out of business. The producers say Inra must be renegotiated to give them a better deal. The consumers, while recognising the difficulties producers are facing, say that with the recession in much of the industrialised world, demand is weak. 'It's all about supply and demand, it's as simple as that,' said one rubber trader. The consumers - mostly the big tyre companies - say the immediate issue is the failure of producers to abide by the terms of the agreement. They say producers broke Inra rules by refusing to agree to a downward revision of prices earlier this year. Until that issue is resolved there can be no discussion of renegotiating Inra, which expires at the end of this year, they warn. Increasingly harsh words have bounced back and forth, with the producers, in particular, making little effort to hide their anger. Mr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, has accused consumer countries of not caring whether price levels are remunerative for producer countries. 'We want Inra but not at any cost,' said Mr Lim. 'Producers must protect themselves. They should not allow themselves to be trampled on by the rich and powerful consuming countries.' Producers have threatened to bring in their own pricing mechanisms if the agreement collapses, setting export quotas for producer countries in an effort to drive up prices. But producers privately admit that with a large number of rubber deals now being concluded on a direct producer-to-buyer basis rather than through an international exchange, such a system would be very difficult to implement. Producers face a further dilemma in that if the agreement does collapse then nearly 200,000 tonnes of natural rubber stockpiled by its buffer stock manager will start being sold on the open market, exerting further strong downward pressure on world natural rubber prices. This might all sound like good news for the consumers. But in the medium to long term they would also face problems. Consumers need security of supply, but if prices continue dropping then inevitably more producers will go out of business and eventually world supply will contract. Furthermore consumers cannot afford to lose sources of supply like Malaysia, which, with its long history of rubber production, delivers high quality product. Even in the short term the consumers would face difficulties if the agreement was abandoned. Inra has provided some sort of global framework for the rubber industry and, for all its limitations, a pricing guide. Consumers do not relish a free-for-all in the rubber market, with all the extra negotiations and paper work that would entail. A Malaysian negotiator at the talks says that if what he calls enlightened self interest prevails, then Inra might yet be saved. 'But there is a lot of belligerence about. I'd put the chances of saving Inra at only about one in three at best.'</p>

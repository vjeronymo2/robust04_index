			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Jackson Grp Pounds 166,000 in black JACKSON GROUP, the East Anglian construction and industrial services company, finished 1992 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 166,000. That compared with a deficit of Pounds 1.55m last time and came from turnover down from Pounds 59.5m to Pounds 57.6m. The outcome, however, represented a downturn from the profit of Pounds 386,000 reported at the interim stage, when exceptional income of Pounds 874,000 boosted the results. A same-again final dividend of 1p is proposed, making a total for the year of 1.5p (2p).</p>

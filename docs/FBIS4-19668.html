			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Hakki Atun has stressed that  continuing to recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration as the  government for all of Cyprus is not an approach that will help  the search for peace.    Atun issued a written statement today in connection with the  report President Clinton submitted to Congress on the Cyprus  question. Atun pointed out that once again Clinton failed to  adopt an equal and balanced approach toward the two peoples in  Cyprus. The prime minister said: It should have been understood  by now that referring to Kliridhis as the Cypriot president will  not help the solution of the Cyprus problem; rather, it will  encourage Greek Cypriot intransigence. Kliridhis is the leader  of the Greek Cypriot Administration, which does not represent  the Turkish Cypriot people. He has been elected only by the  Greek Cypriot people. The legitimate Cyprus Government, which  is sovereign over the whole of Cyprus based on agreements,  ceased to exist in 1963.    Atun recalled that the Cyprus Government was turned into a  Cyprus state through military force and occupation. Even though  the United States is aware of these facts, he said, it continues  to recognize the Greek Cypriot Administration as the legitimate  Cyprus government. This approach cannot help the search for  peace, he stressed.    Atun said: It is noteworthy that Mr. Clinton never mentions  in his report the hostile policies being escalated by the Greek  Cypriots at every platform.    The prime minister expressed the hope that the U.S.  Administration will show the necessary initiative to correct  this situation and to end an approach that is totally  incompatible with the spirit and content of the  confidence-building measures. This would help the negotiation  process, he added.    Atun pointed out that the most important obstacle, both  before a final solution and before the confidence-building  measures, is the fact that the Greek Cypriot Administration is  recognized as the legitimate government for all of Cyprus, even  though it does not have the legal basis for that, and the  insistence of third parties in refusing to treat the two peoples  equally. He stressed that by changing this erroneous attitude  and by treating both sides equally, third parties will create  the necessary conditions for the success of the negotiations.</p>

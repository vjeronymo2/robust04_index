			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Andreas Unterberger: "NATO, or -- the </F> Winners' Efforts"]    [Text] There is nothing more burdensome than success.  This is something that the Western defense alliance, NATO, will  be feeling very painfully during its summit starting today.  NATO is the most successful military alliance in history. It  has guaranteed its members -- and some others, like Austria, in  their vicinity -- freedom, peace, democracy, and wealth for a  sensationally long period of time. It brought down its opponent  -- in defense against whom it had originally been established --  without firing a single shot. And, it seems to be the promised  land in the future as well -- at least judging by the membership  candidates queuing up at its doors.    This makes all those who regarded NATO as the kingdom of  evil  over the past decades, ranging from the Social Democrats to the  Greens, look like foreign policy idiots. This includes all  those who, like Austrian diplomats, did not even want to shake  NATO hands for a long time.    So much for NATO's successes in the past. As for the future,  it may well be that the hope placed on NATO all over Europe  could turn out to be just as stupid, or at least naive. For,  first of all, NATO's coherence in the past was mainly a result  of the apocalyptic threat posed by the gigantic armament and  aggressive policy of the East. The end of this threat makes one  fear a reduction of mutual solidarity within the old NATO.    Second, it is doubtful whether the alliance will ever be  prepared to accept new members from the former Warsaw Pact.  Unlike the Germans, the Americans and the British reject this  option altogether. They would only make an exception for the  neutral countries -- in case there will ever be official  interest in NATO membership in those states. For the rest of  Europe, Russia's veto is respected. Due to a very false  estimation resulting from Russia's size and nuclear armament,  Washington and London still consider Moscow the only relevant  partner in the East. The cynical statement by East European  leaders, asking whether they require Boris Yeltsin's approval  before joining NATO, hits the nail on the head.    Of course, there is a third question mark over the future of  the alliance, which would make an expansion toward the East  doubtful, even without Moscow's veto. For, to the same extent  that candidates for membership want to enjoy NATO's security,  they would bring insecurity into the alliance. Let me just  mention the conflict over minorities between Hungary and  Slovakia. Unrest within its own ranks is the last thing that  NATO, which has enough problems with its old members Turkey and  Greece, wants.    The only republic in the former East Bloc where these fears  are unfounded is the Czech one. Prague is very well aware of  the value its democratic, ethnic, and economic stability has.  This is why the Czechs have been wise enough not to bind  themselves in oaths of solidarity with the other East European  states, who (only) want to join NATO. Although Prague's  neighbors to the north and east are somewhat offended, the  clever Czechs have clearly signalled to NATO: Take us, we are  easy, we do not have a common border with the former Soviet  Union.    This requires difficult decisions on the part of the Western  alliance, not only in today's summit but over the next few  years. The winner takes it all -- including the worries about  the losers.</p>

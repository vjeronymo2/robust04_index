			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / People: Rudloff to form own company Hans-Jorg Rudloff, one of the dominant Euromarket bankers of the 1980s, is probably about to re-emerge in the City of London in an aggressive asset management role, writes Ian Rodger. Rudloff, who ran Credit Suisse-First Boston in London for more than a decade, was unexpectedly kicked upstairs to CS Holding headquarters in Zurich a year ago. In February, he left the CS group 'to pursue personal and family business interests'. 'I want to do business rather than be on the planning side,' he said last week from his Geneva base. 'I was getting a little bit bored.' Rudloff, widely respected as a strategic thinker, sees an opportunity in what he calls the enormous changes taking place in top company share ownership in western Europe. Governments and banks are withdrawing, leaving a vacuum in corporate governance. Rudloff says he has high regard for Martin Ebner's BZ banking group in Zurich, which had set up investment funds to take significant shareholdings in top companies and encourage them to emphasise medium term profitability. Rudloff, who emphasises that his own background is more in equities than in bonds, is in the process of forming his own investment company, and promises that he is more likely to be active in London than Switzerland. So far, however, he has collected only Swiss jobs. Sandoz, the Basle pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, has just nominated him to become its first non-Swiss board director. And he has been named non-executive chairman of Bellevue Asset Management, an investment fund management spin-off from Bank am Bellevue, a newish Zurich brokerage house modelled on BZ Bank.</p>

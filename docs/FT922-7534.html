			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Italian Bonds: Government paper proves resilient FOR a country without a president, prime minister or government, Italy's bond market has been surprisingly resilient, especially considering the free fall now under way in equities. True, the bond market's much greater size and liquidity have partially masked the effect of the political upsets which have helped to send the stock market spinning. Nor have bonds suffered from the surge in cash calls which have so damaged equities this month. And while the government bond market is benefiting from a lengthy period of innovation and reform, the bourse is still at the start of that process. However, the relatively good performance of Italian bonds at a time of acute political uncertainty has come partly at the expense of shares, as big institutional investors have sold equities to reinvest in government paper. The shift of institutional money into government issues was reflected in the record turnover figure reported on the screen-based 'primary dealers' market for government bonds earlier this month, where trading hit a new peak of L16,992bn. The continuing appeal of government paper was also evident at last week's auctions. Seven-year fixed-rate Buoni Poliennali del Tesoro (BTPs), auctioned on Friday, enticed L11,550bn in bids from investors for just L5,000bn of paper on offer, pushing prices well above market expectations. But the bond market has not emerged totally unscathed from Italy's current political problems. In particular, foreign investors have taken cover, with their absence being only partially replaced by greater activity among domestic institutions. The relative strength of the bond market may also have been helped by discreet promptings from the Bank of Italy which looks to have been quietly defending longer bonds. A further indirect boost came last week, when Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the governor of the central bank, warned commercial banks to control lending growth this year. Mr Ciampi's remarks were seen as a further sign that the central bank intended to maintain its tight monetary policy, designed to keep down inflation. But the message on loan growth may have been taken on board by some bankers well before Mr Ciampi's warning. Underlying all the Bank of Italy's strategies has been the continuing priority of safeguarding the lira and isolating the currency as far as possible from the type of downward spiral seen on the bourse. With the lira proving remarkably insensitive to domestic political turbulence so far, it seems to have worked.</p>

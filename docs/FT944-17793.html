			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pounds 543,000 Dutch buy for Walker Greenbank Walker Greenbank, the wallcoverings and fabrics group, entered a new phase of international expansion with the acquisition of a Dutch distributor, announced yesterday alongside its interim results. The Pounds 543,000 purchase of Topwand forms part of Walker Greenbank's strategy to boost overseas sales from 28 to 70 per cent of overall turnover within the next five years. In the six months to July 31 pre-tax profits were up 23 per cent from Pounds 3.35m to Pounds 4.14m. Group turnover rose 22 per cent from Pounds 29.9m to Pounds 36.3m, partly thanks to a Pounds 2.05m contribution from two companies, Hartley and Afia, acquired last year. Mr Charles Wightman, chief executive, promised another acquisition to strengthen the group's European distribution network by the end of this year. Walker Greenbank expects to double Topwand's pre-tax profits of Pounds 98,000 last year by expanding its salesforce to distribute more consumer products in the Netherlands. Interest costs fell from Pounds 181,000 to Pounds 39,000 and gearing was cut from 10 per cent to 7 per cent. This year the group expects to offset a 5 per cent increase in raw material prices by higher plant utilisation and increased productivity. Sales price increases next year are anticipated at 3 per cent. Turnover in the non-core area of healthcare rose to Pounds 1.23m (Pounds 908,000). The group is planning to double the size of its healthcare business , which produces bath lifts for the disabled, before disposal. The healthcare company, Hampshire Medical, survived the group's reorganisation after attempts to build Walker Greenbank into an industrial conglomerate in the 1980s. In 1991, Mr Wightman helped fight off a boardroom takeover by Aubin, a Jersey-based investment company. Earnings per share improved to 2.95p (2.44p) and the interim dividend is increased to 1.3p (1.2p).</p>

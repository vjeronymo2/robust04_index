			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / People: Stoddart to join BSG The search by motor and aviation parts and distribution group BSG International for a permanent non-executive chairman appears to be over. Michael Stoddart, chairman of Electra Investment Trust, the development capital group, is joining BSG as a non-executive director with a view to taking over the chairmanship from Astley Whitall, who retired as chairman of Ransomes earlier this year, some time before next October. By the time Stoddart comes on board as chairman, chief executive Richard Marton, who himself only took over his current job in May, should be implementing the recommendations of a strategic review he set in train two months ago. The brief is to examine the entire structure of the group and the markets in which it operates, and to come up with a corporate plan to be implemented from the start of 1994. Most of those markets have been badly hit by recession, not least the Continental car market into which BSG supplies components, and where output is well down. The divisional structure has already been reorganised with the three operating arms re-arranged along regional lines. Marton, while reluctant to criticise directly his own long-serving predecessor Tom Cannon, considers the review to be well overdue and the group itself to have lacked the leadership which would have allowed it to restructure itself to adapt to changing markets.</p>

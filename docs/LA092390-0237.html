			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CREAM OF THE CROP: SOUTHLAND'S TOP PREP PLAYERS;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: AFTER DOWN SEASON, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S TALENT POOL IS BUBBLING OVER  WITH BLUE-CHIP PLAYERS.  </P> <P> Dick Lascola, who operates the Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation  Assn., said the prep football talent pool in Southern California last season  was disappointing.  </P> <P> "But we strung together five good years in a row," he said. "So I guess we were  due for a bad year."  </P> <P> Lascola and other scouts who annually canvas the Southland in search of top  college prospects said the talent level is up this season.  </P> <P> "It looks like a pretty good year," says Houston-based super scout Max  Emfinger. "There (are) some really good people out there this year."  </P> <P> Lascola said the talent crop is especially deep at defensive back, offensive  tackle and running back. It is noticeably thin at quarterback, wide receiver  and linebacker.  </P> <P> Among the top-rated players this season are running back Napoleon Kaufman of  Lompoc and offensive tackle Robert Loya of Fontana.  </P> <P> In addition to Lascola and Emfinger, national recruiting services such as G  &amp; W Recruiting Report of Pennsylvania, Tom Lemming's Prep Football Report  of Illinois, SuperPrep magazine of Costa Mesa and the Florida-based Steve  Smith's Blue Chip report also determine which Greater Los Angeles and Orange  County seniors are rated among the best players.  </P> <P> Fontana and El Toro each have two players on the list.  </P> <P> Here, in no particular order, are the Terrific 22:  </P> <P> Rob Johnson (El Toro, quarterback) -- It may be a down year for quarterbacks in  the Southland, but Johnson could be the exception. If the name sounds familiar,  his brother Bret was starting quarterback at UCLA last season. At 6-foot-4 and  210 pounds, he is bigger than his brother and has a powerful throwing arm. An  all-around athlete, Johnson was All-Southern Section in football, baseball and  basketball as a junior. Playing sparingly at quarterback last season, he  completed 20 of 25 passes for 550 yards and should have little difficulty  making the transition from wide receiver.  </P> <P> Napoleon Kaufman (Lompoc, running back) -- He was the highest-ranked player on  the Terrific 22. One of the swiftest players in the nation, the 5-9, 170-pound  Kaufman has speed and moves that one scouting service compared to Notre Dame's  Raghib Ismail. He won the 100 and 200 meters at the state track meet in June  and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.3 seconds. As a junior, he gained 2,954  all-purpose yards and scored 39 touchdowns and averaged a remarkable 70 yards  on kickoff returns. He also played defensive back and had four interceptions  last year.  </P> <P> Lamont Warren (Dorsey, running back) -- If Kaufman is the best running back in  the state, Warren is not far behind. Some scouts rate him higher than Kaufman.  At 6-1 and 185, he has more size and speed with a 4.4 time in the 40. He also  finished second in the state in the 400 meters in June. A slashing runner, he  rushed for 1,350 yards and 25 touchdowns and caught 20 passes for 205 yards.  "It is rare when you find a back with all the tools Lamont possesses," said the  Lemming report. He also is an excellent defensive back.  </P> <P> Derek Sparks (Mater Dei, running back) -- He transferred to Mater Dei after  playing his first game of the season at Montclair Prep. As a junior, the 6-1  and 208-pound Sparks produced some impressive rushing figures for the Mounties.  His totals of 1,944 yards and 32 touchdowns in 210 carries last year and more  than 3,300 yards in two seasons attracted a great deal of attention from  colleges. Scouts describe him as a power back with great moves, vision and  more-than-adequate 4.5 speed in the 40. He bench presses 320 pounds and also  plays linebacker.  </P> <P> Ontiwaun Carter (Granada Hills Kennedy, running back) -- In an exceptional year  for running backs, Carter joins Sparks as another prized player from the San  Fernando Valley. At 5-10 and 175, he does not have outstanding size but makes  up for that with speed, strength and durability. He runs the 40 in 4.5 and has  bench pressed 350 pounds. Carter has rushed for 2,753 yards and 21 touchdowns  in his first two seasons at Kennedy, including 1,563 yards and 11 touchdowns  last year. Recruiters also think he could to play cornerback in college.  </P> <P> Leon Neal (Paramount, running back) -- Small is big this year in the Southland.  Neal, 5-9 and 170 pounds, is another undersized running back who is receiving a  look from recruiters. Last season he rushed for 1,729 yards and 23 touchdowns  and averaged more than 12 yards a carry. Also a good pass receiver, he combines  exceptional quickness with leaping ability and lateral movement. A good  all-around athlete and outstanding student, his best moves in college could  come at cornerback.  </P> <P> Albert Jones (Westchester, wide receiver) -- One of the best all-around  athletes on the Terrific 22, Jones is usually mentioned first as a receiver and  then as a defensive back, but could easily wind up playing either position in  college because of his size and speed. A transfer from St. Monica, he is 6-3  and 190 pounds and runs the 40 in 4.5. As a junior, he caught 32 passes for 606  yards and 10 touchdowns and demonstrated his explosive qualities by returning  four punts and two interceptions for scores.  </P> <P> Joel Rosborough (Long Beach Jordan, wide receiver) -- An athlete who might be  able to pick his sport for college, the 6-3 and 175-pound Rosborough is equally  adept in football and basketball. Depending on what scout you believe, he can  also play at either wide receiver or defensive back. As a receiver with 4.5  speed, he combines good leaping ability and hands and is considered a big-play  threat. On defense, he has the instincts to excel at safety. He also averaged  15 points for the basketball team last season.  </P> <P> Chris Finch (Riverside Ramona, offensive lineman) -- As talented as the list of  running backs appears to be, the pool of interior linemen is even deeper. One  of the most talented is Finch, 6-6 and 265 pounds, who has excelled on both  sides of the line for a Ramona squad that has produced several big linemen. G  &amp; W Recruiting Report rates him the No. 1 offensive line prospect in the  state. He is a fierce blocker with superb technique and more-than-adequate foot  speed. The biggest question is his grades, which could stand improvement.  </P> <P> Robert Loya (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- For sheer power and determination,  you will not find a more dominating lineman than the 6-3 and 280 Loya. Said  Lemming's report, "Robert is a fierce competitor who is known for knocking  defenders on their backside." Regarded by many scouts as the state's best  offensive lineman, he has quick feet with a 5.0 clocking in the 40. He has a  dead lift of 565 pounds. He is also solid academically with a 3.6 grade-point  average.  </P> <P> Clay Hattabaugh (Fontana, offensive lineman) -- With major-college prospects  such as Loya and Hattabaugh on the same line, it is no wonder why big things  are expected from Fontana again this season. At 6-3 and 265, Hattabaugh is  slightly smaller than Loya but a little faster with a 4.9 time in the 40. He  also has tremendous strength, having bench pressed 375 pounds. He moves well  off a block and is especially strong as a run-blocker. A tackle in high school,  he could move to guard for college.  </P> <P> John DiSante (Sherman Oaks Notre Dame, offensive lineman) -- In a blue-chip  year for offensive linemen in the state, DiSante rates among the best. He has  the size (6-4, 270 pounds) and above-average foot speed with a time of 5.0 in  the 40. He is a good all-around athlete who also plays nose guard. He also  competes in basketball and track and field. He receives high marks for his  aggressiveness but what scouts like most about him is his intense work ethic.  He is also a good student with a 3.5 GPA.  </P> <P> Donovan Roy (Van Nuys Montclair Prep, offensive lineman) -- Roy certainly has  the size colleges like (6-6, 280 pounds). He also has outstanding quickness  with a 5.0 in the 40 and ample strength having lifted 470 pounds in the squat.  Particularly strong as a run-blocker on offense, he is also an imposing force  as a tackle on defense, having batted down six passes in 1989.  </P> <P> Mike Cardona (La Mirada, offensive lineman) -- Another huge tackle who can play  offense and defense, the 6-4 and 280-pound Cardona is not the fastest lineman  among the Terrific 22 with a 5.4 clocking in the 40, but he makes up for any  shortcomings with his aggressiveness and solid work habits. "He can pull, trap  and makes very few mistakes at offensive tackle," said the Lemming report. He  also stands out on defense, having recorded eight quarterback sacks in 10 games  in earning All-Southern Section honors last season.  </P> <P> Brian Greeley (Riverside La Sierra, offensive lineman) -- There are four  players from the Inland Empire on the Terrific 22 and all are sizable offensive  linemen. Greeley fits the description with his 6-3 and 275-pound frame. He has  excelled at tackle on offense and defense. He is one of the quickest linemen on  the list with a 4.9 time in the 40 and can bench press 360 pounds. His brother,  Keith, plays basketball for USC.  </P> <P> Jeremy Hogue (El Toro, defensive lineman) -- The talent supply at El Toro never  seems to be lacking and Hogue is another standout for one of the top programs  in the Southland. At 6-4 and 255 pounds, he plays offense and defense. Scouts  think his future is at defensive tackle. He has good speed with a 5.0 time in  the 40, which probably helped him accumulate 12 quarterback sacks last season.  Hogue also plays tackle on offense but prefers defense. He is also an  exceptional student with a 4.0 grade-point average.  </P> <P> Mike Balian (LaVerne Damien, defensive lineman) -- Damien always seems to  produce at least one major-college prospect on the line and Balian is the  latest. A 6-4 and 250-pound nose guard, Balian has the quickness and strength  that enable him to control the line of scrimmage. He has a best of 4.9 seconds  in the 40 and can bench press 420 pounds. Mostly a defensive player, he has  even played a fullback on offense. He is also an outstanding wrestler, which  might help to account for his excellent lateral mobility.  </P> <P> Matt Gilmour (Temple City, defensive lineman) -- He is not the biggest lineman  in the state and that is one reason why Gilmour might eventually play outside  linebacker in college. Scouts like his potential. At 6-5 and 220-pounds, he has  above-average 4.8 speed in the 40 and a lot of room to fill out. "Matt is a  quick-footed youngster who explodes off the ball," the Lemming report said. He  also plays tight end on offense and averaged 10 points as forward for the  basketball team last season.  </P> <P> Clayvand Thomas (Carson, defensive back) -- On the field, there is little doubt  about the ability of Thomas. Regarded by most scouts as one of the premier  defensive backs in the state, the 6-0 and 175 Thomas returned three  interceptions for touchdowns last season. He is especially adept at man-to-man  coverage. But there are lingering questions about his physical condition after  he broke a knee cap and wrist in an auto accident earlier this year. That is  expected to keep him out of action until sometime in October. He has also  incurred his share of disciplinary problems.  </P> <P> Derrick Stewart (Granada Hills High, defensive back) -- At first glance, it  might be a little surprising that Stewart is considered among the top  prospects. After all, he didn't produce a lot of impressive statistics as a  junior, but there are a lot of things scouts like about the 5-11 and 185-pound  Stewart. "He reacts well to the ball and he hits like a ton," one report said.  While he didn't have any interceptions as a junior, he did have six quarterback  sacks and plays with a lot of emotion. He also plays basketball and baseball.  </P> <P> Tim Ross (Simi Valley Royal, defensive back) -- It is unusual for Royal, a  school that has never been a CIF Southern Section power, to have a blue-chip  prospect, but Ross is an exception. The 6-4 and 205-pound Ross is one of the  most versatile players on the Terrific 22. He plays strong safety and  intercepted four passes last year, but could develop into an outside linebacker  in college. He will also see time at tight end and wide receiver for Royal.  Ross runs the 40 in 4.6 seconds, has leaped 6-7 in the high jump and plays  basketball.  </P> <P> Reggie Reser (Muir, defensive back) -- Reser, at 5-10 and 175 pounds, is not  the biggest defensive back around, but he makes up for any size deficiency with  his 4.5 speed in the 40. He is also a vicious hitter. "He's the hit man you  want for your secondary who is athletic enough to play corner, too," SuperPrep  said. Recruiters call him a pure college cornerback. He had four interceptions  and forced three fumbles as a junior. He will also play running back this  season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TERRIFIC 22  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:2.77IN:1.56IN:1.45IN:1.56IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>

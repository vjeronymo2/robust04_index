			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Relations with China will not be affected China will not allow developments in Russia to affect relations whatever happens, Mr Qian Qichen, the Chinese foreign minister said yesterday, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. Speaking during a session of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, Mr Qian said the turmoil was Russia's internal affair, but he hoped the situation would stabilise quickly. Mr Qian's non-committal references to the constitutional crisis in neighbouring Russia - their border is the longest in the world - reflect an apparent attempt by Beijing to remain neutral in the crisis. Unlike western leaders, the Chinese have given no indication that they support Mr Yeltsin; or, on the other hand, that they might favour his removal. China's media reporting appears to have been scrupulously even-handed. China's communist leaders have never evinced much public enthusiasm for Mr Yeltsin, who visited Beijing last December. Chinese hardliners have in the past denounced him as a 'traitor to communism'. Diplomats say that while China's leaders may lack full confidence in Mr Yeltsin, they are more frightened of alternatives such as the emergence of more militant Russian nationalism along their western flank.</p>

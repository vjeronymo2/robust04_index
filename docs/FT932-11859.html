			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: O&amp;Y stake in Home Oil sold in public offering HOME OIL of Calgary no longer has a controlling shareholder following a public offering of the combined 59.7 per cent stake held by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer, and Gulf Canada Resources. A group of underwriters led by Burns Fry of Toronto paid CDollars 396m (USDollars 311m) on Wednesday for the 23.6m shares held by O&amp;Y and Gulf. The shares had been re-sold to institutional and retail investors by early yesterday morning. Burns Fry estimated that European investors had bought about 10 per cent of theshares. Home Oil is the latest in a string of large Canadian companies whose troubled parents have been replaced by a widely dispersed group of shareholders. Earlier this year, underwriting groups distributed blocks in MacMillan Bloedel, the west coast forestry producer, and John Labatt, the beer and entertainment company, previously held by the troubled Edper group which is controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family. O&amp;Y's creditors are considering similar action to dispose of the developer's controlling stakes in Gulf Canada and Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer. Mr Brent Fullard, director of equity markets at Burns Fry, said investors had reacted enthusiastically to the sales because of the prospect of companies being freed from a 'constrained owner'. Furthermore, these companies' share prices have been depressed for some time by concern that a large block would be placed on the market. Home Oil earned CDollars 6.9m last year on revenues of CDollars 281.2m. Its main strength is in natural gas, with output averaging 214.2m cubic feet a day last year. Gulf Canada, 75 per cent owned by O&amp;Y, said its share of proceeds from the Home Oil sale, totalling CDollars 145m, would be used to reduce debt. It aims to raise another CDollars 400m this year from asset sales.</p>

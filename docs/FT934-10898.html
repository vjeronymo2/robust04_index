			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / MEPC doubles exposure to US MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, is to pay Pounds 115m for American Property Trust, a unit trust controlled by UK pension funds that owns two shopping malls in the US. The acquisition is the first significant move by a UK property group into an overseas market for some time, as the recession has put most companies in the sector on the defensive. While analysts say the APT acquisition is unusual because MEPC is paying a discount to net assets, the deal shows that some property companies may be beginning to consider buying assets once again, having bolstered their balance sheets. It doubles MEPC's exposure to the US property market, where it already has interests in shopping malls. By issuing paper to pay for the deal, MEPC does not expect to deplete greatly the Pounds 222m it raised in July through a rights issue. MEPC says the deal increases the proportion of assets in retail, rebalancing the portfolio in line with a commitment made at the time of the rights issue. For APT's pension fund unit holders, the deal significantly increases the liquidity of their investment while leaving them an interest in US property. MEPC will be issuing up to 22.65m new shares but APT unit holders will be able to take cash for up to 20 per cent of the consideration. The unit holders have agreed not to sell their shares for at least 12 months. MEPC will also take on Dollars 176m (Pounds 119m) of borrowings and preferred stock in UK-American Properties, APT's main US investment vehicle. In the year to June 30, APT had pre-tax income of Pounds 4.4m and year-end net assets stood at Pounds 145.6m. The pricing represents a discount of just under 10 per cent on the gross property value. MEPC said the acquisition would enhance earnings per share and net assets per share this financial year. Mr James Tuckey, managing director, said the properties were expected to yield about 8 per cent in their first year and at least 9 per cent thereafter. The two US shopping centres - one in California, the other in Georgia - that make up most of APT's assets have a combined leaseable area of more than 2.5m square feet. The deal lifts the retail content of MEPC's portfolio to 31 per cent from 26 per cent. MEPC said gearing would not be materially affected by the deal and the group could make further acquisitions.

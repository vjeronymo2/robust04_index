			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC farm ministers focus on imbalances EC AGRICULTURE ministers yesterday put to one side their increasingly sterile confrontation over this year's farm spending limits, and focused instead on the specific market imbalances that threaten to break the Community's agriculture budget. The 12 ministers - in their third attempt to break the deadlock over price cuts put forward by Brussels to keep spending within the mandatory farm 'guideline' - took their shopping lists to the Luxembourg presidency of the EC and Mr Ray MacSharry, agriculture commissioner. The hope is that the presidency and the European Commission can distill from this a compromise to lay before the next council of agriculture ministers in Brussels on May 21-22. However, this looks optomistic because more than synthesis will be required to resolve the central dispute - whether an increase of the Ecu32.5bn (Dollars 40bn) guideline for this year is justified by the cost of bringing east German farmers into the Common Agricultural Policy. The UK, backed by the Netherlands, say no, while their colleagues, led by France and Ireland, argue that it is. A majority of delegations felt yesterday that some sort of agreement was unlikely before June, a sentiment clear enough to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Commission officials, although they believe that a settlement that late means the CAP could run short of funds by October, were encouraged by the sight of ministers engaging with the details of the price package for 1991. There were, however, few signs of suggestions that would reduce spending. One exception was the UK argument that milk quotas should be cut by 4-5 per cent, instead of 2 per cent as the Commission wants. Mr John Gummer, the British agriculture minister, said that farmers know a second cut will have to follow one of 2 per cent. Mr MacSharry said late on Monday that if no action was taken to reduce prices and cut overproduction, EC stockpiles of surplus food would grow by this time next year to 28m tonnes of cereals (from a record 20m now); to 1m tonnes of butter and skimmed milk (725,000 tonnes); and a record 1m tonnes of beef, from 750,000 tonnes now. 'The only limit on intervention stocks now is the lack of storage space,' one Commission official remarked.</p>

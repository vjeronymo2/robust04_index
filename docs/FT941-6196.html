			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Hungary will apply to join next month: Growth pains as the Union enlarges Hungary signalled yesterday that it will apply for full membership of the European Union in April, with the support of Germany. Hungary would be the first former communist country to apply. It will put pressure on the EU to come up with new ideas for integrating eastern Europe and could trigger a request for full membership later this year by Poland. Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president who visits Hungary today, has ordered a study on how to strengthen economic and political ties with central and eastern Europe. The 12 member states and the Commission oppose offering the east Europeans a precise date for membership; but there are signs of a more adventurous approach to integration, partly driven by the rise of Russian nationalism in last December's elections and the upcoming German presidency of the EU in the second half of the year. The UK and Italy are forging new links with the six east European countries with association agreements with the EU, covering a common foreign and security policy and justice and home affairs. The six are Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. Even Mr Delors, who once favoured deepening integration within the 12 rather than widening membership, appears to be having second thoughts. A Polish official said meanwhile that Warsaw was pursuing membership on a 'parallel track' with Budapest. But the Czechs are likely to delay an application until they have studied how to align economic policies more closely to the EU.</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAILHOUSE INFORMANT ARRESTED IN RAID  </P> <P> Veteran jailhouse informant Leslie Vernon White, who last week failed to appear  for sentencing in a purse-snatching case, has been arrested during a drug raid  on a downtown Los Angeles motel where he was staying, one of White's attorneys  said Monday.  </P> <P> White told his lawyers that he missed his court appearance last Thursday  because he had been beaten by unidentified gang members who had marked him as a  "snitch," said Mark Geragos, who represents White. "He said he was hiding  because he was afraid for his life," Geragos said.  </P> <P> White, whose $10,000 bail in the purse-snatching case was forfeited after he  failed to appear, was arrested Saturday on a no-bail warrant.  </P> <P> Last fall, White prompted a major investigation of Los Angeles County criminal  cases in which informants have testified after he demonstrated to authorities  that he could, through various ruses, convincingly fabricate a murder  confession from an inmate he had never met.  </P> <P> Geragos said White will appear in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday to be  sentenced for the purse-snatching. "He's not going anywhere now," the lawyer  said.  </P></p>

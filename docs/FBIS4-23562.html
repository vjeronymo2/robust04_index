			<p>BFN     [Text] The Namibian cabinet has accepted a proposal that  members of the former counter insurgency unit, Koevoet  [crowbar], should be allowed to return to Namibia. More than  500 members of the controversial unit have indicated that they  want to leave South Africa and return to Namibia. The decision  also paves the way for 5,000 bushmen in the Northern Cape to  return.</p>

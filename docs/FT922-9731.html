			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Gunfire greets Bosnian truce: Mortars land close to United Nations envoy in Sarajevo INTENSE gun and mortar fire was heard around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, last night within minutes of the signing of a truce between the Bosnian presidency and representatives of the Yugoslav army. The accord, which came only hours after heavy shelling hit the city, was reached at the United Nations headquarters there in the presence of the European Community envoy, Mr Colm Doyle. It said both sides would be able to recover their dead and wounded with International Red Cross help, and the free flow of food and medicines to military installations would be guaranteed. Earlier, two mortar shells landed close to the building as UN special envoy Marrack Goulding arrived after a seven-hour delay in Pale, a Serb stronghold outside the city. A third shell landed near his car as he was driving away in a UN convoy to see President Alija Izetbegovic. He was not hurt and there appeared to be no injuries. Mr Goulding was escorted into Sarajevo late yesterday afternoon by General Satish Nambiar, commander of UN peace-keeping forces, after being blocked in Pale. The first UN convoy which tried to meet him had to turn back because of fighting. A second convoy, with Gen Nambiar, got through but with further delay. 'The first convoy came under fire up close and had to turn back. The second expedition was held up for three hours at a Serbian road block and this is really not acceptable behaviour,' said Mr Goulding. 'Terrible things have been happening in Sarajevo and elsewhere in Bosnia. It is a tense and dangerous situation with the risk it might spread. There are strong feelings. . . . that the international community must do something about this.' Mr Goulding's mission to assess the feasibility of sending a peace-keeping force to the republic coincided with an ultimatum from the largely Moslem Bosnian militias to the Yugoslav federal army to withdraw from the capital by midnight tonight. The continuing violence forced 25 monitors to pull out of Sarajevo, leaving a nine-member crew. Responsibility for the killing of a Belgian EC monitor last Saturday was denied yesterday by the federal army, which implied that Croatians had done it. In an apparent effort to stave off international criticism, the presidency of the new Serb-dominated Yugoslavia yesterday ordered its citizens  - Serb and Montenegrin soldiers and officers  - to withdraw from Bosnia within 15 days. However, the call was rhetorical since more than 80 per cent of 80,000 federal soldiers stationed in Bosnia are Bosnian Serbs. The republic's Moslems are backed by Croats who have joined forces against the Serbs and the federal army in a battle for control of strategic parts of Sarajevo. However, the Moslem-Croat coalition which supports Bosnian independence looks fragile. Serb leaders hinted yesterday that Serbia and Croatia could reach agreement on dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, leaving Moslems without a homeland.</p>

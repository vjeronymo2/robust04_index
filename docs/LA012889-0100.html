			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN CONFIDENT AFTER VOLLEYBALL SETBACK AT USC  </P> <P> After dismantling Chapman College at home last week, the Cal State Northridge  men's volleyball team talked about knocking off USC.  </P> <P> But Tuesday the Matadors lowered their aspirations when they were swept under  by Pepperdine. They just hoped to escape Friday night's match at USC with their  limbs intact.  </P> <P> Turns out that CSUN walked out of USC's North gym with a lot more than they  came in with.  </P> <P> Despite losing their second consecutive Western Intercollegiate Volleyball  Assn. match -- this time by scores of 15-4, 12-15, 15-6, 16-14 -- the Matadors  showed a level of confidence thought lost 3 days before at Pepperdine.  </P> <P> "I feel a helluva lot better than I did Tuesday," CSUN Coach John Price said.  "I feel frustrated because we had an opportunity to win on the road at SC but  I'm not frustrated with our record."  </P> <P> Price is feeling good after his team dropped to 3-5 overall, 0-2 in conference  play? Well, part of that optimism stems from the fact that the Matadors' last 2  losses were to the No. 5 and No. 2 teams in the nation.  </P> <P> And Price was also encouraged by the fact that CSUN led in the past 2 games and  even served at game point 4 times in the fourth game before falling to the  defending national champions.  </P> <P> "When those guys come to CSUN, we're going to beat them in three straight,"  setter Tom Ribarich said. "I'm serious."  </P> <P> So was teammate Andrew Greskovics, who will count the days until the rematch at  CSUN. "Home courts are like a seventh player out there," he said.  </P> <P> But before the Matadors can sweep the Trojans at CSUN, they're going to have to  clean house a bit. They may talk a good game, but the Matadors couldn't figure  out how to finish one off at USC.  </P> <P> After falling behind, 12-8, in the fourth game, CSUN scored 6 consecutive  points and was within a point of forcing a fifth game. Outside hitter Neil  Coffman had 3 of his 16 kills in the Matador run.  </P> <P> "We tried to throw a lot of different approaches at them, especially on the  quick hit," Price said.  </P> <P> But with CSUN leading, 14-12, USC (10-2, 2-0) did the same thing to the  Matadors to tie the score, 14-14, as 3 Trojans knocked down quick spikes. USC  took a 1-point lead when the Matadors couldn't return Tom Duke's cross-court  spike and won the match when Duke nailed a free ball into the center of CSUN's  court.  </P> <P> "I thought we'd win," Ribarich said of the fourth game. "I thought after we won  the second game the match would go 5 games. Even when we lost the third game we  were right there with them.  </P> <P> "If we would have won the fourth game we would have taken the momentum into the  fifth game."  </P> <P> Bob Samuelson had a match-high 29 kills and 6 block assists for CSUN and middle  hitter Ron Graening added 17 kills. USC, which had 4 players with 19 or more  kills, was paced by middle hitter Bryan Ivie's 23 kills.  </P></p>

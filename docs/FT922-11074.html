			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: US copper project defeats ecological mussel-power ONE OF the most bitterly fought battles between environmentalists and miners enters a new phase next month when work re-starts on the Dollars 20m development of Flambeau Mining's copper project in Wisconsin. The hugely-rich but relatively small deposit, now owned by RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, was first found in 1968 but it was not until last year that all the permits were in place for development which began in August. Then environmental researchers successfully applied to a US judge for work to be halted because they said purple warty back mussels and other threatened or endangered species were found in the Flambeau River about a mile from where the mining company plans a drain pipe outlet. Mr Larry Mercando, vice president and general manager of Flambeau Mining, said yesterday that Wisconsin's state Department of Natural Resources had now issued a revised environmental impact statement that clearly stated the mine's operations would have no effect on any threatened or endangered species. The episode had delayed mining by about six months, he added. First ore should be shipped in June, 1993. However, Mr Mercando admitted: 'We are ready and prepared for more attacks by environmentalists. They never give up.' Mr Mercando estimates that about 70 per cent of the Dollars 20m-Dollars 30 cost of the mine will go towards environmental protection measures - the biggest cost is for a water treatment plant to ensure that water discarded by the mine is more pure than any found in nature. The recent production delay was caused by a civil action against the state department by the Sierra Club, a group of environmental activists, and the Lac Courte Oreilles Band of Lake Superior Chippewa natives, who say the mine could spoil fishing by polluting the Flambeau River, a tributary of the Chippewa, which drains into the Mississippi. Environmentalists are also concerned because the copper deposit is in a heavily wooded area with is no industrial activity. Flambeau's will be the first mine to be developed in Wisconsin since the Shullsburg lead-zinc mine closed in 1979. Kennecott Corporation, now an RTZ subsidiary, has owned the deposit for 20 years and persevered because it is exceptionally rich. The ore contains 10.5 per cent of copper whereas most miners would be happy with 2 or 3 per cent. Unfortunately, there is only about 1.9m tonnes of ore. As this will be dug out at the rate of 320,000 tonnes a year, the mine will have a life of only six years.</p>

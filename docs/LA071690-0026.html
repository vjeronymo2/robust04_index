			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NOW THE PUBLIC CAN BE PRIVY TO A BIT OF LAWRENCE WELK LORE  </P> <P> Uh-one and a uh-two. Or: It's wunnerful to be from North Dakota.  </P> <P> There's no dispute that Lawrence Welk, now 87 and semi-retired, has had his  share of honors.  </P> <P> Take a squint at the lobby of the Lawrence Welk Theatre north of Escondido,  which is part of the Lawrence Welk Resort on Lawrence Welk Drive.  </P> <P> The theater lobby is the family authorized Lawrence Welk Museum: gold records,  plaques of appreciation, presidential proclamations and more. Outside is a  bronze statue of the Champagne Music Maker.  </P> <P> But now even the official Welk cult has been one-upped.  </P> <P> A save-our-heritage group in North Dakota has announced plans to spend $250,000  to renovate the Welk farm in Strasburg (population 600), where Welk lived until  age 21.  </P> <P> The governor came down from Bismarck to bless the project and listen to some  German polkas. Welk stayed in Santa Monica but sent a warm telegram.  </P> <P> The renovation will include the Welk family's sod house, granary, buggy barn  and outhouse. Repeat: outhouse.  </P> <P> I suggest that anyone whose youthful privy is considered a cultural landmark  has soared indeed to an impressive height.  </P> <P> Sharon Eiseman, executive director of Welk Heritage Inc., explained from  Strasburg that the outhouse is important. Without it, the verisimilitude of a  real farm would be kaput.  </P> <P> It'll be a working one-seater, with a mail-order catalogue hung on a hook. Such  catalogues were a link to the outside world for the Welk family and other  German-Russian settlers, Eiseman noted.  </P> <P> It has not been recorded whether Welk was reading a catalogue when he was  inspired (in 1927) to form the Honolulu Fruit Gum Orchestra and head for  WNAX-radio in Yankton, N.D.  </P> <P> I'll leave that to the biographers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Masked Man Rides Again  </P> <P> Public affairs.  </P> <P> * Who was that politically active masked man?  </P> <P> John Hart, 75, a retired actor who played the Lone Ranger on television for two  seasons in the 1950s, is living in a mobile-home park in Warner Springs.  </P> <P> He's joined his neighbors in opposing the county plan for a garbage dump in  nearby Blue Canyon.  </P> <P> To help fund the fight, Hart is selling autographs at $2 each.  </P> <P> * U.S. District Judge John Rhoades holds the key to San Diego's political  future as he decides whether the City Council's redistricting map is a fraud.  </P> <P> But even Rhoades is not all-powerful.  </P> <P> When a Chicano Federation attorney asked him to review videotapes of a council  session to check for slippery dealing, Rhoades admitted he's never mastered the  VCR:  </P> <P> "You're going to have to clue my wife on what you want me to watch."  </P> <P> * Pay me now, pay me later.  </P> <P> Rick Taylor and Jean Andrews are partners in a San Diego political consulting  firm.  </P> <P> Taylor helped draw the proposed redistricting map that could put Councilman  Bruce Henderson's career greatly in doubt. The map may have delighted Linda  Bernhardt (another Taylor-Andrews client) but it made Henderson howl in pain.  </P> <P> Now Andrews is making fund-raising calls for Henderson.  </P> <P> She's telling people that the redistricting map makes Henderson so vulnerable  that he needs all the campaign help he can get.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Going for the Gold  </P> <P> If anyone asks.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Sockers just won another championship.  </P> <P> Not the indoor pros from the Sports Arena. A semi-professional team from  Balterswil, Switzerland, wearing blue-and-gold Socker uniforms from a store in  Lemon Grove.  </P> <P> For winning the all-Europe tournament in Austria, the team got a pewter plate  and a pig.  </P> <P> The plate went in the trophy case. The pig was roasted and consumed at a  banquet.  </P> <P> * Headline in the Valley Center Roadrunner: Planning Commission Spends Hours on  Minutes.  </P></p>

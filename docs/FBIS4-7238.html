			<p>BFN     [Text] Exiled communist leader Jose Ma. Sison yesterday  accused former colleagues who have turned against him of being  in the payroll of the Office of the National Security Adviser,  Jose Almonte. They are also "directly in touch with U. S.  Ambassador John Negroponte," he said.    Sison did not offer proof of the supposed link between his  enemies and Almonte or Negroponte. He merely said: "I have  been informed by the NDF [National Democratic Front] about the  character of those issuing the statements in the name of the so-  called Democratic Bloc of the NDF and the so-called NDF-Europe."    He said the participation of his enemies in the "psywar  (operations) of the U. S.-Ramos regime" is shown by the fact  that they have not been criticizing the government of the United  States but are concentrating on attacking the NDF and the  Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP].    In a separate press statement, the National Democratic Front  said members of the breakaway faction in the underground  movement are merely "a noisy group" who have long been  repudiated by their mass organizations. It also said that the  New People's Army remains under the control of the Communist  Party of the Philippines. For these reasons, the NDF indicated  it would be meaningless for the government to negotiate with the  splinter faction.    The verbal battle in the underground rebel movement has  escalated with both sides accusing each other of plotting to  kill leading personalities in their camps.    Yesterday, in a statement marking NDF's 21st anniversary,  Secretary General Frank Fernandez expressed the organization's  belief in the need for peace but emphasized this would not come  about unless meaningful changes take place.    Expressing its determination to advance the armed struggle,  the NDF deplored what it called the destructive deeds of a rival  group which recently announced its readiness to hold separate  peace talks with the government.    Fernandez said members of the so-called Democratic Bloc  merely want a "graceful exit" from the armed revolution, and  that their moves are being supported by the Ramos Government to  push the NDF into negotiations under terms dictated by the  government.    Utrecht-based leaders of the NDF have been holding out on  the  negotiations, demanding that the Ramos Government first withdraw  "conditions" for the talks which violate the Hague Declaration  signed by both parties two years ago.    A member of the anti-Sison faction yesterday denied his  involvement in an alleged plot to kill the founder of the CPP.    Antonio Cabardo, former detainee and vice president of the  Sandigan ng Kalayaan at Demokrasya ng Sambayanan [Foundation of  Freedom and Democracy of the People], said Sison's accusations  show him to be "either sick of paranoia of the highest order or  again up to some evil scheme."    He also said statements coming from the Utrecht-based  leaders  seem to show they are preparing for a "graceful exit" of their  own, but in this case, "a graceful exit from the peace process."    He said Sison would use as an excuse the supposed plot to  kill him as reason for pulling out from the peace efforts.</p>

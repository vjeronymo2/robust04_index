			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Jakarta (JP) -- Minister/State Secretary  Murdiono said yesterday that criticism directed against the  government should not undermine the nation's stability.    In his first public comment about President Suharto's strong  criticism of recent demands for greater individual freedom,  Murdiono said no one should take stability for granted.    "Stability is not a self-made product and must not be taken  for granted," he said.    "It is our collective responsibility to maintain the  nation's  dynamic stability," he told reporters after addressing a seminar  on the cultural aspects of Indonesia's second long term  development program yesterday. [passage omitted]    "I think the essence of the President's statement is that  criticisms and statements must not undermine national  stability," Murdiono continued.    "You must remember that what the President actually said was  that their methods resembled the PKI's," he said when asked  about the comparison.    The specter of the PKI, which was crushed and outlawed in  1966 after a failed coup attempt the previous year, has often  been raised in discussions about possible threats to national  stability.    Murdiono in his paper at the seminar said that national  stability ultimately depends on greater public participation in  the nation's economic political and cultural development.    "Greater public participation will expand the state's  political basis. This, will in turn enhance national  stability," he said.    Murdiono acknowledged however that governing was not always  a  smooth process. "It is not realistic to expect a society to be  free of frictions and conflicts."    He suggested that some kind of a limit be imposed on how far  these conflicts could be tolerated that does not lead towards  destruction. "To ensure that differences of opinion remain as  constructive as possible, we should set a limit on the maximum  conflict allowable."    Murdiono said the "limit" would vary according to the  situation.    "This limit must be formulated and agreed upon collectively.  It must be dynamic and dependent on both the society's  development and the ability of the state apparatus to control  the situation," he said. [passage omitted]    Twenty-one students are currently being detained for staging  a demonstration in Jakarta last week. They are likely to be  charged with defaming President Suharto an offense punishable by  up to six years in jail, the police said. [passage omitted]</p>

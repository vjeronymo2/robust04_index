			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 22 for 2 </F> February 1994; by Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovskiy, and  Vladimir Shishlin, edited by Boris Grishchenko]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to arrive for  one day of summit talks in Tbilisi on Thursday. He and Georgian  leader Eduard Shevardnadze will first meet privately and are to  join their delegations later, Yeltsin's press office told  Interfax.    The two countries are expected to sign about 20 agreements  including an outline friendship and cooperation treaty. Others  deal with trade and economic cooperation for 1994, free trade  and the status of Russian border guards deployed in Georgia.    Yeltsin and Shevardnadze are scheduled to hold a joint news  conference afterwards.    The Russian leader is due to fly back to Moscow at 21:00  local time.    The framework agreement binds Russia and Georgia to build  their relations as two friendly nations and to stay out of any  blocs or alliances spearheaded *against each other. It also  provides for a mechanism of consultations and subsequent  measures to remove any threat to each other's interests or  security.    Experts say parts of the treaty dealing with legal and  property matters are designed to help ease the process as much  as possible.    The two sides are committed to working out a package of  measures to regulate migration and travelling. Russia and  Georgia are also determined to promote economic cooperation by  helping towards the formation of markets in the Black Sea region  and Europe and a common economic area.    The treaty enshrines the two sides' desire for cooperation  in  certain areas of the economy, science and technology. It also  provides for mutual responsibility for a free flow of oil and  gas and unimpeded passenger and freight traffic through each  other's territory.    The two countries are expected to promote closer cooperation  in space research, personnel training and so on.    The 10-year agreement is to be extended automatically unless  one of the sides wishes to break it off upon its expiration.</p>

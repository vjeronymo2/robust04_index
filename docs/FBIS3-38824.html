			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Following the massacre in Sarajevo, something  might now be happening, and perhaps now the Bosnian Serbs might  really agree to the demilitarization of Sarajevo, which would be  placed under UN control. In the meantime, the foreign ministers  of the European Community are asking that the siege of the city  be lifted using any means possible, including air strikes.  However, the war is continuing and images of death are  continuing to arrive from Bosnia. Antonio Foresi reports from  Brussels.    [Foresi] It a was long and difficult debate, where moral  indignation was not only evident, but also the belief that not  replying to the massacres taking place in Sarajevo could lead to  a dangerous future for Europe. The conclusion is this: The  request that the siege of Sarajevo be lifted immediately, that  heavy artillery be confiscated from all the warring sides, and  in order to ensure that this happens the request that any means  necessary would be used, including air strikes.    The European Union has left the task to NATO of serving the  disarmament ultimatum and ensuring that Sarajevo becomes a  neutral city under an international administration. The terms  of the ultimatum, that is the expiry date, the terms and  intensity of the armed reaction, and the observance of these  terms by the Serbs and the other sides, will be decided by the  Atlantic alliance either today or tomorrow. The work will be  difficult and complex, and must take into account the land  conditions and the dramatic, complex problems surrounding  Sarajevo. [passage omitted]    We asked Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta if all this  would be enough to stop the carnage.    [Begin Andreatta recording] I believe that we have got off  on  the right footing. Naturally as always, when one uses arms or  has the possibility of using arms, then one is faced with a  difficult and very painful risk. [end recording]</p>

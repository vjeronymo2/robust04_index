			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes unaware of reason for 21p rise Shares in Andrews Sykes, the industrial services group, rose 21p yesterday to close at a high of 158p. The board said it was 'not aware of any reason for the increase'. Earlier in the day it announced the appointment of two new directors one of whom is Mr Jean Jacques Murray who won effective control of the company following a prolonged boardroom battle which ended in May. European Fire Protection, Mr Murray's private Dutch company, owns 59.5 per cent of Andrews Sykes and he becomes a non-executive director. Mr John Hall, operations director of the group's main subsidiary, was appointed an executive director. Andrews Sykes, which has been undergoing a restructuring, reported a Pounds 1.96m loss in the six months to September 30.</p>

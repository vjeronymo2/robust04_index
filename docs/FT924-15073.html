			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM And Maastricht: Bonn urged to clarify unification financing GERMANY needs to clarify its financing of unification to help strengthen European monetary co-operation, Mr Henning Christophersen, EC finance commissioner, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Stockholm. 'A stronger monetary co-operation. . . demands that countries increase the credibility in their economies,' he said at a satellite-linked Community seminar in Sweden. Italy, Britain and Spain were included in the group of countries needing to bolster credibility. . . 'but also Germany, which has an unclear situation about the financing of reunification,' he said. Germany's reliance on debt to finance unification has been blamed by some economists and politicians for forcing German interest rates higher and pushing the Exchange Rate Mechanism close to collapse. Lady Thatcher, former British prime minister, told a gathering of businessmen in Madrid on Monday that the D-Mark was no longer a good anchor for the ERM and that Germany had exported high rates to the rest of the Community. However, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, denied that its high interest rates were solely to blame for turmoil within European money markets and said economic divergences among EC countries were the fundamental cause. He argued that a strong D-Mark had to remain the anchor of the EMS, and any attempt to soften the system's parameters or to relax the commitment to stability at its heart would be counter-productive.</p>

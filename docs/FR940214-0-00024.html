			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 34. Section 1944.215(a)(15)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One respondent recommended that congregate projects where an expanded meal service is designed to provide meals to all of the community's elderly citizen be exempted from the limitations of the Manual of Acceptable Practices (MAP). The same respondent pointed out that the MAP is a supplement to an obsolete minimum property standards. Another respondent pointed out that the MAP is not available in any FmHA office. One respondent agreed with this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The MAP is no longer in print. Guidance pertaining to the size of these facilities can be found in Guide 2 of FmHA Instruction 1924&hyph;A. This section has been changed to reflect the proper reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 35. Section 1944.215(b)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several respondents objected to this way of measuring square footages. Two others objected to restricting congregate units to 110 percent of the minimum square footages since this dimension may not allow sufficient square footages to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. One respondent voiced the opinion that setting the square foot limits will lead to a drop to the minimum footages and adversely impact the rentability. One respondent recommended a lower maximum square footage. One respondent recommended eliminating the reference to ``related facilities'' since their inclusion will distort the square footage of ``living area.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The methodology described in this section for calculating living area is consistent with common industry practices. Congregate living units are not affected by the Americans with Disabilities Act. We do not understand the concern that setting the square foot limit will lead to a drop to the minimum footages since these ranges have been in existence for some time and have not resulted in an automatic drop in square feet. We see no reason to lower the maximum square footage since the size of the unit can be controlled within the allowable ranges. The section has been changed to eliminate ``related facilities'' from being included in the computation of living area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 36. Section 1944.215(e)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two comments were received and the respondents supported this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 37. Section 1944.215(w)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of respondents objected to FmHA's requiring the applicant to reveal the percentage of tax credits it will seek. Several persons appeared to misinterpret the intent of the section. A few of the respondents felt that FmHA is attempting to make the determination of the number of tax credit units the project will receive. One respondent suggested that the section be amended to state that the ``market study'' will be subject to further examination and not the preapplication itself. One respondent points out that if the project is requesting rental assistance, the affordability of basic rent is irrelevant. One person recommended that the word ``percentage'' to changed to ``number'' to avoid confusion. Several persons supported this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA regulations require that the Agency determine whether a proposed project is feasible. In order for a project to be feasible, there must be persons of sufficient incomes to support the expenses and to amortize the loan. The market for 515 projects depends on the existence of persons with a lower level of incomes in those cases where tax credits are awarded to the borrower. Many market analysts are still determining need based on incomes up to the moderate level. This becomes an issue when there is not sufficient rent subsidy for all units. In order to make a proper analysis of feasibility, we must determine the level of incomes which will be required to support the project. Even if the applicant requests 100 percent rental assistance and there is sufficient subsidy to cover all of the units, FmHA is not absolved of its responsibility of examining feasibility. FmHA feels that it is imperative that we are aware of the number of tax credit units anticipated so that the appropriate level of incomes can be studied. In no way does FmHA intend to become involved in the determination of the number of tax credits assigned to a project by the State Agencies. We will, however, provide information to the State Agencies as to the amount of financial assistance granted to the borrower by FmHA. The word ``percentage'' has been changed to ``amount'' and the words ``percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible persons'' have been added.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 38. Section 1944.231(a)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of respondents supported this section with the stipulation that no other preapplication be authorized until the second market study has been completed and a determination made on the original preapplication. Two respondents pointed out that the 45-day period in which to respond to the applicant is not sufficient to accomplish the necessary processing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA agrees that the preapplication hold its position in the ranking and has amended the section to state that no other preapplication will move ahead of the preapplication in question until the feasibility issue has been resolved. The contracts will be similar to those used by the Agency in obtaining appraisals in that the State will let one contract under which the market studies will be prepared by one or more market analysts. This will eliminate the need for contracting for each individual study, thus saving processing time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

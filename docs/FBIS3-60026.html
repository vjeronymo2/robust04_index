This was revealed in a letter to Defense  Secretary Renato De Villa by General Lisandro Abadia, chief of  staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines [AFP].    According to Abadia, some officials and personnel of Narcom  are able to sell illegal drugs that have been confiscated.  Narcom operatives are allegedly giving protection to drug  pushers in exchange for big pay-offs or bribes.    In light of this, Abadia has proposed a system to safeguard  confiscated drugs and to reveal law enforcers involved in drug  pushing.    Meanwhile, Abadia's accusations were immediately denied by  Narcom Chief Ramsey Ocampo. Ocampo admitted that some Narcom  personnel may be involved in drug pushing, but, it does not mean  that the whole command is involved in drug trafficking.    [Begin Ocampo recording in progress] ...unscrupulous  activities of some of our personnel. The complexities mentioned  by Gen. Abadia are based on previous perceptions. [sentence as  heard] As a matter of fact, their claims of service from the  admissions of small-time drug pushers that were arrested before,  well, it is normal that the arrested drug pushers will accuse  Narcom operatives of involvement in irregularities. So far, we  have not handled a case where there has been no counter-charge  against us.</p>

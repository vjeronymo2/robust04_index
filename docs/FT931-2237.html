			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Arts: The voice of Wilfred Owen - Poetry in Performance THIS WEEK, the Shropshire market town of Oswestry celebrated the centenary of the birth of its most famous son, Wilfred Owen, poet of the pity of the Great War, with an evening of readings at the Marches School. It was an great gathering of poets, biographers and other ancillary services: Jon Stallworthy, editor of the poems and author of the official biography; Dominic Hibberd, editor and biographer of Owen's last year; Susannah York, actress; Patricia Beer, Devonian poet; and, last but scarcely least, Ted Hughes. The evening was compered by the Bishop of Shrewsbury. Stallworthy, square-jawed and looking raffish in a tan leather jacket, led off with biographical glimpses of Owen as a boy and youth - his frustrated wish to attend university; his loss of the Christian faith. Unfortunately, Stallworthy has too much of the silver-tongued academic impresario about him  -the voice sings the poems, reminding us too much of the beauties of Poesy and too little of the horrors of the war that the language describes. Susannah York gave us a quartet of Owen favourites, including 'Anthem for Doomed Youth' and 'Dulce et Decorum Est'. Fiercely, fierily dramaturgical, it was a performance of grave, rigid eloquence, a demonstration of professional skills that had been honed to perfection in some drama school. The biographer, Dominic Hibberd, reminded us of the stultifying closeness of the relationship between Owen and his mother, which included a shared habit of using illness as a solution to all difficulties. It seems that on almost every one of his last five birthdays Owen was ill with some hypochondriacal reflex or other - until 1918, the last year of his life, and the one in which he produced his miraculous war poetry. By this time, he had learnt to face down his own devils. Up to this point, the evening had consisted not so much of a calling up of the spirit of Owen as a laudable flourish of Oswestry civic pride in having owned, by the mere fact of his having been born and lived briefly there, such a marvellous writer. The last two readers, Patricia Beer and Ted Hughes, did much to correct that imbalance in the second half. Where other readers had been grandiloquent, Beer - who argued in her little talk that Owen, though not a direct influence upon later poets, had been a great innovator himself in the technical aspects of his poetry by the use of half-rhyme, for example - was plain, and convinced by that very plainness. She also told us certain truths that earlier contributions had seemed to obscure somewhat - for example, that Owen, unlike earlier poets of that war, had written what people did not want to hear, and that that fact alone may have led him to break free of traditional metres. Her own reading of 'Exposure', halting, imperfect, almost prosey, captured perfectly the atmosphere of that poem - especially the way she read its refrain, 'we turn back to our dying', so chillingly flatly. Hughes had sat for the whole evening, great head slumped on his chest, as if lost in some inner maze, and when he rose to speak he clearly felt that there was little to be said, other than to let the poems speak for themselves. What he did say, having been introduced by the Bishop as 'someone else from Dorset', was: 'I'll just read some poems. They're all about dead men'. He gave us just a handful, concluding with 'After Strange Meeting', but each reading was definitive and each poem spoken as if it had been lived from the inside. Only metaphor does justice to Hughes's voice: its subterranean energies; its baleful brutishness, which matches the brutality of Owen's own language because Owen was a poet who, in those last 12 months of his life, and still only 25 years old, transformed himself from some pale, fluttering, Keatsian thing into a poet who had somehow been empowered by suffering to treat directly of the most horrible and sordid things that one man could ever do to another. Hughes captured all this. 'This is a horrible one,' he said of the fragment which begins 'My soul looks down from a vague height with death', and all its numbing horror came spewing out. It was a concluding moment of brilliant and unsurpassed discomfort.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Halifax expresses interest in merger Halifax, the UK's largest building society, yesterday expressed an interest in merging with another society, in a further sign of the growing pressure for a restructuring of the financial services industry. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, said Halifax wanted to be able to play its full part in the 'radical rationalisation' of the mortgage lending industry. 'This could include a merger with another society,' he told Halifax's annual general meeting. With assets of Pounds 67bn, Halifax is already almost twice the size of the next largest society, Nationwide. In 1993 it made about 18 per cent of total net advances in the UK mortgage market. Only Abbey National, a former society which is now a bank, lent on a similar scale. Mr David Gilchrist, Halifax corporate development manager, said the society had wanted to correct the impression that somehow it was 'standing aloof' from possible mergers. Halifax would be interested in a merger which increased its mortgage market share. In this context, he made it clear that one of the changes Halifax was seeking from the current Treasury review of building society legislation was a relaxation of the strict rules on the bonus payments that can be made from reserves in a merger between two societies. The Halifax declaration introduces a further element of speculation into the societies sector, which has been galvanised by Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn cash offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest society. If the Lloyds bid overcomes the legal challenge which begins today in the High Court, then it is likely to act as the trigger for other banks which have said they would like to buy societies to press ahead with making offers. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said that the most attractive candidates for Halifax were likely to be Yorkshire, Birmingham Midshires, Coventry, Derbyshire and Northern Rock - all just outside the 10 largest societies in terms of asset size. But he added that Halifax would have a job to persuade the management teams running such societies of the benefits of a merger. Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, has told the society's 24,000 staff, that its aim was to take a 'significantly bigger share' of mortgage lending.</p>

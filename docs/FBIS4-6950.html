			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, April 23 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge [KR]  guerrillas killed six people and injured 35 others when they  ambushed a train running from the capital to Cambodia's second  city of Battambang, the director of the state railway said  Saturday.    "A group of about 40 Khmer Rouge laid six mines along the  track and after the train hit the mines, they opened fire on the  carriages," Pich Kimsreang, the railway director, said.    The engine was damaged and 11 coaches were derailed by the  blast, he said.    The ambush took place Thursday in the Bakan district of  western Pursat province, he added.    A firefight between the guerrillas and the railway militia  went on for about an hour until the militia ran out of  ammunition and ran to seek help from the local police or  military, the director said.    "The Khmer Rouge then occupied the train for about five  hours  and robbed all the passengers. They took all the valuable  belongings including 10 motorbikes," he said.    The guerrillas retreated when government forces arrived on  the scene.</p>

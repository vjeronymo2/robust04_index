			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Observer: Last of the oil mavericks Forget any suggestion that tonight's annual dinner of the Association of Independent Exploration Companies will be a dull affair because Board of Trade president Michael Heseltine is not putting in an appearance. The news that Roland Shaw, one of the few real characters left in the industry, is finally quitting the executive suite should cause a stir. The 71-year-old American-born oilman has defied gravity for so long that it is hard to imagine the industry without him. A big man in all senses of the word, he has dominated Premier and championed the once-flourishing independent sector since the early 1970s. His presence at Premier, which is now a minnow compared with the likes of Enterprise and Lasmo, is often cited as one of the reasons why Premier did not fall prey to predators - like so many of its rivals. Even the most ruthless shied away from tangling with Shaw. When he retires for good - he will remain non-executive chairman for the moment - the sector will be a much duller place. Men in grey suits are far less exciting than big men with big ideas.</p>

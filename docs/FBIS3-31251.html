			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 15 Feb (TANJUG) -- Greek Foreign Minister  Karolos Papoulias, who has held talks in Belgrade with Serbian  President Slobodan Milosevic, said after the talks today that he  arrived in Belgrade, as the chairman of the European Union [EU]  Council of Ministers, to do his utmost to prevent the worst --  NATO air attacks against the Bosnian Serbs.    "Although we are going through a difficult time, we are  still  optimistic to a certain degree and we believe that the worst  will be avoided. That would be useful not only for the Balkans  but also for the whole of Europe," Papoulias said.    Describing his talks with President of Serbia Slobodan  Milosevic as "cordial, as usual," Papoulias stressed that at  this moment in time it is extremely important to direct all  efforts toward finding a peaceful solution to the Bosnian  conflict, and also underlined that it is important that all the  key players accept the EU's peace plan.    Reminding journalists that Greece has reservations as  regards  the latest NATO decision on the ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs,  Papoulias said -- stressing that he is speaking about this as  the Greek foreign minister, not as the EU chairman -- that  Greece has reservations essentially because it does not believe  that actions such as air attacks could contribute toward  achieving peace in Bosnia.    "We insist on the resumption of negotiations, that is, on  finding a solution to the Bosnian conflict through negotiation,"  Papoulias said, emphasizing that the NATO decision on air  strikes was made against the wishes of the Greek Government.    Replying to numerous questions which exclusively referred to  the NATO threat against the Bosnian Serbs, the Greek foreign  minister said that, according to the latest information, the  process of withdrawing heavy weapons from the positions around  Sarajevo in under way, which is cause for hope, and that he sees  no reason for additional pressure on the Serbs.    "I believe, however, that the withdrawal of heavy weapons is  not an obligation for the Bosnian Serbs alone. The same should  be done by Bosnian Muslims," Papoulias said, adding: "Greek  policy is well known -- all the warring sides in Bosnia must  make the same concessions in order to restore peace and maintain  the EU peace initiative. As a country that holds the EU  presidency, Greece insists on this."    What will Athens do if, nevertheless, air strikes take  place?    "We are doing everything in our power to avoid the spread of  the war, because there is a real danger of the Bosnian crisis  spreading south. Should that happen, it would mean a dramatic  escalation of the conflict which would no longer be limited to  the Balkans but would also be a European conflict, given the  fact that nobody in that case could rule out the possibility of  the involvement of third parties."    As EU president, is Greece is able to convene an urgent  session of the EU ministers before the NATO ultimatum expires?    "Yes, this possibility exists and we are examining it,"  Papoulias briefly replied without going into details.    At the end of his news conference, the Greek foreign  minister  confirmed that the Belgian, German, and Greek foreign ministers  will meet in Athens tomorrow and that Andrey Kozyrev will be  joining them.    "This is the usual practice of the EU troika (the former,  present and the future president), and dialogue with Russia fits  into this. However, one of the issues to which we will devote  attention will be the crisis in former Yugoslavia," Karolos  Papoulias said.</p>

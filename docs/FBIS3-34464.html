			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. 'Umar Baridu, first under secretary of the  Foreign Ministry, reviewed at the ministry's forum today the  statement issued by the African, Caribbean, and Pacific group of  states -- the Lome Convention states -- in reply to the  statement issued by the European Union accusing Sudan of human  rights violations. His excellency praised the attitude of the  Lome Convention states in asking the European Union to be  patient and to respond to Sudan's invitation to send a joint  fact-finding mission. The Lome Convention states said the  convention would lose credibility if it let itself be exploited  as a tool to increase the difficulties faced by any of its  peoples.    Mr. Baridu also reviewed the activities of Sudan's  delegation  during the meetings of the OAU ministerial council held recently  in Addis Ababa.    His excellency also described the massacre perpetrated by  the  Serbian forces against defenseless civilians in Sarajevo as a  hideous crime that shook the pillars of the accords of  international legality and highlighted the weakness of the new  world order. Baridu affirmed that the great powers, the members  of the Security Council, had badly failed in their efforts to  solve the issue of Bosnia, saying that this failure would  diminish the UN's importance. He said Sudan had issued a  statement demanding the lifting of the siege on Sarajevo and for  the Muslim Bosnian people to be allowed to obtain weapons to  defend themselves.</p>

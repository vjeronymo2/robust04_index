			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Shell may face boycott call SHELL, the oil company, could face union calls for a consumer boycott of its products. The unions will step up their campaign against de-recognition in the oil industry at a special conference in London on Wednesday. BP, Esso, Mobil and Shell have all derecognised unions over the past two years but Shell is being targeted over plans to cut 100 jobs at its Shell Haven refinery in Essex, and the introduction of personal contracts for the remaining employees.</p>

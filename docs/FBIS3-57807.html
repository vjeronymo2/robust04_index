			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Final installment of a two-part interview with President </F> Suleyman Demirel by Ilnur Cevik and Ismet G. Imset in Ankara on  21 December]    [Text] Ilnur Cevik: The point we want to make is this:  Now as a result of all of these incidents, there are a people  in the Southeast. A people made up of citizens of the Turkish  Republic. These people are, unfortunately, being thrown out of  their villages in one way or another. And these people, for  instance, are increasing the population of Diyarbakir from  350,000 to 950,000. Don't you think this is creating a great  social problem for Turkey?    Suleyman Demirel: Of course, it will. The social problem is  this. (Showing a list of people massacred by the PKK [Kurdish  Workers Party]). If these people were not killed in this way,  the people there would not leave their settlements and go. It  is not the state which is moving them.    Cevik: What will be done for these people?    Demirel: Every kind of assistance will be given for these  people and is already being given even with deficiencies. The  state is aware of this issue, and the issue was raised in a very  recent meeting. It is not that the state is not sensitive to  what is going on in Turkey. We know all of these. What is  happening where and so on. But there is an incident. Ilnur,  this is what I am trying to explain. These things have not been  happening for only a year. Look, so many incidents have happened  in the past eight years. In a decade in Turkey, 8,423 acts of  violence have taken place--in this region. And in these  incidents, 1,997 soldiers of the state are martyred. Why are  they martyred? Is the state there to kill the people? No.  There is a gang which is killing the state's soldiers, 1997  people. This gang has also killed 2,666 citizens. These 1,997  people are dying so that this 2,666 citizens don't die. Are the  soldiers of the state of the Turkish Republic an occupation  force there?    Cevik: Of course not.    Demirel: Of course not. Why are they dying? Because there  is a gang against them. With what else could the state of  Turkey struggle against this gang? It raids your (military)  station. Why does it raid your station? What is the measure to  be used against this? Is the measure to withdraw your stations  and leave the area to them? We won't do that.. We won't do that  in any way.    Ismet G. Imset: But Mr. President, there is something else  happening in recent days. The stations specifically in rural  areas are being closed down and being withdrawn to more  concentrated centers. After our recent trip with Hasan Cemal to  northern Iraq, coming back to Turkey, we sort of had to force  our way into Turkey. The soldiers there said that after 16:00,  one could not go out on the streets, that the PKK was in control  of the roads, especially the Habur-Diyarbakir road. And, in  fact, at around 17:00, they stopped us and looked at us asking  whether we were crazy to be on the road. One of them asked,  "How can you travel at this time of the night?" And, Hasan Cemal  and I were surprised. Previously, we knew that one could not  walk outside after 19:00 or 20:00, but we did not know something  like this was going on.    What you have said is something we want to stress anyway. We  want the state to be in the region more than it is. We want the  state to be in control of the highways, roads and districts.  But this is something which we cannot see much of. As if the  state is getting lost.    Demirel: Can the state be lost? This is exactly what  efforts are being expended to prevent. The state, in that  corner of the country, and by making ineffective those who are  responsible for all kinds of problems, is working to make  justice reign without difference between day and night. Because  of this, so many people have been martyred. The state is trying  to guard its borders. To guard its people. So many people have  died. The state is exerting efforts so they won't die. And for  them not to die, children at the age of 20 from this country's  Izmir and this country's Tekirdag are going to those mountains.    Imset: Sir, there appears also to be issues on the  international scale. For instance on Armenia, we have received  news that Ocalan is planning to move his headquarters from Syria  to that country... Of course, this could be Syrian  disinformation. But there is the Armenian issue, the recent  developments in Russia.    With regard to regional issues, how do you see Turkey's  position? For instance, there is something an Ankara taxi driver  told us. He thanks God that Ozal is no longer here for, he  explained, too many people visited the capital, the roads were  jammed but now they are very much less congested. What is  happening? Is Turkey's importance in the world being lost?    Demirel: Why should Turkey's importance in the world be  lost? What is the reason for this? Could an Ankara driver be the  criteria for this?    Imset: Of course not. I was just going to say that when we  talk to foreign officials and ambassadors, even officials we  know in Washington, we get the message that Turkey is on the  wrong path and that since they are allies, they are planning to  warn Turkey especially in the next two-month period.    Demirel: What is the wrong path?    Imset: Mainly on human rights, sir.    Demirel: Are the people who are being killed not human  being?    Imset: They are, sir, but those killing them are working  under the standards of "bandits." But because we are a state we  have different...    Demirel: What? Should the state not kill bandits? Is this  what is being said? Who else but the bandits is the state  killing?    Cevik: They ask why the state is not protecting the regional  people.    Demirel: It is because the state is trying to protect the  regional people that these people are becoming martyrs. My  brother, there is a fire here. Can anyone claim that the forces  of the Turkish Republic are turning their guns on the people  within this fire? No one can claim this. The state is trying  to protect the regional people. I don't understand where we  will reach hitting the state from here to there. If these  duties cannot be fulfilled, then you will see the chaos. We are  saying that these duties should remain to be fulfilled.    Now, I don't know who has come and told you these things, in  the past six months, 14 foreign state officials have come here  and visited Turkey. These were on the level of king, of  president and of prime minister.    What has Ozal done under this Constitution that once he  went,  Turkey regressed? There is no need for such arguments and  actually I don't enter such arguments. What happened when Ozal  was here that is not happening when he is not here?    Cevik: In recent days what we have continuously been hearing  in Turkey, from officials as well, is that Jalal Talabani is a  liar or something along these lines. Is Talabani no longer a  credible person for Ankara?    Demirel: There is no criteria for credibility. It is not  possible for me, as the president of the Turkish Republic, to  lend credibility to this or that person. Talabani's statements  that they (Ankara) asked us to extend the (PKK) cease-fire are  completely untrue. As we have never accepted APO (PKK leader  Abdullah Ocalan) as a counterpart, we would never have told  Talabani to go and say this to him. We never said this. You  are also well-aware of this.    Imset: There were reports that APO was arrested. We could  not get them confirmed. Have you received anything information  on this?    Demirel: There is nothing that has reached me to this  effect. I am not in a position to confirm or deny the reports.  But I don't think they are true.    Imset: Do you believe that there has been a change in the  attitudes of Syria and Iran?    Demirel: I have spoken with the Iranian first vice  president. He appears to be very sincere and interested in the  issue of cooperating against terrorism.    Imset: Then can something really be expected? Perhaps a  joint operation with Iran in the region?    Demirel: It is possible. These issues are being discussed.    Cevik: As we enter 1994, political turmoil is apparent in  Turkey. This is especially evident within the country's  political parties and, particularly, within the True Path Party  (DYP) which is in power. Do you feel that since you have left  the prime ministry, Turkey has entered a period of instability?  Will there be changes in the political spectrum in the new year?    Demirel: There is no instability. Stability is this: The  game has its rules and you play by the rules. Fair play. Look,  what is being ignored is this--and we have a capability of  ignoring good things: In the past 30 years, the election of a  president in Turkey has always become an incident. Today,  Turkey does not even feel that a president is being elected.  Governmental problems used to surface when the president was  elected. And they did surface. But weren't they solved there  and then? You may like or dislike who comes to power. This is  your personal right. But the regime has worked in Turkey. It  has produced the government. Turkey has a government. This  depends on the trust of the Grand National Assembly (TBMM). The  Turkish Grand National Assembly is on top of its  responsibilities. And, the Turkish Grand National Assembly has,  in the past two years, handled 25 motions, 27 general debates,  39 investigations and 420 verbal questions. In other words, all  institutions of the Turkish state are on top of their  responsibilities and I believe this is very beneficial. Just go  and see whether you would find this in Poland or in Hungary.  The Turkish state has institutions, it has a judiciary which  everyone should be proud of. It has created this judiciary in  70 years. It has supreme courts, whether you like or dislike  their decisions. There is the prosecution whose door you can  knock on without having to try to claim your own rights. And,  there is nothing like instability in Turkey. Turkey's mission  is being fulfilled. Whether good, bad, too little or too much,  it is being fulfilled. It has a government, Parliament, police,  courts, governors, everything. And, I must say clearly that the  value of Turkey must be recognized.    But everyone must realize the value of this democracy in  Turkey without forgetting what kind of past we have had. Today,  just compare the city of Ankara with its population of three  million to European cities of the same scale. See what happens.  At any time of the night, in this city of Ankara, you can  easily walk with your hands in your pockets...    Compare Istanbul, a city of 10 million, with cities of the  same size. When you compare it, the number of incidents are  less than forty-to-one. And, the state is in control even in  the most remote corners of the country...    The problem is only in the southeast region. Turkey's  problem is inside the corridor staring from Tunceli--Tunceli,  Bingol, Kulp, Sirnak, Mardin and Hakkari--and connecting to  northern Iraq. Until the recent incidents in Adiyaman, there  had not been a single occurrence there. In Erzurum and  Erzincan, there have been incidents only in the areas close to  Tunceli.    I certainly do not agree with view that the Southeast  problem  has spread and become a problem of the eastern region as well.  I went to Erzurum where the governor there is quite content  with his position. I went to Kars and observed the Liberation  Day celebrations.    The Turkish state is not a state that is crumbling. It must  function in a better way and many things should be improved.  But if you say we won't improve, that nothing can be done with  us or that neither our democracy or our state is worth anything,  such claims simply cannot be.    Imset: Recently in a newspaper article, you had made a  statement that was said to have been related to the Democracy  Party (DEP). There you said whoever sympathizes with the bandits  are murderers. Some columnists even commented on this and said  it could have been a remark made in error. The DEP is a party  that emerged from the elections with 17 deputies. One of them  has been killed. When you look at the DEP what do you see? How  do you regard this party?    Demirel: I don't have to comment on this. Is there any  reason? Don't you see what it is? Why are you asking me what  the Democracy Party is? Have you not watched its congress? Did  you not hear what the man was saying at its congress? Why ask  me? Write it exactly like this: The DEP is whatever was seen  in its congress. As far as the incident involving the Democracy  Party... Would the chief prosecutor have demanded the closure of  a party out of nowhere?    Cevik: Sir, Ismet wrote an article which was in the form of  a declaration asking the Democracy Party to condemn the PKK for  the killing of women and children, but they didn't do it.    Demirel: Then why ask me?    Imset: I asked because of this. Within the Democracy Party  there are a group of deputies whom we know are not pro-PKK. In  fact, they have sought a dialogue with Ankara, sort of looking  for a bailout. But when, suddenly, all levels of the state  launched a concentrated effort against the DEP, it gave the  impression that the state just wanted the DEP to leave  Parliament. Alright, this may be what the public wants and  there is a public reaction. But the PKK is also in favor of the  DEP's departure from Parliament. When we look at Ocalan's  recent orders and his articles, and at his attacks on the Ahmet  Turk family, what he is saying is that the DEP should withdraw  from Parliament. And, during that time, we were writing many  articles in favor of the DEP's continued presence in Parliament  because we realized that once the DEP withdrew, it would only  serve the aims of the PKK. It appears that we (Turkey) are  giving these people the impression that we want to force them up  into the mountains.    Demirel: Who is providing this image?    Imset: For instance the investigations that are being  initiated on a legal basis. For instance there are  parliamentarians today who have been suspected of very serious  crimes, including tax evasion, but they have immunity. Such  crimes in the law are referred to as ordinary crimes. On the  other hand, there is the Democracy Party. I accept that some are  linked to the PKK and I have even witnessed Ocalan sending  orders to them, but in the end, the government they entered  first was your government. It appears that there is a  contradiction. As if all of this activity against them were  being conducted simply because the public wants it.    Demirel: We have come to the same point again. There is  confusion here. There is a judiciary state. Someone commits a  crime and the laws agree it's a crime. If nothing is done to  him, nothing should be done to someone else who commits a crime.  You can't ask for this. Because two wrongs don't make a right.  The first is a mistake and the other is a mistake as well.  Here, you as a journalist, cannot take on the duty of the judge  or prosecutor. You can only report the incident. If you put  yourself in the place of the judge or prosecutor after exposing  the incident, it is no longer journalism. It takes on a  different form.    Now the funerals of young children have come to the square  of  Turkey. Ten to fifteen thousand people participate in these  funerals. What I fear is that the situation has gotten worse.  Tomorrow, in various parts of Turkey--where citizens of  southeastern origin are greater in number than those in the  southeast region itself--there may be a demand for them to leave  these areas and there are no measures to prevent this. There  are measures against the man on the mountain. And I am taking  care of this. But now these people have started to shout. You  say you have told them to condemn those killings of children,  but they have not done this. Alright, these man who cannot even  raise their voices against the killings of children, are  actually approving the killing of children, approving of the  killing of soldiers. And, the soldiers on those mountains at  minus 28 degrees are struggling to defend this country. When  they return in a casket, the people ask what are these people  doing in Parliament. And, tomorrow, the people will create  great debates with regard to this Parliament. I told them (DEP)  so many times, come here, get up and say we have no relations  with this bloody terrorist gang, we condemn these incidents.  Are you free enough to say this? Yet, they could not say  anything...    I declare openly that whoever is supporting those shedding  blood or sympathizing with them are the murderers of our  martyred citizens. I said this even from the rostrum of the  Grand National Assembly. If I don't say this, who will? If you  are not going to say anything to those who kill 5-month-old  infants, where is your humanity?    This is what I am revolting against. Don't misunderstand me.    Imset: I think what was unfortunate was that while you were  making such statements, the chief of staff announced that the  PKK had 375,000 sympathizers. When the two statements came  together, the 375,000 became a target.    Demirel: It may be. It may be. It may even be higher.  What, can I say there is no trouble if you say nothing to those  killing five-month-old children and even support them? I am not  doing this duty as a president but as a person who has given the  best 45 years of his life for this country.    The situation is like this. You always take the incident in  a single-sided way. Troops went here or there, destroyed one  village or another, harassed the people and so on. But the  problem is not this. And the result is it appears as though you  are not in favor of the other man shedding blood but you do not  view it as that much of a crime either.    In other words, the argument is "what should this man do? If  the state is pushing him to and fro, he has nothing else to do."  This is a conclusion which the West is coming to. Don't come  to the same conclusion yourself. I must be open, I struggled  against the West after the Cyprus issue as well. I can struggle  with all of them. Are human beings not human beings? The men  say nothing to them. Is this not human rights?    I say it again, in England, France and Germany, whatever  there is in the form of measures to prevent human rights  violations, the same exists in my country as well. What is  there? I'll tell you: There is an open regime...    I am among the people everyday. Everyone can say anything  they want. They can say everything, no one tells them not to.  Again there is a free judiciary in this country. If there is a  human rights violation, this is a crime. It is no different  than attacking somewhere. There is a Parliament. Everything is  said there even at this hour. Then there are squares in this  country. Appear at the squares and protest against them.    Cevik: They would arrest us then, sir. Just try to appear  at that square in Turkey!    Demirel: You appear there. If they take you away, I'll come  and free you.    Imset: Sir, the State Security Court even opened an  investigation of Dogu Ergil.    Demirel: They can. An investigation is something different.  A verdict is another matter. A verdict can also be passed.    Imset: As long as the State Security Courts are open, of  course such a verdict will be passed. You had promises related  to these.    Demirel: I had no promise on State Security Courts.    Imset: You promised to deal with the remnants of the  military regime.    Demirel: We have nothing against the State Security Courts.  Turkey comes from out of chaos. The Turkish courts were courts  which could not pass sentences. The State Security Courts are  measures born out of this. We have not said a single word that  we would abolish the State Security Courts. What would you do?  With what would you create a democratic authority? Don't touch  criminals! Some people should have criminal immunity! This  cannot be democratic authority. The problem of Turkey is the  vacuum of democratic authority!Look 6,000 people have been  killed in Turkey. How many people were punished? Turkey's  problem is that it could not deal with illegalities. It could  not make the judiciary function. It caught the man, but watched  him escape from prison. Then came an amnesty and everyone came  out. The people who are damaged are those killed and their  families, but no one is fighting for their rights.    A merciful feeling comes at one period, and then everyone  starts defending a number of killers. This cannot be democracy.  Such a democracy cannot be defended. You cannot make such a  democracy function.    I'll say this openly; Turkey should not come to the point of  where it will miss these days.    The State Security Courts can open investigations and put  people on trial...    Imset: What happened to Ozgur Gundem seems to be an  outstanding example of press freedoms. What do you have to say  about this?    Demirel: I'll give you the note which has been given to me  with regard to the search conducted at Ozgur Gundem. Can you  defend this? No one can defend this:    According to telephone conversations between Ozgur Gundem  Editor in Chief Gurbetelli Ersoz and PKK European representative  Mustafa Karasu (code named Huseyin) as well as Faysal Dumlayici,  who is making press statements under the name of Kani Yilmaz as  the ERNK [National Liberation Front of Kurdistan] representative  (recorded with permission from the republic prosecutors office),  information has been obtained that the newspaper is completely  affiliated to the PKK. Under a decision taken by the State  Security Court, a search was conducted of Ozgur Gundem and the  Zagros printing house, and it revealed the bloodstained diary  and the bullet-riddled identification card of private Muzaffer  Ulusata, who was martyred on March 9, 1993, in a clash with  terrorists in the Findikli district of Sirnak.    This is what has been found. Documents showing that articles  written by Abdullah Ocalan were published under the name Ali  Firat. Documents which show that all of the executives of the  newspaper are appointed by the PKK and are people known in the  past to have carried out executive duties in the PKK  organization. In fact, Editor in Chief Gurbetelli Ersoz is  known to have been the Cukurova regional PKK executive in the  past. An ERNK invoice of 400 million liras which shows that  donations have been collected for the PKK.    Now you are calling this a newspaper office and write:  "Today them, tomorrow us." Can you defend this?    Cevik: But we are not defending this. Sir, when you were  prime minister, we wrote about these things and said them.  Especially then there were orders being received from the PKK.  We were even made into a target.    Demirel: What is Ozgur Gundem for you that you show it as an  example for democracy in Turkey?    Cevik: But sir, something done to one place could be done to  another tomorrow. I am talking not only about what has been  done to a newspaper. This has been done even to you.    Demirel: No sir, I was neither an arsonist...    Cevik: But they did it despite this!    Demirel: They did nothing to me. What did the man do to me?  He forced me to stay in my house. Did I stay I my house? I  broke through the walls and came out. I had neither a gun, nor  a knife nor anything else. I was only right. I mean this man  is going to collect money for the PKK, and the same PKK will go  and massacre 29 innocent citizens in the Sunduz plateau. It  will kill so many soldiers and then what is being done? What  else can be done?</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> APPEAL COURT ORDERS NEW SENTENCING IN ABDUCTION OF OFFICER  </P> <P> An appellate court, finding that the trial judge had erred, ordered Monday that  an Arizona man be resentenced for abducting an Irvine police officer at  gunpoint. But the court refused to throw out his conviction altogether.  </P> <P> Edward M. Reyna Jr., 46, of Peoria, Ariz., drew a sentence of nearly 13 years  following an attempted murder conviction for wrestling a police officer to the  ground, grabbing his .357-caliber revolver and trying to kidnap him and take  him to Mexico on Sept. 19, 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Officer Found Cocaine  </P> <P> A fugitive from Arizona, Reyna was pulled over along the San Diego Freeway  after Irvine Police Officer Thomas Friday observed Reyna's car weaving in  traffic. After the officer searched Reyna and discovered several vials of  cocaine, Reyna managed to grab Friday's gun and hold it, cocked, at the young  officer's head, threatening to kill him.  </P> <P> Friday, who testified that he was ordered at gunpoint to drive Reyna to Mexico,  was able to bring the vehicle to a screeching halt and then knock the gun away  from Reyna, wrestling him out of the car. Another officer, who arrived on the  scene as the pair struggled beside the roadway, then aided in the arrest.  </P> <P> Friday, who was 26 at the time of the incident and was serving only his second  week alone on patrol, was lauded for heroics that later were dramatized in  police training films. But the incident took its toll emotionally. Friday took  a medical leave from the force because of mental stress. He has not returned to  the job.  </P> <P> Reyna appealed his conviction for attempted murder, maintaining that Friday  discovered the vials of cocaine through an unlawful search. Reyna also  complained that his attorney was unfairly prevented from trying to discredit  Friday's testimony by questioning him during a preliminary hearing about what  effect the attack had had on the officer's career.  </P> <P> But the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana, in its decision released  Monday, rejected both those claims as it upheld Reyna's conviction.  </P> <P> The justices did, however, find fault with Reyna's sentencing.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Superior Court Judge James K. Turner, citing Reyna's history of  criminal convictions, ordered him to serve 12 years and 8 months in prison for  attempted murder, kidnaping and the use of a gun.  </P> <P> But the appellate court on Monday ruled that Reyna essentially faced a double  jeopardy. It faulted Turner for citing Reyna's use of a gun both in imposing  the maximum possible sentence for attempted murder, and in adding an extra 2  years to his total sentence for using a gun.  </P> <P> Reyna now must be resentenced. But Mathew Vallance, who prosecuted the case,  said he expects Reyna to receive the same sentence when he returns to Superior  Court. Vallance said other factors in the incident besides Reyna's use of a gun  could be considered in imposing the maximum cumulative penalty.  </P> <P> "My opinion (in February, 1987) was that he should have gotten the maximum  sentence, and that remains the same today," said Vallance, who is now in  private practice. "I wish the judge could have given him more than he got."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'This Guy Is Dangerous'  </P> <P> Lt. Michael White of the Irvine Police Department, which supported Judge  Turner's imposition of the maximum sentence, said the appellate ruling was a  disappointment. "This guy is dangerous, and he should be put away for a long  time," White said.  </P> <P> Friday could not be reached for comment after the ruling.  </P> <P> In September, 1987, the city of Irvine sued the manufacturer of the Police  Department's holsters, Hoyt Holster Co. of Costa Mesa, charging that the  company had reneged on its promise to provide "unequaled safety" for officers.  The suit is pending in Orange County Superior Court.  </P></p>

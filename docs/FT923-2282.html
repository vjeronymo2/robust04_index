			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Halifax defies gloom with 4% increase HALIFAX, the largest UK building society, yesterday defied the gloom in the housing market by announcing a 4 per cent increase in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 318m for the half year to July 31. Mr Jon Foulds, chairman, described the results as good figures in a bad market. 'They confirm the underlying financial strength of the Halifax,' he said. However, Mr Foulds gave a warning about profits in the remainder of the year. 'It is unrealistic to look for an improved second half year, and after yesterday's events we remain even more concerned about the continued depressed state of the housing market.' He called on the government to take measures to improve the housing market, otherwise any recovery would be deferred. In spite of Mr Foulds's warning, Halifax's profits growth in the first half contrasted impressively with the 10 per cent fall in interim profits of Abbey National, the second largest UK mortgage lender. Total assets of the society rose by 9 per cent on a year ago to Pounds 61bn. The bad debt charge for the period was up nearly 10 per cent to Pounds 135m. Total income grew 6 per cent to Pounds 791m, and interest income was up 3 per cent at Pounds 611m. Despite the lack of demand in the market, Halifax's mortgage book grew to Pounds 51.1bn, up from Pounds 46.5bn a year earlier and Pounds 49m at the end of January, and its share of the mortgage market has risen to 19 per cent, against 10 per cent a year ago. The increase appears to reflect a partial withdrawal from the market by smaller lenders. Halifax refuses to give any details of its problems with mortgage arrears and repossessions, beyond saying that evictions were down by 40 per cent in the half year because of its policy of showing greater forebearance to customers in serious difficulty. Mr David Gilchrist, general manager, said very few customers indeed had been saved through the 'rent-into-mortgage' schemes advocated by the government last December. Savings deposits held by Halifax in the half year were Pounds 48.7bn (Pounds 45.3bn), but the bulk of the increase came from capitalised interest. Halifax's 500-branch estate agency chain reduced its loss from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 4.4m.</p>

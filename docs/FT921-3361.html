			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Travel: Once bitten by the Borneo bug SMALL BLACK ants dismembered a white moth and hauled the wings down a dark crack in the wooden floor. Pale-bodied geckos stalked the walls of the hut, while a generator hammered into the forest night at the foot of Gunung Mulu mountain, the base for exploring limestone caves tucked behind the Brunei border in Sarawak, eastern Malaysia. The Gunung Mulu caves are among the largest in the world, but little-known and little-explored. They lie a day's journey up the Batang Baram river from the coastal town of Miri in northern Sarawak, although both the journey-time and the adventure will diminish when an airstrip and multi-storey hotel open in the Gunung Mulu National Park this year. Tourists can already fly half-way to the caves. A 20-minute flight from Miri to the river town of Marudi replaces a jarring three-hour trip by express boat. VIPs and executives hire helicopters, but the rest of the population travels through the rain forest as it always has done - up the Batang Baram river, which follows the border with Brunei. The express boats travel at great speeds, powered by enormous Cummins diesels. Air-conditioned passengers recline inside a claustrophobic steel cabin, which has only two narrow exits, usually blocked by bags, chickens, suitcases and the odd 4 ft blowpipe. I preferred to sit on the roof, watching the green forest roar by. The express boat nosed into the river bank at remote logging camps, picking up passengers and dropping off cardboard boxes of supplies, before hurtling up the loops and whirls of the river. Our helmsman, who peered out of a tiny cockpit at the prow of the express, missed a stray log. It hit the hull with a bang and damaged the propeller. The boat wallowed in the brown water until we were rescued and transferred, in mid-stream, to another express. The expresses travel up-river until it is too shallow. At the small settlement of Long Panai, where a long house and huts stood in a clearing by the river, I was bundled off the express and into a small wooden boat. Nixon the driver gunned an enormous outboard motor and the cockleshell shot between rocks and branches. Cold rain beat into my face and misty clouds hung round the peaks of Gunung Mulu. Where it is protected, virgin rain forest soars into the air, the straight-boled trees forming a natural canopy. But where the trees have been logged outside Sarawak's parks, a tangle of matted vegetation forms as secondary forest - assumed by most visitors to be natural rain forest. My guide, Richard, took me to Clearwater cave, where a very loud party of Chinese tourists were eating lunch on raised wooden walkways. Away from the noise and inside the looming darkness stood stalagmites and limestone formations. Cockroaches burrowed into rock-hard piles of guano. The stench of ammonia filled the air. Bats hung in their thousands overhead. Richard picked up a squirming millipede and squashed it, his hand glowing from a luminous secretion. The caves are vast, but huge caverns like the Sarawak Chamber are only accessible to serious cavers. At Deer Cave we left the tourists behind and set off for the Garden of Eden. We walked for half-an-hour up and down a wooden walkway on the floor of the cave, and scrambled over slippery boulders. Eden was a cold river with crystal water, towering trees and a soaring cliff face. That evening we waited for the bats to fly out from the cave to begin their nocturnal search for food, but they weren't playing. I returned to Miri by boat and travelled by bus to Batu Niah, 100 kms south along the main road which follows the Sarawak coast. The Niah caves excited great interest when its Painted Cave yielded the remains of 40,000-year-old Homo sapiens, although the site is now sadly neglected behind a crude barbed wire fence. Ancient orange paintings surround the remains of wooden ships of the dead, but the wooden boats are breaking up, apparently forgotten by the park authorities. Official permits are solemnly issued at park headquarters, but not a guide was to be seen anywhere on the sweaty 3 kms walk to the caves themselves. A high steel fence bars a narrow entrance to the caves and is meant to deter illegal nest collecting. But the gate in the fence is unlocked, and the nests of swiftlets are collected day and night. Young boys swarmed up flimsy bamboo poles and scaffolding to scrape the nests from the roof of the caves. Their helpers, up to 100 m below, collect the glutinous fragments in plastic bags. The floor of the cave was littered with the collectors' old batteries and torch bulbs. Modern Malaysia and the tourist industry is removing the mystery from Borneo  -the swiftlets are almost certainly decreasing in numbers. But ancient Borneo is not quite finished. A friendly insect fell down my shirt and squirted burning acid on to my shoulder. A black scab formed, unalleviated by the Axeoil potion carried by my Malaysian companion. It was the bite of the Borneo love-bug, he said. The mark has yet to fade.</p>

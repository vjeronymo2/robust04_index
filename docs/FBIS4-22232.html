			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mykola Tymchuk, professor, economic commentator </F> for UKRAYINSKA HAZETA, president of the Nauka--Rehionu  Association: "Separatism Stirring Where Anti-Ukrainian  Sentiments Exist. The Causes of Economic Collapse and Ways To  Overcome It"--Conclusion. -- see FBIS-USR-94-030 28 Mar 94 pp  20-22 for first installment]    [Text] First part in No. 4    It is imperative for a large state like Ukraine to pursue an  economic policy with respect to her regions that takes into  account the ethnic, demographic, natural and climatic, and  resource characteristics of a region's development. For nearly a  year, the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and the presidential  structures have been developing and discussing a draft of the  basic directions that Ukraine's regional economic policy should  take, but so far, as in the case of most key normative and  legislative decisions, this document has not been approved by  the Supreme Council, even though the president has cited this  draft on many occasions in his speeches.    As one who took part in drafting individual provisions of  the  above document at a certain stage of its preparation, the author  of this article believes that the implementation of economic  independence requires that the state regional policy guarantee  local governing organs the following essential powers:    a) to make policy regarding the development of education,  health care, culture, and other aspects of the social  infrastructure, taking into account the historical, national,  and demographic characteristics of the given region.  Unfortunately, because of the economic crisis, practically  nothing is being done at this time to solve these problems;    b) to implement measures directed at the socioeconomic  revival of the country's rural regions. Towards this end, it is  necessary to develop regional programs, based on the national  program for social rural renewal, specifying the necessary  sources and funds to finance these objectives;    c) to create finance and budget as well as credit and  banking  systems, which would interact with the state system. The regions  should have the funds they need to pay for their socioeconomic  programs, drawing on various sources of revenues into the budget  and into extrabudgetary funds;    d) to create a regional taxation system, which would make it  possible to create local budgets. As a matter of expediency, a  single-channel mechanism for setting up local budgets and  allocating their funds should be introduced, based on the  premise that they be formed from the bottom up. At present, the  Ministry of Finance of Ukraine is inclined to allow only a  two-channel system of creating budgets -- through parallel  deductions into the local and state budgets;    e) to form and regulate the prices of goods and services  that  are produced by enterprises in the local economy, as well as the  prices of other producers' goods, by applying economic levers  (taxes, benefits, subsidies, credits). As a matter of fact,  pursuant to a decision of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine,  beginning with this year, the prices of consumer goods and  services are to be regulated at the expense of local funds.  <H8>  5 </H8>   What should be the directions and mechanism of economic  change in the regions? Economic changes will be successful only  if the state and the regions comprehensively coordinate their  actions. The rules for making the transition to the market  should be defined at the state level, while the mechanisms for  implementing these rules should operate at the local level.    For example, take an important measure on the road to a  market economy like privatization. The Supreme Council having  passed laws on "large" and "small" privatization, it is up to  the regional organs in charge of privatizing state and communal  property to implement these laws with the help of an appropriate  mechanism -- the creation of investment funds, surety companies,  opening of privatization deposit accounts, conducting  competitions, auctions, etc.    At present, however, the most important thing is to  determine  what is state-owned and what is communally owned. A battle is  being waged over this, making it possible for sharp operators  from the local nomenklaturas to conduct so-called property  "privatization." That is why the president's edict, which  elevates the role of regional subdivisions in charge of  privatizing state property, is appropriate. This will make it  possible to establish a clearer division between state and  communal property and create regional and local communal  property funds. It is desirable that local government organs,  taking into account territorial features and regional  privatization plans, be able to complete most of the "small"  privatization of objects this year.    Due to bureaucratic red tape and the absence of a  well-defined organizational and normative mechanism, the  privatization of housing is almost frozen. So far, only some 20  percent of the housing fund has been privatized in Ukraine's  cities. The principal cause of this slowdown is that people have  been given no guarantees that they will be provided with housing  and municipal services. I believe that it is necessary to speed  up not only the privatization of housing, but, first and  foremost, the privatization of enterprises that provide housing  and municipal services.    The regional mechanism of economic change requires the  necessary levers to foster the development and growth of  business enterprise, and, above all, small and medium-sized  businesses. In most developed countries, these businesses  account for 60 to 90 percent of the total number of enterprises,  and their share of output volume constitutes from 40 to 60  percent. Therefore, most questions with respect to the operation  of small and medium-sized businesses should be decided locally  --beginning with the registration of the relevant business  entities and ending with the creation of regional markets for  the sale of production. In addition, local government organs  should create economic conditions designed to best promote  business enterprise: tax benefits, financing, subsidies, etc. At  the same time, they should use the same economic levers to  restrict business activity that is undesirable in a given  region. Although we already have a state law on business  enterprise, we have still not worked out a mechanism for  regulating the development of business enterprise on a given  territory. This mechanism should include the preparation of a  regional program (business plan) for the development of business  enterprise, the creation of the necessary infrastructure  (information and consulting firms, educational centers,  investment funds, etc.), the passage by the representative  organs of government of certain normative acts on the economic  regulation of business development, etc.    An essential direction of market-oriented change at the  regional level is the creation and development of a market  infrastructure, which includes commercial banks, exchanges,  advertising, auditing, insurance, and other companies. At  present, Ukraine has close to 250 commercial banks. This number  is much too small to serve the country's business community. For  example, in the United States, there is a banking institution  for every five to ten thousand people.    But perhaps the interests of a territory are affected most  tangibly when we talk of creating the so-called free economic  zones (VEZ). According to some sources, there are currently  nearly 2,000 VEZ of more than 20 different types in existence in  the world. It is possible to find small territories (up to 10  square kilometers in area) in every region of Ukraine that could  be turned into free economic zones and serve as centers for  attracting foreign investment and technology and for  special-purpose means of organizing production that could then  be gradually expanded throughout the rest of the territory. But  the most suitable territories for free enterprise zones are in  the Ukrainian Black Sea region and the border regions in the  western part of Ukraine. These territories are conveniently  located in transportation and economic terms and ecologically  less polluted. The necessary documentation has already been  prepared or is in the process of being prepared for free  enterprise zones in Zakarpattya, Mykolayiv, Odessa, and  Chernivtsi oblasts. Final decisions on the creation of the VEZ  are being held up in the center's bureaucratic offices. It would  therefore be more expedient to hand over most questions  regarding the creation of free enterprise zones and the terms on  which they function to be decided by the regional authorities,  which would take into consideration interest in creating the  appropriate type of VEZ.    It is legitimate to ask: is it not possible that the free  enterprise zones might result in the realization of separatist  aims? As a matter of fact, this fear arose when the government  organs of Zakarpattya put forward a proposal for a free  enterprise zone in Zakarpattya Oblast. It is true that nowhere  else in the world does there exist a free enterprise zone of the  kind they have proposed. And if we take into consideration that  this proposal calls for the administration of the Zakarpattya  VEZ to be autonomous of the state, this is only a step away from  political independence. What has been put forward in the  Zakarpattya VEZ proposal generally applies to all regions of  Ukraine. It is a demand, first and foremost, for economic  independence. But then why separate the entire oblast in  administrative terms from the state system of government? This  being the case, I believe that questions associated with the  determination of the status of a free economic zone should be  subject to approval by the center.    The regional mechanism of market-oriented change can  function  efficiently only if it includes measures for the social  protection of the population of the given territory.    The implementation of the directions and mechanisms of  economic change in the regions requires rather serious  organizational measures and, primarily, certain decisions by the  central governing organs, as well as the will and desire of  local leaders, broad popular support, and, above all, a sense of  overall responsibility for the future of our integral  independent Ukraine.</p>

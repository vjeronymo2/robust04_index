			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / The Italian Election: Magistrates seek to defuse row over Berlusconi raid Senior members of the Italian magistrature yesterday sought to reduce the political tension caused by Wednesday's removal by police of documents on candidates from Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia headquarters. Meeting in special session they said the action so close to the elections was 'at best inopportune', writes Robert Graham. Mr Berlusconi was yesterday granted a meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro during which he voiced his concern about the behaviour of magistrates. The police action had been prompted by a request for lists of Forza Italia candidates and club members in various parts of Italy. It came from a magistrate at Palmi near Reggio Calabria investigating the links between membership of secret masonic lodges and organised crime. However, it emerged yesterday that the request for the information had come from a magistrate who was shortly due to be posted away from Palmi. It is possible that disciplinary action will follow. But while saying the timing of the police action was inappropriate, the senior magistrates pointed out that there had been no 'seizure' of documents  -merely a normal request for information. Mr Berlusconi denounced the move as political intimidation by the magistrature which he claimed was infiltrated by the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). Yesterday there were signs the incident had been itself blown out of all proportion by Forza Italia to pose in the guise of victim. Mr Berlusconi himself played the victim late on Wednesday in his sole television debate with his main opponent, Mr Achille Occhetto, PDS leader. The debate was largely taken up with mutual recrimination and neither went into details of his economic programme. Yesterday, in an unusual move, the leaders of Italy's unions and Confindustria, the industrialists' federation, appealed for last July's historic wage productivity deal to be honoured by the next government. This was an implicit warning to Mr Berlusconi with his free market ideas on labour relations to keep his hands off it.</p>

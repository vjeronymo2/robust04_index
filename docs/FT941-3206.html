			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London role as world city 'threatened' By John Willman, Public Policy Editor London's future as a world city has been weakened by the absence of a single planning authority for the central business district, says Hillier Parker, the firm of estate agents. The 10 London boroughs responsible for planning in inner London have designated less than half the central business area as part of the Central Activities Zone where priority will be given to business and economic development. The London Planning Advisory Committee will today present its latest advice to the government on how to develop the capital. The committee, which represents all London local authorities, is expected to emphasise the importance of the Central Activities Zone in London's continued success as a world city. Planners traditionally use the registrar-general's definition of London's central business area  - which is based on demographic data revealing where property is mainly non-residential (see map). However, much of this area has been left outside the central activities zone as defined by the 10 boroughs. This includes all of the central business area in the three boroughs on the south bank of the Thames  - Wandsworth, Lambeth and Southwark. Islington, which adjoins the City financial district, has designated only one small area as part of the zone. 'Each of the 10 boroughs covering central London can say it has made provision for business development,' says Mr John Parmiter of Hillier Parker. 'But overall the picture is of a city that is shrinking and becoming more fragmented in planning terms.' As a result, London will find it harder to attract international businesses to the capital, says Mr Parmiter. Other European cities, such as Paris and Frankfurt, have single local authorities that offer attractive packages to inward investors. 'Some of these boroughs appear to regard their central London areas as distractions from their responsibilities to residents,' says Mr Parmiter. 'There is no agreement between them on what constitutes the central activities zone. Camden excludes all but a small part of its area while neighbouring Westminster casts the net far wider.' Since the abolition of the Greater London Council in 1986, responsibility for planning in central London has been divided between nine inner-city boroughs and the City Corporation. Each is completing its first unitary development plan setting out strategic planning policies on matters such as areas to be designated for business development. Little effort has been made to co-ordinate the 10 plans, says Mr Parmiter. Comparison of the 10 maps shows that neighbouring boroughs disagree on such matters as the line of the underground railway and the route for new lines such as CrossRail. Most of the boroughs' plans for the central area are too advanced to be altered significantly.</p>

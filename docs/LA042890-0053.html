			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SIBERRY DOWNSHIFTS CRISPLY INTO FOLK AT COACH HOUSE;  </P> <P> THE CANADIAN SINGER'S SIMPLER, MORE DIRECT APPROACH TO MUSIC MAKES FOR AN  INTIMATE CONCERT.  </P> <P> Chalk up one more reason to be thankful that it's cool to be a folkie again: We  now get to hear Jane Siberry set aside her labyrinthine abstractions and  explore songs that are simple and rewarding, not to mention far more  comprehensible.  </P> <P> Maybe Siberry has taken note of the success of the Tracy Chapman/Cowboy Junkies  folk-based class of '88-'89. Or maybe she simply concluded that she  accomplished what she had set out to with the sprawling song-structures and  puzzling symbolism that dominated her albums "The Speckless Sky" (1985) and  "The Walking" (1988).  </P> <P> In any case, the direct, folk-based material from the Canadian singer's strong  current album, "Bound by the Beauty," formed the basis for an exceptionally  warm and intimate concert Thursday night at the Coach House.  </P> <P> Siberry, who in the past has toured with a seven-member ensemble featuring  backup singer-dancers, has pared her act to the elemental stuff: just herself  on guitars, tambourine and a few bars of accordion, aided by two fine  accompanists, guitarist Ken Myhr and piano/accordionist Teddy Borowiecki.  </P> <P> Thanks to their contributions and Siberry's ability to range from sheer whimsy  to utter heartbreak, the nearly two-hour show never lacked variety or  inventiveness. Only one song, "Bound by the Beauty," sounded undernourished  without a rhythm section.  </P> <P> Siberry signaled from the start that she is on a new tack. Playing for a small  but rapt audience that seemed to be made up of committed fans, she began with  Tom Waits' open-hearted "Train Song," singing with a tawny warmth reminiscent  of Bonnie Raitt. For most of the concert, however, Siberry stayed in a higher,  more ethereal range that recalled Joni Mitchell. Like Mitchell, Siberry  frequently sang in unpredictable harmonic steps that skirted folk-pop  convention, and lent her singing a sense of surprise and fragile mystery.  </P> <P> Siberry sang all of the "Bound by the Beauty" album, adding only one song from  each of her three previous U.S. releases. Only one of those older songs, "Mimi  on the Beach," was an example of Siberry's epic mode, and it is her most  accessible magnum opus at that. Even so, she abridged "Mimi" considerably and  leavened it with a healthy instrumental slice of "Georgy Girl," as if to show  anyone who had her pegged as a deliberately obscure artiste that some  re-evaluation now is in order.  </P> <P> Myhr (pronounced "mire") has been a longtime sidekick of Siberry's. At the  Coach House, he could almost have been a band unto himself. His arsenal  included hard-edged acoustic slide guitar blues, atmospheric electronic  effects, breezy Spanish guitar and even some tongue-in-cheek arena-rock hero  licks during the joking finale, "Miss Punta Blanca." Myhr also sang a taut  desperado blues, "Bruce's Song," that recalled the Neville Brothers' eloquently  spare arrangement of Bob Dylan's "Ballad of Hollis Brown."  </P> <P> Siberry's set moved along with sure pacing and intelligent juxtapositions of  mood and theme. At mid-set, for example, she paired two of her loveliest songs:  "The Walking," a hushed meditation on the pain of a romantic breakup, was  followed by "The Life Is the Red Wagon," a swelling affirmation of hope and  love.  </P> <P> The evening's finest song was a new, unreleased number, "Calling All Angels."  In this country-folk tune, the protagonist is caught up in the first fearsome,  intoxicating moments of a crush that is both utterly romantic and ragingly  libidinous. It's a number that Emmylou Harris or Linda Ronstadt probably  wouldn't mind having if they could get their hands on it, but Siberry's sexy  and plaintive reading did it full justice.  </P> <P> Siberry kept between-song chats in check, but she and her band mates managed to  loosen the mood with playful asides (including shutterbugging each other and  the audience with a camera that Siberry brought on stage). The trio's  comfortable interaction added to the show's sense of warmth. The intimacy and  detailed playing of Siberry's concert rivaled that of Cowboy Junkies, those  younger upstarts from her hometown of Toronto. But the energy, stylistic range  and dynamic variations of Siberry's show far exceeded what the ever-nodding  Junkies have shown to date.  </P></p>

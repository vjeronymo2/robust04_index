This  pint-size version of a dump truck is made from plywood, runs by pedal power and  has a working steering mechanism.  </P> <P> Other realistic features include a crankshaft on the forward set of rear tires  (8-inch lawn-mower wheels) and the back set of rear tires "floats" on rough  terrain.  </P> <P> The dump lever operates by pivoting on a roller that moves under the dump box,  causing it to rise . . . and allowing the driver to deliver his pay dirt from  one end of the yard to the other.  </P> <P> Full-size traceable parts, detailed drawings and step-by-step directions guide  you in construction.

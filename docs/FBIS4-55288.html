			<p>BFN     [Text] Today the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]  parliamentary group deposited at the office of the National  Assembly a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov due to his inability to organize and lead the Council of  Ministers. The aim of the SDS is evidently to forestall the  prime minister's statement on structural and personnel changes  in the cabinet that he is expected to make next Thursday, our  reporter Antoaneta Puncheva points out.    Prime Minister Lyuben Berov's proposal for structural and  personnel changes in the government will be discussed at a  special plenum of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], BSP  leader Zhan Videnov stated at today's meeting of BSP deputies.  The BSP deputies reported after the meeting that the plenum  will be scheduled for the day when the prime minister officially  presents his cabinet's program intentions in parliament, so the  exact date is not clear at the moment.    The deputies of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD] decided  at their meeting today not to support Prime Minister Lyuben  Berov's expected proposal on structural and personnel changes in  the Council of Ministers.    All the political forces, especially those in the  parliamentary center, should reach a consensus on the cabinet  shuffle, even at the cost of making compromises -- this was the  common view of Ahmed Dogan, DPS [Movement for Rights and  Freedoms] leader, and Aleksandur Tomov, leader of the Civic  Alliance for the Republic. They had a long discussion in  parliament today, the main subject of which was the government  changes. According to Tomov, Dogan and he found that they  shared quite a number of common viewpoints in their positions.    Regarding the hardline position of the NSD deputies not to  take part in the vote on Professor Berov's program, Aleksandur  Tomov expects a slow but sure evolution in the views of the  parties and organizations in the NSD group, and Ahmed Dogan  predicts the same. The idea of forming a new cabinet within the  term of the present parliament is not a bad one, Aleksandur  Tomov thinks, but at the moment it is simply unrealistic.</p>

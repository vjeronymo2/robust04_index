			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Clark rules out 'witch hunt' of directors C&amp;J CLARK, whose shareholders narrowly defeated the proposal to sell to Berisford at a special meeting last Friday, said yesterday there would be 'no witch hunt' of directors. Seven of the 11 directors, including all the executives, had recommended shareholders to sell to Berisford. Mr Walter Dickson, chairman of Clark, has gone on holiday to Barbados for two weeks. He said on Friday he would be 'considering his position' following the vote. Some shareholders had attempted to oust Mr Dickson at a meeting last October, at which the board was given a mandate to seek a bidder for the group. Speculation was that Mr Roger Pedder, a non-executive director who had neither recommended nor opposed the sale originally, but who came out against the deal on Friday, might become chairman if Mr Dickson left. At the meeting a shareholder asked Mr Lance Clark, also a non-executive director, who was a leading opponent to the sale, if he would continue to support Mr Dickson as chairman if the resolution was defeated. He refused to give that assurance.</p>

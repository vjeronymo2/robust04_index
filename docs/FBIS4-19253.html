			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia President Silvio Berlusconi by </F> Bruno Vespa in Rome on 13 April: "`Scalfari Counts for Nothing;  He Is Missing an O'" -- first five paragraphs are L'INFORMAZIONE  introduction -- all quotation marks as published]    [Text] Rome -- I want a government that legislates, and we  are going to have to work hard for five years. That is the  concept Silvio Berlusconi hammers home in the interview granted  to our newspaper.    For the first time since his election victory, the Knight  [Berlusconi nickname] responds to the attacks of LA REPUBBLICA  editor Eugenio Scalfari: He needs an "o" to start drawing up  lists of ministers [reference to virtual homonym with head of  state Oscar Luigi Scalfaro], he said. "I want Marco Panella,  [Pannella Reformers' List leader] in the government."    "By the time they told me, the problem was already resolved.  It is better that way. With so many institutional problems  still unresolved...." Silvio Berlusconi smiled when I asked him  to comment on the mass resignation first handed in then  withdrawn by the three directors of the Fininvest TV news  programs, Mentana, Fede, and Liguori, following an interview  granted to LA STAMPA by the group's managing director, Mr.  Franco Tato, in which he accused them of being a source of  expense and trouble. In all probability, Berlusconi seems  likely to have been informed immediately after emerging from his  talks with President Scalfaro. I tried to probe further,  saying: "That interview perfectly represents Tato: his  character, his fiery nature, and also his good faith."  Berlusconi smiled but refused to bite. The case is closed and  he has other things on his mind.    It was dusk on a gray day. The blinds let very little light  into the drawing rooms of the Berlusconi residence near Rome's  Piazza Navona. In the larger of the rooms, two white sofas and  a chimney breast framed a broad table groaning under neat piles  of books, candy, and Forza Italia brochures. A few 18th century  hunting scenes adorned the walls. Next to the windows, a nice  photo of his wife, Veronica Lario, rested on a shelf.    "There is just one of me, guys, just one," he said, closing  the door in the face of his elegant footmen, spokesman Antonio  Tajano and personal assistant Niccolo Querci, who would like him  to be all over the place at once. But at this juncture the  Knight has three important things on his mind: the designation  of the speakers for the two houses of parliament ("Who knows, we  might just succeed in throwing off the shackles of narrow  vision...?"); the probable assignation to him of the mandate to  form a government; and his parliamentary debut.    [Vespa] When was the last time you stepped inside  Montecitorio [parliament]? What impression did it make on you?    [Berlusconi] I recall a fine, austere building, something  halfway between a national legend and the best show in the  capital.    [Vespa] Are you moved in any way by returning there as a  member of parliament or the winning leader? Or is Montecitorio  a palace just like any other, for a rich man?    [Berlusconi] To represent the electorate is certainly a  moving experience, almost like the first day at school. But my  true riches, at any rate, are that I am still just a guy like  every one else. My responsibilities may be greater, but my  feelings are the same as those of the common people.    [Vespa] The outgoing parliamentary speakers are Napolitano  and Spadolini. Whether people like them or not, they are first  class politicians. Will the new majority provide alternatives  of an acceptable standard?    [Berlusconi] Where the speakers are concerned, I am looking  for a solid balance between renewal and republican solidity. I  believe in government by the majority, leaving the opposition  free and untarnished by any clubby temptations; but for that  reason, precisely because I wish to implement this change at all  levels, it is right that certain elements of institutional  safeguard should stay in place. Naturally, all this within the  framework of the direction expressed by the coalition which, in  its entirety, won the elections.    [Vespa] If Scalfaro were to ask you to form the government,  how many days would it take you to accept [sciogliere la  riserva]?    [Berlusconi] As many days as it takes to put together a good  program and a good team.    [Vespa] If you form the government, will Pannella be part of  it?    [Berlusconi] As far as I am concerned, yes, I hope so.    [Vespa] On that topic: Can you guarantee that the new team  will be an improvement on the outgoing one?    [Berlusconi] I must say, the dance going on right now is  highly comical. The very people who as good as smashed the old  ruling class and caused the old parliament to lose its  legitimacy are now falling over themselves to describe the "new"  guys as inexpert, unfit, and not up to the job. I guarantee  that we can do better than in the past with all the men of the  present.    [Vespa] On that subject, Scalfari on Sunday said that you  cannot be prime minister. Too many interests. You got your  lawyer, Dr. Dotti, also elected under the Forza Italia flag, to  answer him. I get the feeling you are not too worried.    [Berlusconi] Scalfari needs an "o" on the end of his name to  decide who is going to form the next government.    [Vespa] [Fininvest President] Confalonieri claims that a  group with revenue of 12 trillion lire and a staff of 40,000  cannot be sold off in a short time. One got the feeling he was  trying to reassure the people in the firm as much as anything  else.    [Berlsuconi] Confalonieri is fulfilling his role as a great  manager; I will fulfill mine, which is quite different. Nobody  with any sense, whatever his job, can doubt for one moment that  Fininvest is not a two-bit company to sell off to the highest  bidder just to keep the ivory tower mystifiers happy. We are  talking about tens of thousands of jobs, an asset, an ethos, and  an entrepreneurial tradition which belong to the country.    [Vespa] Who will do the negotiating to decide how many  networks Fininvest should have and how many the RAI [Italian  State Broadcasting Corporation] should have? Will you succeed  in turning it into a personal matter [as published]?    [Berlusconi] Of course I will. I have already explained how.  By separating my political role from my assets in the clearest  possible way, and by imbuing all decisions with the greatest  transparency, under the collective control of the government and  parliament.    [Vespa] [Northern League Secretary] Bossi has said that he  will agree to you becoming premier only if you present yourelf  "naked," in other words after divesting yourself of your strong  interests.    [Berlusconi] Bossi wants me to catch a nasty cold. I  presented myself to the electorate with my clothes on, by no  means in the nude, and it put its trust in me. But the problem  does exist. We are examining it, and only those in bad faith  can deny a priori that, without any legal obligation to do so, I  began to practice the distinction of roles the moment I resigned  all my duties with Finivest. The rest will follow shortly, but  compatibly with the problems of a group with a 12 trillion lire  in revenue and a staff of 40,000.    [Vespa] The other problem is federalism. If no concrete  results are forthcoming within six months, your League ally has  threatened to leave you in the lurch. What can be done in such  a short time?    [Berlusconi] Under the old system in six months you set up a  comittee, with its good old chairman and his good old staff, and  got through about 1,000 working lunches. I hope that under the  new system six months will be enough for the work of any  committee to be concluded, whatever the topic, and a vote to be  taken on the results. Yes, yes, no, no: just like it says in  the Gospel.    [Vespa] What solution are you most convinced by? Greater  powers to the present regional authorities, eight or 10  macroregions, [League ideologue] Miglio's three Italies?    [Berlusconi] Federalism is not a topographical problem. The  first republic was based on the distribution of power through  centralized parties. In the future the distribution of weights  and balances, starting with tax questions, will have to rest on  the institutions of territorial self-government.    [Vespa] The oppositions claim that parliament alone has no  right to implement reforms of this nature. Do you envisage  resorting to a referendum? If so, when?    [Berlusconi] Parliament has every right to do what the  Constitution allows. The will of the people is exercized  through parliament within the framework of a Constitution which  provides the conditions for its own modification. Added to  which, in the case of sweeping changes, there is the tool of a  referendum.    [Vespa] You said: We will set up a centrist government.  [National Alliance Coordinator] Fini objected: It will be a  center-right government.    [Berlusconi] Those are moldy old definitions with which I do  not identify. I hope we will put together a good government on  the basis of a majority which, in old-style geopolitical terms,  is center-right, but with criteria and a program which also  belong to other ethical and moral traditions. Is broadening  civil rights a left-wing, right-wing, or centrist aim? Is  increasing the work done by voluntary organizations left wing,  right wing, or centrist? Are privatizing great lumbering  concerns badly run by the old nomenklatura, or keeping the power  to set rules applicable to the entire market in the hands of the  public sector left-wing, right-wing, or centrist acts?    [Vespa] Have you closed the door in the faces of the Popular  Party [PPI] and the Segni Pact members? Have you spoken with  Segni, [former PPI Secretary] Martinazzoli, [PPI Chairwoman]  Jervolino, [PPI members] Formigoni, or Buttiglione since the  elections?    [Berlusconi] I talk with a lot of people, and I always  welcome the advice and criticism of those in good faith. For  everyone today is a time to distinguish between the roles of  those who are going to govern and those who are going into  opposition, but imbued with the spirit of cooperation and with  our doors open to whoever shares our values and our program.    [Vespa] You have been invited to take part in the 25 April  [Liberation Day] antifascist march. Will you go?    [Berlusconi] Ideally I will be attending all those  celebrations, which I hope will be a mark of reconciliation.    [Vespa] Is there any danger that Liberation Day will not be  a  calm holiday, despite the head of state's appeal? What is your  position?    [Berlusconi] I see no reason why we should await 25 April in  such a doom-laden atmosphere. I would like to hope that this  thirst for revenge is quenched in time. I repeat, it was not  antifascism which lost the elections, it was the left-wing  cartel. It would be as well not to get mixed up between the  principles, which are everybody's, and the programs for the  political struggle, which are partisan. Even [left-wing  philosopher] Vittorio Foa made that clear.    [Vespa] Unemployment is uppermost in people's minds right  now. The day after the elections you told me: "I am already  working on the economic program," and you reiterated your  promise of one million jobs. Have you pursued that path any  further?    [Berlusconi] Of course. We are working to turn our election  program into parliamentary and governmental initiatives.    [Vespa] The Ciampi government has taken the credit for  getting the recovery started. Was it right to do so?    [Berlsuconi] Ciampi did what he could. He had neither a  majority nor a true opposition. Added to that, some cross-party  centers of power attempted, sometimes brutally, to influence his  government's actions.    [Vespa] How long will the next government last? Is it true  that the next legislative term is going to be transitional?    [Berlusconi] Five years of hard work, then the balance sheet  and the verdict of the electorate. That is the aim I hold most  dear and which I think the Italians deserve after the storms and  turbulence of the past few years. The stock market is giving us  encouraging signs in that direction.    [Vespa] Is it true that at this juncture your mind is  totally  devoted to politics? Will you ever go back to being a  businessman?    [Berlusconi] The only interests that concern me at the  moment  are my country's.    It was late when Berlusconi walked me to the elevator. "By  the way, how are things with [Forza Italia deputy] Ms. Parenti?"  The Knight answered with a smile.    Downstairs, in Via dell'Anima, there was a small crowd of  journalists waiting for the Knight. One of them cried out  jokingly: "Did you go up to discuss taking over from Mentana as  director of TG5 [TV news program]?" I answered: "He withdrew  his resignation before I had time. Anyway, as you can see, I am  not wearing a blue blazer, the standard Finivest uniform...."</p>

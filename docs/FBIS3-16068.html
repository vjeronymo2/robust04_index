Defense Ministry press secretary Maige Proom neither  confirmed nor denied the information.    The Defense Ministry and the Defense Forces general staff  have for months held talks with several enterprises that are  prepared to manufacture NATO standard 5.56 mm, 9 mm and 7.62 mm  ammunition.    At least two Estonian companies, the Turi-based Arbalett  joint-stock company, one of whose shareholders is the Defense  League Foundation, and the Tartu-based state-owned Tarkon, have  applied to the Defense Ministry to start production of  cartridges.    Tarkon's director Toomas Noorem said in an earlier interview  with BNS that his company is fully capable of and interested in  producing cartridges.    Defense Minister Indrek Kannik was scheduled to visit the  Tarkon plant today.    Defense Ministry Deputy Chancellor Tarmo Molder claimed in  an  interview with BNS that locally made cartridges would in any  case be cheaper than, for example, ammunition imported from  Israel.    Lieutenant Colonel Romas Zibas, head of the Lithuanian  Defense Forces general staff's military training department,  told BNS a couple of weeks ago that Lithuania is already  producing its own cartridges and grenades. He said his country  also plans in the near future to start manufacturing 60 mm and  80 mm mortars and shells. The Latvian Defense Ministry invited  bids from domestic manufacturers to start producing ammunition  locally.</p>

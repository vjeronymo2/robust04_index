			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Preposterous Jargon" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam  blared on May 4 that their "patience reached the limit" with  regard to "the nuclear development of the North."    Commenting on his remarks, MINJU CHOSON today says he must  stop the development of nuclear weapons in South Korea, instead  of charging others.    The analyst says:    In South Korea large quantities of plutonium enough for the  manufacture of hundreds of nuclear bombs have been extracted  from the pressurized heavy-water reactor in Wolsong and the  multi-purpose research reactor in Taedok. Nevertheless, Kim  Yong-sam is now hysterically crying over "the nuclear  development" by the North, revealing his true color as a traitor  to the nation.    The traitor spoke ill of the peace overture made by the DPRK  to the United States recently, alleging that the North "withdrew  from the armistice commission" and it "is isolated." His  preposterous jargon was aimed at balking the DPRK-U.S.  negotiation, having the hostile relations maintained between the  DPRK and the U.S., and stifling the North with the backing of  outside forces.    The analyst further says:    His remarks are, in a nutshell, a thoughtless sophism of a  fellow bereft of reason.    The traitor, who is rejected by the people for his  despicable  policy of dependence on outside forces, North-South  confrontation, irregularities and fighting within the quarters  of power, made such remarks in the hope of diverting elsewhere  the resentment directed at him. But, nobody takes him at his  words.</p>

He told the Commons Transport Select Committee that Britain  is keen to give U.S. airlines freedom to fly into regional  airports. In return, Britain wants greater access to U.S.  destinations. "We have offered an immediate lifting of all  restrictions on services to all airports in the UK except  Heathrow and Gatwick," Mr MacGregor said.    "I very much regret that we have not had a positive response  from the United States to these proposals. Nor, indeed, have  they been able to agree a date for talks to resume," he added.    American airlines argue that Heathrow and Gatwick are what  they want because of their strategic value as a hub to the rest  of Europe.</p>

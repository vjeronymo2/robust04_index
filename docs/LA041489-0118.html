			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO'S OPERATIC VOICE IS STILL STRONG  </P> <P> When former San Diego Opera general director Tito Capobianco was hyping his  nascent summer Verdi Festival, he predicted that San Diego would become the  Verdi capital of the world, the equivalent of Bayreuth, Bavaria, for  Wagner-lovers. Ten years after his overly optimistic prediction, both  Capobianco and his Verdi Festival are long gone, but the local opera scene has  survived without the flamboyant Argentine impresario.  </P> <P> If the state of opera in San Diego can be judged by performances across town  this weekend, the Capobianco legacy still hovers in the wings. Saturday at the  Civic Theatre, San Diego Opera opens Puccini's unsinkable "Madama Butterfly,"  the final production of the current four-opera season. After Capobianco left  San Diego Opera in 1983, the company scaled down the number of operas it  produced in order to contain its debt, and resorted to conservative programming  -- familiar operas such as "Butterfly," "Tosca," "Faust" and "Il Trovatore" --  to rebuild its subscription base.  </P> <P> Although it has taken the company six seasons to rebuild, according to general  director Ian Campbell, the formula has worked. Campbell announced a more  ambitious and expanded 1989-90 season earlier this week, and was able to add a  performance of "Madama Butterfly" because of high ticket demand.  </P> <P> Tonight, San Diego State University's opera workshop presents a bill of four  one-act operas at Smith Recital Hall. Like the opera company, the university's  opera program has also gone through a recovery period since its association  with Capobianco. From 1981 to '83, Capobianco's Opera Center, at that time the  local company's educational program, joined forces with the SDSU music  department to offer opera courses and produce operas on campus.  </P> <P> "I'm trying to get opera back on the boards here," explained Martin Chambers,  recently appointed chairman of the music department. "After Capobianco left,  the program here was fallow several years. When I came here in the fall of  1986, the department decided to resurrect the program."  </P> <P> Chambers has been rebuilding the university opera program slowly, relying on  students and faculty who would have a continuing commitment to the program,  rather than a few experts brought in for a short-term stint, the premise of the  former program.  </P> <P> Chambers has the right background to head a university opera program. The  Canadian tenor sang in European opera houses for seven years before he returned  to North America to assume a university position. He continued to sing roles  with Toronto's Canadian Opera Company under Lotfi Mansouri, that company's  general director until his recent appointment as head of the San Francisco  Opera.  </P> <P> At this stage of the SDSU opera workshop, Chambers is not attempting to vie  with the downtown company for production values.  </P> <P> "I'm not interested in producing the best stage product," he said, "but in  training students how to act, sing and put an opera together. We are not only  interested in singers, but see potential designers and directors coming out of  this program."  </P> <P> In tonight's Smith Hall program, Chambers will conduct his cast and the SDSU  opera orchestra in Douglas Moore's 1958 one-act comic opera "Gallantry." The  rest of the program features Ralph Vaughn Williams' "Riders to the Sea," based  on the William Synge play; "Bastien and Bastienne," Mozart's first Singspiel,  and Hugo Weisgall's monodrama "The Stranger," based on a Strindberg play.  </P> <P> Chambers does not see the performances of his opera workshop transforming the  campus consciousness about opera.  </P> <P> "We invite students, especially music appreciation students, to the open dress  rehearsals, and the responses are pretty positive, but we have to struggle to  get audiences."  </P> <P> Chambers does not predict a second attempt at making an alliance between San  Diego Opera and the SDSU music department, even though he has good relations  with Campbell. Earlier this season, Chambers made his local opera debut in San  Diego Opera's "Lucia di Lammermoor" production, and he will appear in next  season's production of Poulenc's "Dialogues des Carmelites."  </P> <P> "I think Campbell is doing a fine job with his education program, and we are  both concerned about spreading our available resources too thin. He has  generously helped us out with the loan of some props and set, however."  </P></p>

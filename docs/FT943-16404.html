			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Retention of two-tier Staffs urged Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle-under-Lyme should come together to form a single unitary authority but the rest of Staffordshire should retain two tiers of local authority, the Local Government Commission for England recommended yesterday. The commission will seek the views of county residents in the next 11 weeks before making its final recommendation to Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. The commission's willingness to retain both the county council and district councils, albeit over a reduced area, is at odds with the government's preference for unitary authorities. It follows a similar approach to that adopted in Kent, Hampshire and Leicestershire, although the majority of commission recommendations so far have been in favour of scrapping county councils. All the district and borough councils in Staffordshire favoured the creation of unitary authorities, although Lichfield and Tamworth wanted to merge. The commission's preferred option is closest to the view of the county council, which suggested a unitary authority for Stoke with a two-tier structure elsewhere. Union of Stoke and Newcastle, the north Staffordshire conurbation, would create a community of 375,600 people. There is already 'a degree of community interdependence', the commission concluded on the basis of a MORI poll. Newcastle Borough Council is against merger with Stoke, however, and organised a petition that gained more than 11,500 signatures supporting independence. The commission said the financial implications of its preferred option were 'relatively minor'. Implementation would cost up to Pounds 10m and administrative costs would be Pounds 4m a year less than current spending.</p>

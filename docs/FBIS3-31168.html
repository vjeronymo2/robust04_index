The ruling coalition  includes the HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS).    "There is not any disagreement", he said, adding that no new  faction has formed within the HZDS as yet, although two  unspecified deputy chairmen of a deputies' group of deputies  offered their resignation, to be considered today.    Earlier yesterday, Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and  Deputy  Ivan Laluha hinted at polarisation within the HZDS when they  told journalists that they had rejected Meciar's proposal to  hold referendum over the expulsion from the parliament of  deputies who strayed from their mother parties.    The meeting also discussed the parliamentary stalemate,  brought on by the walkout of the coalition deputies, Cabaj said,  adding that he believed the parliamentary session would continue  as planned on February 16. Meciar told the meeting about an  unofficial offer from the Democratic Left Party (SDL) for a  wider coalition, Cabaj said.    But SDL Chairman Peter Weiss today refused the idea of a  coalition with the HZDS.    The SNS would only take a decision over the proposed  referendum on the maverick deputies after an SNS extraordinary  congress was held on February 19, chairman of the SNS  parliamentary group, Miloslav Kona, said.    "Everything is possible and everything depends on the  conditions," he added, reflecting on a possible coalition with  the SDL.    The congress will try to resolve the rift within the SNS.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Indian inflation rate increases India's inflation rate rose in the week ending December 3, adding fresh grist to the mill of critics of the government's economic policies. Voters in recent state election in which the ruling Congress (I) party suffered a serious defeat singled out the high rate of inflation as one of their main complaints about the central government, prompting demands from some Congress party members for a change in economic policy. Government figures published this week show wholesale prices rose 9.75 per cent in the week ending December 3, compared with the same period last year, up from 9.69 per cent the previous week. These are provisional figures - the final figures have recently been running 1 percentage point higher.</p>

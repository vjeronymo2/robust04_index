			<p>BFN     [Text] The ANC has rejected allegations that it wants to  control the Zulu king. ANC spokesman Blade Nzimande said the  organization was insisting that the king's status and  remuneration be entrenched in the constitution. He accused the  IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] of blackmailing the king by paying  his salary and of preventing him from establishing relations  with those of his subjects who belong to other parties.</p>

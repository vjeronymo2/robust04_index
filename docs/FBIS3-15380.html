Russian Federation Foreign  Affairs Ministry Has Held a Conference on Problems of the  Commonwealth's Russophones"]    [Text] The range of opinions (including in Russia's state  structures) on how Moscow's relations with the newly independent  neighboring countries should develop is very wide -- from  isolationism to unification at any price. But in this context  the problem of "ethnic Russians" in the CIS countries is  perennial. In an attempt to define their legal status, the  Russian Federation Foreign Ministry has proposed a draft  bilateral treaty between the Russian Federation and a  corresponding state related to "Russian Federation citizens  permanently residing on its territory." The treaty proposes  that a status be established for them close to the legal status  of that country's citizens in as much as refers to political,  economic, and other rights. With very few exceptions -- for  instance the right to elect and be elected to supreme bodies of  state power, participate in referendums, and hold diplomatic or  state security posts -- the "permanent residents" have equal  rights with the country's citizens and the restrictions imposed  on foreigners do not extend to them.    The appearance of such a draft, in the opinion of Moscow  diplomats, is due to the fact that a different status -- say,  dual citizenship -- creates more problems than its solves. At  the same time the special citizenship status proposed by them is  not based on ethnic principles, but enables anyone having any  even very remote roots in Russia to register his citizenship  according to a simplified procedure. In particular this setup  is designed to remove certain problems for re-emigres from the  CIS countries who are often treated in Russia as foreigners.  Without recognizing dual citizenship juridically, the Russian  authorities may do this de facto.    True, this agreement, speakers at the conference noted,  leaves out people who move from the "inner neighboring states"  [vnutrenneye zarubezhye], in particular Russians who leave the  Russian Federation's ethnic republics.    One of the acute issues is still the character of influence  on Russian communities in the newly independent states by  numerous public organizations created in Russia to maintain  links with compatriots abroad. To politicize the public life of  the Russian diaspora and to turn the community into a conduit of  Russian policy abroad would mean, as was stressed at the  conference, to subject it to additional danger, leading to  extreme situations -- "knowing some traditions that can reemerge  in certain regions."    At present, social problems in Russia for compatriots from  the neighboring states have been alleviated somewhat after the  free circulation of foreign exchange, which they often had to  pay for their presence in their "historical motherland," was  banned here. It was also proposed to allow them to enroll in  Russian colleges and universities on a general competitive basis  and to promote the dissemination of Russian newspapers and books  in the Commonwealth countries. At the interstate level, that  the extension of credits to CIS countries be made contingent on  which proportion thereof will be used to support and promote the  Russian diaspora, also taking into account the number of  Russians leaving the country.</p>

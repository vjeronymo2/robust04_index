			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chamber of Deputies Chairman Milan Uhde: "An </F> Important Objective Is To Not Provoke the Russians"]    [Text] During its visit to Luxembourg and Belgium, the  Czech Republic Chamber of Deputies delegation had many  interesting experiences, was asked probing and astute questions,  and, in turn, asked about many things and found out a great  deal. However, an impromptu oral survey conducted in the  delegation evinced, among extremely stimulating ideas, the  following observation from one of our foreign colleagues: The  Partnership for Peace [PFP] is the only feasible chance for you  Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians, and Poles. You surely understand  that we must not provoke the Russians.    I explained to him and to other people who showed an  interest  that we accept the PFP and that we understand it: States that  are politically, economically, and militarily undeveloped cannot  be immediately incorporated into NATO. We did not expect  immediate admission, just a guarantee of the prospect that the  doors have not been closed to us, that they will not be closed,  and that admission depends, first and foremost, on us, on our  readiness, maturity, and resolve.    Provocation is a feeble policy, and, in politics, it is  rightly regarded as desperate. I am opposed to anyone being  provoked, and I understand that the Russians would not like it  if security structures were to evolve in Europe without them as  if they were oriented against them. The PFP leaves the  development of these structures wide open because the situation  is still evolving in all of the postcommunist countries, and,  therefore, it would not be prudent to anticipate the outcome of  development and make premature and definitive decisions.    However, it would be equally ineffectual not to do anything  that could provoke the Russians. This means something that would  only seem like a provocation. I remember the touching  tragicomic attempt in 1968 by the reform communists not to  provoke Moscow. Reproaches for the so-called ill-considered  anti-Soviet excesses in the democratized mass media dragged on  into the private discussions of the 1968-ers long after the  occupying tanks had been on our territory. A renowned professor  was still saying 10 years later that the caricatures in  LITERARNI NOVINY were partly to blame.    Masaryk [Tomas Garrigue Masaryk] dealt with a similar rebuke  in his monograph on Havlicek [Karel Havlicek Borovsky]. Palacky  [Frantisek Palacky] and Havlicek were certainly closer to him  than Sabina [Karel Sabina 1813-77, radical writer] and Fric  [Josef Vaclav Fric 1829-90, radical politician], yet he rejected  Palacky's explanation that the military intervention against  Prague in 1848 was provoked by the irresponsible radicalism of  the people on the barricades. If Palacky has based his  political concept on foundations that could have been torn up by  the provocations of foolhardy people, they are such weak  foundations that it is impossible to take them seriously,  commented the future Czechoslovak president.    If a politician or group of politicians in Europe relies on  the supposition that, if there is no provocation, everything  will turn out all right, he is terribly mistaken. Every devotee  of the Yalta ideal of an eternally valid division into spheres  of influence and of the philosophy that whoever has influence  ascribed to him has the right to regard everything that  repudiates it as a provocation will interpret every departure  from authentic political conduct of a free state as a weakness.    We know well this way of thinking; the Czechs and other  nations have experienced it firsthand. It is time to emphasize  again what has obviously not been stated clearly enough until  now: Every state in Europe will have as much influence as it  can achieve by its internal democratic arrangement, its  application of the principles of a law-governed state, and its  observance of human rights; to sum up, by showing respect for  the freedom guaranteed by a market economy, freedom crowned by  spiritual and cultural symbolization.    Influence based on anything else--for instance, on the  threat  of countermeasures if the small postcommunist states acknowledge  the European values that NATO was set up to defend--is like  beating a tattoo on old drums. I hope that Czech policy will  always put up stiff resistance to this. I am absolutely  convinced that it will not be alone.</p>

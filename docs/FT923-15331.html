			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Streamlined Granada rises 49% GRANADA, the leisure, television and computer services group, yesterday produced evidence of a recovery in its fortunes when it announced a 49 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 57.2m for the 28 weeks to April 11. The performance was marginally ahead of the result for the last full year to September 28 1991 when Granada's profits slumped from Pounds 120m to Pounds 57m. Turnover was Pounds 674.5m (Pounds 721m including discontinued businesses). Granada's share price rose 13p to close at 257p. Mr Gerry Robinson, who was appointed chief last year, said the company had made real progress in simplifying its structure and in improving efficiency. 'We have much to do but I think we have made an encouraging start,' he said. Mr Robinson aroused controversy when, earlier this year, he required the resignation of Mr David Plowright, chairman of Granada Television. The company said that a 12 per cent increase in the underlying level of operating profit had been achieved by: a turnround in Granada Computer Services from a Pounds 3.6m loss to a Pounds 4.3m profit; higher profits from Granada Television - up from Pounds 14.9m to Pounds 18.8m; the disposal of the lossmaking Canadian rental businesses. The pre-tax result was also helped by a 44 per cent fall in interest charges to Pounds 19.3m following last summer's rights issue. Mr Alex Bernstein, chairman, said there were few signs of economic recovery. 'Against this background it is encouraging that our actions over the past year have started to generate positive results,' he said. The rental and retail businesses have been boosted by satellite television and Granada Leisure had been streamlined. Apart from businesses which had been sold Granada had about 2,000 fewer employees than a year before and now had about 20,000 staff. Earnings per share rose by 15 per cent to 8.2p fully diluted and the interim dividend at 2.75p was up 10 per cent. Analysts are predicting that Granada will make pre-tax profits of between Pounds 112m and Pounds 117m for the full year. Mr Robinson said he foresaw considerable growth for Granada's computer maintenance business - which had been a lossmaker for the company. Granada was one of the largest independent operators yet had only 0.5 per cent of a world market worth Dollars 50bn (Pounds 27bn) a year. Acquisitions were likely in computer services once the company was sure the structure of the division was right. Mr Robinson also said he believed that eventually there would only be five or six ITV companies and that if the rules allowed it Granada would be interested in taking over another large ITV company. At present large ITV companies are forbidden from taking each other over. See Lex</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Air France 'hinders Swissair plan' Swissair, the quoted Swiss carrier, said Air France's partial ownership of Sabena was hindering its plans to buy a large minority stake in the Belgian national airline. 'A continuation of Air France's involvement would appear to make little sense,' Mr Paul Muller, a Swissair director, said in the latest issue of the employee publication Swissair News. Swissair said yesterday that current negotiations depended on Air France. 'If they decide to keep their shares, then we will have to discuss a new situation,' it said. Air France owns two-thirds of Finacta, a holding company which has a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena. It has been reluctant to dispose of its investment in the Belgian carrier. However, industry observers believe that Mr Christian Blanc, chairman of Air France, may be leaning towards a sale or reduction of the stake. 'It would be difficult for Air France to muster any further capital for Sabena, given its own need for financial resources,' said one airline industry analyst.</p>

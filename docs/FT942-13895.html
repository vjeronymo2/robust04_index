			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Henry Boot ahead 7% to Pounds 7.6m Henry Boot, the Sheffield-based contractor, housebuilder and property developer which has withstood the recession better than many of its rivals, increased pre-tax profits by 7 per cent, from Pounds 7.08m to Pounds 7.59m, in 1993. Turnover advanced to Pounds 165m (Pounds 129m). The group is proposing to raise its final dividend from 4.3p to 4.8p, increasing the total for the year by 10 per cent to 6.5p (5.9p). Earnings per share increased from 18.9p to 20p. The company said that operating profits rose by a fifth, which compensated for a reduction in interest received. Contracting, however, remained difficult with prices 'ludicrously low'. The market continued to suffer from over-capacity and remained very competitive. Public spending cuts and tax increases had increased the anxiety felt by the industry while the recovery was 'fragile at best'. Nonetheless, the company said the number of homes completed last year had risen by 62 per cent, with profits and sales benefiting from a change in the mix of house types and lower interest rates. It expected to increase further its investment in housebuilding as well as expanding its interests in commercial property as those markets recovered. Significant progress had been made in obtaining additional lettings and rental increases which would benefit the group over the next few years. The cash position had improved in spite of increased spending on land purchases.</p>

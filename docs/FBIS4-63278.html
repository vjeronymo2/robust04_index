			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice Premier Sergey Shakhray will be carrying out  the duties of deputy to the head of the Russian government until  the signing by the president of a decree on being relieved of  these duties. The final decision on his future in the  government Shakhray does not intend to take until his meeting  with Premier Chernomyrdin and President Yeltsin. This was how  Shakhray commented to the information by an Interfax  correspondent that Yeltsin had not accepted Shakhray's  resignation.    Shakhray announced his resignation on Wednesday after he had  been removed by Yeltsin's orders from his other government post  as minister of nationality and regional affairs.    According to Shakhray's press service, he puts the  president's evaluation, voiced by Kostikov, of his personal  traits "on the conscience" of Press Secretary Kostikov. The  latter had voiced criticisms of Shakhray while quoting the  president on Thursday at a briefing in the Kremlin. Kostikov,  quoting the president's words, in part said that Shakhray is  marked by "a certain political fickleness and a desire to  accumulate many (governmental) posts, and has political plans  that don't always meet the true interests of Russia."</p>

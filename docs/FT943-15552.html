			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Subdued response to 3i public offer The public offer for 3i, the venture capital group, has been fully subscribed. But the response to the Pounds 178m share offer was subdued by comparison with the 385,000 individual registrations for its prospectus. Baring Brothers, the issue's sponsor, said details of acceptance levels would be released today. But early indications suggest that it was only marginally over-subscribed. The timing of the offer coincided with a further slump in the equity market and a deluge of flotations. The company said yesterday it was 'delighted' with the take-up. Sir George Russell, chairman, said: 'To raise over Pounds 700m, including over Pounds 178m from the public, in these market conditions is a very major achievement.' Brokers were unwilling to forecast share price performance. However, the consensus was that with the Pounds 522m institutional placement 1.7 times subscribed, the shares should edge above the issue price in early trading, but would offer little for the stags. The company, which is Europe's largest investor in unlisted companies, with stakes in more than 3,400 businesses, is not a natural target for retail investment support. However, it offers an unusual exposure to the unlisted smaller companies sector. With a market capitalisation of Pounds 1.58bn, it is likely to be propelled into the FT-SE 100 Index, which will require many institutions to buy it. Share allocations will be announced tomorrow. Dealings will start on July 18.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Widening Europe's Horizons"] </F>   [Text] The successful conclusion of negotiations between  Brussels and three of the applicants for EC membership will  furnish the Community with much needed momentum in the wake of  Maastricht and the fiasco of former Yugoslavia. The deals  accepted by Austria, Finland and Sweden on Tuesday [1 March] --  with Norway expected to follow suit next week -- prepare the way  for the inclusion of countries with strong democratic traditions  and economies which will make a net contribution to EC funds.  Their accession, scheduled for January 1 next year, will open  the door to the East European applicants, the Czech Republic,  Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. The widening of the Community,  espoused by successive British governments, is on the verge of  taking place.    There is, however, a furlong or two to go before the  finishing line. First, the Commission and Oslo must resolve  their differences over access to Norwegian waters for Spanish  fishermen. Second, the Community has to decide whether to  change the current system of qualified majority voting when the  new members join. Third, the agreements reached in Brussels are  subject to referenda in the applicant countries. According to  the opinion polls, those in favour of membership outnumber  opponents in Austria and Finland, but not in Sweden and Norway.    If all goes well, by next year the Community will form the  largest economic unit in the world, a market of 372 million  people with a combined gross domestic product of $6,700 billion.  As the date approaches for the Maastricht review conference in  1996, those countries, such as Britain, which remain sceptical  about the treaty's goals should find in the new Scandinavian  members useful allies in curbing federalist ambitions. The  enlargement, the first since Spain and Portugal joined in 1986,  is to be welcomed.</p>

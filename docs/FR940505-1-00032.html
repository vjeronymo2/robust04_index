			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the above discussion suggests, we seek to meet several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals as we engage in the development and promulgation of FIPs for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these California areas. These goals compel EPA to go beyond normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boundaries of rule development and implementation. EPA views both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SIP and FIP processes as an opportunity to make real progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> towards clean air on a variety of fronts. To do that, these FIPs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include more than rules which reduce emissions; they must also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve a concerted effort to make the process of bringing clean  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air to California work better. This effort will require even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better cooperation and coordination among local, state and federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air pollution control agencies, better coordination with the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governmental agencies which must contribute to the solutions, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more public involvement and education. Success demands that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> everyone work together on creative and innovative solutions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> difficult air pollution problems these areas still face.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Provide for the Emissions Reductions Needed To Meet EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obligations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> First and foremost, EPA's goal is to meet its obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Clean Air Act and under court orders, to promulgate plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Sacramento, Ventura, and the South Coast which provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment of the health-based ozone and carbon monoxide standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to historical failures of these three nonattainment areas to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop adequate plans themselves, the courts have determined that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, requires EPA to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans now. Although EPA disagreed with the retention of the FIP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations in the wake of the 1990 amendments, EPA takes its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations, and their ultimate objective of clean air very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriously. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  In EPA's view, any efforts to fulfill other goals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated below must complement this ultimate objective of clean air.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has previously published advance notices of proposed rulemakings (ANPRs) and/or notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) for FIPs in the three areas. For Sacramento, ANPRs were published on April 5, 1990 (55 FR 12669) and May 27, 1992 (57 FR 22194). For the South Coast, EPA published an ANPR on December 7, 1988 (53 FR 49494) and an NPR on September 5, 1990 (55 FR 36458). EPA published an NPR for Ventura on January 17, 1991 (56 FR 1754). While the approach of these FIPs is quite different, the reader should consult these notices for an account of the litigation, settlement agreements, modifications to the agreements, regulatory history, and EPA's then-current interpretations of its obligations. For an account of EPA's views on timing and circumstances of these FIP obligations, see especially the executive summary of the South Coast NPR. See also Coalition for Clean Air, 971 F.2d 219 (9th Cir. 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Develop the FIPs in a Manner Which Encourages and Assists the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Implementation of Air Quality Measures by State and Local Agencies <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is most appropriate for state and local agencies to play  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lead roles in addressing their own air pollution problems. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact, that is how Congress, through the Clean Air Act, intended it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to work. Traditionally, this approach has placed EPA in the roles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of technical advisor, grant officer, and, as a last resort when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> local or state responsibilities are not met, as a backstop. But  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the air quality problems faced by these California areas are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tremendous, and despite their efforts the state and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governments have been as yet unable to provide a plan for attaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the health standards. It has therefore become necessary, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legally and practically, for EPA to play the backstop role at this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As EPA pursues this role, we believe that we must do so in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manner which both encourages and supports the efforts of the state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and local governments to meet their continuing air quality related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities, especially regarding the development of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 15 SIP submittal. In short, this means moving beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mere fulfillment of our legal responsibilities toward the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment of a full working partnership among all parties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Obviously, the first real test of this new partnership begins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> now. As has been previously discussed, these FIPs are being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed at the same time as state and local agencies are preparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet many of the Act's most important requirements, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own plans to address the very same obligation as these FIPs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment of the ozone NAAQS. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  EPA is concerned that issuance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comprehensive regulatory FIPs within the FIP time frame has the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential to disrupt the SIP planning process. State and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies will be in the process of designing air quality measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for legislative or board consideration at the same time the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government is proposing to promulgate measures to cover the very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> same emission sources. At the very least, these parallel planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes are likely to create confusion for the public and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated community. EPA's goal is to develop the FIPs in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that supports effective air quality planning by the responsible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state and local agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For carbon monoxide, the South Coast is revising its CO SIP which was submitted to EPA in 1992. The South Coast is currently scheduled to submit this revised SIP to EPA in November 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Minimize Federal Intrusion Into State and Local Affairs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA will meet its obligations to prepare federal plans for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clean air in these three areas of California, and EPA must, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will if necessary, implement the measures it promulgates. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA firmly believes that clean air is more likely to be achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> faster, and in greater harmony with local economic and community  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals, if its own role is minimized by effective state and local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

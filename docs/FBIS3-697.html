Koyo said on state radio late  Thursday that more than 3,000 of those affected "held false  qualifications", while the others were in fact "fictitious"  employees created to enable people to obtain "five to ten  salaries" each month.    Most of those dismissed were recruited under the former  ruling party, the Congolese Labour Party, under pressure from  the trade unions, which responded to Koyo's announcement with a  strike threat.    The head of the main CSTC labour confederation, Louis  Gondou,  said "all this is illegal because we concluded an agreement with  the government for the payment of January and February salaries  to these 8,050 employeers who worked normally." "The workers  will meet Friday to decide whether to strike against this  measure," he added.    Koyo also announced that the government planned to lay off  934 civil servants aged over 55, who should have been retired a  year ago but were not because of "bureaucratic difficulties."    The planned lay-offs will enable the government to cut the  annual pay allocation for some 80,000 civil servants from 134  billion CFA francs (229 million dollars) to about 122 billion  CFA francs (208 million dollars), informed sources said.</p>

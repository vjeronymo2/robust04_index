Chien, currently in Boston, was reported  as wanting to resign due to frustration of the impasse to  broaden diplomatic relations and internal opposition to  diplomatic policies from the Legislature, local papers reported.  Presidential aide said Li has made no concrete plans to go  abroad, denying a local newspaper report that the president will  leave for Bali on February 9 and will meet with Indonesian  President Suharto.    Esther Kuo, a presidential spokeswoman, said that once the  president's overseas travel plan matures, the office will  announce that at the proper time. Kuo urged the media not to  play up Li's possible trip, saying the (?extension) of the  itinerary will create unnecessary trouble. She said that the  pressure from Peking was the apparent obstacle, saying Li's  travel plan over the past two years were aborted due to the  similar obstacle.</p>

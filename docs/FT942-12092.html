			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / SPD risks votes with tax plan: German opposition party leadership agrees election manifesto Germany's opposition Social Democrats yesterday committed themselves to a controversial tax reform package as the cornerstone of their election platform, in spite of evidence that it could lose votes. Mr Rudolf Scharping, SPD leader and candidate for the post of federal chancellor, faced down sharp criticism of his leadership style to force the party programme through his national executive committee with only one abstention. The package includes a large tax reform to make energy more expensive, but stops short of calling for a national motorway speed limit, apparently for fear of losing votes from the car-crazy nation. Instead, the SPD will campaign for a Europe-wide speed limit, although Germany is the only EU member state without one. Mr Scharping said the programme still included a plan to switch the government's 7.5 per cent 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax, needed to pay for the soaring costs of German unification, to a 10 per cent surcharge payable only by higher earners. When it was unveiled in March, it caused an immediate outcry amongst the broad mass of middle-income earners, and a slump in SPD popularity in the opinion polls. According to Mr Friedrich Bohl, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's closest ministerial aide, the surcharge will last for at least five years, and possible longer, in order to pay the annual cost of transfers to east Germany running at between DM140bn (Pounds 56bn) and DM150bn (Pounds 60bn). 'That is an enormous sum and we have to finance it, which is why we have the solidarity surcharge,' he said. However the SPD plan, although on the face of it a considerable relief to the majority of taxpayers, is in danger of targeting precisely those more prosperous floating voters it needs to win next October's election. The programme also includes an 'ecological tax reform' which would switch the burden of taxation from labour-related costs to energy and raw materials, intended simultaneously to promote employment and discourage energy consumption. The SPD leader said that there would be no increase in the overall tax burden from the level to be reached next year, describing it as 'a programme based on solid finances. . . . and social justice'. There would be a 'step-by-step reduction' in taxes and deductions hitting payroll costs, alongside a step-by-step introduction of the new energy taxes. The third main economic plank of the party programme is a commitment to promotion of more research and investment in new technologies, including a programme of public investment in development of solar energy.</p>

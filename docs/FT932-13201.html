			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Revival in west remains fragile THE HOUSING market in south Wales and south-west England has stabilised but it is premature to talk of a firm recovery. Across the region more interest is reported from buyers, but houses have to be at the right price to sell. 'Generally speaking there are more buyers around,' said Mr Peter Mulcahy, principal partner of Peter Mulcahy, an independent chain of eight offices in south Wales. 'Prices now are very realistically pitched, very much more related to what people earn, and allied to that are the low interest rates.' But Mr Carey Jones, director and general manager of Crown &amp; Co, which has 16 offices in south Wales, warned: 'What recovery there is is very thin. We have better figures than in 1992 but not as good as 1991, which was not a brilliant year by any stretch of the imagination.' Mr Justin James, associate partner of Stags, an independent group of seven offices in Devon and Somerset, said: 'The recovery is sporadic, although in the cheaper price bracket there is more movement, reflecting the cheaper cost of borrowing. Pricing is absolutely crucial and if something is overpriced it becomes obvious very quickly.' Job security, he said, was a more important factor now than interest rates. Other estate agents confirm that the revival in the housing market is mostly confined to cheaper properties. Mr John Hiles, partner of the 13 CJ Hole offices in Avon, said: 'We are seeing a lot more movement but it is in specific areas - the first-time buyers and even second-time buyers, but mainly confined to under Pounds 90,000. There is some movement above that, but negative equity is beginning to creep up as a real practical prob-lem.' Houses for which estate agents have taken recent instructions, and are at 1993 prices, are beginning to sell quite quickly, especially new homes. 'Developers are more realistic than some sellers on prices,' said Mr Hiles. 'At one show home last weekend we had 120 visitors.' But 'old chestnuts', as one agent called properties which have been on the market for a year or more, will still not sell unless their prices are reduced. Agents report that offers are now closer to asking prices, provided that the latter are realistic. Some estate agents are finding that there are more good buyers around now than good properties. Mr James said: 'Across the board there is not much property coming on the market, particularly of country properties in the middle and upper ranges.' As yet, there is no upward pressure on prices. 'There is no need or concern that they are likely to rise because there are an awful lot of properties on the market,' said Mr Mulcahy. Mr James said: 'Any building society which says that prices have risen by 1 per cent should be sent on the next rocket to Mars and left there.'</p>

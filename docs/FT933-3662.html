			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / The black anniversary turns golden THIS Thursday marks the anniversary of Black Wednesday. It has been 12 months in which the UK economy has enjoyed a golden period - at least in comparison with what went before. Sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16 was a big factor behind the 1.3 per cent growth in gross domestic product between the third quarter of 1992 and the second quarter this year, writes Peter Marsh. Coming after the deep recession which started during 1990 and petered out around the middle of last year, such a large expansion in output would almost certainly not have happened had the pound stayed in the mechanism. Sterling's decoupling from the D-Mark has enabled the UK government to cut interest rates from 10 per cent to 6 per cent, boosting domestic demand. That particularly helped manufacturers, which have pushed up output 2.6 per cent in the past year. They have been aided by the 11 per cent depreciation in sterling (on a trade-weighted basis) over the period which has increased competitiveness. And while unemployment remains high, it has come down from a record 2.99m in January.</p>

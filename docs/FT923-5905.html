			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee producers united on pact BRAZIL, COLOMBIA and Costa Rica presented a united front after three days of talks on the establishment of a new International Coffee Agreement and said the International Coffee Organisation must register 'decisive progress' at its meeting in September. Brazil is to call a producers' meeting for September 19 and 20, before the ICO discussions begin. Representatives from the three coffee-producing countries pointed out that producers had accepted the universal quota and agreed to negotiate other issues presented by the consuming countries. But they deplored the fact that consuming countries were not showing willingness to share the responsibility for ensuring controls on coffee imports. 'We are not going to export coffee other than that established by our quotas,' said Mr Jorge Cardenas, manager of Colombia's Coffee Federation. He insisted that it was urgent to get the pact going and if there was no will to negotiate in September the producers 'would have to analyse other alternatives'. The joint communique refers to the 'devastating effects' of low prices. Colombia is to take at least 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of coffee out of production to cut its present output of 17m bags (60 kg each), which is draining the national coffee fund. Income from coffee has now dropped to less than 20 per cent of Colombia's export earnings.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are not adopting the use of scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales to identify deficiencies because, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described below, the Act imposes limitations that make it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impractical. However, we are adopting substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance as the standard of performance to which providers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be held. This is consistent with the intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act, and will accomplish much of what the advocates of scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and severity scales claimed that the scales would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplish. Although the thrust of nursing home reform was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to codify a system of nursing home regulation that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome oriented, the Congress enacted a number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that simply do not lend themselves to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome analysis. Moreover, the Act does not always lend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> itself to an analysis of whether the resident population as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a whole was treated properly which, in our view, would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential to a workable scope index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, section 1919(b)(3)(C)(i)(I) of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires facilities to conduct a resident assessment no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> later than 14 days after admission. Whether a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complies with this obligation, which the Act makes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable to each resident, rests only on whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment was in fact done by the date prescribed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act. Should a facility conduct an assessment on the 15th  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day after a resident's admission, that facility will have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failed to comply with the requirement, notwithstanding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact that it may have conducted timely assessments on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other residents, and notwithstanding the fact that there may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been no negative outcome for the resident who received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the untimely assessment. In the same fashion, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(b)(7) of the Act requires that facilities having more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 120 beds employ a full-time social worker. Should a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility having 121 beds not have such an employee, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure is a clear violation of the statutory standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regardless of whether there are any documented negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcomes that resulted from this failure. There are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous other examples of this type of requirement in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other requirements in the Act, as some commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out, focus on a facility's duty with respect to each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident and not its duty to perform in a certain fashion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the bulk of all individuals in residence. Other than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resident assessment requirement discussed above, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(c)(1)(A) of the Act requires facilities to protect and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promote the rights of each resident. Should a facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, not perform in such a manner (as further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in the Act and implementing regulations) even for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one resident, it cannot be said that the facility was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficient in this area notwithstanding the fact that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure was an isolated one. In the same way, section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1919(b)(6) of the Act requires that the health care of every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident be under the supervision of a physician (or, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State's option, other specified health care professionals).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Here, too, a facility may not be determined to meet this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement if it has successfully provided for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision for most of its residents as long as even one of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its residents has not had the benefit of such supervision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is not to say that any violation of these or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar requirements ought to result in the imposition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanctions of consequence. As we suggested in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, and as we require in this final rule, the degree of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriousness of a deficiency looms large in determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriateness of a remedy. In some of the hypothetical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situations cited above, there may be nothing more than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan of correction that is called for. The point is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, that the kind of analysis that allows for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of a deficiency's seriousness in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an appropriate remedy will not always work when seriousness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is considered to determine whether a deficiency exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> None of the commenters who sought the use of scales in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> context acknowledged these issues squarely or made  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions that would allow us to address this matter in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way that comports with the structure of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The substantial compliance standard that we are adopting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tolerates a reasonable degree of imperfection. Even though  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies will be cited for violations that constitute no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actual harm and a potential for no more than minimal harm,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these deficiencies, due to their negligible seriousness,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not deny a provider a certification of compliance nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject a provider to a remedy. The substantial compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard should also insulate providers from the uneven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement that may result from inconsistent surveyor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> behavior, because the marginal deficiencies that surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are likely to be the most uncertain about citing are liable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be the deficiencies that fall into the substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance range, and, consequently, neither a facility in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a situation constituting no actual harm and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for no more than minimal harm was cited as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency nor a facility in which the same situation was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not cited as a deficiency will be penalized.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter was concerned that a formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity scheme to determine deficiencies would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> add issues to hearings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Providers have the opportunity to appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certifications of noncompliance leading to an enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedy, and if we adopted scope and severity scales for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining deficiencies, the commenter is correct that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity assignments would be an integral part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the determination of noncompliance, and would therefore be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to challenge if the deficiency led to the imposition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an enforcement remedy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters requested that we incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the survey guidelines into the body of survey and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement regulations. Certain commenters believed that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure to do so would violate the Federal Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, which requires that general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of proposed rulemaking be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> when the rulemaking is substantive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Nasrallah al-Dawudi: "The Accursed, </F> Self-Contradictory One"]    [Text] The Iraqis have dealt with the accursed Ekeus with  honesty and good will, avoiding the tricks of politics and the  encroachments of the four big powers in the UN corridors. This  has been intended to draw attention to the fact that we have  frequently stressed, namely, that Iraq has fulfilled its  commitments toward the Security Council resolutions.    This fact was confirmed in the statements made by the  accursed Ekeus. These statements usually begin positively, and  those concerned with politics and its secrets clearly understand  such positive statements. Thus, the Security Council and its  Special Commission should also clearly fulfill their commitments  toward Iraq, lift the total embargo of its oil exports, and end  the unjust blockade without resorting to a test period. This is  because positiveness in international dealings means  credibility. Throughout the joint work with the UN Special  Commission, Iraq has been credible, particularly within the  framework of building confidence, stemming from Iraq's  international commitments and the maintenance of independent  political and national decisionmaking.    Has the accursed Ekeus managed to move one step forward on  the path of this positiveness, which remained the common  denominator of all his statements before and after each round of  talks held in Baghdad or at the UN headquarters? One who  follows events sees the contrary and even senses a contradiction  that evokes wonder and astonishment. Days after the talks  ended, the accursed one ignored positiviteness and said  something that satisfied the four big powers and stimulated the  appetite of the agents, the defeatists, and their hired media  trumpets run by Zionism.    The accursed Ekeus went back on his recent statements when  he  was received by the slaves of the Americans in the [Iraqi]  governorate of Kuwait. Thus, positiveness turned into  differences, and the tears he shed at the al-Rashid Hotel turned  into greed for a handful of dollars. Ekeus wanted to ignite a  fire and undermine Iraqi steadfastness. But, he did not realize  that an Iraqi palm tree will not bow to storms. History will  note that Ekeus has sold only the honor of his job, lost  himself, and deserves a new nickname in addition to his previous  nicknames. Mankind will recall Ekeus as an accursed and  self-contradictory one. How bad are his nicknames and his loss  of conscience!</p>

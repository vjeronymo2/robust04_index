			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / CBI denies anti-union campaign British companies are not pursuing an anti-union offensive among their employees, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. The sharp decline in trade union membership and collective bargaining since the mid-1980s reflected 'a shared wish in the workplace for dealings on a different basis,' the CBI said. It told the Commons employment committee's inquiry into the future of unions: 'There is no evidence that employers have been forcing the pace. 'A substantial number of employers work with trade unions in their businesses and find the relationships more or less satisfactory. More harmonious relations and greater involvement in the workplace may provide some positive reasons for employees to be less interested in union membership.' In a document submitted to the committee, it said 'there is still scope for a continuing role for trade unions' but only if they adapt to change in an enterprise rather than obstruct it. The CBI argued that unions should concentrate on providing advice and support facilities for individual workers in 'seeking to invoke their legal rights'. It said member companies 'anticipate dealing more directly with the workforce and building up relationships on an individual basis - but frequently to complement, rather than replace collective bargaining'. The CBI said unions should 'never again' have 'the capacity to disrupt the commercial and day-to-day life of the nation and exercise excessive influence over government experienced in the late 1970s'. But it backed the retention of the Trades Union Congress on statutory bodies such as the Health and Safety Commission, the conciliation service Acas, and the commissions on racial equality and equal opportunities. A survey of 79 British employer organisations found that in the past three years they have undergone a change of role from collective bargainers with trade unions to advisory and lobbying bodies. The survey is published today by Industrial Relations Services, the research body.</p>

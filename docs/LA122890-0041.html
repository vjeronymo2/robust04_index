			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> I Wanna Be a Mermaid: British actress Emily Lloyd sued Orion Pictures Corp. for  more than $5 million on Wednesday, claiming she was promised the role in the  film "Mermaids" that went to Winona Ryder.  </P> <P> Lloyd, 20, contends that in January, 1989, her agent reached an oral agreement  with Orion that she would play Cher's daughter in the film. An Orion agent then  sent Lloyd a letter outlining the terms of the contract, Lloyd's attorney said.  In May, however, Lloyd learned she would not be playing the Charlotte Flax  character in the movie. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

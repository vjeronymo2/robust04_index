			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Josef Joffe: "England and Germany United Against </F> Europe?"]    [Text] Who is interested in Europe? The Germans have  become skeptical since reunification and the British have always  been so. The Danes said "no" to Maastricht on one occasion; in  France, Europe just made it in the referendum. However, with  just two weeks to go to the Strasbourg European Parliament  elections, Europe fans have at least one consolation. The  turnout will be particularly high. Eight out of 10 people  eligible to vote said that they would "definitely" go to the  polls; a further 15 percent said that it would be "very" likely  or "quite probable."    Only 5 percent do not want to vote at all; even in England,  the number of people who do not want to vote only accounts for 6  percent of the electorate. What is the motivation of those  radicals who do not want to vote? Almost a quarter of them  across Europe said that the "election is unimportant" or "my  vote does not count." Almost every fifth of those who are  reluctant to vote do not know what is at stake.    Essentially, what one should assume is that the future of  European integration is at stake. Should one proceed along the  Maastricht path, should one do so more slowly, or should one  just go back? This indicates a high degree of skepticism about  Europe. In all 12 EU countries, 40 percent of those polled  still say that they would like "less" integration. Half of  those polled want "more," but there are some unexpected  differences among individual member states. The figure for  Britain is not surprising: Over 60 percent opt for "less  integration."    Of course, the Germans, who were once so favorably disposed  toward integration, have now become "British": Six out of 10 of  those polled want "less" of a community, while those who are in  favor of integration have fallen to about a third. The Germans  and the Anglo-Saxons are in one boat -- that is the biggest  surprise to come out of the poll conducted by SUEDDEUTSCHE  ZEITUNG and six other European partner newspapers during the  second half of May.    The leading Europhiles are the Italians, closely followed by  the Spaniards and the Dutch. Even the "Gaullist" French exceed  the Germans in their support for integration.    Another way of measuring the support for integration is  offered by questions on the powers of the European Parliament  and the EU Commission. Do these supranational institutions have  too much or too little power? If someone says "too little,"  then it can be assumed that he wants a stronger European state.  In this respect, the European Parliament fares slightly worse  than the community as such. Exactly half of the European  electorate wants "more integration," but only 46 percent believe  that the European Parliament has too few powers. Does it have  too much power? That is the view -- this could have been  foreseen -- held by the British (58 percent), but also by the  Irish (43 percent), and the Greeks (37 percent). The  percentages for these countries are similar with respect to the  question of whether the EU Commission has too much power.    The EC Commission has always seen itself as the engine  behind  integration. Of course, it cannot draw too much strength from  the poll, because the European public is undecided: The camps  that say the commission has too much or too little power are of  about the same strength (about 30 percent).    In short, the poll does not provide much ammunition for  those  who want a faster rate of progress on the way to a "closer"  Europe. The picture is clearer with regard to expansion --  there are significant differences between the various groups of  candidates for admission. Put bluntly: "Those who are like us  can come in, but we are not so sure about those who have a  different political and economic tradition."    Almost four-fifths of the 12-member community welcome the  admission of Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Switzerland whereas  not even 10 percent oppose that. That indicates a clear "yes"  to expansion. The picture is more complicated in the case of  the Central European applicants Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and  the Czech Republic. Only half of those polled want to have them  in the European Union [EU] and a third oppose their membership.  With an approval rating of 60 percent, the Germans are above  the EU average, but they are still significantly behind the  Italians, who have turned out to be the East Europeans' best  friends.    What about the issue of a European currency? The answer is  on the one hand yes and on the other hand no. Half believe  there will be a currency union composed of at least three  currencies by the year 2000 and the other half does not want to  believe that. Only the British stand out in this respect.  Two-thirds believe -- or, to be more precise, fear -- that they  could be confronted with a European currency in the next few  years.    In a very indirect way, the poll sought to gauge the basic  political climate in Europe, the question being "who trusts  whom?" The results confirm a well-known picture: The French and  the Germans trust each other the most. The French and the  Germans trust the English, followed by the Italians, the least.  However, cracks are appearing in the Franco-German marriage.  Almost just as many French (17 percent) mistrust the Germans as  trust them (20 percent). However, the Germans do not consider  the French to be formidable opponents: Only a tiny number  mistrust the former "archenemy."    Are the Europeans prepared to do more about the Balkans  other  than talks and reason? The clear answer is: "no." Not even a  fifth of those polled support aerial bombardments; exactly 16  percent support the deployment of ground troops. The German  picture corresponds precisely to the European one.    The conclusion is that there are only European majorities on  two issues. Almost everyone wants to go to vote and about 80  percent support the expansion of the EU to include the  Scandinavian and neutral states. The question of Europe's  future -- should we continue along the path leading to the  united states of Europe? -- remains open: Exactly half say  "yes," 40 percent want a looser union, and the rest do not know  what they want.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Congress President Jaime Yoshiyama on 4 April  predicted that the declining figures in favor of President  Alberto Fujimori's candidacy will pick up as soon as he starts  his electoral campaign.    Yoshiyama thus virtually made official Fujimori's candidacy  for reelection, something the chief of state has refused to  confirm so far.    Yoshiyama thus refuted poll results that show former UN  Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as the undoubtable  winner of the presidential elections.    Polls show 47 percent support for Perez de Cuellar and only  38 percent for Fujimori.    Fujimori's "representative" also referred to Perez de  Cuellar  in stating that all candidates who live abroad should go into  the opposition to debate the president and state their  viewpoints.    Without mentioning his name, he said the candidates who live  abroad should come to the country and dirty their shoes by  visiting different points of the country.    He also said it would be good that Fujimori remains  president  to be able to continue his pacification and economic  stabilization program.    Yoshiyama later said that the delay in the beginning of  ordinary Congress sessions is due to the need for the committee  presidents to coordinate their debate agendas to make them as  productive as possible.    Legislator Henry Pease has repeated charges that government  representatives seek to delay beginning Congress sessions to  prevent the debate of electoral bills and others such as the  ones on fiscal policies and municipalities.    Pease charged that there is an attempt to implement an  electoral system that everybody regards as untimely and  inconvenient for the country because it is unreasonable.    Yoshiyama, in turn, said that among the draft bills to be  debated are those for the electoral system, which will allow the  system's reorganization, as established by the new Constitution.    He commented that it will prevent any chance of fraud and  will allow clear elections.    The Congress president added that the important thing is  whether there is any political will to hold clear elections with  the presence of international observers.    He commented that Congress will make the laws clearer so  there is no intention of fraud, as the opposition groups have  charged.    He added that the Constitution was approved by the large  majority of the people and all that remains to be done is to  adjust the electoral law to it.    Yoshiyama said he is not against the establishment of an  independent body to supervise the elections, as some groups have  proposed.    He said that everything that will contribute to a clear  process is welcome; the presence of international observers and  the media is something in favor of the electoral process.    Another bill that must be debated is the one referring to  ownership certificates that will allow the distribution of 2  million title deeds to farmers.    He added that next week Congress also must debate the water  and education draft bills.    The Congress president made these statements after a  ceremony  to mark the 95th anniversary of the Japanese emigration, which  also was attended by Japanese Ambassador Nobuo Nishisaki.</p>

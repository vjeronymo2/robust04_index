			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In proposed &sect;618.8010 (``Related Services Authorization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Process''), the FCA replaces the prior approval in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing regulation in part, by communicating to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions those services it has approved, which may then  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be offered without further regulatory approval. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulation also describes the process for the FCA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review of new services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;618.8015 (``Policy Guidelines'') requires each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution offering related services to adopt a policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressing related services. Proposed &sect;618.8020  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``Feasibility Requirements'') contains criteria for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility analysis that must be performed in conjunction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with developing a new service program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;618.8025 (``Feasibility Reviews'') addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statutory requirement for the board of directors of each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding bank to determine that association-related service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs are feasible. The proposed regulation requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association to perform a feasibility analysis and requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the bank's board of directors to verify that this analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been done, and limits the scope and frequency of reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the bank must perform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final section in subpart A, &sect;618.8030  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``Out-of-Territory Related Services''), establishes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory basis for providing out-of-territory related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The FCA's policy statement and bookletter on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offering services outside an institution's chartered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> territory would be superseded by these provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Member Insurance regulation in subpart B  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains largely unchanged with two exceptions: (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement for a debtor/creditor relationship would no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer be necessary for sales of certain types of insurance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (2) employee compensation for insurance sales would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowed within certain limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Section-by-Section Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Subpart A_Related Services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 618.8000_Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 618.8000 of the proposed regulation would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> define the term ``program'' to mean the method or procedure by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which an institution provides a related service. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of the definition is to distinguish between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept or type of activity that will be provided, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> farm business consulting, and the manner in which an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution will provide the particular service. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinction between the type of related service and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's program for providing the service will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed further in the discussion of proposed &sect;618.8010.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Related services'' would be defined to mean any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activity provided by a System bank or association that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pertains to the recipient's on-farm, aquatic or cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation, including control of related financial matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition is intended to be broadly construed in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to encompass services, other than the making of loans, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution may want to offer to persons or entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible to borrow. It should be noted that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition does not rely upon whether the institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charges fees or makes a profit from offering a service in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> making a determination as to whether it is considered a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``related service.'' The FCA recognizes that institutions may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offer related services at cost or at a slight loss in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to increase customer satisfaction or attract new customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such decisions are considered business decisions that will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reviewed in the examination context. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of related services is not intended to include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising or purely promotional activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although other terms, such as ``technical assistance,''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``financial and technical assistance,'' and ``financially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services,'' are referenced in the Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinction among these types of services has become  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negligible. In fact, the legislative history for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enactment of the Farm Credit Act of 1971 <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distinguish among these terms. Therefore, in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce any confusion, the proposed definition would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all services referred to above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Pub. L. 92&hyph;181, Dec. 10, 1971. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PPC work group commented that the on-farm  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement should not be interpreted to limit authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related services to only those services that relate to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physical operations of the farm. The FCA agrees that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Congress did not intend the on-farm requirement to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interpreted in such a restrictive manner and, historically,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FCA has not done so in approving related service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The FCA interprets the on-farm requirement to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mean that related services must pertain to the farming or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aquatic operations of the recipients or be useful in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> managing the financial matters of such operations. In fact,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many of the services specifically mentioned by Congress when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it enacted the related services authority in 1971 are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to farming and aquatic operations and controlling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the risks associated with such operations rather than being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a direct part of the physical operation. Those services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically mentioned in the statute or legislative history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include insurance, estate planning, and tax services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

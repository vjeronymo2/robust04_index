			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COACHES' DUTIES ALSO INCLUDE RAISING MONEY FOR THEIR TEAMS  </P> <P> John deFries was a seven-year assistant line coach at Rancho Santiago College  before he was named to replace Herb Hill as the varsity football coach at Loara  High School last spring.  </P> <P> DeFries expected a transition from simply wearing a cap and whistle and  coaching at Rancho Santiago to becoming "a part-time parent, baby-sitter,  academic adviser and personal counselor" when he accepted the coaching job at  Loara.  </P> <P> And deFries has added another title to his long list of duties: fund-raiser.  </P> <P> "You've got to be a fund-raiser just to survive these days," he said. "The  funds you receive from the Associated Student Body (ASB) can't possibly cover  all the expenses incurred by a football program."  </P> <P> DeFries' first task was to help organize a jogathon last spring. Loara's  coaches asked each of the program's 75 players to get 10 pledges each from  relatives, friends and neighbors to help buy new game jerseys.  </P> <P> The players ran laps and earned about $2,000. The event was so successful that  deFries is planning a liftathon this spring, in which his players will lift  weights for pledges.  </P> <P> While the majority of the student body took the summer off, deFries had his  team competing in a summer passing league at El Dorado and an eight-team  tournament at Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> DeFries charged each player a $50 participation fee. That helped to pay a  $1,000 coaching stipend for two assistants who aided deFries.  </P> <P> "I did some checking and found out we were undercharging the kids for our  summer program," deFries said. "Most schools charge between $75-$100. Mater Dei  is getting $150. I'm sure we'll go up next summer, because we plan on playing  in Rancho Santiago's summer tournament."  </P> <P> When the season began, deFries played host to Wednesday night booster club  meetings, in which he reviews game films from the previous week. The booster  board raffles prizes and a game ball, usually earning $50.  </P> <P> The 50-50 drawing on game nights usually earns about $100, and Loara's football  program splits a $1 fee for those who attend a party at an Anaheim pizza parlor  after each home game.  </P> <P> "It doesn't sound like a lot of money, but it all adds up," deFries said.  </P> <P> School administrators are hoping bingo, added this summer on campus, will  become a big money-making proposition. Loara's band boosters started the  program off-campus a couple of years ago but it failed.  </P> <P> DeFries estimates the games are drawing 175 players and netting $1,500 to  $2,000 each week.  </P> <P> "Our football booster board is helping out and will get a share of the profits  depending upon how many volunteers show up each week," he said. "We're still  paying off the equipment, but I'm hoping we'll start seeing some profits soon."  </P> <P> Loara's football boosters budgeted about $4,000 for any additional expenses  deFries might incur during the season. The money was raised selling  advertisements for the game programs.  </P> <P> DeFries has given the boosters one bill for 25 game-day shirts for his coaching  staff and another for seven game films at $65 each.  </P> <P> "I never bargained to be just a coach when I took this job," he said. "I knew  that going in. You're more than a coach at this level, and helping to raise  money to keep your program on top is just part of the job."  </P></p>

According to intelligence reports, the organization  operates by bribing the authorities who try to fight them. The  very few who have dared to report on them are journalists.    Myriam Ortiz brings us a report, done with the cooperation  of  Peru's Channel 9:    [Begin Ortiz recording] According to authorities, the  so-called Cali Cartel also has a well-structured organization in  Peru known as Los Calenos.    Waldo Vargas, alias El Ministro, is considered the main  leader. He purchases drugs worth $144 million every year.  Vargas, born in Colombia, is the lord and master of the Bajo  Huallaga area. He has gone as far as using Peruvian Air Force  helicopters to transport drugs, according to information given  to the general command.    Demetrio Limoniel Chavez, also known as El Vaticano, is the  other leader of the organization. It is estimated that he buys  $216 million worth of drugs every year. El Vaticano works with  his brother Humberto, also known as Calavera, who manages the  landing strips, but his main storage center is in Palma Pampa,  Ayacucho, from where the flights leave for Colombia.    Berta Chavez, also known as La Calena, is El Vaticano's  sister, and she markets 5 tons of coca paste each month. She  was arrested in September 1993, but a judge released her  recently.    (Luis Hernan Pineda Menjura), also known as Trompa de Buque,  and La Calena were in charge of a shipment landing strip and  this laboratory uncovered by police.    Everything seems to indicate that this cartel's strategy is  to buy the authorities in charge of fighting drug traffic. For  this reason, they operate as if they were in their own homes,  and the cases of corruption become more evident everyday.    Major (Enrique Paez), former commander of the Zaposoa Base,  has admitted he allowed drug flights to come in, while Maj.  Alfredo Ruiz, former commander of (Duchisa), was caught when he  was authorizing the shipment of a cargo of coca paste to  Colombia.    The military does not like the journalists' research. Some  have been murdered; others have received death threats. [end  recording]</p>

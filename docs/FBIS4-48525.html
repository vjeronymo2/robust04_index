			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the South African Police Public </F> Relations on the SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] The General Staff of the South African Police  Service (now including all the former police forces of the TVBC  [Transkei - Bophuthatswana - Venda - Ciskei] and self governing  territories) today held in-depth discussions, on a wide range of  policing issues, with Mr Sydney Mufamadi, the minister of safety  and security and his deputy, Mr Joe Mathews.    The generals pledged their full commitment to uphold the  constitution and assured Ministers Mufamadi and Mathews of their  full support in the fight against crime and violence.    The South African Police Service would perform its duty in a  professional, impartial and non-political manner, in service of  all the people of South Africa.    Although the challenges facing policing in South Africa were  formidable, South Africa could be made a much safer and more  secure country with the full co-operation of the community.    Reconciliation and nation-building were also priorities for  the South African Police Service, which looked forward to  providing the security necessary for democracy and economic  growth to flourish in South Africa.    The General Staff also assured all members of the South  African Police Service that they had nothing to fear and would  always be treated in a fair and just manner.    Members who conducted themselves in a professional manner  had  no reason whatsoever to fear for their jobs or security.    The General Staff again committed itself to serving and  promoting the professional interests of all South African Police  Service members.</p>

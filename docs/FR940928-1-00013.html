			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As for the 172(c)(5) NSR requirement, once an area is redesignated to attainment, this requirement is no longer applicable. The area then becomes subject to prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) requirements in lieu of the NSR program (57 FR 13564). Currently, the San Francisco Bay Area is amending its NSR rule to comply with the provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments. Prior to final action on the redesignation request and maintenance plan, EPA will take final rulemaking action on the BAAQMD's NSR program with respect to the ozone requirements of sections 182(a)(2)(C) and 182(b)(5) in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document. Upon redesignation to attainment, BAAQMD will continue with NSR permitting until such time as BAAQMD requests delegation of the PSD program for VOC. At that time, the nonattainment area requirements of the BAAQMD's NSR program will be placed in the contingency plan. See the TSD accompanying this notice for a detailed discussion of the NSR requirements and deficiencies in the current regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, for purposes of redesignation, the San Francisco Bay Area SIP was reviewed to ensure that all requirements of section 110(a)(2), containing general SIP elements, under the Act were satisfied. Title 40 CFR 52.220 evidences that the San Francisco Bay Area SIP was approved under section 110 of the Act, and further that it satisfies all applicable part D, title I requirements with the exception of the outstanding part D requirements for the ozone SIP, mentioned above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B.2. Subpart 1 of Part D_ Section 176 Conformity Plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Provisions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 176(c) of the Act requires States to revise their SIPs to establish criteria and procedures to ensure that Federal actions, before they are taken, conform to the air quality planning goals in the applicable State SIP. The requirement to determine conformity applies to transportation plans, programs and projects developed, funded, or approved under title 23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act (``transportation conformity''), as well as to all other Federal actions (``general conformity''). Section 176 further provides that the conformity revisions to be submitted by the States must be consistent with Federal conformity regulations that the Act required EPA to promulgate. Congress provided for the State revisions to be submitted one year after the date for promulgation of final EPA conformity regulations. When that date passed without such promulgation, EPA's General Preamble for the Implementation of title I informed the State that its conformity regulations would establish a submittal date ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  57 FR 13498, 13557, (April 16, 1992)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA promulgated final transportation conformity regulations on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62118) and general conformity regulations on November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63214).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These conformity rules require that States adopt both transportation and general conformity provisions in the SIP for areas designated nonattainment or subject to a maintenance plan approved under CAA section 175A. Pursuant to 40 CFR 51.396 of the transportation conformity rule and 40 CFR 51.851 of the general conformity rule, the State of California is required to submit a SIP revision containing transportation conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by November 25, 1994. Similarly, California is required to submit a SIP revision containing general conformity criteria and procedures consistent with those established in the Federal rule by December 1, 1994. Because the deadlines for these submittals have not yet come due, they are not applicable requirements under section 107(d)(3)(E)(v) and, thus, do not affect approval of this redesignation request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the BAAQMD has committed to revise its SIP to be consistent with the final Federal regulations on conformity by the applicable November 1994 deadlines (see 40 CFR 51.396(a) and 51.851(a), November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62218) and November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63247), respectively).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> B.3. Subpart 2 of Part D_Section 182(a) and 182(b) Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The San Francisco Bay Area is a moderate ozone nonattainment area. Under subpart 2 of part D, such areas must meet the requirements for marginal areas under section 182(a)(1) as well as the requirements for moderate areas contained in section 182(b). As discussed in section 2.B.2. above, for purposes of section 107(d)(3)(E)(v), the San Francisco Bay Area must meet only those requirements of sections 182 (a) and (b) which were due prior to or at the time of the submittal of a complete redesignation request. The BAAQMD has met the requirements of section 182 with the exception of VOC RACT rule corrections, the emissions statement rule, and the NSR rule corrections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the request of the CARB, EPA will parallel process the SIP revisions required pursuant to section 182(a) and (b) in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice before final action on the redesignation request and maintenance plan (See letter dated July 21, 1994 from James D. Boyd, Executive Officer, CARB to Felicia Marcus, Regional Administrator, EPA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

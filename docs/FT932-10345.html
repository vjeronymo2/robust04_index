			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / Senior Tories join reshuffle calls: Major urged by colleagues to act to restore his authority CLOSE associates of Mr John Major last night echoed the chorus of calls from Conservative MPs for Mr Norman Lamont to be moved from the Treasury as the disarray in the Tory party threatened to spill over into the cabinet. Humiliating defeats last week in the Newbury by-election and in the shire counties brought conflicting demands on the prime minister from cabinet ministers on how the government should restore its political authority. Some suggested that the prime minister must revamp his political agenda. Others dismissed calls for a significant change of direction. A procession of senior colleagues mounted an orchestrated public defence of the chancellor, dismissing as 'absurd' the idea that he should be blamed for election defeats. Mr Lamont's cabinet allies were also insisting in private that he must not be made a 'scapegoat' for the resentment in the country over the recession. But some of the most influential figures in the government were arguing strongly that Mr Major would not be able to restore his own political authority until he reshuffled his cabinet and installed a new chancellor. 'We need a (cabinet) reconstruction, a fresh start,' one commented last night. As Mr Major prepared for a detailed post-mortem this morning on the causes of the election defeats, the associates suggested that he could not afford to delay such a reshuffle beyond the summer parliamentary recess. Although senior colleagues were reluctant to blame Mr Lamont, it was clear last night that those who believe he should stay on were in a minority in the cabinet. There were also clear indications that soundings since last Thursday have shown intense pressure among Tory party activists for a new chancellor. The debate over Mr Lamont's future was mirrored by signs of divisions within the cabinet on how the government should respond to the electoral defeat, threating further to undermine Mr Major's premiership. Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, acknowledged on BBC radio that the government was 'in a dreadful hole'. Mr Clarke, on the centre-left, pro-European wing of the Conservative party, said the government needed to get across 'our view of this country in Europe' and to set tackling crime as a high priority. He regretted the 'parliamentary tangle' over Maastricht and Britain's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism. In contrast, Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, emphasised in a BBC television interview the priorities of the Tory right: 'Sound money, which means controlling inflation . . . sound public finances, which means the government not living beyond its means; and controlling the size of the state.' Mr Lamont, he said, had done an 'outstandingly good job.' A further test for Mr Major will come this afternoon when MPs debate the extension of value added tax to domestic fuel - acknowledged yesterday by Mr Portillo as a cause of Tory losses last Thursday.

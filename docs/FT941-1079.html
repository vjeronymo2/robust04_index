			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Finance and the Family: Society axes fixed-rate offer - But plenty remain to tempt home-buyers Market upheavals mean that fixed-rate mortgage offers do not have a long shelf life at the moment. The Yorkshire building society withdrew a planned range of six this week before it had even been launched. But there are still a number around. New rates from the Woolwich are 7.99 per cent fixed for five years, or 6.99 for two years. Arrangement fees are Pounds 295 and Pounds 225 respectively, and the penalty for early redemption during the fixed period is six months' interest on the former and three months' on the latter. Loans are available as repayment, endowment, pension, Pep and re-mortgages, up to 95 per cent of valuation (except for re-mortgages). Insurance is not compulsory. The Nationwide has fixed-rate offers for periods of two to 10 years, with rates varying from 6.39 per cent over two years (6.29 for first-time buyers), 6.99 fixed for three years, and 8.89 over 10 years for buyers with a 15 per cent deposit; otherwise, for loans up to the usual limit of 95 per cent of valuation, it is 8.99 per cent. Early redemption penalties are between three and 10 months' interest. Arrangement fees range from Pounds 200 to Pounds 300 (Pounds 95 for first-time buyers). Barclays is offering fixes over two, four and 10 years for existing home-owners, with versions over two and four years for first-time buyers. Rates are 6.25, 7.45 and 8.65 per cent, or 5.95 and 6.95 per cent for first-timers. Purchase of a Barclays' life assurance policy is compulsory for first-timers. Booking and arrangement fees are from Pounds 200 to Pounds 400; Pounds 100 will be refunded to existing home-owners if they take out a life policy or pension. Redemption fees are three to seven months' interest. Halifax has five fixed rates over two to six years. They go from 6.25 per cent over two years to 8.49 over six. There are cash incentives of Pounds 300 to Pounds 500 on completion, and arrangement fees are between Pounds 150 and Pounds 250. National &amp; Provincial is holding its one and two-year fixed rates until early next week, but has raised rates for fixes over three, four and five year. The new rates for loans of up to 95 per cent of value are: 7.25 per cent until February 1997, 7.50 until February 1998, and 7.95 until February 1999. For loans of up to 75 per cent of value, the rates are 6.95, 7.25 and 7.75 per cent respectively. The maximum re-mortgage is 90 per cent of value. Arrangement fees are Pounds 250 and a free valuation is included, but buildings and contents insurance has to be arranged through N&amp;P. Early redemption penalties range from 90 to 120 days. N&amp;P's one-year fix is at 3.25 per cent, or 3.95 per cent depending on what proportion of the property's value is borrowed; the two-year rates are 5.64 or 5.84 per cent, with the same conditions as above. There are special offers for first-time buyers, too. Mortgage broker John Charcol continues to offer a three-year fix at 6.99 per cent for anyone wishing to borrow between 75 and 90 per cent of the value of their homes. Re-mortgaging costs a fixed fee of Pounds 250, and Charcol will pay all the costs for this except for early redemption penalties on earlier fixed-rate mortgages. But the firm warns that the offer will be withdrawn soon.</p>

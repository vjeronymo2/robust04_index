Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> TIRED BERNSTEIN SLATES CONCERT  </P> <P> Leonard Bernstein, who canceled six appearances in Japan this month due to  exhaustion and lingering illness, is planning to conduct a concert next month  at the Tanglewood Music Center, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Bernstein has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and pneumonia since the  beginning of the year. He flew back from Japan on July 16.  </P> <P> "He's resting up. It was just too extreme for him," said Bob Gallo, a spokesman  for the 70-year-old Bernstein.  </P> <P> Gallo said the conductor is preparing for an Aug. 19 concert in honor of the  late Boston Symphony Orchestra director Serge Koussevitzky, who founded the  Tanglewood center in Massachusetts.  </P></p>

He survived the leadership challenge which led  to a snap election just 20 months into his first term in office.  Fiji votes under a racial system guaranteeing indigenous Fijian  dominance in the Parliament. However, Mr. Rabuka now has a  stronger mandate and says he can work with the country's other  major race, the Indians. Erina Reddan reports from Fiji:    [Begin recording] [Reddan] (?Several observers said) Fiji  has  voted along racial lines. The smaller multiracial parties were  the big losers as Fiji went for the more established Fijian and  Indian parties.    Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka's SPT [Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa  ni Taukei] Party won most of the Fijian seats -- 31 of the 37 --  which successfully fought off the challenge by the new  one-month-old Fijian Association. Its leader and long-time  Rabuka rival, Josevata Kamikamica, who launched the leadership  challenge last November which led to the snap poll, has lost his  seat. Mr. Rabuka can now lead the government apparently  unhampered by internal strife. On the Indian side, the  electorate also returned to its party of tradition, the National  Federation Party. It won 20 of the 27 seats at the expense of  the Labor Party, which lost heavily -- down from 13 to six seats.    Despite the strong race vote, there is more chance now  healing the bitter rift between Indians and Fijians at any time  since the 1987 military coups which overthrew an  Indian-dominated government and led to systematic discrimination  against Indians. The extremist anti-Indian Nationalists lost  their five seats, while the Fijian SPT Party and the Indian  National Federation Party are both talking about understanding  each other. After swearing in Prime Minister Rabuka, President  Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara called for a Fiji free of racial conflict.    [Mara] People of Fiji: The world is watching us closely, and  there are some who still believe our nation of many races,  cultures, and faiths is doomed to failure. As your chosen  government takes office, let us once more show the naysayers the  depth and strength of this country and our determination to find  common ground for a common future.

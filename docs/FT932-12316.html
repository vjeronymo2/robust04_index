			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Clinton cuts rail plans down to size THE Clinton administration yesterday unveiled details of its plans to promote high-speed rail links. They focus on upgrading existing tracks to handle faster conventional trains, using federal money to stimulate spending on tracks by state and local governments. More advanced technologies such as magnetic levitation, which can propel trains at up to 300mph, have been kept out of this first phase. During his election campaign Mr Clinton promised the 'creation of a high-speed rail network linking our major cities and commercial hubs'. Budget realities, however, have forced some scaling back of these ambitions. Trains run at moderately high speeds in a northeastern corridor from Boston to Washington, by way of New York, where trials have now begun of a Swedish tilting train. However, long-distance passenger rail traffic has virtually died in most other parts of the US.</p>

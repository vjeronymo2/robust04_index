			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Menem aide quits over milk scandal ONE of Argentine President Carlos Menem's most trusted aides resigned yesterday after press allegations that he is a shareholder of a company that sold sub-standard powdered milk at inflated prices to a public nutrition programme for children. Mr Miguel Angel Vicco, one of Mr Menem's two private secretaries, is also a close friend of the president. He had direct access to Mr Menem and handle delicate government missions, as well as the president's private affairs. An investigation led by Pagina/12, an opposition newspaper, claimed that Mr Vicco and Mr Carlos Spadone, also a government official until forced from office last month, were partners in a milk-processing plant that sold powdered milk to the Ministry of Social Action. Mr Menem had strongly defended Mr Vicco against the allegations, claiming they were thinly-veiled attacks on the government. Mr Vicco is the second government official to resign this year accused of corruption. On Monday, Mr Miguel Nazur had resigned as head of PAMI, a government health insurance scheme for old age pensioners. Mr Menem has shrunk from aggressive prosecution of alleged offenders. He has said: 'They have left the government. What more do you want? We should shoot them?'</p>

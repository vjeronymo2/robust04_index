			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / New row erupts over car pricing CONTROVERSY over car pricing in the EC broke out again yesterday. A new consumer group report claimed that Commission efforts to open up the car market were still not working, and a senior UK motor industry executive called for Belgium to be ordered to end price controls as part of the solution. The consumer report, by the Bureau Europeen des Unions de Consommateurs (Beuc), claims that long-winded import procedures and unhelpful dealers continue to stop car buyers in some EC states taking advantage of low prices in others. It says the situation has not improved since 1989, and that price differentials across Europe are in many cases still much wider than the 12 per cent recommended in EC rules. However, the Commission and car manufacturers claimed yesterday that they were moving towards agreement on how to make it easier for consumers to compare cross-border prices. Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, told the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in London last night that manufacturers might be prepared to publish lists indicating prices of certain models and options in different national markets. Brussels and the producers have agreed that it would be both difficult and confusing to publish detailed lists covering all models and options. Sir Leon said manufacturers were also now prepared to write to dealers urging them not to discriminate against buyers ordering cars for export to other EC countries. Brussels wrote to manufacturers in May urging them to make their pricing more transparent. Sir Leon seemed unprepared, however, for a determined attack by Mr Colin Hope, the SMMT's president and chairman of components group T&amp;N, on the price controls which have been a long-standing part of Belgian economic policy. 'We in this (UK) industry are fed up with being hauled in front of the media to be asked why our prices are higher than in Belgium,' said Mr Hope. If the single market meant anything, Belgium should be ordered to end controls. Commenting on the Beuc report, a spokesman for the Association des Constructeurs Europeens d'Automobiles (ACEA), the EC manufacturers' federation, said yesterday: 'Beuc seems to suggest we are trying to avoid the issue and trying to hide information. We're not hiding anything. We want to co-operate in a way which is simple and meaningful.' The manufacturers have until 1995 to demonstrate that the 'selective distribution' system of exclusive car dealerships is not hampering the single market for car buyers. The Beuc study details wide differences in price across the Community with Britain the most expensive country for car-buyers and Denmark the cheapest. But the organisation was also sharply critical of national authorities and dealers which it said hampered consumers' attempts to take advantage of such price differences.</p>

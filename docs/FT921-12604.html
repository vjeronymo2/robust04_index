			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Pensionable salary ceiling up The ceiling on pensionable salary for the fiscal year beginning April 1992 will be raised to Pounds 75,000 from Pounds 71,400, according to calculations by Scottish Provident. Calculations on earnings-related pensions are not allowed to take into account pay above this ceiling. Employee contributions towards pensions may not be calculated on earnings above that amount. The ceiling is adjusted annually in line with rises in the previous year's retail price index. Scottish Provident also announced that it had maintained bonuses on its endowment policies. Pay-outs on policies started by a 29-year old man paying Pounds 30 per month dropped 4.4 per cent for ten-year policies, to Pounds 7,129, but rose 1.4 per cent to Pounds 57,369 for 25-year endowments.</p>

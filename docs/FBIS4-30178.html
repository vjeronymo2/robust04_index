			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 20 (KCNA) -- A hearing on the nuclear  issue of the Korean peninsula was held at the International  Affairs Committee of the State Duma of Russia on June 20.    Present there were Chairman of the committee Vladimir Lukin,  deputies to the State Duma who are members of the committee,  Director of the Institute of the Far East of the Academy of  Sciences of Russia Mikhail Titarenko, officials concerned and  men of the press.    DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil, addressing the  hearing, said that the Russian media reports on the nuclear  issue on the Korean peninsula were almost distorted reports much  inclined to U.S. and Western reports. He explained the cause of  the origin of the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and the  consistent stand and efforts of the DPRK for its solution.    Noting that the issue owed its origin to the massive  shipment  of the U.S. Forces and nuclear weapons into South Korea, he  said that the United States invented the pretext of "suspicion  of nuclear arms development" for the purpose of maintaining its  domination over the Asia-Pacific region by keeping its forces  and nuclear weapons in South Korea.    Stressing that the DPRK joined the Nuclear Non-proliferation  Treaty to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, not  to be exposed to nuclear threat and pressure, he denounced the  United States and its followers that are misleading public  opinion with the allegation that the DPRK's withdrawal from the  treaty is destroying the system, while shifting the blame for it  onto the DPRK, and are continuously scheming to isolate and  stifle the DPRK, crying for "sanctions".    He said that the "resolution" of the Board of Governors of  the International Atomic Energy Agency is a prelude to the UN  "sanctions" against the DPRK.    "We are always ready for dialogue and negotiation for a  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, but can  never accept threat or `sanctions' against us. If pressure is  put on us, we will take a strong countermeasure," he declared.    Son Song-pil answered questions put by deputies to the State  Duma and officials concerned with the Korean question.    Answering a question about the international meeting on the  nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula proposed by Russia, he  said: "With the DPRK-U.S. talks brought to a rupture, we  consider the meeting to be a way for a peaceful solution to the  nuclear issue, if it is held on an equal and fair principle and  when a concrete plan is proposed, we will study it."    "But," he added, "we cannot approve the notion of holding an  international meeting while taking `sanctions' against us.  Dialogue and `sanctions' are incompatible. We will take a  countermeasure corresponding to the scale of the `sanctions'    "Our stand is to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with  war."</p>

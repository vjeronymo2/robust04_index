			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMAN UNITY TALKS APPROVED;  </P> <P> EUROPE: TWO HALVES OF DEFEATED NATION AND WORLD WAR II VICTORS MOVE TOWARD  FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT. SECURITY CONCERNS OF NEIGHBORING STATES WILL BE  DISCUSSED.  </P> <P> The Big Four victors of World War II and the two halves of defeated Germany  agreed here Tuesday to begin historic talks "shortly" to reunify Germany and to  discuss the security concerns of neighboring states.  </P> <P> After a frenetic day of bilateral talks among their foreign ministers, the six  nations issued a brief statement that, however vague, begins a process that  will finally lead to a peace settlement with Germany 45 years after the end of  the war. With a defeated Germany divided into zones of occupation in 1945, no  peace treaty was ever signed to formally end the war.  </P> <P> The statement was the product of an almost nonstop flurry of meetings between  the foreign ministers involved in the reunification issue.  </P> <P> The statement, developed on the basis of a draft proposed by Secretary of State  James A. Baker III, said that after talks among the Soviet Union, Britain,  France, the United States and the two Germanys here, they agreed that the  foreign ministers of the two Germanys would meet with the foreign ministers of  the Big Four "to discuss external aspects of the establishment of German unity,  including the issues of security of the neighboring states."  </P> <P> "Preliminary discussions at the official level will begin shortly," it  concluded.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union held out adamantly against setting a date for starting  reunification talks between the two Germanys, Soviet spokesman Vitaly I.  Churkin said. The Western allies wanted the communique to call for talks to  begin immediately after elections scheduled in East Germany for March 18. That  vote is expected to oust the Communist-led government of Prime Minister Hans  Modrow.  </P> <P> But Moscow apparently wanted to avoid casting any doubt on the legitimacy of  Modrow's government in the election campaign by implying that it would not  survive. And it has also wanted to slow down the reunification process as much  as possible.  </P> <P> The Soviets also oppose a plan offered by West German Foreign Minister  Hans-Dietrich Genscher to keep a reunified Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, while pledging that no NATO forces would move onto the territory  that is now East Germany. That plan is supported by the Western allies.  </P> <P> Tuesday's announcement made no mention of NATO membership, nor were any other  security issues cited.  </P> <P> The meetings began early Tuesday almost in full view of the "open skies"  conference that had brought the foreign ministers here. The conference, called  to prepare a treaty for the peaceful overflights by military aircraft of  territory of the opposing blocs, is being attended by the top diplomats of all  23 NATO and Warsaw Pact nations. German reunification and disputes over  conventional force cuts in Europe pushed the conference far into the  background, however.  </P> <P> Baker and Genscher first met privately for 10 minutes in the morning; then  Baker and Shevardnadze met along one side of the conference hall. Genscher and  Shevardnadze met for more than two hours, so long that Genscher had to cancel a  scheduled meeting with his East German counterpart, Oskar Fischer.  </P> <P> British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd said he had been meeting continuously  with Baker and Genscher as well as with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.  </P> <P> Emerging from one meeting, Hurd said the Soviets and the Western powers,  including West Germany, were "quite close" to agreement on the reunification  procedure.  </P> <P> Hurd also disclosed that Poland and Hungary had both rejected the Soviet demand  that a unified Germany be neutral, despite earlier Soviet claims that its  position was the Warsaw Pact view.  </P> <P> "There is no joint Warsaw Pact position on anything -- not on anything," said  one East European source.  </P> <P> In mid-afternoon, Genscher met again with Baker to consult over a U.S. draft of  a joint statement that said the Big Four powers and the two Germanys "agree to  meet shortly after the March 18 elections" in East Germany. It added that the  six ministers will "discuss external aspects of German unification," presumably  including the key security consideration of whether Germany will remain a NATO  member.  </P> <P> Amid the almost feverish meetings, Genscher addressed the open skies  conference, explaining Bonn's policy on reunification, which his spokesman said  could occur as early as next fall.  </P> <P> "We seek German unification in the context of integration in the European  Community, the CSCE (Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe) process,  East-West partnership for stability, the building of the common European house  and the creation of a peaceful order throughout Europe," he said, notably  omitting any mention of NATO.  </P> <P> Genscher said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told him and West German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Moscow last week that "unity of the German nation can  only be decided by the Germans themselves and that they must themselves choose  in what political forms, in what periods, at what pace and under what  conditions they will realize their unity."  </P> <P> "We Germans are aware of the historical dimension of this (reunification)  process," he said, adding that Germans remember "all the suffering inflicted on  other nations in the name of Germany."  </P> <P> He promised that "Germans united in freedom and democracy will contribute to a  better Europe."  </P> <P> Reunification, he continued, involves only East and West Germany and Berlin.  </P> <P> "We do not have territorial claims against any of our neighbors," he said. "We  respect the rights and responsibilities of the Four Powers with regard to the  whole of Germany."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Associated Press reported from Brussels that an adviser to Mikhail  S.Gorbachev said Tuesday that some East European nations may eventually leave  the Warsaw Pact. Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, former Soviet chief of staff, did  not say which ones might leave.  </P></p>

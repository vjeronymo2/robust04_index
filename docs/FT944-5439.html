			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies as bonds post strong gain Wall Street US share prices surged yesterday on the heels of a soaring bond market to post their highest gains in more than a month, writes Lisa Bransten in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 44.75 at 3,745.62. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 climbed 4.38 at 453.30, while the American Stock Exchange composite gained 1.27 at 432.46. The Nasdaq composite rose 3.84 at 745.03. Trading volume on the NYSE came to 285m shares. The 30-year bond rallied strongly taking heart from a decline in wage inflation to 2.6 per cent. By 4pm, the long bond was up over a point, with its yield pushed back below 8 per cent. Two-year bonds were up 1/32 , helping to flatten substantially the yield curve. Also contributing to the rally were gains by the dollar against the Japanese yen and the D-mark. By the end of the day, the dollar was at Y100.60 and DM1.5800. The rally came despite more signs of inflationary pressures in the economy. The labour department reported that November's unemployment rate was 5.6 per cent, down from 5.8 per cent in October. The figures came at the end of a week-long barrage of economic data indicating a robust economy, which earlier in the week created fears that the Federal Reserve would boost interest rates. Retail stocks were mixed as news of lower-than-expected sales for some swamped out early reports of strong consumer spending so far this holiday season. Dayton Hudson fell Dollars 1 at Dollars 79 3/4 , Kmart lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 14 1/8 and Dillards Department Stores dropped Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 27 7/8 . Investors returned to Best Buy, pushing the shares up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 33 1/4 . The electronics retailer lost more than Dollars 11 after it reported earnings well below expectations. Commercial banks, which tend to be sensitive to changes in the interest rates, posted narrow gains. NationsBank rose Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 45 5/8 , BankAmerica up Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 41 1/4 , Chemical Banking up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 37 3/8 and Citicorp up Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 41 1/4 . Chase Manhattan Bank was unchanged at Dollars 35 3/8 . Canada The Toronto Stock Exchange was up slightly on the day as booming metal stocks balanced out heavy losses in gold shares. While a strong late-session rally in New York helped lift the weaker Canadian market. The TSE 300 composite index added 10.57 points, or 0.26 per cent, to 4,092.99, with losers over winners at 369 to 326. Volume of 61.7m shares was down from yesterday's 70m. The TSE 300 lost 6.26 points on the week. Seven of the 14 sub-indexes were up, led by metals, paper, financial and industrial product stocks. Real estate and gold stocks led the declining issues. Metal stocks were the stars, adding 2.68 per cent. The leader was Inco, which jumped 2 1/8 to 40 3/8 in active trading. Mexico Stocks closed down 2.08 per cent yesterday in a bout of foreign investor profit taking and price adjusting to Thursday's decline on Wall Street. The IPC index closed off 53.86 points at 2,537.48 - a loss of 2.08 per cent. At the end of 1993, the IPC stood at 2,602.63. Traders said the Mexican Stock Exchange saw a relatively sleepy session apart from opening arbitrage transactions as investors moved to balance out local prices of American Depositary Receipts of Mexican blue chips. The market was closed on Thursday for the inauguration of President Ernesto Zedillo, and traders said his speech had little effect on stock movements. They also said the currency added little pressure to the market. The spot dollar closed almost flat at 3.4390 new pesos, from 3.4405 new pesos at Wednesday's close. Volume totalled a light 863.6 million new pesos, on 61.6 million shares traded.</p>

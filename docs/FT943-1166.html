			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Late move to win priority for West Coast line The government has launched a belated attempt to obtain priority status for a flagship rail project from the European Union. Supporters of the project said the initial failure to seek a priority listing for the Pounds 500m West Coast mainline on the EU's programme of trans-European networks could cost it European funding. It could also make it more difficult to raise private-sector finance. The Ecu220bn (Pounds 170bn) plan for a pan-European network of transport links was launched last December by the European Commission. Its list of schemes for priority treatment includes high-speed rail links in France, Germany and Spain and motorways in Spain and Greece. Local authorities and business groups along the 550-mile West Coast route between London and Glasgow are furious about the government's failure to act sooner and are campaigning vigorously for the project to be accorded priority status. Britain will try to persuade European Commission officials to add the project to the priority list at a meeting planned for October 17. But there are already 11 schemes on the list and other member states are also expected to propose additions. Schemes agreed in October will be put to the EU summit in Essen, Germany, in December. Mr David Cole, economic director of Cumbria County Council, said: 'There is a lot of campaigning to do to get it on the list because Spain, Portugal and Italy also have projects they want included. The British government has not been pushing vigorously enough.' Private-sector and local authority backers of the Pounds 500m plan to modernise the West Coast route are divided over the government's reasons for failing to put the scheme forward earlier when it first had the chance. Some said British officials might have been sticking too closely to the formal eligibility guidelines. Others suggested it reflected the low priority which the government gave to rail compared with road. The West Coast rail project is intended to modernise the 30-year-old track and signalling on the route. A feasibility study is being carried out by Railtrack and WCML Development, a private-sector consortium. A construction consortium will be selected by competitive tender to start work next year. Mr Tony Bradley, business policy manager at the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, said: 'It could have been put on the list earlier. We have been lobbying for the project for the past three years and the list of trans-European network schemes was only agreed in June.' Priority status for the West Coast line would mean the project was eligible for help with feasibility studies and other EU funding.</p>

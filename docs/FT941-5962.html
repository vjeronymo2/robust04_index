			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Dockers end strike in Sydney About 490 striking stevedores returned to work in Sydney yesterday, ending a three-week walkout that had tied up millions of dollars worth of cargo, Reuter reports from Sydney. The dispute was settled after intervention by a government arbitrator who ordered the company at the centre of the dispute to re-hire 55 sacked workers. A spokeswoman for Australian Stevedores, which handles over half the container and conventional cargo moving through Sydney, said the backlog should be cleared by Monday. A Maritime Union of Australia official said the union was happy with the outcome.</p>

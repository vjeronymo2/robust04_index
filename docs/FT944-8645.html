			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Sharp cut in bad debt costs helps NAB to surge 46% National Australia Bank, the strongest of the country's four big banks, yesterday announced a ADollars 1.71bn (USDollars 1.29bn) profit after tax, abnormals and outside equity interests, for the year to end-September. The figure, a record for any Australian company, compared with ADollars 1.13bn in the previous 12 months, and translated into earnings per share of 127.3 cents, a 46.2 per cent rise over the 1992-93 result. The abnormal gain was ADollars 50m, against ADollars 59m last time. NAB, which takes in the Clydesdale, Yorkshire and Northern banks in the UK as well as National Irish Bank and Bank of New Zealand, said it had declared a final dividend of 39 cents a share, making a total for the year of 74 cents. This is an increase of 48 per cent over the previous annual total. Although NAB had never been as troubled by the property market's collapse and bad debt experience as its big local rivals, the strong result - in line with analysts' forecast - confirms the extent to which the Australian banking sector is bouncing back from the recession of the early 1990s. NAB said yesterday's result came after a reduction in the charge for bad and doubtful debts, to ADollars 179m from ADollars 604m. Total impaired loans after provisions fell by 37.2 per cent to ADollars 1.7bn. The main Australian Bank division saw its contribution to operating profit rise by 34.1 per cent, to ADollars 1.03bn, with the UK/Irish group making ADollars 428m, up from ADollars 293m previously. NAB said the latter progress came mainly from a reduction in the bad debt charge and improved efficiency levels. The New Zealand operations made ADollars 143m, up from ADollars 95m previously. In spite of the result, NAB shares weakened yesterday and closed 34 cents lower at ADollars 10.36 on the Australian Stock Exchange. Some analysts said that investors had been hoping for even higher profits; others suggested that, while the interest margin had widened in the second half, cost-containment in the second six months was disappointing. The cost-to-income ratio for the year overall was 55 per cent, down from 55.6 per cent in 1993 (excluding restructuring costs). The bank said it expected further interest rate rises in the current year, both in Australia and overseas, but was looking to improve performance further as economies picked up. However, Mr Don Argus, managing director, struck a cautionary note in Melbourne, saying he did not want to forecast 1994-95 profits 'because, while saying there is good economic growth being projected for all of the markets in which we are represented, I still believe there are some signs to suggest that the system's growth that we have experienced over the past 12 months may not be sustainable.'</p>

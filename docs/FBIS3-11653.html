			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Luis Orlando Pantoja] </F>   [Text] In the midst of intensive discussions within the  national Cuban Workers Federation [CTC], an analysis was made of  the experience and the results of parliaments in workplaces in  the city of Havana. The meeting was presided over by Politburo  members Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada, president of the National  Assembly of the People's Government; Jorge Lezcano, first  secretary of the Cuban Communist Party in the city of Havana;  and Pedro Ross Leal, CTC Secretary General; along with Alfredo  Morales, top union leader in the city of Havana.    Alfredo Morales read a detailed report on the main proposals  submitted by the Havana workers. The report also makes a  political assessment of these heated discussions in which a  spirit of willingness to carry out our main tasks stands out.    A group of participants in the meeting also gave their  opinions on the report and on the parliaments. They underscored  such aspects as a greater demand by the administration to  control resources, costs, accounting, labor discipline, and  other essential matters.    Several suggestions on the banks' role in receiving payments  and in paying accounts by different organizations; the need for  efficiency indicators to be posted in each workplace; the  reduction of annual sick leave figures; and the need to  subsidize consumers rather than products, among other topics,  were some of the most debated points.    Jorge Lezcano thoroughly explained the country's economic  situation, namely in Havana city. He stressed the political  outcome of this process, the need to continue the process and  made an analysis of the salary tax, currency exchange, labor  discipline, and the attitude toward the money hoarders [macetas].    He made it clear that workers will not be laid off but that  the measures adopted will surely imply sacrifices and that these  measures would be in effect for some time. Costs are the key  factors in the economic efficiency process, Lazcano concluded.    Ricardo Alarcon de Quesada also stressed the need to find  efficiency as a result of internal measures and not by  increasing prices. He also underscored the need to review the  inflated payrolls, to prioritize self-consumption areas,  stressing that there was no need to wait for the National  Assembly, that decisions must be made concerning everything that  can be implemented in the workplaces. Alarcon also made a  valuable assessment of the Cuban socioeconomic situation before  1959.    In conclusion, Pedro Ross Leal stressed the importance of  keeping up this style of work and the need to strengthen it. He  said we must now continue with the second stage of parliaments  which consists of implementing measures in each workplace and  discussing them with workers.</p>

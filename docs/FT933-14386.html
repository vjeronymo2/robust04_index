			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Survey of Birmingham and West Midlands (8): Need is not always enough - The region's urban renewal programmes THE Government's efforts to enhance the West Midlands urban canvas sound generous: two urban development corporations; four City Challenges; a new Housing Action Trust; Estate Action; City Grant totalling Pounds 8m; derelict land grant amounting to Pounds 20m. Such is the heritage of physical neglect, however, and the social problems associated with a neglected environment, that even this panoply of schemes cannot transform a highly urban region. For nearly 200 years, the swathe of towns that grew into the West Midlands conurbation has been the scene for coal mining, minerals extraction, metal bashing and manufacturing. They have not just left their scars above the ground. All the many phases of industrial workings have left their mark below the surface. Fortunately, with each new discovery of the horrors that were left by industry, new methods of dealing successfully with the problem are being worked out. In the Black Country, for instance, nearly 2,000 private sector new houses have been built on reclaimed sites. In the east Birmingham area about 500 new houses have been built or are about to be started; sites are being prepared for another 500. In Stoke-on-Trent, a complex of offices, retail, leisure and industrial development covers part of the once derelict site which was reclaimed for the Garden Festival. Derelict land in the Stoke ribbon of urban development has been dealt with steadily over the years. Much of the land, however, has been greened, because reclamation of land for redevelopment is much more expensive. The city is now coming to terms with the urgent need to assemble packages of land to be made suitable for industry. This will depend on successful deals being worked out with the owners - which include industry, the utilities and British Coal. The motivating factor in restoring derelict and run-down tracts of land is this need to be able to offer new sites for potential incoming companies, and for existing companies to expand. While developers keep up pressure to bite into green belt land, the towns and cities in the region must find alternative urban sites. Without this land, prospects are poor for towns and cities being able to provide urban living standards better than now. Packaging sizeable sites can be a lengthy and costly procedure; existing users must be bought out and relocated. In the current climate, developers and financial institutions are sceptical - unreasonably - about the finished product. The abandonment by the government of the proposed contaminated land register, at least for the time being, has not allayed the private sector's fears. The Black Country Development Corporation, set up in 1987, is finding the costs of extensive reclamation more than it can afford. Funding has been cut back sharply in the government squeeze on public spending. Increasingly, unreclaimed sites are being put up for sale accompanied by a site investigation report, leaving the developer to carry out the reclamation. Birmingham Heartlands Development Corporation, set up in 1992 to cover part of east Birmingham, is likely to adopt a similar course on the site it bought as part of the Leyland-Daf rescue. The Black Country spine road, now under way, will provide much better access to sites such as that of the old Patent Shaft steelworks, once planned as a huge shopping mall redevelopment, now offered as an automotive components industrial park. A new spine road in Birmingham Heartlands is expected to get the go-ahead in late summer - again improving the marketability of sites. City Challenge schemes in the region were allocated Pounds 29.6m in 1993-94. City Challenge plans to address the social needs of rundown areas more deliberately than urban development corporations, whose brief is primarily property-led. The regional winners are in the Black Country and Birmingham. City Challenge is concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods. To be a deprived area, however, does not necessarily lead to the five year City Challenge status and Pounds 37.5m from the Department of the Environment. Coventry and Dudley were losers in the second and (for the present) last round of City Challenge, despite putting in bids for severely deprived neighbourhoods. Coventry has succeeded in getting a Pounds 2.6m slice of the new Urban Partnership fund which will enable two developments in one of the unsuccessful City Challenge wards - a ward which recorded an unemployment rate of 28 per cent in April 1993 - to go ahead. The phasing out by the government of Urban Programme money (down from Pounds 41.1m in 1992-93 to Pounds 27m in 1993-94 in the region) which funded projects across the inner cities through the local authorities, is hard on neighbourhoods which have not been designated for Estate Action, City Challenge or other area-specific programmes. Urban Programme has funded a wide variety of economic, social and training projects in the past. Three housing estates on the outskirts of Birmingham demonstrate the swings and roundabouts of government funding policy. Nobody denies their need. But they did not qualify for the old system of funding, which concentrated on the inner city. Now one of the estates, the most needy, has attracted Estate Action. But one of the two adjoining estates, only slightly less deprived, falls outside old and new funding. The Castle Vale housing estate in the north east of the city accepted the government's terms for money to be pumped in via a Housing Action Trust. The private sector also has a lot of unfit housing; it is more difficult to find the means to upgrade. Current rates of investment in upgrading or replacing this stock do not keep pace with the problem. The quality of life in much of the region's urban areas is poor. East and west Birmingham health authorities have described their territories as among the unhealthiest places in the UK. The number of households with at least one person suffering from long term illness is nearly 50 per cent higher than in a Warwickshire village. In the Black Country's Sandwell district, a new worry is the high incidence of diabetes among people with ethnic minority backgrounds. The quality of the environment is part of the quality of life. Nobody has given it a high priority in the predominantly urban West Midlands. That is just beginning to change. Birmingham has shown that it is possible to improve the urban environment, at least in the centre of the city. A new report* prepared by the West Midlands Forum of local authorities calls on other towns and cities in the region to follow the Birmingham example in a campaign to make the region more attractive. This is just one of the recommendations in a report to the European Commission which aims to convince the West Midlands that its industrial competence will go unrecognised in the wider world unless it addresses a number of related environmental and economic issues. *Development Strategy for the West Midlands: Partners in Europe.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- URBAN REGENERATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Expenditure by department of the environment in West Midlands region                                        1992/93             1993/94                                      Allocation/         Allocation Grant regime                    expenditure Pounds m       Pounds m  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Urban programme                         41,117              26,959 City grant                               3,928               8,800 Derelict land grant                     22,270              20,600 City action team spec. budget            0,427               0,410 Urban development corporations          67,460              72,000 City challenge                           8,250              29,600 Task forces                              3,056              2,6452 Urban Partnership fund                                       3,576 Coalfield ares fund                                          0,826 Totals                                 146,508             165,416  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Notes 1992-93 figures are estimated outturns; actual outturn figures have been used where available. 1993-94 figures are all allocations.

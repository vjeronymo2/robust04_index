			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Floor revolts over pensions THE leadership suffered its first defeat of the conference yesterday when delegates voted overwhelmingly to back a big rise in the state pension. In a rare act of defiance, conference rejected a recommendation by the national executive and supported increasing the state retirement pension for a couple to a level equivalent to half average gross earnings in the UK. Although embarrassing, the result does not commit Mr John Smith to adopting the motion as official policy. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said he was 'not disconcerted' and that such a pension increase was a reasonable long-term aspiration. The motion agreed by conference also called for moves towards equality in retirement ages to be achieved by reducing the normal retirement age for men  -and not at the expense of women's entitlement. Labour's official policy is to back a 'flexible decade' of retirement. Delegates also wanted the introduction of pensions for all women, to be paid from their 60th birthday, regardless of the age of their partner. Measures were also proposed in the motion to protect pension funds from Maxwell-style robberies. Moving the motion, Mr Des Andrews, of the Usdaw shop-workers' union, accused Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, of 'robbing' pensioners. 'The money that was taken, we want back at the earliest opportunity,' he said. 'If any government tries to make our women work until they are 65 before they get a pension, my union will be out on the streets, I can guarantee.' Replying, Ms Brenda Etchells, an NEC member, said policies set out in the motion pre-empted the results of the commission on social justice planned by the party leadership. It could also result in overcompensating women pensioners and discrimination against men. But she launched an attack on the government's failure to support pensioners, particularly in comparison with other European Community countries.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Ares-Serono in site transfer Ares - Serono, the fourth largest Swiss pharmaceuticals company, is to transfer the manufacture of diagnostic products from its Swiss base at Coinsins in the canton of Vaud, to sites in Rome, Italy, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, US, Daniel Green reports from London. The closure of the Swiss plant is the latest stage in the restructuring of the European healthcare industry as it struggles to reduce costs in the face of government healthcare spending cuts. The company said the move was a cost-cutting measure and that it was part of a stronger emphasis on drug development at the expense of diagnostic technology. It plans to launch six new drugs over the next few years. In the first nine months of last year, diagnostics products accounted for Dollars 67.3m (Pounds 44.8m) out of total sales of Dollars 548.3m. The remainder was accounted for by drugs. The transfer of manufacturing abroad would take around 18 months.</p>

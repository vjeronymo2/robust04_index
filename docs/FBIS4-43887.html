			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release issued by the UK Overseas Development </F> Administration: "Britain To Help Rehabilitate Villages in  Northern Iraq"]    [Text] Britain is to provide an aid grant of 1.6 million  pounds to help rehabilitate villages in Kurdish areas in  northern Iraq. This was announced today in Geneva at the United  Nations donors conference on Iraq.    Since 1975 the Government of Iraq has been destroying  villages in northern Iraq and moving survivors into collective  villages. Some 4,600 villages and their agriculture have been  destroyed.    The grant will help "Save the Children Fund" rehabilitate  216  villages and provide shelter for 700 families. The project  includes a voucher system whereby villages can exchange vouchers  to obtain goods worth 410 pounds. Agricultural inputs and  livestock will also be provided to help meet basic human needs.    An official from the Overseas Development Administration  [ODA] visited northern Iraq in March and was impressed by the  commitment of the villagers to return to their villages and  start farming again.  <H5>  Note for Editors </H5>   The ODA's total expenditure on humanitarian aid to Iraqi  civilians is over 66 million pounds since April 1991. This  includes at least 4 million pounds to Save the Children Fund for  a variety of projects.</p>

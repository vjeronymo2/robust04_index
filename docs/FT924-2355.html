			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: Dan Maskell: the voice of Wimbledon - Tennis MY OLD friend Dan Maskell died peacefully in his sleep early on Thursday morning. I had a premonition it might happen. When I arrived in Munich for this week's Compaq Grand Slam Cup, I remembered what Dan had told me from his sick bed before I left home on Monday. Although he found it difficult to breathe, there was nevertheless still a chuckle in that famous plummy voice. 'Careful now John . . .' he said,' . . . don't catch whatever it was I caught there last year - I haven't been the same since.' It was typical of the man - always ready to make light of life's misfortunes and much more concerned about others than himself. Dan's was a life of service to others and it brought him immense satisfaction. Throughout a diverse career that began with his appointment as full-time ballboy at Queen's Club at the age of 15, he was always giving of himself. I first met him in 1948 when, as a promising junior, I was sent along by the Lawn Tennis Association for national coaching to the All England Club where, in 1929, Dan had become its first teaching professional. There was the great man, dressed as always in long cream flannels, putting me at my ease at once  -but also putting me through my paces thoroughly on the tennis court to find out what I could do. Quite soon, it became apparent that I lacked a backhand of any substance. I do not hold it against Dan that, over the years, he was never able to eradicate that weakness. Nobody else could, either] During the war, Dan served as the first rehabilitation officer for the Royal Air Force. It was a role he accepted with typical enthusiasm and one he conducted with such distinction that he was awarded the OBE shortly before he was demobbed. He often spoke in glowing terms of those dedicated days when wounded air crew would be brought for treatment to the new unit that had been established at the Palace Hotel in Torquay. This was an establishment that Dan knew well because of its two beautiful indoor tennis courts, the stage for many memorable cup matches and tournaments. He was devastated when a bombing raid destroyed a wing of the hotel and killed some of the medical staff. Dealing with the sufferings of others in those years helped to prepare Dan for the two tragedies that came later in his own life: the loss of his son, Jay, in an air crash in the West Indies and the drowning of his wife, Connie, a few years later in the same part of the world. The strand of steel that lay beneath the reserved, gentlemanly demeanour, together with the unfailing support of his daughter, Robin, saved him. So did his second marriage. Kay was the salvation for Dan in his final years and her large family brought him unexpected joy and happiness. When he retired from the All England Club in 1955 at the age of 47, Dan became the LTA's training manager to concentrate on re-organising the national coaching structure. He felt he was no longer able to play daily for four hours at the pace of the outstanding young players who had risen to the top of the British game: men like Roger Becker and Bobby Wilson, Michael Davies, Billy Knight and Tony Pickard. These fellows were the nucleus of my Davis Cup teams in those years and I always took care to see that Dan would be around during our matches. His fund of stories - some taller than others  -always helped to keep the atmosphere relaxed. More importantly, the fellows trusted him and respected his deep knowledge of the game and his dedication - just as the winning teams of the 1930s had done. After all, Dan had been the professional champion of Great Britain 16 times and could boast a win over the legendary Bill Tilden. Dan was justly proud of the part he played in those golden years with Fred Perry and Bunny Austin, Pat Hughes, Raymond Tuckey and Harry Lee. The reunion of that triumphant team one year, during one of Fred's spectacular birthday parties at Wimbledon, was a special day for him. It was Dan's friendly and relaxed personality that enabled him to bridge the gap between the Upstairs-Downstairs world in which he had grown up and the glittering world of international tennis. He helped to accelerate the social changes that seemed so slow in coming. When he first joined the All England Club, he was allowed to change in the members' dressing room - a practice unheard-of at Queen's Club. Imagine his pride when, in 1953, he was elected as the first professional honorary member at Wimbledon. He had also been the first professional to be sent abroad with a national team in those glorious Davis Cup years. It was as the voice of Wimbledon for BBC television that Dan will best be remembered. Over a span of 41 years his obvious respect for the game, its traditions and its performers shone through in all he did. There was a humility about him that all the great champions have possessed. Sitting beside him in the commentary box was a privilege I enjoyed for 21 years. He did his homework meticulously and had an instinctive way of knowing how to enhance the enjoyment of the viewer by highlighting the reason behind the outcome of a point. Never the needless chatter. Better complete silence so as not to intrude on the viewer's enjoyment of the action. It was a formula that was the envy of other broadcasters and built for Dan an army of fans. In spite of the tragedies in his life, Dan used to say that he was one of the luckiest men alive. His love affair with tennis had begun early in life, while first skiing and then golf had provided the relaxation. The love affair never died. He saw his first Wimbledon final in 1924, when Kitty Godfree inflicted on Helen Wills the only defeat the great American ever suffered there. Then, from 1929 to 1991, he saw every day of play. I shall remember Dan best for his generosity of spirit. He never said a mean word about anybody - though he would get justly angry at some of the outrageous behaviour he had to witness. Yes, he was a lucky man in many ways, but the ones who can really consider themselves lucky are those whom he counted as friends - and they are many. I am proud to have been one of them.</p>

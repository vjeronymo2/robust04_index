			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Letter: Kicked into public arena Sir, In 'Spurs forced to issue statement on profits' (May 18), your correspondent suggested that 'Mr Venables' methods of giving out price-sensitive information jars with stock exchange rules about making such announcements to the market as a whole'. He did speak without board approval. Nevertheless, his method of announcement outside market hours on live television during the FA cup build-up could not have been more equitable. Small investors without ready access to star analysts would be less disadvantaged if more company news was released on Saturday TV.

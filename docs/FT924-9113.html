			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / TV networks backed on syndication A FEDERAL appeals court in Chicago has rejected an important 1991 ruling by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that restricted the rights of US television networks to earn big profits from the syndication of prime time programmes. The court decision could play havoc with the politically sensitive issue of who earns the most from the Dollars 5bn annual market for the resale of television shows. Last year the FCC ruled the networks could own and syndicate, domestically and abroad, 40 per cent of programmes. That was a partial victory for the networks because they previously could not syndicate anything domestically. The ruling followed a 20-year period in which Hollywood studios which made the programmes were in a stronger position as they had the exclusive resale rights. Both the networks and Hollywood decided to appeal. The networks argued they should be given the right to resell 100 per cent rather than just 40 per cent of the shows while Hollywood argued the networks should not have any rights. The Chicago court ruling sent Wall Street analysts scrambling to interpret its possible future financial impact. It remained unclear whether the matter would continue in the courts, lead to a new FCC decision or be treated at a political level once the Clinton administration takes office. 'The whole question is a football and when it bounces it could bounce in any direction,' said Mr David Londoner, media and entertainment analyst at Wertheim Schroder, the investment bank.</p>

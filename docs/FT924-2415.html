			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Small pay cut for Lord Hanson LORD HANSON, the chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-American industrial conglomerate, has taken a small pay cut. His remuneration fell from Pounds 1.38m to Pounds 1.35m according to the company's annual report. In his statement Lord Hanson took a swipe at the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance. He said: 'Much has been said recently about corporate governance but most of the advice has been long on accountability and short on encouraging efficiency and enterprise.' He said the group's directors and associates held 17m shares, 0.4 per cent of the share capital, between them, an average of half a million each. However, Lord Hanson holds 6m shares himself and Mr Robert Hanson, his son and also a director, holds 3.75m shares. The total holding is worth about Pounds 40m at yesterday's close of 223 1/4 p, down from 226p. The accounts also show that Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson's US operations, could receive 14.4 per cent of an annual fee of Dollars 1.1m (Pounds 720,000) relating to his personal holding in MariFarms, a 46.8 per cent owned associate of Hanson. After the September 30 year end MariFarms bought Marine Harvest, Unilever's Scottish fish farming business, for Dollars 39m. This was financed by a Dollars 31.8m private placement of preferred stock issued to Prudential Insurance of America. Prudential has the right to sell the preferred stock back to Hanson and Mr Clarke if MariFarms fails to redeem the stock by October 31 1995. The annual fee will be paid as long as the put option is unexercised. The accounts also show that Hanson made charitable donations of Pounds 721,000 in the UK, down from Pounds 786,000, included in a worldwide total of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.8m), less than 0.2 per cent of pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.32bn). One project Hanson supported was St Tiggywinkle's Wildlife Hospital Trust, where Hanson donated the materials to build a wildlife teaching hospital. Donations of Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative Party and Pounds 15,000 to the Centre for Policy Studies were unchanged.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Revival of Docklands Sir, Your balanced leader on the Tower Hamlets British National party vote is welcome ('A shiver in east London', September 20). It is vital that the concern generated by this event does not shield the positive changes shaping and improving Docklands and east London. When the docks finally closed in 1980, the local community here faced no investment opportunities and high unemployment but their strong sense of identity remained. If that position had continued, the community would have had just cause for feeling there was little hope as there were poor communications, little suitable job training, and only modest educational opportunities. Now, with very substantial commercial investment, and much better job opportunities, especially as the recession ends, there is indeed good reason to be optimistic. Better communications and the new airport, better public transport, housing improvement and more opportunities for home ownership, are all helping to secure the long-term future for residents. There were 27,000 jobs in Docklands in 1981 and the number was falling. We have secured 55,000 now, and the number is rising. There were about 1,000 businesses and there are nearly 2,500 now. Canary Wharf, for example, has made particular efforts to target job opportunities on local residents with almost 800 local people so far finding work at Canary Wharf during the course of the project. Unfortunately, there are no data linking jobs to residents for the total 55,000 jobs. Change inevitably brings some tension as we have to adjust to new technologies, different job opportunities and new life styles, and sensitively deal with the housing and educational priorities demanded by demographic and ethnic change. All of us who are committed to improving this area, including ourselves, Tower Hamlets Council, and many other organisations, work closely together to try to deal positively with change and growth. We are confident that we shall succeed both in making this area an economic success and in promoting a harmonious community, but this requires continuous effort, particularly to improve educational achievement.

Matutes commented on the result of  the referendum at a news conference on pan-European traffic  conference in Crete in mid-March. The traffic commissioner  admitted that Switzerland's decision of Sunday [20 February] was  made in conjunction with EU traffic principles as laid down in  the green book. However, it is incompatible with the transit  agreement concluded between the EU and Switzerland. From his  point of view, this will not change if Switzerland affirms that  it desires to keep its international commitments. Matutes  commented on the result of the referendum at a news conference  on theserious circumstance which turns out to be even more  serious when analyzed on a long-term basis. What is an  agreement worth if a referendum can be held and it can be  overruled anytime, Matutes asked.    For the Spaniard Matutes, the referendum is casting a shadow  on future EU negotiations with Switzerland. The commission was  instructed to check the consequences of the referendum in detail  -- particularly with a view to bilateral traffic negotiations.  According to Matutes they might now be jeopardized. The  transportation commissioner similarly assesses the aviation  agreement situation. According to Matutes, the substance of the  mandate for traffic negotiations that the transportation  ministers originally wanted to adopt in mid-April must be  revised. The referendum will also affect air traffic  negotiations, he said. However, nothing is currently impossible,  everything must be thoroughly considered now.    Matutes is worried most about discrimination on the part of  EU transporters. Discrimination is not acceptable, he said. He  also insisted on freedom of movement for goods and persons.  Matutes recalled that in the negotiations with Switzerland a  global balance is sought and one does not want to confine  oneself to one point. However, the result of the referendum has  changed the possibilities, he said. The transportation  commissioner hopes that he will be able to discuss alternatives  with Federal Councilor Ogi at the conference in Crete, in order  to find a way out of the dead end. He is banking, among other  things, on the political abilities of the Swiss transportation  minister, he said.</p>

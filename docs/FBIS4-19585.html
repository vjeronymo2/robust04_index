			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ali Sirmen from the "The World Today" column: </F> "Why Not?"]    [Text] "Turkey will not become Algeria. It cannot."    We have been hearing this phrase often lately. Do not doubt  that those who say this phrase are stating a fact in their  opinion; but, maybe they are actually expressing a wish.    In social life, however, developments cannot be stopped by  saying "it cannot be, it must not be."    Such phrases have been uttered frequently in our country.  There were times when people said "Turkey cannot become Latin  America." When the circumstances dictated, however, we began  experiencing the same things as Latin America.    It must be noted immediately, however, that social  development in one country is never identical to that in another  country. Every society has its own particular circumstances and  they differ from one society to another. These differences  should not prevent us from seeing some of the common factors.    It is possible to observe common factors in all countries,  where radical movements emerge.    We will examine these factors in another article, while  today  we will look at the common factors between Turkey and Algeria.    One of the greatest similarities between Turkey and Algeria  consists of the high rate in the population growth in both  countries. This rate is 2.4 percent in Turkey (although the  rate is below 2 percent in certain western regions, it is around  4 percent in the southeast) and stands at 3.2 percent in Algeria.    This rate of increase in the population, which exceeds the  rate of economic development, causes big social problems in  societies where the increase in production cannot keep up with  the population growth.    Especially because of high migration rates, a significant  portion of the population is concentrated in urban areas,  creating shantytowns, as in the case of Turkey, and forcing  people to live in difficult and destitute conditions in Algeria,  which make the shantytowns in Turkey appear desirable.    In both countries, people are given jobs in state economic  enterprises in a bid to solve the employment problem, and this,  in turn, pushes the economy into a bigger impasse.    Grave economic crises and the inability to increase the  income from exports make it more difficult to undertake new  investments in both countries.    Both countries are burdened by huge foreign debts, and the  capital and interest payments obstruct all kinds of economic  enterprise.    Having cited these common factors, let us look at elements,  which appear to be different at first glance, but are not  actually so different upon deeper examination.    It is said: "Contrary to Algeria, there is a democracy in  Turkey and the situation will not be the same as Algeria because  everyone will have the opportunity to express his opinion within  the framework of democracy."    There is a portion of truth in this statement. It is also  true, however, that this democracy and its parties as well as  its leaders have become unable to meet the demands of the  people. The system is unable to overcome its problems and its  difficulties within its own framework and it is failing to  provide real or seemingly alternative institutions, other than  the Prosperity Party.    Democracy is a regime of choices. If the choices disappear  or it seems to the public that there are no choices, then the  structural existence of democracy loses its meaning.    Another argument suggests that Turkey has a secular  tradition  of 70 years and secularism is established among the people.    Yes, it is true that Turkey has a 70-year-old tradition of  secularism, which is still supported by the people. It is,  however, necessary to realize the following point as well.  Aided by the state's carelessness as well, a new and powerful  anti secular generation is being raised in Turkey because  monotheistic education has been abandoned, Koran courses have  been taken over by anti secular forces, and these forces have  infiltrated the state's National Education cadres.    It is clear that declaring offhand that Turkey cannot become  Algeria is merely wishful thinking.    It is neither right to say "Turkey cannot become Algeria,"  nor is it correct to say "Turkey will definitely become another  Algeria."    When social circumstances dictate, consequences similar --  not identical -- to those in Algeria are inevitable.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vasos Vasiliou] </F>   [Text] The U.S. services, police, and the Popular Bank  went on alert a few days ago after the visit of a Russian  businessman to the bank in order to deposit an amount well over  $100,000 in cash.    According to our information, due to the fact that the  dollars were almost new, the employees of the Popular Bank were  afraid that they were counterfeit.    Police experts were called immediately, and they examined  the  approximately $140,000 with a machine of the latest technology.  The examination showed that the dollar notes were legitimate.    At the same time, a U.S. expert was also called in; and  after  he examined the bills, he issued a finding which, we are  informed, left the experts and others speechless.    Specifically, the U.S. expert confirmed beyond any doubt  that  all the dollars were part of aid money given by the United  States to Russia.    According to our information, in addition to that, the U.S.  expert knew the date the dollar notes were sent and received by  the Russian Government.    However what left everyone speechless was the moment it  became evident that the Americans knew not only when they had  sent these specific dollars and when the money reached Moscow,  but also their serial numbers.    Following that, the dollars were deposited because the main  purpose of the investigation was to determine the authenticity  of the dollars.</p>

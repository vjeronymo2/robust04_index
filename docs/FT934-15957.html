			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: 'Poor performers' list gives ammunition to institutions INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, RJR Nabisco and Bethlehem Steel were named yesterday as being among the financially worst performing large US companies in a survey which will provide powerful ammunition to institutional investors involved in America's fast-growing corporate governance movement. The movement seeks to improve corporate performance, and board responsibility to investors, by pressing for changes in the framework governing the running of companies. One of its main weapons is the shareholder resolution, or 'proxy' vote, at a company's annual meeting. The Council of Institutional Investors, an umbrella organisation for US pension funds, whose members have more than Dollars 600bn in assets, yesterday issued a list of 50 companies which it said had been identified by an independent research agency as the poorest performing among America's largest 1,000 companies, according to various investment criteria. The list has been sent to council members together with a profile of each of the 50 companies' attitudes towards various corporate governance issues, such as executive compensation and the role of non-executive directors. The information is meant to be used by funds in deciding their attitude towards individual companies on corporate governance issues. Ms Anne Hansen, deputy director of the council, stressed yesterday that 50 companies did not form a council-approved 'hit list'. Some large US institutional investors already have their own computer-generated financial screens which identify poorly performing companies. The council's list is designed to disseminate such information much more widely, among funds which could not afford to gather this data on their own. Other companies near the bottom of the list include Borden, the foods group, the New York Times publishing company and Black &amp; Decker, the tools business. The list was released at the council's semi-annual meeting of members. The list is an example of the increasing sophistication of the corporate governance movement in targetting poorly performing companies. Institutions have also been given more power to launch concerted action against problem companies by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which a year ago changed its rules to allow easier communication among investors. However, in a change of tactics over the past year or two, shareholder activists have been seeking more to negotiate change with companies in private, before attacking them head-on with proxy contests. A further demonstration of growing investor sophistication came this week with the release by TIAA-CREF, the US teacher's fund which is the world's largest pension system, of a comprehensive set of corporate governance principles. The fund believes this may be the first all-inclusive document of its kind in the investment industry and it has sent copies to all 1,500 companies in which it holds stocks. An unusual feature of the document is its belief that a board should be composed of people 'who reflect diversity of experience, gender, race and age'.</p>

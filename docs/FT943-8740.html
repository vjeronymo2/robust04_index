			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / World Trade News: British trade with Malaysia in surplus despite boycott Britain's trade with Malaysia has recorded a healthy surplus in the first six months of the year, despite a Malaysian government ban on giving contracts to UK companies. According to figures from Kuala Lumpur, UK exports to Malaysia rose 80 per cent in the period to Pounds 666m (Dollars 1bn). Meanwhile, Malaysia's exports to Britain dropped by 24 per cent to Pounds 581m. Malaysia imposed its ban on British companies in February this year in retaliation over reports in the London press alleging that a British company had tried to offer bribes to senior Malaysian officials. The Malaysian government was also angered by the publicity surrounding the granting of British aid for construction of the Pergau dam and the parliamentary inquiry into its linkage to multi-million-pound Malaysian purchases of British defence equipment. While British officials would not comment on the latest trade figures, it is thought that a large portion of the goods exported by Britain to Malaysia over the last six months resulted from contracts signed before the ban was imposed. The trade figures are likely to have included British defence equipment, including British Aerospace Hawker fighter aircraft, delivered recently to Malaysia under the terms of a controversial 1988 memorandum of understanding on defence sales signed by former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher and Dr Mahathir Mohamad, her Malaysian counterpart.</p>

			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil/Securiguard There must have been little doubt after Rentokil's 345p offer that Securiguard would sue for peace. Less certain is that Rentokil needed to offer quite so much to tip the balance in its favour. It may have felt Securiguard could drive a hard bargain because its shares are concentrated in the hands of relatively few institutions. If so, it will also have to live with a reputation for being a soft touch. That will not help in future acquisitions or calm worries that it is growing anxious about its ability to maintain its 20 per cent earnings growth. Rentokil's answer that the total Pounds 76m purchase price is paltry in comparison with its market capitalisation of Pounds 2bn is not entirely satisfactory. It has drawn attention to itself with so much huffing and puffing over what ought to have been a pretty easy prey. Also, the deal involves a Pounds 40m goodwill write-off while Rentokil has a net worth of only Pounds 146m. There is limited room for more goodwill hits if large contested takeovers are now needed to maintain earnings momentum - on which coincidentally the chief executive's remuneration depends. In the short-run the acquisition should not prove dilutive. In the medium term everything depends on whether Rentokil can bolster the margins of Securiguard's security division and expand the business. Paradoxically yesterday's offer document does not help its case. It points out that price competition in security is now intense. Perhaps that is why, before Rentokil came along, Securiguard's shares were languishing at a level not much more than half the price it is now set to pay.</p>

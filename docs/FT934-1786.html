			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Argentine city hit by job protests The Argentine government last night flew riot police from Buenos Aires to retake the north-western city of Santiago del Estero from rioters. Local police withdrew from the city's streets after rioters stormed the governor's palace and pillaged the building. They then rampaged through the courthouse and legislature, which they tried to burn down. The rioting broke out after the provincial government announced plans to cut jobs as part of an economic reform programme. Santiago del Estero is one of Argentina's poorest provinces. One rioter said: 'We are all (dying) of hunger. We are in the office of some thief and we are breaking everything.' The uprising forced President Carlos Menem to cut short a visit to the Vatican. Earlier in the day, rioters and police traded gunfire, molotov cocktails, stones and tear gas. Two were reported dead and dozens injured. Crowds later fanned out through the city, ransacking the homes of prominent local politicians, including that of Mr Fernando Lobo, the recently appointed provincial governor. This is the second, and most serious, recent outbreak of violence in Argentina's provinces. The deteriorating economies of many provinces is emerging as one of Mr Menem's most pressing political and economic challenges. The federal government is demanding that Argentina's 23 provinces reform their chaotic finances by cutting public jobs, reducing spending and reforming their tax systems. They rely on tax transfers from Buenos Aires to cover two-thirds of their annual spending of Dollars 20bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ninth National Assembly's Fifth Session enters  its eighth work day today. In the morning plenary meeting, the  National Assembly continued to discuss the revised draft law on  elections of the People's Councils under the direction of  National Assembly Chairman Nong Duc Manh.    The revised draft law includes a preamble and 71 articles in  10 chapters. The draft law amends 54 articles, supplements 10  others, and retains the other seven articles of the old law.    During their discussion, the deputies expressed their  unanimous views on the quality of deputies specified by the  revised draft law as persons who are loyal to the socialist  Vietnamese fatherland, who can represent the people in various  ways, who have records of good conduct and abide strictly by the  law, who are enthusiastic in protecting the interests of the  state and the people, who have good general backgrounds, are  competent in carrying out National Assembly activities and  resolving pressing local issues, and who are trusted by the  people.    The deputies also discussed the composition of People's  Councils and the quality of people's councilors. Some deputies  suggested that candidates who failed in the first election  should not be allowed to run in People's Councils by-elections,  and that only new candidates should be allowed in such  elections. Other deputies said that efforts should be made to  ensure equality of rights between nominated candidates and  independent candidates, and so forth.    This afternoon the National Assembly will continue its work  at the conference hall in Hanoi.</p>

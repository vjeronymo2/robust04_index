Other Sources.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> RACM (including RACT) does not require the imposition of controls on emissions from sources that are insignificant (i.e. de minimis) and does not require the implementation of all available control measures where an area demonstrates timely attainment and the implementation of additional controls would not expedite attainment (see 57 FR 13540&hyph;44).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IDEQ has determined, through its emission inventory analysis of the nonattainment area, that road dust contributed 38 percent of the PM&hyph;10 concentration on the worst case days in base year 1988. IDEQ demonstrated timely attainment of the 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS by controlling wood smoke. Therefore, RACM does not require road dust control measures. Furthermore, RACM does not require the implementation of controls for prescribed silvicultural and agricultural burning for the Pinehurst nonattainment area, because the area is not significantly impacted by those activities on worst case days, according to the emission inventory analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, RACT does not require the implementation of control technology for sources of PM&hyph;10 in the nonattainment area, because the area is primarily characterized by residential and commercial uses which are not subject to RACT requirements. There are no major stationary sources operating in the Pinehurst PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A more detailed discussion of the control measures contained in the SIP and an explanation as to why certain available control measures were not implemented, can be found in IDEQ's submittal and in the TSD. EPA has reviewed IDEQ's submittal and associated documentation and concluded that they adequately justify the control measures to be implemented. The implementation of the Pinehurst, Idaho PM&hyph;10 nonattainment plan control strategy will result in the attainment of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS as expeditiously as practicable_by December 31, 1994. By this notice, EPA is approving IDEQ's control strategy as satisfying the RACM (including RACT) requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Demonstration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Moderate PM&hyph;10 nonattainment areas must submit a demonstration (including air quality modeling) showing that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994 (see section 189(a)(1)(B) of the Act). The General Preamble sets out EPA's guidance on the use of modeling for moderate area attainment demonstrations (57 FR 13539). Alternatively, the State must show attainment by December 31, 1994, is impracticable. The 24-hour PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 150 micrograms/cubic meter (&mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and the standard is attained when the expected number of days per calendar year with a 24-hour average concentration above 150 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is equal to or less than one (see 40 CFR 50.6). The annual PM&hyph;10 NAAQS is 50 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and the standard is attained when the expected annual arithmetic mean concentration is less than or equal to 50 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (id.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

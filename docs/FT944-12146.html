			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Fed intervenes as dollar sinks to post-war low: US currency hits Y96.05 amid warnings from Tokyo of threat to recovery The Federal Reserve intervened repeatedly in support of the dollar yesterday and the US Treasury tried to talk the US currency up after it sank to Y96.05, a fresh post-1945 low. The dollar's renewed weakness prompted Mr Masayoshi Takemura, Japan's finance minister, to warn that the country's economic recovery was under threat. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said the dollar's dive was 'inconsistent with the fundamentals of a strong investment-led recovery' in the US. 'Continuation of recent foreign-exchange trends would be counterproductive for the US and the world economy,' he said. He promised to monitor developments closely in co-operation with the other six members of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. However, apart from the Bank of Japan, which regularly buys dollars, the Fed was alone in its support of the currency. Traders estimated that it spent between Dollars 1bn and Dollars 1.5bn on buying dollars in the currency markets. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said: 'I welcome the fact that the American monetary authorities have clearly expressed their interest in a strong dollar.' Fed support helped to take the dollar back to Y97.60 in New York trading, and lifted it to DM1.515 from an earlier low of DM1.491. Signs of continued expansion in yesterday's 'Beige Book' report on US economic conditions added to the dollar turmoil. The report alarmed financial markets by renewing questions over whether the Fed had acted fast enough to head off inflationary pressures. The Fed intervention provided an initial boost to US stocks, but share prices later fell and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 26.24 at 3,837.13. European stock markets were weighed down by the dollar's initial decline and by Tuesday's falls on Wall Street. In Paris, the CAC-40 index was 1.7 per cent lower, while the Dax index fell 1.3 per cent in after-hours trading. In London, the FT-SE 100 Index, having been 26 points lower, rallied on news of Fed intervention to end the day 15 points down at 3,081.3. Since taking office at the start of 1993, the Clinton administration has been dogged by the perception that it was happy with a fall in the dollar. Mr Bentsen's statement yesterday was needed to offset the damage he had caused with recent remarks. But analysts said the dollar would go lower without the active support of the Bundesbank and other central banks. Mr Avinash Persaud, at J. P. Morgan, said: 'I think the market is going to brush this aside unless it sees the Bundesbank come in.' The Tokyo markets were closed this morning.

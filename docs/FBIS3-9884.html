			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Presidential Candidate Ruben Dario Carles has  presented his government plan, which is entitled "Carles' Plan:  New Jobs for All," to the nation for consideration. The plan  lists a series of immediate measures his government will take to  do away with unemployment in Panama and to develop several areas  of the nation's economy.    Carles was nominated by the Nationalist Liberal Republican  Movement (Molirena), the National Renewal Movement (Morena), and  the Civilist Renewal parties. Some of the plan's immediate  objectives are the construction of 115,000 "dignified homes" at  a cost of $250 million, which will also create some 35,000  direct and indirect jobs. The text of the plan follows:  <H5>  Carles' Plan: New Jobs for All </H5>   1.

New investments and improvements in public works and  services    -- Heightened quality and efficiency in public services  (health, education, security, transportation, power, water,  telephones, ports, and waste management) will begin during the  first 100 days of this administration    -- Awareness of public employees' responsibility and the  taxpayers' right to receive better public services at all  government agencies    -- Institutional development requires public administration  reforms, and such reforms will be implemented    -- National reforestation plan    -- Reforestation, forest production, and export programs    -- Development of 50,000 hectares of lumber forests across  the country    -- The creation of 20,000 temporary and permanent jobs in  rural areas    -- Streamlining and strengthening of tax breaks for  reforestation projects    -- Environmental and ecological conservation    5. Investment promotion    A. Support for the promotion and development of the tourist  sector, highlighting ecotourism    -- Creating a single office to resolve excessive government  bureaucracy and simplify procedures    -- We will improve coordination between the public and the  private sectors to allow coherent planning that will promote  growth. We will also implement an evaluation system to allow  rapid decisionmaking and expeditious actions to encourage  investment in the tourist sector    -- Establishment of installations and facilities for cruise  lines    B. Promotion of a maritime business and international  cargo transshipment center with cargo container operations in  Manzanillo, Telfers, Cristobal, and the port of Chiriqui Grande.    -- Legal and administrative structures will be improved to  allow the integration of maritime activities under an entity  that promotes Panama as a maritime business center.    C. Bolster the mining industry.    -- Incentives will be created for the commercial  exploitation and development of our mining resources.    -- Exports will be promoted to reach a projected $500  million annually by the year 2000.    -- Mining activity will generate 4,000 direct jobs and  24,000 indirect jobs.    D. Develop the export availability of agriculture and cattle  products.    -- Preferential conditions will be negotiated for  Panamanian agricultural products in the United States.    -- Agriculture and cattle export production areas will be  outfitted with the proper infrastructure.    -- The concerted agreement of labor conditions, which are  better than what competing countries offer, will be promoted.    -- Financing will be sought for the production of  agricultural products that have export possibilities.    -- Reasonable protection for certain basic agricultural  food products for domestic consumption (meat, milk, rice, corn,  sorghum, beans, potatoes, onions, and tomatoes) will be  maintained.    -- A properly operating toxicology laboratory for meat  exports.    -- A sterile fly production program to wipe-out the  burrowing worm. This will generate 500 jobs.    -- The creation of facilities to convert Tocumen  International Airport into a international air traffic center.    These policies will allow the Panamanian farmer to begin  producing nontraditional products, thereby creating new jobs.  Protectionism will enable farmers to ensure a market for their  production and maintain jobs, and in certain cases, increase  production to cover the domestic deficit of protected products.    Note: To the previously mentioned activities, we must add  the  activities that will emerge as a result of the negotiations on  the use of existing facilities in Panama for U.S. Government  defense use, which we are proposing.

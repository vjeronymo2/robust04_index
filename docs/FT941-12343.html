			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Management: MBWA - manage by wandering around - Lew Platt, chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, offers advice on keeping close to your employees / Tips from the top I have just completed my first year as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, a year of escalating competition in our industry and continuous pressure on our employees to make difficult changes. Sounds familiar? Because most of our 96,000 employees around the world are struggling with tumultuous change, I made a decision at the outset to focus my inaugural communication efforts on employees. Although this left little time for press interviews or communicating with other important constituents, the first 12 months presented an opportunity to gain employee support that wouldn't be repeated. I've been a believer in open, two-way employee communication throughout my career, and this year reinforced that belief. Employee communication seems to be a fad that comes and goes in many companies. At HP, though, it is a sustained effort; in fact, it is ingrained in our company culture. There are some simple practices that have worked well at HP for more than 50 years. They are so simple that they're often rejected or overlooked. They were put in place by our company founders - Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard - when they started the business and I'm fortunate to have inherited this legacy from them. The first rule is to trust and respect all employees. We approach each situation with the understanding that people want to do a good job and will do so given proper tools and support. This is one of the values that underlie our corporate objectives. It's evident in our lack of time clocks. Employees are trusted to keep track of their own hours. It is also evident in our placing decision-making at the lowest possible level, where invariably the best decisions are made. Second, create an atmosphere of open communication and let it permeate the culture. At HP, we have an informal atmosphere where everyone is on first-name terms, regardless of rank or job. We also have a number of mechanisms to encourage people to talk to each other, including: an environment where there are no doors; regular employee communication sessions in which managers update employees on the state of the business; communication lunches where employees can share ideas and identify problems in a two-way exchange with management; and coffee pots located around the company where people can gather for informal conversations. We also encourage MBWA - managing by wandering around - which gets managers in touch with people. Third, establish an 'open door' policy. At HP, any door is literally open to an employee with a problem, a complaint or a suggestion. The practice has been extended successfully to our electronic mail system and I get dozens of letters each week from employees, as do managers throughout the company. This practice has worked as well as any formal employee suggestion programme I've ever heard of, and it's much less costly. I spent much of my first year as chief executive travelling to HP sites around the world. It is amazing how these principles work as well in India and China as in the UK and the US. At every site, I've made a point of having a communication session with employees. These have been invaluable for reinforcing my key objectives and learning what's on people's minds. This is not just the job of the chief executive. People expect the entire management team to live by these values and not just talk about them. Every HP manager is accountable for communication on his or her performance evaluation. Our employee survey, conducted at each site every 12 to 18 months, is one of the best measures of how well managers are performing in this regard. None of these practices is new. There is no magic about them. But they are time-tested, and they are the primary reasons why we have been able to attract and keep top talent, even in the most difficult times. This concludes the present series. The FT will shortly be publishing Tips from the Top as a single booklet. Fax John White on 071-873-3072 for further information.</p>

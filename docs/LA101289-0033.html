			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IF NOT IN YOUR BACK YARD, WHY PUT HOMELESS IN OURS?;  </P> <P> DOWNTOWN: THE HASTY MOVE OF THE UNION RESCUE MISSION SEEMS DESIGNED TO SPARE  STATE WORKERS FROM SEEING UNKEMPT STREET PEOPLE.  </P> <P> A shocking process is under way to move hundreds of homeless men who seek  shelter from the elements each night in downtown Los Angeles. The city's  Community Redevelopment Agency is enticing the Union Rescue Mission with  millions of taxpayer dollars to encourage it to find a new home.  </P> <P> Why does the CRA want to give the Rescue Mission $6.5 million to buy a new home  and then millions more in payment for its Main Street facility, where it has  served the homeless for more than 70 years? It's simple. For a long time, the  CRA has been pressured by the state of California to get rid of the Union  Rescue Mission's 800-bed shelter on Main Street, because a new state office  tower is being built around the corner.  </P> <P> State officials have made it clear and the redevelopment agency has agreed: It  is unacceptable for well-groomed and stylishly dressed state workers to be  confronted by the sight of the homeless huddling down the block. The situation  can be compared to a potential home buyer demanding that his real estate agent  evict his new next-door neighbors because the family has no concept,  understanding or appreciation of social graces.  </P> <P> The CRA is buying into preposterous arguments that hard-working state employees  have no business being subjected to the real or imagined daily threat presented  by people who might not have shaved, showered or slept in a bed. What the CRA  should do is to fix up the existing mission so that it can become a shining  example of a redevelopment project for the homeless. Instead, the agency is  transferring blight from one neighborhood to another. To call this an outrage  is an understatement.  </P> <P> While the CRA and the state are trying to give the Union Rescue Mission the  bum's rush, they don't intend to sweep the homeless clear of Main Street and  move them far away. No, the mission's moving vans will need to travel only a  few blocks to Central City East, an area popularly known over the years as Skid  Row.  </P> <P> The rationale for this is disturbingly clear. Central City East is already home  to the largest concentration of homeless service shelters in Southern  California: Los Angeles Mission, Fred Jordan Mission, the Weingart Center, L.A.  Men's Place, Transition House and a host of single-room-occupancy hotels. The  CRA seems to be saying, "Hey, what's one more mission? After all, most of their  homeless friends are already there, so they will feel more at home." The agency  would have you believe that this forced migration of the homeless is intended  to improve the quality of their lives. This is hypocrisy at its best.  </P> <P> Why should the Union Rescue Mission be offensive to state employees, yet be  acceptable to the blue-collar women and men working in Central City East? What  the state doesn't want to confront before it moves into its gleaming office  tower, we manage to deal with on a daily basis with a good measure of  compassion.  </P> <P> But the story doesn't end there. The CRA's handling of this phase of the Union  Rescue Mission's relocation has been rushed, incomplete and contrived. The  mission entered into an agreement to buy its hoped-for new home months ago. It  was done in great secrecy. Neighbors were not informed. Neither was the City  Council.  </P> <P> The whole matter is being brought before the City Council only days before  escrow is scheduled to close on the proposed new site. An artificial sense of  urgency has been purposely created. There has been no formal and thorough city  review and no compelling research to justify the relocation. There has been no  meaningful consultation with the Central City East community. Worse yet, during  a time when the CRA says that it's running out of funds, it hasn't convinced  anyone that less expensive relocation sites are unavailable.  </P> <P> The deal to move the Union Rescue Mission to a new home at 6th and San Pedro  streets will be considered by the full City Council on Friday. The council  should see through this raw deal and disallow the CRA action.  </P> <P> A careful deliberation by the City Council could only benefit the homeless  population on Main Street and might even save the taxpayers money. The Union  Rescue Mission has been serving the homeless at its current site for  generations; why the rush now?  </P></p>

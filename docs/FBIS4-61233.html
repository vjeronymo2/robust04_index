			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Own Information" report: "Once Again We Have No Program </F> for the Sowing"]    [Text] The other day the Federation Council rejected the  version of the program for agrarian reform in Russia proposed by  the government.    The parliamentary decree recognizes that the government  decisions and presidential edicts according to which the  agrarian reform is being carried out "are often contradictory  and sometimes simply wrong." As a result of the economic policy  of the last three years "the country's agro-industrial complex  is in the grip of an extremely grave crisis."    The Ministry of Agriculture and the Russian Academy of  Agricultural Sciences were instructed to carry out additional  work on the program within one month, placing the emphasis on  specific protectionist measures for the agro-industrial complex.  But that will either happen or not. As yet one thing is  certain: Peasants will not learn before the end of the sowing  campaign what kind of policy they can expect from their state in  the fall.</p>

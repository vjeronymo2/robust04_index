			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By David Isaacson] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg May 29 SAPA -- Self-Defence Unit [SDU]  members could be incorporated into the South African Police  Services [SAPS] if African National Congress proposals are  accepted by police and SDU members. The proposals on the  disbanding and disarming of SDUs were given to SDU  representatives from nine East Rand townships at a meeting in  Katlehong on Sunday [29 May].    ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Deputy  Secretary Obed Bapela outlined the proposals as:     -  providing special catch-up schooling to SDU members  between the ages of 13 and 18;    -  accepting those below the age of 25 as police reservists in a  neighbourhood watch programme;    -  and integrating others into the SAPS.        He said this would have to be negotiated with regional and  national authorities, and that the current matric qualification  for policemen would have to be addressed.    "Some of the people...have got some experience of policing  (by)...patrolling our streets to ensure that people sleep  peacefully...    "In the army, Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation] (the  ANC's military wing) through negotiations were able to take a  lot of people without matric who have joined the national  defence force.    "And...we feel strongly that members of the SDUs have to  play  that role (in the police)."    The ANC also proposed a police academy and service brigade  to  train and use people in areas such as electrical and civil  engineering.    SDU members would be debriefed to update them on recent  political developments, Mr Bapela said.    He said SDU representatives, who would report to the ANC on  June 19 after consulting their members, had welcomed the  proposals which, he said, were in line with the ANC's plans for  strict gun control measures in the PWV.    The disarming of SDU members, criminals and "impis [group of  warriors] in hostels" would operate voluntarily and in  conjunction with an amnesty, Mr Bapela said, adding that this  would have to be discussed with authorities.    Mr Bapela, who recently announced a "one person, one gun"  policy in the PWV provincial legislature, said licences would be  issued to people only on merit.    People entitled to guns would include policemen, reservists,  soldiers and those living or working in dangerous areas.    PWV MEC [member Executive Committee] for safety and security  Jessie Duarte attended the meeting, but only in her capacity as  an ANC regional executive member, Mr Bapela said.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER OWLS AND TIMBER IN NORTHWEST  </P> <P> Your backhanded attempt to equate loggers with the production of weapons is  both cowardly and typical.  </P> <P> And your statement that loggers can be retrained and re-employed shows a  callous disregard for the families affected.  </P> <P> No one has a greater love for animals and trees than I, but I reject the  elitist notion that they have equal rights with humans. The ultimate goal of  environmental activists is a total ban on timber harvesting. One can only hope  that common sense will someday be the rule and not the exception.  </P> <P> ROBIN NEWLOVE  </P> <P> Olivenhain, Calif.  </P></p>

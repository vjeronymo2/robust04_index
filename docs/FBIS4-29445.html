			<p>BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir says the enforcement of the  unanimously approved amendments to the UMNO [United Malays  National Organization] constitution to curb money politics will  not be back dated. However, the prime minister said that UMNO  members who resorted to money politics in the party election  last year might lose their chances to be chosen as Barisan  Nasional's candidates in the next general election. The  amendments will be taken into account in deciding UMNO  candidates to be fielded under the Barisan Nasional ticket at  the general election.    He said this at the news conference at the end of the  special  UMNO general assembly in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir,  who is UMNO president said that the date of the enforcement will  not be back dated to ensure fairness to the members. However,  proof for the use of money in the UMNO election last year would  be taken into account to ensure that the party's candidates who  were clean would represent the Barisan Nasional in the general  election.    The prime minister also that Malaysia is not yet prepared to  establish diplomatic relations with Israel because the  government is not convinced that the peace process between  Israel and the Palestinians is settled.    Replying to questions from newsmen at the end of the special  sitting of UMNO general assembly this evening, the prime  minister disclosed that he has so far received three letters  from Yitzhaq Rabin. In his letters to Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir,  the Israeli prime minister has indicated his desire to establish  diplomatic ties with Malaysia.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he has replied to all three  letters and has also informed the cabinet about the  correspondence. When asked to comment on the report that a  prominent Malaysian businessman had visited Jerusalem recently,  the prime minister said he is not aware of the visit. He also  said that there is at the moment no defined punishment for such  wrong. The government has also taken action against the  Malaysian reporter who covered the peace talks between Israel  and the Palestinians recently.</p>

			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Sport: Ibrox blueprint for the people's game - Soccer / The Glasgow Rangers vision of the future AS DANISH champions Lyngby ran out on to lbrox Park for the first leg of their European Champions' Cup encounter, the hostile growl that is Rangers supporters' customary greeting for visitors was tempered by apprehension. The Light Blues have won four successive Scottish Premier League titles. These give them entry to the European Cup. In the first three campaigns they were embarassed, failing to get beyond the second round. This time Rangers won 2-0, but Lyngby did enough to suggest that the second leg this Wednesday will be no formality. European cups which follow a knock-out format no longer make sense to large clubs like Rangers who do not enjoy being booted out in the early rounds of a lucrative competition. That is why Rangers championed the league system that UEFA - the European football governing body - introduced in the European Cup last season. If Rangers can survive the first two rounds they are guaranteed six money-spinning matches against top European clubs in the third round. Rangers hope this reform foreshadows the creation of a European league. Success in Europe is vital for Rangers. They need the minimum of Pounds 3m that reaching the third round brings; their overdraft stands at Pounds 10m and since they also believe their future lies outside Scotland. They have to be capable of matching the best Europe has to offer. In Scotland, football is a matter of great national pride. Scots think they taught the world how to play the game and Rangers represent a particular sub-set of national identity: proud, superior, Protestant and establishment. They are the True Blues, the West of Scotland's Finest. Goals for Rangers can trigger off the chant, 'We are the people.' Rangers see themselves as the most progressive force in UK football and they have radical plans for the 'people's game'. These could show up the new English Premier League for the holding operation it is. Rangers have gone as far as they can under Scottish football's current set-up. They are, says John Lambie, the manager of Partick Thistle, one of Rangers' Scottish rivals, 'the one class outfit in the game today.' Rangers dominate the Premier League with a team assembled for Pounds 18m. The outlay on Thistle's current squad has been less than Pounds 500,000. Not only have Rangers spent money on players, but they have also bought themselves a stadium, 'a five star hotel without the bedrooms', which is unsurpassed in the UK and which must be the envy of many English clubs struggling to meet the government deadline for all-seater grounds. Rangers, says Bob Reilly their commercial manager, have been transformed from an 'old fashioned Institution with a capital 'I', a sleeping giant, into a highly successful commercial and business operation.' Off-field finance has been the key to the three phases of Rangers' revival. The first seed was sown back in 1964 with the establishment of Rangers Pools. For 20 years, this, the most successful club pools operation in the UK, was Rangers main source of off-field income. Since 1969, it has raised some Pounds 22m (Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m in today's money) through a variety of schemes including a spot-the-ball competition and a lottery based on football scores. Today 200,000 people participate every week but at its peak 700,000 played. Changes in the gambling law in 1985 sharply reduced prizes and profitability, but Rangers were developing other sources of income. After the Ibrox disaster in January 1971, when 66 fans died in the crush on Stairway 13, Rangers transformed their stadium. Using the income from the pools, the club built three new stands between 1978 and 1981 reducing capacity from 120,000 to 44,000 in line with a general decline in attendance. That was phase one of the Rangers reform. Poor results in the early 1980s meant Rangers could not even fill their smaller stadium. Enter Graeme Souness as player manager in 1986 to start phase two: the transformation of the team itself. Souness, a combative Scot, had been the midfield force in Liverpool's European Cup winning teams in 1978, 1981 and 1984. The pools money, enabled Souness to transform the thinking of the club. He reversed the traditional footballing trade imbalance with England. Top Scottish players have always headed south and Scottish football had always believed that this was the natural order of things. Souness changed that thinking. He could outbid English clubs and he was able to persuade English international players such as Terry Butcher and goalkeeper Chris Woods to come to Glasgow. Overnight, Rangers became a force in the international transfer market. Souness also bought Mo Johnston, to break a long tradition at the most Protestant of British clubs of not signing Catholics. In year one of Souness, Rangers seized their first Premier League title in nine seasons. Reilly says no one could have had more impact than Souness: 'The image of the team was soaring. We had broken the parochial mould, which was important. And the club was coming up with a product - by that I mean performances on the park - that could attract commercial enterprises and sponsorship. 'Prior to his advent, our season ticket holders numbered 7,000 or 8,000. With the emergence of his internationally- concepted team that more than doubled. Even when he left (to manage Liverpool), we were able to build on the image he had created. Today, because of it, our season ticket holders number 30,000, probably the largest in Great Britain. That gives us a very solid base.' Having built an excellent stadium and a team to fill it, Rangers entered phase three of their transformation when they were bought for Pounds 6m in 1988 by David Murray. Murray is an Edinburgh businessman with interests in steel and property. He is the most powerful chairman Rangers have ever had. He owns over 63 per cent of equity and his power is absolute at Ibrox. Murray is not a man for committees. He emerged from the inevitable Ibrox power struggle earlier this year with the right to oust other board members without putting it to shareholders vote. Those who criticise him as a dictator are given the statistics. In four years, annual turnover has risen from Pounds 5.5m to more than Pounds 13m. Revenue from sponsorship, contractual deals, corporate hospitality, catering (including Rangers Chardonnay), publishing and stadium rentals is up from Pounds 1m to Pounds 6.3m. A new deal with Adidas, the sports equipment manufacturer, should generate Pounds 12m-Pounds 18m over the five years. Murray, supported vigorously by Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Heart of Midlothian, the biggest Edinburgh club, is forcing through proposals for a Scottish Super League. Murray is behind an attempted break-out from the strength-sapping 44-game grind of the current Scottish Premier League, where 12 teams play each other four times a season and blunt their skills and appetite for the game in doing so. Murray has persuaded nine other clubs to back the plan. They are threatening to break away from the Scottish Football Association which bitterly opposes the plan. Murray wants a reduction in the number of domestic league games to 18, which would leave his club free to play midweek in as yet unformed British or European leagues. The league, set to begin in 1994, will also concentrate revenue among Scottish football's elite. Murray's aims include eliminating European knock-out competitions in Europe and ensuring a steady supply of money-spinning games at Ibrox, which will have the added benefit of raising the level of his team's performance against sophisticated opposition. 'Rangers are looking beyond Scotland,' says Bob Reilly. 'That's where the future lies. We are probably one of the few clubs in Great Britain who are ready to operate within a larger scenario because of the standard we've set in terms of stadium and commercial control. But we know one very important thing: the product has to be good or we can't sell it and go on to better things.'</p>

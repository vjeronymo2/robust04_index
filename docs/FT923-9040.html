			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Olympic News in Brief: Games bid cities' restraint The eight cities bidding for the 2000 Olympics have promised not to wine, dine and lavish gifts on IOC members. 'The candidate cities have entered into a gentleman's agreement. We are very pleased. It gives us a chance not to appear as a bureaucratic police force,' IOC secretary-general Francois Carrard said. The cities competing for the 2000 Games are Beijing, Sydney, Manchester, Tashkent, Istanbul, Brasilia, Milan and Berlin. The IOC will meet in Monte Carlo in September 1993 to select the host city.</p>

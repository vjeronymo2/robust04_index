			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Berlusconi wins senate backing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's new prime minister, last night cleared the last hurdle to begin governing with his right-wing cabinet when he narrowly won a vote of confidence in the senate. Mr Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance lacked an absolute majority in the 315-seat senate, swelled to 326 by 11 life senators. He had to rely on the absence of some senators and the abstention of others to win the vote by 159 to 153, with two abstentions. The abstentions counted as a negative; but those absent either through ill health, travel or tactical reasons simply reduced the size of the majority required. With an absolute majority in the chamber of deputies, the confidence vote there on Friday is a foregone conclusion. Mr Berlusconi can now begin to flesh out the details of deregulating the economy, ending Italy's rigid labour laws and reforming taxes, which he announced earlier this week would be the centrepiece of his first 100 days. The three-day debate in the senate showed many politicians were concerned about the composition of the new government, with its five ministers drawn from the neo-fascist MSDI/National Alliance and the presence of the populist Northern League. But despite such reservations no one suggested a serious alternative to Mr Berlusconi or his chosen allies.</p>

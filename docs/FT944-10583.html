			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / US Mid-Term Elections: A seismic takeover for the Republicans - Losers and winners in polls which dealt a severe blow to Clinton and the Democrats Even if the Republican party had fallen short of complete control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the congressional power structure was already well on its way to a substantial shake-up because of the retirement and defeat of a number of party leaders and powerful committee chairmen. But with outright majorities in both chambers, the Republicans will make a seismic takeover of the committee apparatus. Most Republican candidates for House seats signed the 'Contract with America' prepared under the leadership of Congressman Newt Gingrich, the architect of the Republican victory, who will almost certainly take over as Speaker of the House. The Contract pledges to bring to the House floor in the first 100 days of the new Congress 10 substantial bills, including measures to cut income and capital gains taxes, increase defence spending, provide for a balanced budget amendment to the constitution, toughen penalties for criminals, cut back on welfare payments and set term limits for members of Congress. But many House candidates have been running away from the details of the Contract - and even its chief draftsmen say they promise only to bring these measures to a vote, not to pass them. Republican Senators have also been sceptical about the proposals, which do not include specific spending cuts to meet a balanced budget requirement, and the Republican leadership structure in the Senate is likely to be much more moderate, particularly on economic issues. Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, will be flanked by Senator Phil Gramm, a right winger with unconcealed presidential ambitions who chairs the Republicans' Senate campaign committee. Other right wingers will take over some important posts, notably Senator Jesse Helms, the extreme conservative from North Carolina at the head of the foreign relations committee, and Senator Alphonse D'Amato, the Republicans' chief attack dog on the Whitewater issue, as chairman of the banking committee. But major economic policy positions in the Senate will be held by some of the party's leading moderates. Senator Robert Packwood, although politically weakened by charges of sexual harassment which are still under investigation, is expected to chair the Senate finance committee, with jurisdiction over all tax-related matters. However, Senator Gramm has hinted that he might seek to elbow Mr Packwood aside. Mr Packwood's fellow Oregonian, Senator Mark Hatfield, will take over the appropriations committee, which controls government spending. Moderates will also head the labour committee (Senator Nancy Kassebaum) and the environment and public works committee (Senator John Chafee). Senator Larry Pressler, a stiff-necked South Dakotan with an unpredictable set of beliefs, will take over the commerce committee, where he is likely to be much more of a free trader and much less of a regulator than Senator Ernest Hollings, the current chairman. Perhaps the determining factor in the direction of the Republican Congress will be the influence that Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico manages to wield as chairman of the budget committee. A fiscal conservative, almost to the point of obsession, Mr Domenici has been one of the few Republicans willing to contemplate unpopular measures such as tax increases and cuts in entitlement programmes such as social security and Medicare in his desire to control the budget deficit. Mr Domenici is therefore likely to play a central role in curbing the more wayward Republican promises of tax cuts and in tackling the long-term fiscal imbalance that the US faces in the next century if it does not alter the terms of social security and Medicare. He is aligned with his House Republican colleagues on the need for a line-item veto but could clash with them over the supply side premises of the Contract with America's tax cut proposals. Congressman Dick Armey, the chief backer among the House Republicans of a flat income tax rate, says the cuts will cost Dollars 130bn to Dollars 150bn, but says the Republicans will simply change the way the Congressional Budget Office scores tax measures to assume that tax cuts will pay for themselves by stimulating the economy - a logic which failed to balance the budget in the Reagan era. Mr Armey currently ranks third in the Republican hierarchy, but with the retirement of Congressman Bob Michel, the current minority leader, and the elevation of Mr Gingrich to Speaker, he is likely to take the number two post of majority leader, now held for the Democrats by Congressman Richard Gephardt. He will be backed on most tax issues by Congressman Bill Archer, a fellow Texan who will probably become chairman of the House Ways and Means committee, and by Congressman John Kasich, who will take over the budget committee. In some other key House committees, however, the Republicans are expected to override the normal seniority rules that have prevailed in the past. At the appropriations committee, Congressman Joseph McDade is the senior Republican but his indictment on corruption charges is expected to block him from the chairmanship. The second ranking Republican, Congressman John Myers of Indiana, may be too moderate for the taste of the new House majority. Congressman Jim Leach of Iowa, a moderate but another leader of the Whitewater pursuit team, will become chairman of the banking committee, and Congressman Benjamin Gilman of New York, one of the most centrist members remaining in the Republican party, will chair foreign affairs. But Mr Gingrich is expected to push for a close ally, Congressman David Dreier of California, to head the Rules committee, which plays a crucial role in deciding which legislation comes to the floor, and with what amendments, rather than Congressman Gerald Solomon, who is now the senior Republican member of the committee. Congressman Tom Bliley of Virginia, and not senior Republican Carlos Moorhead, is also expected to take over the energy and commerce committee, the barony created by the all-powerful Congressman John Dingell. Mr Dingell's loss of the chairmanship could prove one of the most important changes. His claim to jurisdiction over virtually everything has blocked many legislative proposals, and his departure could pave the way for the measures such as repeal of the Glass-Steagall act, which separates investment and commercial banking.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Controversy" column by Akranis: "Time for </F> Responsibility"]    [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' resignation threat to  U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister John  Major if discussion on the confidence-building measures [CBM's]  continues is certainly not the most serious move that the  president has ever made.    What the president should have done was to brief the  National  Council about his intentions and negotiate with the country's  political leadership about ways to deal with the deadlock, a  deadlock for which he is greatly responsible.    It is inexplicable that while the president briefed the  National Council about his letters to Clinton and Major, he did  not mention his resignation threat. It is unacceptable that  once again the president shows such lack of confidence toward  the country's political leadership. Nor can the shallow  argument that his resignation from the presidency is a personal  issue be accepted.    At at time when the Cyprus issue is at a difficult stage,  the  National Council has unanimously agreed on future moves, and as  his policy has borne such bitter fruit, the president's action  is most unfortunate. His attempt to present himself as a hero  is vain. If the president felt that his policy bore such bitter  fruit that he felt the need to resign to disengage Cyprus--as he  says--from accepting them, he should have done it when he  accepted the 21 March UN document on the CBM's.    The president is well aware that it would not be easy to  disengage once the CBM's were accepted. His mere resignation is  not enough. The international community must be persuaded about  our positions.    The president of the republic knew from the outset that the  National Council opposed his moves. He was aware of political  opposition to the CBM's but he proceeded with what he considered  to be correct moves. Now that Cyprus is facing a painful and  dangerous crossroad, he is threatening to resign.    Of course, we are not the ones to show him whether to  proceed  in one way or another. We are simply presenting food for  thought for the people. These thoughts are being stated because  of the presidency's bad moves.    Now is the time for responsibility. Each one must assume his  own responsibilities in the way he believes is correct and the  people will judge.</p>

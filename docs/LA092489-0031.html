			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA'S TRIAL  </P> <P> What's all the uproar over Zsa Zsa Gabor's trial? Get a clue, folks. Do you  really think she deserves the credit for making a mockery of our legal system?  In America everyone is entitled to a trial by jury. With legal fees at $400 an  hour (Part I, Sept. 18), this is a system only the rich can afford. So what's  the fuss? We are supporting this show, and I for one am delighted to be getting  something back for my entertainment dollar.  </P> <P> MARY SCHWARTZ  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Iveco in talks on joint venture with Nanjing IVECO, the commercial vehicle subsidiary of Fiat of Italy, is negotiating a joint venture in China to produce light commercial vehicles with Nanjing Motor as part of the expansion of its operations in Asia. Mr Giancarlo Boschetti, Iveco chief executive, said final agreement on the Chinese venture was expected to be reached in the summer. Around 6,000 Iveco Daily light commercial vehicles (3-6 tonnes gross vehicle weight) were produced by Nanjing Motor last year under an existing licensing deal established in the mid-1980s. The planned joint venture would raise capacity to around 60,000 vehicles a year, and local content would be increased from 50 to around 90 per cent. Iveco would take a minority equity stake in the venture. Mr Boschetti said Iveco wanted to increase its operations in Asia and was aiming to use the venture in China as well as Ashok Leyland, its minority-owned affiliate in India, to export to other parts of the region. Separately, Iveco has signed a licensing agreement with Halla Engineering and Heavy Industry in South Korea to produce heavy duty trucks, chiefly for off-road use in the construction industry, and is planning to assemble a small volume of light commercial vehicles in a joint venture in Vietnam. Around 250 Iveco vehicles will be produced in South Korea this year, to rise to 1,000 a year by 1997. The group is transferring to India the assembly line for the former UK-built Iveco Ford Cargo, which has been replaced by the new generation EuroCargo truck range at the Langley plant west of London. Output of the Cargo is due to begin in India in November under a four-year plan to renew the Ashok Leyland product range. Products will be badged Ashok Iveco. Ray of light, Page 25</p>

			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / S African talks to resume SOUTH Africa's tortuous negotiating process received a big boost yesterday when it was announced that the South African government and the African National Congress (ANC) would meet next week for talks on a new constitution. It will be the first time the two sides have met for formal constitutional negotiations since multi-party talks broke down last May at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Since then, the gap between the two sides on the crucial issue of power-sharing has narrowed, with the ANC proposing this week that South Africa be ruled by coalition even if one party wins a majority of votes in the first elections under a permanent constitution. ANC officials tried to force the pace of next week's meeting, which will be held over three days at a secret location, by rejecting as too slow the timetable announced on Thursday by President F W de Klerk, who forecast elections for an interim government by April 1994. Amnesty International human rights group has released a report documenting physical abuse of prisoners in ANC camps outside South Africa. The victims were often labelled as South African government spies, but most appeared to have been genuine ANC members, imprisoned because they raised grievances or policy differences, it said.

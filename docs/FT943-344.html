			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Auction of benchmark gilt meets strong demand UK government bond prices were pushed higher yesterday after the successful auction by the Bank of England of Pounds 2bn of new stock. The auction - of 8 1/2 per cent gilts due 2005 - was covered 1.74 times, close to market forecasts, and had a tail - the difference between the top and average yield - of 1 basis point. Unsatisfied demand for the bonds - which will become next year's benchmark - after the auction drove prices higher. There were rumours in the market that the Bank of England moved to meet this demand by supplying an extra Pounds 100m of gilts after the auction to help market-makers who found themselves short of stock. One trader said: 'It is pretty rare for the Bank to sell other stock on the day of an auction, and it has supplied stock right along the yield curve.' Traders believed that the Bank supplied Pounds 100m in total of the 7 per stock due 2001, 9 per cent stock due 2011, and 8 per cent stock due 2013. They believed much of the new gilt went to long-term investors, and then marketmakers who had been selling futures against the new benchmark issue, found themselves short of stock and needed to cover their positions. 'It has been a very technical market today, with a big squeeze. But cash volumes have been pretty pathetic. There hasn't been a lot of profit in it.' The December long gilt future moved up  29/32 to 99 15/16 before the close, and the spread over bunds was 151 in late trading. German government bonds followed US Treasuries upwards in the afternoon, with the December bund future around 89.60 in late trading, up 0.60 point on the day. Mr Adrian Owens, European economist at Yamaichi said: 'The market had a much better feel to it, and the floating-rate note was well received.' The DM10bn floating-rate bond met strong demand, traders said. A total of DM4.49bn was issued yesterday, after DM3bn was issued the day before. The Bundesbank withheld DM2.5bn for market-tending purposes. The performance of the Italian government bond market yesterday was a reaction to domestic political events. The yield on the 10-year bond fell by 15 basis points to 11.63 per cent on hopes of a reduced government deficit heralded by agreement on a budget. 'The Italian soap opera continues,' said Mr Neil Williams, analyst at UBS in London. He said the market rallied by almost a point on the news that the government's budget had been finalised for presentation to parliament, but fell back on news that the trade unions were planning a short strike in protest at pension cuts, and on news that the Northern League had dissociated itself from the budget. Mr Williams said: 'It will be a choppy ride from here on. The market will continue to ebb and flow on rumours of the deficit. It is a fascinating market to follow.' US Treasury bonds regained their poise yesterday as traders ignored an inconclusive report on durable goods orders. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  3/8 better at 96 13/32 , with the yield slipping to 7.805 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  1/32 at 100 1/32 , to yield 6.50 per cent. Bonds were stronger overnight after retreating the previous day on the decision by the Federal Reserve to stand still with its current policy on interest rates. At the long end of the maturity range, Tuesday's inaction by the Fed had brought a measure of disappointment. Holders of the most inflation-sensitive securities would have preferred a more forceful response to recent signs of economic acceleration. Yesterday's economic news are essentially neutral for the Treasury market. The Commerce Department said orders of goods built to last more than a year had risen 6 per cent last month, against expectations of a 3.8 per cent increase. Bonds slipped on the headline figure, but quickly recovered. Most of the unexpected surge was attributed to aircraft orders, perhaps the most volatile of sectors. Without transportation, the August increase was only 2.3 per cent, a tame growth rate which traders were able to brush aside. Bonds gained additional support from a firmer dollar and a well-bid auction of Dollars 11bn in five-year notes. Despite a lukewarm reception for a two-year sale the previous day, strong demand surfaced for yesterday afternoon sale. Afterwards, the long bond fell off its session highs amid some light profit-taking.</p>

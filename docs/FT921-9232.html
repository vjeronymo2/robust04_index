			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Refocused St Modwen declines 48% PRE-TAX PROFITS at St Modwen Properties, the Birmingham-based group, fell 48 per cent, from Pounds 4.05m to Pounds 2.11m, in the year to November 30. The figures masked a change in the shape of the group from a property developer with some rental income to a property investment company with a development stream. Gross profits came to Pounds 10m, of which rental income contributed Pounds 5.4m and property development Pounds 4.6m. In the previous year the contributions were Pounds 4.2m and Pounds 6.5m respectively. Out of an operating profit of Pounds 7.6m interest charges took Pounds 5.5m compared with Pounds 4.3m the previous year. The rise is partly explained through the group stopping the capitalisation of interest charges on its developments. Present gearing is 88 per cent, but during the year the group reduced its debt load from Pounds 56m to just under Pounds 40m. With lower interest rates, the borrowing cost this year should be reduced. As the annual rent roll is now Pounds 6.9m and rising, borrowing costs are covered. 'We no longer need development profits to avoid loss,' said Mr Anthony Glossop, chief executive. Development profits this year, in any case, will be lower than 1991. A sharply lower tax charge, resulting from the holding as investments of developments in Enterprise Zones, left net profit at Pounds 2m (Pounds 2.78m) and earnings at 1.7p (2.3p). The dividend is 0.55p (0.5p). There were no extraordinary charges, against a Pounds 2.14m provision against an investment in an associate.</p>

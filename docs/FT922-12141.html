			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / Disgraced mayor may revive career MR Marion Barry, the 56-year-old former mayor of Washington, will be released from prison tomorrow after serving six months for cocaine possession, Reuter reports from Washington. Political analysts expect Mr Barry, a former civil rights leader, to try to resurrect his political career by running for one of 13 Washington city council seats in this year's elections. He is able to do this as he was convicted of only a misdemeanour, not a felony which would have disqualified him from holding public office. But an election win is not certain for Mr Barry. Once considered unbeatable, with a nickname of 'mayor for life,' he lost badly when he ran for a city council seat in 1990 after his conviction and before sentencing. Nevertheless, a band of supporters plans to escort Mr Barry back to Washington in a bus caravan from a federal prison in Loretto, Pennsylvania, where he spent the last few months of his jail term.</p>

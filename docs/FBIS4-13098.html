			<p>BFN     [Text] In a statement to the newspaper AL-SAFIR published  today, Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz asks what Israel wants the  Lebanese delegation to negotiate in the peace talks. He said:  Lebanon's stance is clear; it demands implementation of  Security Council Resolution 425 providing for Israeli withdrawal  to the internationally recognized borders to enable the  legitimate Lebanese Government to extend its sovereignty  throughout Lebanon. He added: Lebanon will then obligate itself  and pledge to exercise its responsibility as a government and  undertake to keep law and order in the area from which Israel  will withdraw. Buwayz said: We tell the Israelis that this  resolution is independent of the Middle East dispute. He added:  Let them acknowledge this principle and then we will be ready  to form a joint military committee to prepare an agenda and take  the necessary steps to implement security measures. Then, and in  solidarity with the other Arab countries, Lebanon will make  progress in the peace talks and may then recognize a state of  comprehensive and final peace.    Buwayz said: We offered to make progress in two stages: The  first is a purely Lebanese stage through implementation of  Resolution 425 and the second concerns progress on the regional  level. He asked: What did Israel do? He said that Israel  linked the Lebanese file with all the regional files,  particularly the Syrian one. He noted that Israel is demanding  that the Lebanese Government control the resistance as a  precondition although it knows that this is impossible. Israel  also knows that the resistance is a result, not a cause, of the  occupation. The result cannot be eliminated before the cause is  first removed. He said: Israel knows full well that this or any  other Lebanese Government cannot give up the principle of  resistance as long as it has no sure and definite guarantees to  regain its territory. Thus, he said, Israel is setting out an  impossible precondition whereas we pledge to establish peace and  stability when Israel withdraws from the south. Moreover,  Israel links its withdrawal with the signing of a comprehensive  peace agreement. Israel knows that a comprehensive agreement  requires the restoration of all Arab rights.    Buwayz pointed out that Israel links the south Lebanon  problem with the regional problem. This is not the first time  Israel has done this. He said that Israel maintained the same  attitude after the 17 May Agreement. After one and a half years  of peace negotiations and after ending the negotiations, Israel  links the result of all negotiations with Syrian approval and  commitment to security in south Lebanon and even with the  political part of the agreement. He said that Israel accuses us  of linking our file with that of Syria. He said: It is Israel  that links our file with Syria's. Israel accuses us of linking  our file with the regional file although it is the party that  does this.    Buwayz noted that Israel maintains that it cannot make  progress on one track while it has made no progress on the  Palestinian track. Israel is deliberately prevaricating to foil  this round in the hope of reaching particular agreements with  the Palestinians.    Discussing the multilateral negotiations and Lebanon's  refusal to take part, Buwayz said: Lebanon maintains this  stance because we are still determined and more convinced than  ever that joining the multilateral talks is premature. We  cannot join these talks before the bilateral talks make firm,  tangible, and substantial progress. We insist on our position  that participation in the multilateral talks is wrong. Lebanon  was the first country to warn against joining the multilateral  talks. He revealed that there is a regional-international plan  to solve the problem of Palestinian refugees in the diaspora, a  solution that provides for settling these refugees living in  Syria, Egypt, and Jordan, where they are now, and for  distributing the Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon.</p>

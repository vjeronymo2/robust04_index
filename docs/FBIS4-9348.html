			<p>BFN     [Text] Bilateral relations and common issues related to  our integration in the European structures were discussed at the  22 April meeting between Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav  Daskalov and Eduard Kukan, foreign minister of the Slovak  Republic.    I was surprised to learn that the trade exchange between  Bulgaria and Slovakia is shamefully small, and we agreed to  encourage contacts between businessmen from the two countries,  our foreign minister said. He said that it is necessary to  review the contractual-legal basis between Bulgaria and Slovakia  and sign a trade agreement in May.</p>

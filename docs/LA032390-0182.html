			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RESTORED SISTINE CHAPEL UNVEILED BY VATICAN  </P> <P> The Vatican today unveiled a multimillion-dollar restoration -- paid for by a  Japanese television network -- of one of the world's greatest art treasures,  the ceiling Michelangelo painted for the Sistine Chapel.  </P> <P> For the first time in hundreds of years visitors will see the whole mammoth  fresco in its original dazzling colors, freed from four centuries of dust and  candle smoke.  </P> <P> The Renaissance master took more than 30 years between 1508 and 1541 to paint  the story of how God created the world and chased Adam and Eve from paradise.  </P> <P> Asked if the end result put to rest a bitter controversy over whether the  $3-million, 10-year restoration damaged the frescoes, project director Fabrizio  Mancinelli told a news conference:  </P> <P> "We don't want to enter into controversy. We did our best, and now we will  explain what we did with an international conference of experts in Rome."  </P> <P> Smoke from the candles, braziers and torches lighting papal services and  conclaves to choose a new Pope dulled Michelangelo's work over the centuries.  </P> <P> An exhibition on the restoration, which Pope John Paul II will open Saturday,  boasts a life-size copy of one section that shows how Michelangelo, standing on  a platform, had to paint huge, distorted figures to make them look lifelike  from below.  </P></p>

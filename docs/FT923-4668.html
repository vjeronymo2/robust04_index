			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / International Company News: Heineken sees steady growth HEINEKEN, Europe's leading brewer, has announced a 17.4 per cent rise in first-half profit before extraordinary income from Fl 168m to Fl 197.7m (Dollars 125m). The group expects a 'markedly higher' 1992 result, compared with the Fl 410m achieved in 1991, but cautions that its full-year growth rate will 'probably not' exceed 12 per cent. Turnover advanced by 9.3 per cent to Fl 4.59bn, due mainly to higher sales volume, especially of premium and non-alcohol beers, but also better average selling prices. Europe was the biggest growth market geographically but beer demand has not yet regained the high level seen before the Gulf war, and consumer behaviour remains 'cautious'. Despite a big rise in marketing outlays, overall cost growth was 9.1 per cent to Fl 4.25bn. Heineken's net profit advanced 39 per cent to Fl 235m, helped by Fl 37m in extraordinary income stemming from the sale of property in Singapore. A further Fl 25m income is expected in the second half. There were no one-off gains in the first half last year. Trading profit, which excludes income from unconsolidated shareholdings and interest charges, was up 12.2 per cent from Fl 298m to Fl 334m. The first-half result was flattened by charges in connection with restructuring the loss-making Spanish operation, El Aguila. Heineken is to pay an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 1.50 per share.</p>

			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Low wages 'paid by third of employers' NEARLY one in three employers are illegally underpaying their staff, according to a report from the Low Pay Unit based on the 1991 figures from the government's Wages Inspectorate. The Low Pay Unit, an independent research group, found that of about 18,000 employers visited by government inspectors last year, nearly 6,000 were underpaying staff. Only 15 employers were prosecuted. Mr Chris Pond, director of the Low Pay Unit, said: 'The Wages Inspectorate, which has responsibility for enforcing minimum wage legislation, is being whittled away. There are now only 64 inspectors to check the wages of nearly 2.5m employees, compared with 177 in 1979.' He said proposals to abolish the Wages Councils, which set wages in some low-paid industries, would legitimise 'criminally low wages' and leave the UK alone in Europe with no minimum wage protection. The latest underpayment figures represent a 15 per cent increase on 1990. The Low Pay Unit says the worst offenders are employers in the retail food sector. Cafe and snack bars also had a poor record, followed by restaurants, hotels, pubs, clothing factories and shoe repairers. It's a Crime. The New Review, No 17.

In his view, local conflicts could grow  into an all-out war throughout that region.    Shanibov feared that a Kabardino-Balkarian problem might  emerge on top of the Abkhazian, Ossetian-Ingush, Chechen and  Ossetian-Georgian troubles. He accused Sergey Filatov, the  Russian president's chief of staff, of having inspired the  decree on steps to rehabilitate the Balkarian people issued by  Valeriy Kokov, the president of the Kabardino-Balkarian Republic  (KBR). The decree called for reinstatement of two Balkarian  districts that had been abolished in 1944. Shanibov felt that  the decree might revive KBR's territorial claims on parts of  Northern Ossetia and the Stavropol Territory.    On the other hand, Shanibov believed that those who did not  want war and supported Abkhazia and the CCP to an extent were  gaining influence in the Russian leadership.    He said that the CCP intended to establish contacts with the  West and international organizations with a view to obtaining  their aid in resolving the North Caucasian problems.</p>

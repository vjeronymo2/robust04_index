"The  fight will take place in a tent-like structure specially insulated from the  wind."  </P> <P> Leonard, 33, ended his retirement last Nov. 7 by stopping Donny Lalonde for the  WBC middleweight and super-middleweight titles. Leonard relinquished the  middleweight title now held by Duran, 38.  </P></p>

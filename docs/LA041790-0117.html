			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BIGGEST BABY SHOWER' TARGETS SMOKING  </P> <P> Later this spring, the American Lung Assn.'s Los Angeles chapter again will  sponsor the "World's Biggest Baby Shower" to alert young pregnant women to  smoking's dangers.  </P> <P> "It's a creative approach," says Ron Arias of the ALA.  </P> <P> "You're dealing with a very hard-to-reach group. It's an economic and  educational problem more than anything."  </P> <P> Statistics bear that out: 20% to 40% of all women who become pregnant are  smokers and only about 25% stop during pregnancy, experts say. The potential  health consequences for these women and their babies are severe:  </P> <P> * According to a 1989 Swedish study, women who smoke during pregnancy increase  the risk of a late miscarriage by 40%.  </P> <P> * Smoking while pregnant appears to increase the risk of Sudden Infant Death  Syndrome. More than 2,500 deaths of infants under the age of 1 could be  attributed to smoking by the mother, reports the U.S. Centers for Disease  Control.  </P> <P> * A pregnant women who smokes two packs a day reduces the oxygen supply to her  fetus by 25%, the lung association reports.  </P> <P> According to Dr. Kenneth Kizer of the State Department of Health Services,  however, pregnant women who stop smoking early in the pregnancy have a good  chance to stay off cigarettes.

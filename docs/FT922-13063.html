			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / The men Kinnock blames Kelvin McKenzie The Sun His views were made known in a typically trenchant manner yesterday. An aide said the claim that the press cost Mr Kinnock his election victory was an insult to the 14m people who voted Conservative. The Sun says today that the difference between it and Mr Kinnock is that its message is 'one of good humour' and his 'one of vindictiveness'. Sir Nicholas Lloyd Daily Express He dismissed Mr Kinnock's remarks about the press as 'a case of sour grapes'. He said Mr Kinnock had not mentioned the vitriolic campaign mounted against Mr John Major by the Daily Mirror. Sir Nicholas added: 'He doesn't mention The Guardian, The Independent - or the Financial Times, which advised its readers to vote Labour.' Sir David English Daily Mail 'The Mail is a campaigning Tory newspaper which examined very closely the weaknesses of the Labour position and made sure our readers knew about them. To suggest, as Mr Kinnock has done, that the Daily Mail single-handedly won the election for the Conservatives . . . ascribes far more influence to us than we would give ourselves.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Robert Shrimsley report: "Major Told To Stand Firm Over EC </F> Voting"]    [Text] Mr Major was told last night that he should  surrender his plans for enlargement of the European Community  rather than weaken Britain's power to block unwanted legislation  from Brussels.    As Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary, prepares for a  key  meeting in Brussels tomorrow to thrash out a deal on the voting  rights row, he faced growing demands from traditional loyalists  as well as the Right wing of the party to resist compromising.    Such views were echoed yesterday by Mr Michael Portillo,  Chief Secretary to the Treasury, who said the British people did  not want to be "swept along" by the rising European tide.  Senior party sources predicted that Mr Major would contact Mr  Kohl, the German Chancellor, before tomorrow's meeting to urge  him to come to Britain's aid.    Other EC nations insist that the four new recruits, Austria,  Norway, Sweden and Finland, can be allowed to join only if  Britain accepts that the number of votes needed to block new  legislation must rise accordingly, from 23 votes to 27.    They argue that the blocking majority has always been 30  percent of the votes, and with four new members that  necessitates a rise from 23 to 27. This would mean that Britain  could no longer count on blocking new laws with the support of  just one other large nation and one smaller one.    A fourth nation would now be needed for a veto under the  Qualified Majority Voting system. EC leaders said yesterday  that Britain would have to compromise if it wanted enlargement,  a policy Britain has championed, to be approved .    Mr Leo Tindemans, President of the European People's Party,  said the European Parliament, which has to approve the new  rules, would "never accept" enlargement unless the required  majority was increased to 27. However, the Government's room  for manoeuvre seems limited. A growing number of MPs not  traditionally identified as Euro-rebels say a compromise would  be difficult to accept .    A Conservative Central Office survey of Tory activists  showed  a majority of three to one against reducing British powers and a  majority actually in favour of increasing them.    Mr Kenneth Baker, former party chairman, said on BBC's On  the  Record, that if Britain held firm, enlargement would not be  sacrificed, "it would merely be a postponement." Mr David  Howell, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, added  that with the greater volume of legislation from Brussels the  voting threshold should actually be tightened, "to prevent this  unwelcome volume of measures being pushed on unwilling  minorities."    Even Sir Peter Hordern, the staunchly loyal head of the  backbench European Affairs Committee, said the situation had to  remain where two major countries could effectively block  legislation. The compromise cooling-off period of one or two  months was "neither here nor there."    Mr Portillo, speaking on the BBC's Frost programme, said he  did not believe enlargement was in danger because all member  countries saw it as a "great prize." The idea "that this whole  thing is going to sink on British obduracy is really an  invention," he added.    The Government had never considered enlargement "as being a  reduction of each country's power and each country's weight."    The Government's difficulties were played up by Mr John  Smith, the Labour Leader, in a speech in Birmingham yesterday,  when he said the Tories, with "their narrow vision and low  ambition for the country," were sacrificing British interests  for the sake of party unity.    The Government's posturing was a political manoeuvre "to  keep  the Tory Euro-sceptics happy."</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS AT LOS ANGELES ZOO  </P> <P> The Greater Los Angeles Zoo Assn. believes The Times was right on target in its  editorial ("Wanted: A Zoo, Not a Pigsty," Sept. 15) calling for a fresh  approach to the management of the zoo. This seems a viable solution to the  chronic problems of the sort that came to light and will continue to plague the  zoo operations under the current administrative setup.  </P> <P> Our organization, a nonprofit association made up of some 135,000 volunteers  and an administrative staff of 47 professionals, also supports Mayor Tom  Bradley and Councilmen John Ferraro and Joel Wachs in their demands for an  investigation.  </P> <P> GLAZA, which is responsible for the zoo's animal acquisitions, fund-raising,  concessions, membership, capital improvement projects, and conservation,  educational and public support programs, has been frustrated for some time by  the arrangement under which the zoo is now run. Under the city's current  system, coordination between GLAZA, the zoo director and the city's Recreation  and Parks Department, which oversees the zoo's housekeeping functions, is very  difficult. This dissipates the strength and frustrates the goals of all  concerned.  </P> <P> We have thoroughly researched and long advocated an approach such as The Times  suggests, with management "transferred from Recreation and Parks to a private  nonprofit zoological society like the one that runs the Bronx Zoo in New York  and the San Diego Zoo."  </P> <P> The great zoos of the world today are vastly different from their counterparts  of a generation ago. Animals are treated more humanely and with greater regard  for their needs. They are housed in habitats more closely resembling their  natural state. The emphasis is less on entertainment and more on informing  people about their world and natural environment in ways no book or classroom  can.  </P> <P> THOMAS R. TELLEFSEN  </P> <P> Chairman, GLAZA Board of Trustees  </P></p>

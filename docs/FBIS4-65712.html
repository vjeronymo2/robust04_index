			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 19 (AFP) -- A plan to restructure the  European steel industry by reducing capacity and shedding 50,000  jobs has collapsed because of disputes over subsidies for  Italian plants.    The plan by the Commission of the European Union [EU] was  well and truly dead because it had proved impossible to reach a  minimum figure for the reduction of productive capacity,  Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said here Thursday [19  May].    It would be impossible to achieve cuts of 19 million tonnes  per year in the capacity to produce rolled steels.    State-owned and private firms had promised to close  factories  with capacity amounting to 11 million tonnes, he said.    The plan had been launched by industry ministers from the 12  EU countries in February 1993 to put the industry, which has  been hard hit by a fall of prices, on a competitive footing. It  would also have led to the loss of at least 50,000 jobs.    Van Miert and Commissioner Martin Bangemann, who is  responsible for industry, were obstructed by the problem of the  Bresciani, the small Italian steel manufacturers in the region  of Brescia in northern Italy.    They had agreed to remove capacity to produce five million  to  six million tonnes on condition that they could receive aid of  415 million ECUs (477 million dollars) from the Italian state.  But all such aid must be approved by the commission.    Van Miert had asked the rest of the commission to accept  what  was termed a "flexible interpretation" of EU regulations  concerning state aid so that capacity could be cut quickly  towards the figure of 19 million tonnes.    But a majority of the commission rejected this.    The decision that the plan is now dead throws into question  social, financial and commercial measures which were to have  been part of the scheme. They were intended to protect  companies while they restructured.    Funds would have been available for the re-training of  workers who lost their jobs, and imports of steel from central  and east Europe, and particularly from the Czech Republic, would  have been restricted temporarily.    Van Miert said that these measures were no longer justified.    The commission had also authorised industrialists to  establish financial arrangements to help each other. This was  never used.    Ministers from EU countries are to study the situation at a  special meeting in June.    The 12 EU countries approved plans for reductions of  capacity  by six subsidised companies, among them Ilva of Italy, SCI of  Spain and EKO-Stahl of Germany, on December 18, 1993, after many  difficulties.    But private or non-subsidised producers held that the  agreement was unbalanced since it approved public subsidies  totalling 6.7 billion ECUs in respect of cuts in production  capacity of 5.5 million tonnes.    These unsubsidised producers have since shown reluctance to  close plants, fearing that in so doing they would hand market  share to their competitors.</p>

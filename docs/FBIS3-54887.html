			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature by Dmitriy </F> Voskoboynikov, Igor Porshnev, Vitaliy Trubetskoy and others]    [Text] Russia's Foreign Ministry is not inclined to "react  in earnest" to the numerous declarations of the former chairman  of Lithuania's parliament and now right-wing opposition leader,  Vytautas Landsbergis. To argue with him is as pointless as with  the Liberal Democratic Party leader, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, said  a high-ranking Russian diplomat dealing with Baltic problems in  comments on recent statements by Landsbergis concerning  relations with Russia.    Speaking at a recent news conference in Vilnius, Landsbergis  criticized the present Lithuanian leadership for its "policy of  rapprochement with the East."    According to Landsbergis, "the last few months fully  revealed  the aggressive nationalism of Russia, whose policy had been  identical to that of Zhirinovskiy, who only speaks more openly."    "Such escapades by Landsbergis are no longer surprising,"  said the Russian diplomat. "They have become so biased and  subjective, that they can hardly be taken seriously, even in  Lithuania itself," he said.    According to the diplomat, Vilnius' current foreign policy  is  aimed only at normalizing relations with all countries,  including Russia, and not at rapprochement with the East. From  this point of view he noted "certain achievements gained by  Lithuania's present leadership." "Neighboring countries should  live in peace and cooperate on a mutually-beneficial basis.  This is an axiom, and to dispute it is senseless," the diplomat  said.    According to him, "what motivates Landsbergis is largely  political jealousy, since Lithuania's current president,  Algirdas Brazauskas, has managed to achieve in the  foreign-policy area much of what the right-wing radicals failed  to achieve during their stay in power."</p>

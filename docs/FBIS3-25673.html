Colonel Saykagepo Kortor, deputy chief of the AFL  intelligence service, was arrested along with his three  bodyguards and driver, who was released, the interim government  defense minister disclosed. According to the driver, the four  soldiers were arrested after going through the last checkpoint  manned by the African peacekeeping force in Liberia, Economic  Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group  [ECOMOG], in the Firestone plantation, which marks the entrance  into an NPFL-controlled zone.    This arrest occurs at a time when the disarmament of the  Liberian armed factions is scheduled to start in less than two  weeks, in accordance with a new agreement signed last week in  Monrovia between the main factions in the Liberian conflict --  the interim government, the NPFL, and the United Liberation  Movement for Democracy in Liberia [ULIMO]. IGNU has called on  ECOMOG and the UN military observers "to ensure the safety and  release of the AFL soldiers." For its part, ULIMO has issued an  ultimatum to NPFL to release Col. Kortor and his men "within 48  hours" or face "reprisals."</p>

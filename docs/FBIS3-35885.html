Vytautas Landsbergis told reporters Monday [31 January] that  consultants from NATO could have been invited to Lithuania  during the signing of the Partnership for Peace program, to  reflect on whether Lithuania is safe or not, confronted with  Russia's current policy and certain statements of Belarus. The  opposition leader said such a visit would enhance Lithuania's  security.    Landsbergis said Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas'  speeches in the West were very cautious and expressed a position  on "joint movement" that is soothing to Russia. He said the  president's thoughts about a security zone from Vancouver to  Vladivostok "resembles explanations by the Russian foreign  minister that Partnership for Peace is a Russian, not an  American idea."</p>

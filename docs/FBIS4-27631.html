			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Although it is Turkmenistan President Saparmurad  Niyazov's first visit to Malaysia, considerable headway was  achieved in ties with Malaysia. The five bilateral agreements  signed in various fields are vital as they will pave the way to  enhance two-way cooperation. This is all the more significant  as the breakaway Soviet Union state only achieved independence  three years ago.    Therefore, there is much the Central Asian nation can learn  from Malaysia. As can be seen from the deteriorating situation  in Russia, the transition towards a market-based economy is not  all that easy. It is important that the right economic policies  and development strategies are in place. To this end, Malaysia  is ready to offer its expertise wherever it is possible in the  spirit of South-South cooperation.    With a population of 4.2 million people, Turkmenistan is  rich  in oil and gas reserves, minerals, cotton, and chemical  properties. This provides excellent prospects for the  development of downstream activities -- an area where Malaysia  has excelled in. The national oil corporation Petronas can look  into tapping the oil and gas reserves besides looking to develop  petrochemicals in Turkmenistan. Other areas for potential joint  ventures include hotel construction, resort facilities, and  tourism. But the former Soviet state has to realize that  foreign investments do not flow into a country automatically.  It must work towards creating a conducive investment climate.  Red tape must be cut to a minimum. Bureaucracy has been a  major obstacle for cross-border investments.    This is often the case in developing countries. So far,  Turkmenistan's legislation which provides for foreign  investments is a step in the right direction. Its free economic  zones is yet another indicator that its investment strategy is  on the right track. Infrastructure facilities have to be well  in place, otherwise foreigners will be reluctant to invest. It  also has to realize that competition for the foreign investment  dollar is getting more intense. Also, its private sector has  yet to fully develop its potential.    There is much it can learn from Malaysia's success in  privatization. It is important that the development of private  enterprises is accompanied by social benefits. Otherwise a wide  cross section of the people will never taste the fruits of  economic development and might sow the seeds of discontent.  Malaysia is ready to offer training aid under the Malaysia  technical cooperation program in administration, banking, and  other fields. It has trained officers under this program from  numerous other developing nations. It forms part of Malaysia's  commitment towards transferring skills to South countries.    Turkmenistan's decision to establish an embassy in Malaysia  marks a major step in building a concrete bridge towards  enhancing two-way contacts at the highest level. This would go  a long way in bringing bilateral links to a more significant  level.    Niyazov's visit, which comprises a high-powered delegation,  indicates the importance the country places in its relationship  with Malaysia. The visit has also opened a new chapter in what  is potentially a mutually beneficial and long-lasting  relationship between Malaysia and Turkmenistan.</p>

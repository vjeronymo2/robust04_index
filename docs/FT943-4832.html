			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (4): The bay gets busy - Cardiff Property Delight - mixed with some relief - swept through the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation in July when Nippon Electric Glass of Japan and Schott Glaswerke of Germany announced they would locate a 500,000 sq ft new plant costing Pounds 200m near the city's waterfront. Delight that one of Britain's biggest inward investment schemes this year, creating up to 750 jobs over five years in a high technology industry making glass components for the television industry, was coming to the area; relief that after a long gap a 'headline' scheme had been attracted against international competition, possibly opening the way for other companies to follow. Cardiff Bay's biggest successes to date - headquarters buildings for NCM, a credit insurer, and for the Welsh Health Common Services Agency - were announced in 1992. Both buildings will be occupied shortly. Though there have been other developments, including a relocation by Axa, the French insurance group, to a 44,000 sq ft building, Meridian Gate, on the fringes of the area, a new supermarket by Tesco on the Penarth side of the bay, and Techniquest, a Pounds 7.5m science centre due to open next year, the weak economic environment of the past few years has put a brake on the hoped-for relocations . Yet the measured pace at which the huge area - a total of 2,700 acres, equivalent to one-sixth the size of Cardiff itself - has been attracting development, may turn out to be an advantage. In London docklands development took place ahead of infrastructure, a mistake which Cardiff, with its ambitious target of attracting Pounds 2.5bn over a 10-15 year timescale, has been able to avoid. The centrepiece - a two-thirds of a mile long barrage which will impound a 500-acre lake and help to create an eight-mile waterfront - was started in February, and is expected to be completed in 1998. The peripheral distributor road which will take traffic through the bay has been largely completed from the west and will emerge from a tunnel section into the heart of the bay area by the end of the year. Another section taking traffic east to connect with the M4 should be completed before the end of the decade. Other parts of the jigsaw, creating a mixed-use development in an area which offers outstanding waterfront opportunities and also takes in Cardiff's docklands and older industrial areas, are being put in place. On the site of former car scrapyards Wilson Bowden, the Midlands developer, plans a Pounds 50m retail and leisure scheme, including Pounds 10m worth of infrastructure; TBI, a local development joint venture, has recently started the first phase of a 140,000 sq ft speculative industrial scheme; housing schemes, including the provision of some social housing and involving local and national groups such as Beazer, Wimpey and Barratt are going ahead at various sites; and Associated British Ports' property arm, Grosvenor Waterside, is hoping to put a 100,000 sq ft new office development, Scott Harbour, out to tender shortly, for a 1995 start. The development - for which at least a partial pre-let is being sought - will be available to a single occupier, or split into up to five units of 10,000 sq ft or more. The shape of the area around the old Pier Head, now called the inner harbour, is also becoming clear. Next to ABP's south Wales docks office a new hotel is planned, together with an opera house, the design for which is now being selected from a shortlist of eight. It is hoped the opening next year of a silver service Harry Ramsden fish restaurant will encourage the growth of a food quarter like those in Boston and Baltimore in the US. An important issue, however, is the impact that work on this scale is going to have on the rest of Cardiff, and in particular whether the redeveloped bay will be a natural graft or present the existing city centre with a damaging rival. Demand for offices in Cardiff - the likely main determinant of the success or otherwise of the bay - has averaged in recent years around 200,000 sq ft a year. Though there is a substantial surplus of space in central Cardiff at present, much of it is in secondary locations and not high quality. Room for further expansion in the city centre is limited. However, demand remains relatively weak, and because of a narrowing of the once substantial gap between London and Cardiff rents - and an overhang of space in other provincial cities - relocations are unlikely in the medium term to provide a significant boost to indigenous demand. Nevertheless, the concept is right, says Mr Peter Kelly, regional chairman of property agents, DTZ Debenham Thorpe. 'Cardiff needs a new business quarter. The city centre is full and the bay is already proving attractive to tenants.' Whether the two areas can grow together beneficially is going to depend also on the solution of transport problems. A big growth in office development in the bay area - soon likely to be employing more than 4,500 office workers - could lead to serious traffic congestion if adequate public transport is not put in place. Various studies have pointed to the need for a light rail system which could be linked to the extensive Cardiff suburban and valleys rail network. Decisions have yet to be taken, however, in part because of the lack of an overall transport planning authority for the region and the likely cost. There is another physical constraint which the bay planners have been seeking to overcome. Cardiff is bisected by the main London railway line, to the south of which the bay area lies. There are plans to give the city's main station a new southerly entrance and to create a large new square - the Bridge area - which would link the two parts of the city but design of this scheme has proved difficult. Delays also seem likely on another city-bay connector, the broad avenue to run both sides of the rail link into the docks. Nevertheless, the Cardiff bay authorities are confident the problems can be overcome, and a deadline may concentrate their minds. The corporation is due to wind up at the end of 1999, but, perhaps even more importantly March 1 is pencilled in as the opening date for the new opera house. For this to be a truly gala occasion, a grand entrance and and a matching backdrop will need to be in evidence.</p>

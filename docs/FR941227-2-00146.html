Anchor National, a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the State of California, is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc., a financial services company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Anchor National established the Separate Account on June 25, 1981, to fund variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. SunAmerica Capital Services, Inc. (``SEC''), the principal underwriter for certain of the existing Contracts, is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. SCS also is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of SunAmerica Inc. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.

The Contracts will provide for accumulation of contract values and payment of benefits on a variable basis. Fixed accumulation and/or payment options also may be available under the Contracts. (In the case of group Contracts, the term ``Contract,'' as used herein, will include a certificate issued to a participant in the group; the term ``Contract owner'' will include such a participant.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Finance and the Family: Just five days to pay - Bethan Hutton on the latest stage of rolling settlement Private investors have just under eight months to get used to the idea of paying for shares five days after buying them. The London Stock Exchange announced this week that T+5, the next stage of rolling settlement, would start on June 26 1995. The first stage of rolling settlement was introduced in July when the old stock exchange account periods were axed and replaced with the new system of settling share transactions 10 days later, known as T+10. The move to T+5 was planned originally for January but was postponed to allow market traders more time to adjust. The main pressure behind rolling settlement comes from the big institutions, which account for the bulk of dealing on the stock exchange. 'It will make life more difficult for the minority but I think it is inevitable. Wall Street is moving to T+3,' says Brian Tora, of private client stockbroker Greig Middleton. Paul Killik, senior partner at Killik &amp; Co., agrees. 'The dynamics of this are institutional and international - you cannot stop it. It is no good complaining.' The advent of T+5 will increase the pressure for changes in practices which started with T+10. 'We certainly think that T+5 is going to be difficult for a lot of private clients to meet,' says Tora. Selling is not such a problem, but he feels more investors will find their broker asking for payment up front before he will place an order. Tora adds: 'If you look at the pure mechanics of it, you are talking about phoning an order in and the contract note being issued which, at the very best, is going to arrive a day later, maybe even the day after that, depending on circumstances. 'Then the private client has to send the cheque, which will take another day, and that cheque is going to need three days to clear - so, effectively, the broker is going to be out of funds.' There is a growing tendency for brokers to charge interest on late payments but they are also working on other ways around this problem. Common solutions are to provide client banking facilities, so eliminating the time wasted sending cheques through the post, or to offer credit. Usually, this is done through margin trading where brokers lend clients money to buy shares on the security of shares they own already. Greig Middleton already has banking arrangements for its customers. 'Clients have a nominated deposit account: sales can be credited to that and purchases settled from it. Obviously, it makes life a lot easier,' says Tora. The firm is still working on its plans to offer margin trading. Similarly, Killik is hoping to have client banking and margin trading facilities in place in good time for T+5. T+5 will make nominee accounts for holding shares almost unavoidable, as the five-day system simply makes the physical sending of share certificates to and fro increasingly infeasible. More than 90 per cent of Killik's clients now use nominees, although Killik is still unhappy about some drawbacks of the system, such as the effect on communication between companies and shareholders. Most brokers say that the transition to T+10 was much smoother and caused fewer problems than they expected. They now hope that halving the settlement period will prove equally trouble-free.</p>

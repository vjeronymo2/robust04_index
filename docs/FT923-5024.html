			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Observer: Back on top With the appointment yesterday of Jacob Palmstierna as chairman of Nordbanken, Sweden's state-controlled bank, it looks as though his rehabilitation in Swedish banking society is complete. Palmstierna spent 30 years at Sweden's top commercial bank, the prestigious Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken. But his spell in the chief executive's seat was embarrassingly brief - both for him and S-E Banken. Only a few months after his appointment, he was investigated for tax fraud - a heinous crime in the eyes of the law-abiding Swedes - and decided to step down while the investigations were under way. In the end he was cleared of any irregularities but he did not get his old job back. Since then, he has been vice-chairman at Nordbanken, number two to Bjorn Wahlstrom, an industrialist with no banking experience who was brought in to shake up the bank. Wahlstrom did well turning round SSAB, the formerly state-controlled steel company, but has not been a great success at Nordbanken. With the benefit of hindsight it might have been better to have given Palmstierna the chairman's job in the first place.</p>

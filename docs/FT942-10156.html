			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Landlords call for repeal of lease law The British Property Federation, a landlords' association, has called on the government to repeal a law which gives tenants the right to renew leases at the end of their term. Mr Roger Carey, president of the federation, yesterday described the right as an 'anachronism', brought in to protect tenants at a time when property was scarce and tenants' awareness low. The federation's proposals are an attempt to improve the position of landlords if the government presses ahead with its intention to abolish privity of contract, a law that may make a former occupier of a building responsible for paying rent if a subsequent tenant defaults. The government is expected to back a private members bill abolishing privity of contract, which is due to be published later this month. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, has stated his support for the measure in relation to new leases. The bill is being brought forward by Mr Peter Thurnham, a Conservative MP, and is backed by the British Retail Consortium, which says privity of contract puts an unfair burden on commercial tenants. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said yesterday that an announcement on commercial property lease reform - the subject of a consultation paper - would be made 'as soon as possible'.</p>

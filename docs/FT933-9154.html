			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / A king and his people: Belgium's late monarch was a rare symbol of national identity Belgium as such seems to inspire little affection, in either of its main linguistic communities, I wrote in the Weekend FT of July 31. Bad timing. That very day King Baudouin died, and his death unleashed a great outpouring of national grief, in which, it seems, Dutch-speaking Flemings and French-speaking Walloons joined quite indiscriminately. In a country of only 10m people, hundreds of thousands queued outside the royal palace to file past his body. A cartoon in Le Monde showed Flemings and Walloons approaching the palace from different directions in separate queues, but emerging on the other side as a single, tearful cortege. That may be jumping quickly to conclusions, as the paper's correspondent admitted next day. 'It is too soon,' he wrote, 'to count the 'unitarists' and the 'separatists', since the latter could hardly show themselves at a funeral.' Certainly there is no easy way to tell how many of those who stayed at home in front of their TV sets approved the attitude of the Vlaams Blok, the Flemish separatist party, which did officially boycott the ceremonies; and even those who did feel a pang of respect for the dead king as a person were not necessarily transformed thereby into fervent Belgian patriots. But two conversations from my recent journey through Belgium came immediately to mind when I heard of the king's death. One was with an old family friend, completely non-political, who is herself very much a Walloon but had a Flemish mother. What's the future of this country, I asked, and her answer took me by surprise: 'Personally I doubt if it'll survive the present king. To my mind he's a kind of saint.' The other conversation was with a Belgian about as different from my friend as one could imagine: Mr Guido Sweron, director of the Flemish cultural centre in Fouron Saint-Martin (or, as he would prefer to call it, St Martens Voeren), one of six predominantly French-speaking villages that somehow got included in the Flemish province of Limburg back in 1962, and whose destiny has been a bone of contention in Belgian politics ever since. Mr Sweron is what the Walloons call un flaminguant. That is to say, he is not just Flemish but militantly so. In his office he keeps a large map showing practically the whole of eastern Belgium as the Duchy of Limburg, as indeed it was a few centuries ago. (Limbourg, the original seat of the duchy, is now in the heart of Wallonia, east and south of Liege.) He argues that the people of this area were all historically Flemings, but that those in the southern part have been forcibly Frenchified over the centuries to the point where they no longer properly understand their own identity; and he seems to think that this entitles, indeed obliges, the state to ignore what the inhabitants think about themselves now, at least until they have had a good dose of Flemish reindoctrination from people like himself. 'Belgium,' Mr Sweron said, 'doesn't make any sense any more: it's just kept alive for the king, and for some capitalistic powers - and for Brussels.' Poor old king, I remember thinking. Half his subjects believe he's a saint, keeping himself alive for Belgium's sake, while the other half think Belgium is only being kept alive to give him a job. But both seem to agree that, apart from him, or apart from the monarchy, there is precious little of Belgium left. Only the royal family now escapes the otherwise absolute division of the country into linguistic communities. No one else is allowed to be just Belgian. You have to be either French-speaking or Dutch-speaking (unless you belong to the tiny German minority on the eastern frontier); it is in that capacity that you vote, receive education, and even serve in the armed forces. I asked Mr Sweron whether the real aim of Flemings who thought like him was to reverse the 1830 revolution, which brought Belgium into existence, and reunite the Dutch-speaking part of the country with Holland. 'No,' he said. 'It's not necessary for us to join Holland, or for them to join France. We thought the solution was to get a federation here in Belgium but, since we are building a federation in Europe, if we give 40 per cent of the power to Europe and 40 per cent to ourselves (ie, to the provinces) it's not worth keeping Belgium just for 20 per cent.' So there you have it. Behind Belgium's enthusiasm for a federal Europe lurks the hope of Flemings and Walloons that it will enable them to do away with Belgium altogether. Which leads me to think there might be a connection, if only at an unconscious level, between the wave of emotion that greeted King Baudouin's death and the crisis of the European exchange rate mechanism, which happened the same weekend. Perhaps, in expressing their grief at the loss of a monarch who had become almost the only remaining embodiment of Belgian national identity, the Belgians were reacting to the discovery that a federal Europe is not after all just round the corner. Perhaps some of them are thinking that a nation-state, even a rather artificial bilingual one, may have its uses for a while longer. Personally I hope so. I like Belgium. Bilingualism, which many Belgians find irksome, strikes me as something to be envied. The interplay of Gallic and Flemish culture in the Low Countries has been going on for a thousand years or more, and has produced some of Europe's greatest art. Complete separation on linguistic lines would be a sad way for it to end.</p>

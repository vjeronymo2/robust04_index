			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Trade deficit with non-EC countries widens BRITAIN'S TRADE deficit with countries outside the European Community widened sharply last month, raising fears about structural problems in the economy as it emerges from the recession. The visible trade deficit deteriorated by Pounds 274m in February to Pounds 1.3bn, the second-biggest monthly deficit on record. The value of imports and exports reached record highs. The seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that import prices rose 2.25 per cent in February against a 0.5 per cent rise in export prices. The most widely used measure of underlying trends showed that while import and export volumes reached record highs, imports continued to grow faster than exports on a three-monthly basis. The trade deficit was expected to rise for a while after devaluation because of the higher cost of imports. But yesterday's figures showed that import volumes excluding oil and erratic items such as aircraft and precious stones have also risen. They rose 6 per cent in the past three months compared with the three months to November. Exports rose 4.5 per cent in the same period. Although the fall in the pound has made foreign goods more expensive the trend continued last month. Underlying import volumes rose 3.2 per cent from the previous month compared with a 1 per cent increase in underlying exports. The higher import volumes may reflect a rise in economic activity as manufacturers increase orders for foreign components and raw materials. The poor performance of non-EC trade comes in spite of the improving economic outlook in north America. The value of exports to the US and Canada rose 8.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the three months to November, but imports in the same period rose 22 per cent. The balance of trade with north America was nonetheless healthier than a year ago. The deficit with Western Europe excluding the EC also widened. Import values rose 13 per cent in the latest three months compared with export growth of 5 per cent. Mr Robert Lind, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'Strengthening economic recovery in North America compares with dismal recessionary forces in the major EC economies. We might have expected the UK's trade performance with countries outside the EC to have reflected this.' The figures show that export growth has been concentrated in basic materials in recent months, although the CSO pointed out that this mainly reflected a large consignment of industrial diamonds that left the country in February. Export volumes of manufactured goods rose 3 per cent in the three months to the end of February compared with the previous three months. The deficit in oil narrowed to Pounds 110m in February compared with Pounds 135m in January. The erratics deficit deteriorated to Pounds 320m from Pounds 128m and as a result the underlying visible trade deficit, which excludes both oil and erratics, also widened to Pounds 904m from Pounds 797m in January.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VALUE OF TRADE WITH NON-EC COUNTRIES Balance of payments basis seasonally adjusted (Pounds m)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       Ex oil                                                  and erratics*              Exports   Imports   Balance   Exports   Imports   Balance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991          44,477    53,884    -9,407    38,289    45,252    -6,963 1992          46,573    56,510    -9,937    40,522    48,187    -7,665 1992 Q1       11,288    13,618    -2,330     9,832    11,550    -1,718 Q2            11,641    13,898    -2,257    10,106    11,820    -1,714 Q3            11,556    13,678    -2,122    10.048    11,676    -1,628 Q4            12,088    15,316    -3,228    10,536    13,141    -2,605 1992 Aug       3,834     4,532      -698     3,307     3,890      -583 Sep            3,835     4,527      -692     3,362     3,904      -542 Oct            4,021     4,828      -807     3,470     4,174      -705 Nov            3,968     5,045    -1,077     3,454     4,314      -860 Dec            4,099     5,443    -1,344     3,612     4,652    -1,040 1993 Jan       4,345     5,405    -1,060     3,764     4,561      -797 Feb            4,425     5,759    -1,334     3,826     4,730      -904  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Defined as ships, aircraft and precious stones.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

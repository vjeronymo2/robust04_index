			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions The sale of almost 8.5m shares in Berisford International at 120p by the Chicago-based Pritzker family looks curious, given that they were trading at almost double that a short time later. The Pritzkers apparently were keen to crystalise a capital loss to offset huge gains on other investments. Rodney Olsen, finance director of Cable &amp; Wireless, the international telecommunications group, has sold 60,000 shares at 533p. C&amp;W's share price has been under some pressure since, partly due to an anticipated fall in revenue from ending higher-rate morning calls. Sir Ernest Harrison has been raising cash on a large scale. He sold 100,000 shares at 400p in Chubb Securities and 75,000 Vodafone shares at 577p. Both companies were part of the Racal empire before they were de-merged and Sir Ernest remains chairman of both. Shares of GWR Group, the radio company have outperformed the market by more than 120 per cent in the past year and Lord Stokes, a non-executive director, has sold 25,000 at 931p, a significant reduction in his holding.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  No of Company                   Sector        Shares       Value   directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Berisford Intl              BM&amp;M     8,462,500      10,155          2 Boot (Henry)&amp; Sons          BCon         4,000          14          1 Border Television           Mdia        11,000          20          1 Cable &amp; Wireless            Tele        60,000         320          1 Cater Allen                 OthF         2,838          18          1 Chillington Corp            OS&amp;B     1,350,000         540          1 Chubb Security              SSer       100,000         400          1 Denman's Electrical         Dist         3,300          18          1 Excalibur Group             Eng        800,000         364          1 Gibbon Lyons                Chem        25,000          17          1 Grampian Holdings           Phar        14,000          25          1 Greenacre Group             Hlth       125,000          18          1 GT Japan Inv Tst            InvT        14,680          43          1 GWR Group                   Mdia       166,436       1,403          4* Halma                       Eng          5,700          15          1 Ibstock Johnsen             BM&amp;M        13,448          12          1 Jones &amp; Shipman             Eng         40,000          11          1 London Scottish Bnk         OthF       201,000         239          3 Marks &amp; Spencer             RetG         5,028          22          1 Rank Organisation           L&amp;Hl         2,148          23          1 Rolfe &amp; Nolan Comptr        SSer         4,000          93          2 Savills                     Prop     1,913,999       1,740          8 Smith (DS)                  PP&amp;P        60,000         300          1 Smith (WH)'A' share         RetG       114,226         577          2 South Wales Elec            Elec         3,978          32          1 Southern Water              Watr        20,000         134          1* Stirling Group              Text        75,000          47          1 Vodafone                    Tele        75,000         433          1 West Trust                  FdMa       100,000          45          1 Wood (JD)                   Prop        60,000          63          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bullough                    Eng         10,000          18          1 Cakebread Robey             BM&amp;M        40,000          20          1 Cakebread Robey             BM&amp;M       179,568          90          1 Danka Business Syst         EE&amp;E         5,000          17          1 Elliot (B) (CCR)            Eng         10,000          13          1 Excalibur Group             Eng        100,000          46          1 Gibbs Mew                   Brew         2,600          10          1 Hogg Group                  Insu        15,000          21          3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Moscow and Washington Trying to </F> Work Out Unified Position on Korean Crisis"]    [Text] Pyongyang's statement that it is quitting the  International Atomic Energy Agency, sharply exacerbating the  situation on the Korean Peninsula, leaves Russia and the United  States facing the need to work out a unified position so as to  counter Kim Il-song's nuclear blackmail more effectively.    Tuesday's phone call between Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton  was mainly devoted to the Korea crisis. Judging by the  statement made by the Russian president after the conversation,  the Moscow and Washington positions are now essentially similar  [sushchestvenno sblizilis]. The United States, as Yeltsin put  it, no longer objects to the Russian idea, put forward a few  months ago, of holding an international conference on Korea.  The Kremlin, for its part, has agreed to discuss at this forum  the question of introducing sanctions against the DPRK -- U.S.  diplomats are insisting on on the need for them.    The Korean problem will be one of the main points on the  agenda for the talks to be held very shortly between Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher. The exact date is not yet known. President  Yeltsin had gotten somewhat heated and told journalists that  Kozyrev would be flying to Brussels to meet with his U.S.  colleague virtually tomorrow. But it transpired that the  secretary of state has a Near East tour planned and will only be  able to see the Russian minister once it is over.    As of the morning of 15 June the Russian Foreign Ministry  and  the State Department had not yet coordinated the question of a  timetable for the forthcoming meeting.    IZVESTIYA was told by Kozyrev's entourage that, apart from  the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the minister and  secretary of state plan to discuss preparations for the Russian  president's visit to the United States, scheduled for September.</p>

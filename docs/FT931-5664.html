			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Hurd backs UN chief on Yugoslavia MR Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, yesterday endorsed the view of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that United Nations troops may have to use force to implement an agreement in former Yugoslavia. However, Mr Hurd emphasised that it would be impossible to impose a military solution in the absence of a negotiated settlement endorsed by all the warring parties. During his one-day visit to New York, Mr Hurd discussed the Balkans crisis with Mr Boutros Ghali and the UN and European Community mediators trying to complete a peace settlement. The question, said Mr Hurd, was how to implement an accord based on the proposals of the two mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, 'after that agreement had been reached'. The ideas that were taking shape after last Friday's Nato meeting were still a long way from 'receiving detailed definition,' he added. Asked if the new outbreak of fighting in Bosnia was a serious setback for the peacemaking process, Mr Hurd acknowledged that it was damaging but it only made the peace talks even more essential. Mr Hurd welcomed yesterday's US call for an emergency session of the Security Council. The council scheduled closed-door consultations last night that were expected to be followed by a statement aimed at halting the carnage in Bosnia. Meanwhile, in a speech in Antwerp yesterday, Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for external relations, raised the prospect of the European Community, the US and Russia using joint military force to bring an end to the conflict. Mr Van den Broek, formerly Dutch foreign minister, said the Yugoslav crisis had entered a crucial phase. Military intervention might be necessary to uphold a political settlement based on the Vance-Owen plan, or to impose a solution from the outside. 'In both scenarios Europe will face painful choices as to its military intervention,' said Mr Van den Broek. 'I believe that only a united front by the US, the European Community and Russia offers a chance of forcing the warring parties to make peace.' EC diplomats reacted cautiously to Mr Van den Broek's suggestion, pointing out that such decisions lay with member states, rather than the European Commission. A UK diplomat said Mr Van den Broek, a long-time hawk on Yugoslavia, was on 'dangerous ground' if he was threatening to impose an outside settlement. More than 50,000 troops might be needed to broker and enforce a truce.</p>

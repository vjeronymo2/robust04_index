For transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, the adjusted payout rate is determined by using the appropriate Table F, contained in paragraph (e)(6) of this section, for the section 7520 interest rate applicable to the transfer. If the interest rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the interest rate is below 4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The adjusted payout rate is determined by multiplying the fixed percentage described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(1)(i)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) by the factor describing the payout sequence of the trust and the number of months by which the valuation date for the first full taxable year of the trust precedes the first payout date for such taxable year. If the governing instrument does not prescribe when the distribution or distributions shall be made during the taxable year of the trust, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(a). In the case of a trust having a payout sequence for which no figures have been provided by the appropriate table, and in the case of a trust that determines the fair market value of the trust assets by taking the average of valuations on more than one date during the taxable year, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Period is a term of years <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the period described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(5) is a term of years, the factor that is used in determining the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is the factor under the appropriate adjusted payout rate in Table D in paragraph (e)(6) of this section corresponding to the number of years in the years. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors are provided in Table D, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the appropriate valuation date) of the property placed in trust by the factor determined under this paragraph. For purposes of this section, the valuation date is, in the case of an inter vivos transfer, the date on which the property is transferred to the trust by the donor. However, if an election is made under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b) to compute the present value of the charitable interest by use of the interest rate component for either of the 2 months preceding the month in which the date of transfer falls, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. In the case of a testamentary transfer under section 2055, 2106, or 2624, the valuation date is the date of death, unless the alternate valuation date is elected under section 2032, in which event, and within the limitations set forth in section 2032 and the regulations thereunder, the valuation date is the alternate valuation date. If the decedent's estate elects the alternate valuation date under section 2032 and also elects, under section 7520 and &sect;1.7520&hyph;2(b), to use the interest rate component for one of the 2 months preceding the alternate valuation date, the month so elected is the valuation date for purposes of determining the interest rate and mortality tables. If the adjusted payout rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the adjusted payout rate is less than 4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . D transfers $100,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust on January 1, 1990. The trust instrument requires that the trust pay 8 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st for a term of 12 years to D in quarterly payments (March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31). The section 7520 rate of January 1990 is 9.6 percent. Under Table F(9.6), the appropriate adjustment factor is .944628 for quarterly payments payable at the end of each quarter. The adjusted payout rate is 7.557 (8%&times;.944628). Based on the remainder factors in Table D, the present value of the remainder interest is $38,950.30, computed as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10  -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Factor at 7.4 percent for 12 years  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .397495  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Factor at 7.6 percent for 12 years  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .387314 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Difference  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .010181 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w117,d62 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER10JN94.003  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,10  -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Factor at 7.4 percent for 12 years  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .397495  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Less: Interpolation adjustment  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .007992 <!-- PJG 007 0162 intable --> n,s <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interpolated factor  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> .389503  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Present value of remainder interest:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=02 g=1 f=1 --> ($100,000&times;.389503)  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> $38,950.30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Period is the life of one individual <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the period described in &sect;1.664&hyph;3(a)(5) is the life of one individual, the factor that is used in determining the present value of the remainder interest for transfers for which the valuation date is after April 30, 1989, is the factor in Table U(1) in paragraph (e)(6) of this section under the appropriate adjusted payout. For purposes of the computations described in this paragraph, the age of an individual is the age of that individual at the individual's nearest birthday. If the adjusted payout rate is an amount that is between adjusted payout rates for which factors are provided in the appropriate table, a linear interpolation must be made. The present value of the remainder interest is determined by multiplying the net fair market value (as of the valuation date as determined in paragraph (e)(4) of this section) of the property placed in trust by the factor determined under this paragraph (e)(5). If the adjusted payout rate is between 4.2 and 14 percent, see paragraph (e)(6) of this section. If the adjusted payout rate is below 4.2 percent or greater than 14 percent, see &sect;1.664&hyph;4(b). The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> A, who will be 45 years old on February 19, 1990, transfers $100,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust on January 1, 1990. The trust instrument requires that the trust pay to A semiannually (on June 30 and December 31) 9 percent of the fair market value of the trust assets as of January 1st during A's life. The section 7520 rate for January 1990 is 9.6 percent. Under Table F(9.6), the appropriate adjustment factor is .933805 for semiannual payments payable at the end of the semiannual period. The adjusted payout rate is 8.404 (9%&times;.933805). Based on the remainder factors in Table U(1), the present value of the remainder interest is $11,098.00, computed as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

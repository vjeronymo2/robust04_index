			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> KILLER WHO WAS RULED INSANE DISAPPEARS  </P> <P> A woman declared insane after she killed her mother and slashed her daughter's  throat with a razor eight years ago has disappeared from the psychiatric  halfway house where she has lived since her release from a state mental  hospital.  </P> <P> Arlyne Louise Genger, 45, left Gateways Hospital in South-Central Los Angeles  Tuesday morning after she received permission to go to the bank. She never  returned, said Dr. Harry Goldberg, program director at the residential  community mental health facility.  </P> <P> Genger has lived at Gateway since June, when she was released from Patton State  Hospital. She was committed there in 1981 after admitting that on New Year's  Day, 1980, she stabbed her mother more than 20 times and cut her daughter's  throat and wrist with a razor. The attacks took place in the family's North  Hollywood apartment.  </P> <P> After a court battle last April, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge C. Bernard  Kaufman ruled on the basis of psychiatric testimony that Genger no longer was a  threat to the community and should take continued psychiatric treatment at a  halfway house with no physical restraints to keep patients on the premises.  </P></p>

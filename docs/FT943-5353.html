			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Computer spending 'grows 15%' UK companies have increased their spending on computer systems far beyond corporate projections of a year ago, says the annual Price Waterhouse information technology review. The development is a further reflection of rising business investment confidence. The review, based on a survey of 1,000 information technology executives, indicates that IT spending rose 15 per cent last year across the corporate sector, a sharp increase given the low inflation rate. At the beginning of 1993 executives were predicting a rise of only 0.2 per cent. Executives projected that their IT spending would fall 2.6 per cent this year, however. This raises doubts about the sustainability of the investment recovery, although Price Waterhouse notes that in recent years 'the panel has consistently underestimated the coming year's growth'. The mainly privatised utilities led the corporate sector last year, increasing their IT budgets by 15 per cent. They were followed by retailers (11 per cent) and financial services (11 per cent). The largest increases came in central and local government, where IT spending rose 20 per cent. The survey found IT spending to be closely tied to restructuring. Two-thirds of organisations claimed to have programmes in place, and 28 per cent of IT executives said they were themselves the 'main architect' of change in their organisation. The survey reflects the marked trend away from mainframe-based systems to new designs based on networks of personal computers and mid-range machines called 'servers', with 58 per cent of organisations claiming to have some form of client-server network. Other new technologies popular with the executives included document image processing, which was planned for introduction by half of the organisations, and new telecommunications services such as wireless or cable, planned by 46 per cent. The survey found telecoms costs down 9 per cent from 1992 in response to competition in the business market.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from the press center of the 2d Army </F> Corps in Celic]    [Excerpts] The quiet morning on 18 January turned into  hell for residents of the Celic region earlier this morning.  Shortly after 1000, members of the Nordic battalion arrived in  this area. Their arrival was immediately followed by shelling  of the settlements of Vrazici and [word indistinct] from the  direction of Brusnica. At the same time, infantry attacks were  launched on the northeast part of our commune, from the  direction of (?Siljes and Kupusanik), which was supported by  anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft guns. The infantry  attack was preceded by a strong artillery attack on the  settlements of Celic and Ratkovici. More than 40 122-mm  howitzer shells were fired from the direction of Markovac. In  addition to material damage, they also wounded (?four) people in  (?Celic). [passage omitted]    The last report we received refers to an attack on the  members of the Nordic battalion. As we were told, the chetnik  fired five [words indistinct] directly at the armored vehicles  of the Nordic battalion [words indistinct]. We do not have many  details of this attack, but it confirms best the hypocrisy of  the chetnik leader Karadzic, who promised that such incidents  would not happen.</p>

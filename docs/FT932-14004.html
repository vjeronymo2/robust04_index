			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queen's Awards For Export Achievement 1993: Strong tail winds from Canada - Short Brothers of Belfast SHORT BROTHERS of Northern Ireland, which has won its 16th export achievement award, has staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in the aerospace industry during the last five years. After more than 40 years in government ownership, the Belfast-based company and oldest established aircraft manufacturer in the world, was acquired in October 1989 by Bombardier, the Canadian aerospace and transport group. From a loss of Pounds 47m in 1988 it has returned to profit with earnings in its last two financial years of Pounds 26.5m and Pounds 28.5m respectively. Exports have doubled from Pounds 110m in 1988 to Pounds 224m last year while overall turnover has also doubled since 1988 to Pounds 392m last year. Since the company's privatisation and acquisition by the Bombardier group, about Pounds 200m has been invested in plant, machinery and facilities to improve quality and productivity as well as to reduce costs. The company says it has saved so far Pounds 35m as a result of its total quality programme launched six years ago. Shorts has now become the European arm of Bombardier's aerospace division which also includes Canadair, de Havilland and Learjet. The link with the Canadians has enabled Shorts to win new business on Canadair and Learjet regional and corporate aircraft. However, the latest export award was won by the company's Fokker division which manufactures and exports wings for the 100-seat Fokker 100 regional jet built by the Dutch group. Shorts' Fokker export business almost trebled over the past three years. Shorts has worked with Fokker and Deutsche Aerospace, which is acquiring this year a majority stake in the Dutch aircraft maker, for the past 28 years: first on the Fokker F-28 and since 1983 on the Fokker 100. The Belfast group has seen the delivery rates for Fokker 100 wing sets increase from 12 in 1988 to 61 last year. The company expects to expand its business with Fokker with the delivery of wing sets for the Dutch manufacturer's latest programme, the Fokker 70, a 70-80 seat derivative of the Fokker 100. Shorts, Northern Ireland's largest manufacturing company, also does extensive commercial aerospace business with Boeing of the US, Rolls-Royce and the International Aero Engine consortium. On the defence side, it has developed new products including the Starburst close air defence missile system and the S-1 multi arms trainer. Following the general trend in the aerospace industry, the company has also expanded its international partnerships. However, Shorts has not escaped the general slump in the world aerospace industry. The company, which currently employs about 8,500 people, announced last March plans to shed 665 jobs largely because of production cuts at its two big civil aircraft customers, Boeing and Fokker.</p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Efta group 'could play role in Emu': Bundesbank economist spells  out ideas on monetary union THE top economist at the German Bundesbank, Mr Otmar Issing, yesterday suggested that European monetary union (Emu) could go ahead with an inner core of European Community countries and a number of new members from the existing Efta group. He suggested that such a 'deepening' process involving only some of the EC member states need not be inherently contradictory to the process of 'enlarging' the Community. At the same time he urged what would appear to be a third tier of EC adherence to accommodate the emerging democracies of eastern Europe - by allowing them greater access to the EC market without full membership. Mr Issing, who is a full member of the Bundesbank's governing council and directorate, spelt out his ideas at a seminar on Europe organised by the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Bonn. His ideas do not reflect current German government policy. However, they do reflect the intellectual thinking about the long-term future of the EC taking place in the highest levels of the Bonn administration, faced with the growing uncertainty over the Maastricht treaty and European political and monetary union. He warned against greater institutional integration of the EC - known as 'deepening' - leading to more protectionism, by reinforcing the common rules of key sectors such as agriculture, industry, energy and steel, at the expense of outside competitors. That would lead to a form of 'fortress Europe,' he said. However, a deepening, in the form of monetary union involving only those member states capable of meeting the EC economic convergence criteria of strictly controlled inflation, public borrowing and budget deficits, could be seen as a move to 'preserve the existence of the Community'. On the one hand, that might mean the expulsion of the non-participating states from the 'centre of gravity' of the EC. On the other, by bringing in new member states capable of joining the monetary union straightaway (Mr Issing did not identify the obvious two, Austria and Switzerland), a new inner core of integrated states could be created. He said that such a core group could provide 'adequate internal stability'. As far as eastern Europe was concerned, he said it was essential not to exclude such countries as Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, but it was equally impossible for them to fulfil the full EC membership criteria in the near future.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Moves in ethnic market Businesses in Britain owned by ethnic minorities will have to work harder to develop new markets in future, according to a survey by Kingston University Small Business Research Centre. The ending of large-scale immigration and the move by many younger members of ethnic minorities out into the broader community to live and work will reduce the size of the 'captive' ethnic market, the researchers concluded. The study looked at three ethnic communities: Bangladeshi, Afro-Caribbean and Greek-Cypriot. Seventy-six businesses in London, Sheffield and Leeds took part. The Greek-Cypriots had gone furthest in breaking into the wider markets needed to develop mature, successful businesses, the study said. They also had the widest range of kinds of business. The Bangladeshis tended to be in low-profit, highly competitive markets with low-growth prospects such as restaurants, clothing manufacture and retailing. Compared with the other two groups, they operated in the narrowest range of enterprise. The Afro-Caribbean businesses were the smallest and the youngest and all had been set up after 1980. They were strongest in food manufacturing and non-professional services. Ethnic minority business owners were educationally well qualified compared with white small-business owners and the working population as a whole. Afro-Caribbeans were the best qualified and Bangladeshis the least. More than one-third of businesses were dependent on their own communities for more than 50 per cent of sales, with Afro-Caribbeans the most dependent. Some 45 per cent had used bank finance to get started and only 7 per cent reported being refused. Accountants were the main source of business advice. But trade associations and chambers of commerce were less popular and greater use was made of the assistance of family and friends. *Ethnic Enterprise and the High Street Bank by James Curran and Robert Blackburn.

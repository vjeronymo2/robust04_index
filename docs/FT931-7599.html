			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Giscard says utilities not for sale FRANCE'S big 'monopoly' utilities run no risk of being privatised, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of one of the centre-right opposition parties tipped to win next month's parliamentary election, said yesterday. All companies in the competitive sector could be privatised, Mr Giscard d'Estaing said, 'but there are no plans to privatise the big companies in a position of monopoly' in such areas as telecommunications, transport or energy. The ex-president of France thus removed the ambiguity left in his Democratic Union (UDF) party's recent joint programme with the Republican Assembly (RPR) Gaullists. This stated that 'all banks, insurance companies and enterprises in the competitive sector will be privatised', leaving undefined what the opposition considered 'non-competitive'. France Telecom, Electricite de France (EdF), and Gaz de France (GdF) are probably profitable enough to be sold, but have been used as instruments of industrial policy. Reacting to pressure from Brussels for a liberalised electricity market, EdF has commissioned a study of the privatisation of the UK electricity industry which is due to be unveiled here today. The study is expected to be critical of the British energy sell-off which, however, appears to have benefited the French utility. Out of its total 54.8bn kW/hours of power exports last year, EdF sold 17bn to the UK. Even while keeping utilities in state hands, Mr Giscard d'Estaing forecast that the stock market would be able to bear privatisation of the order of FFr40bn (Pounds 5bn) this year and FFr60bn in each of the two following years. Proceeds would be used to reduce public debt and taxes.</p>

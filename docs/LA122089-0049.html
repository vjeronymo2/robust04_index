			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> USC RECRUIT CONWAY SCORES 730 ON SAT  </P> <P> One of USC's top football recruits last season, quarterback Curtis Conway of  Hawthorne High School, scored 730 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test Nov. 4,  making him eligible to enroll at USC next fall.  </P> <P> After failing in four attempts to reach the SAT score of 700 required under the  NCAA's Proposition 48, Conway decided to sit out this fall in an effort to  retain his four years of athletic eligibility. USC did not accept players  ineligible under Prop. 48 this year.  </P> <P> Conway plans to enroll at El Camino College part time beginning next semester  and begin his college football career next fall. USC had told Conway that it  would honor its commitment to him if he passed the test.  </P> <P> "I have not been in school this fall," Conway said, who was the state 100-meter  champion last spring. "I have just been studying for the SAT test and working  construction this year."  </P> <P> Conway said he also plans to participate in track at USC. LONNIE WHITE  </P></p>

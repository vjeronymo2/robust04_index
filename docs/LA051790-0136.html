			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> An adult Boy Scout leader accused of molesting a 14-year-old Scout pleaded  innocent Wednesday to 12 felony counts against him.  </P> <P> Rodney Stark, 41, who was a Boy Scout volunteer for more than 20 years, will go  on trial July 3.  </P> <P> Stark is also a sixth-grade teacher at Black Mountain Middle School in Rancho  Penasquitos and has been employed by the Poway Unified School District since  1973. He is currently on a leave of absence.  </P> <P> About a dozen friends and supporters accompanied Stark to his arraignment  Wednesday before Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Penso said afterward that the trial is expected to  last two weeks, but could last longer depending on how many witnesses the  defense attorney calls.  </P> <P> Penso said she expects Lane Cooke, who is representing Stark, to call a number  of other Boy Scouts as witnesses to testify that they also went on camping  trips with Stark and were never molested. The boy testified at a preliminary  hearing several weeks ago that the alleged molestation took place on camping  trips.  </P> <P> Stark, who lives in Rancho Penasquitos, remains free on $15,000 bail posted  soon after his arrest in early March.  </P></p>

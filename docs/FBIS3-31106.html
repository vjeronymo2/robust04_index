			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, Feb 14 (AFP) -- UN General Michael Rose on  Monday [14 February] said he was determined to enforce a "total  exclusion zone" of heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital  Sarajevo, as an agreed arms handover ground to a halt.    Rose, commander of the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR) in  Bosnia, said all heavy weapons within 20 kilometres (12 miles)  of Sarajevo "will either come under UNPROFOR control or will be  subject to air attack."    The decision applied "to all weapons, it doesn't matter  which  army is in possession," he added, dispelling doubts about  differences on the issue between the UN and the North Atlantic  Treaty Organisation.    Last Wednesday NATO said both sides faced airstrikes if they  did not withdraw heavy weapons from positions around Sarajevo or  place them under UN supervision. Since then, some observers  have questioned whether UNPROFOR was too lenient in allowing  Serb forces to put heavy guns under "observation" rather than  handing them over to full UN control.    Since Friday the Moslem-led Bosnian army has put 10 mortar  guns under full UN control. The Serbs have put 33 of their guns  under UN observation, but at Serb barracks.    No arms handover from either side took place on Monday, but  negotiations to unblock the process were continuing, UNPROFOR  spokesman Richard Pernod said at a press conference.</p>

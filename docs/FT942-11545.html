			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Book Review: Fact stranger than science fiction THE BILLION DOLLAR MOLECULE: One Company's Quest for the Perfect Drug By Barry Werth Simon &amp; Schuster Dollars 25, 445 pages Anyone who thinks scientists are quiet and dull should read this fly-on-the-wall account of research in action at Vertex Pharmaceuticals, a Massachusetts biotechnology company. The Billion Dollar Molecule is a story of anger, arrogance and aggression, spiced with duplicity and deceit and lubricated with hard drinking. One scientist smashes office furniture when his experiments fail and there is even a half-hearted arson attempt in the laboratory. The hero of The Billion Dollar Molecule is the hyper-ambitious Joshua Boger, a chemist who leaves a senior research job at Merck, the largest and most respected US drugs company, in 1989 to set up Vertex. He has enough venture capital funding to recruit a bright band of scientists. Most of them are former Merck colleagues whom he lures away with stock options and a scientific vision of computerised 'rational drug discovery' combining the skills of chemists and biologists. Boger emerges as a true leader. While all around him are acting irrationally, he remains calmly decisive. After every disappointment he manages to soothe his anguished staff and to reinspire them to new efforts. However, on the basis of this book, Boger is open to criticism. One strategic mistake was to put egotistical researchers into a flat management structure as a 'social experiment', with the result that they waste time fighting each other. It takes him three years to recruit a research director, who proceeds to reorganise the scientists into a more conventional and smoother-running hierarchy. And, on a personal level, it is sad to read how Boger and his workaholic colleagues deprive themselves of normal family life. Returning home for a rare weekend between 'death march' business trips, Boger finds that his youngest son first fails to recognise him and then says poignantly, 'bye-bye, daddy' whenever he leaves the room. Vertex may be a new company but its mainly male staff works according to the old macho traditions. Barry Werth, author of The Billion Dollar Molecule, follows consciously in the tradition of Soul of a New Machine, the highly successful inside story of a computer project written 13 years ago by Tracy Kidder. But Werth's book is more wide-ranging than Kidder's, covering not only the science and technology but also the financial story behind Vertex. Indeed for many FT readers the most interesting aspect will be the way Boger raises tens of millions of dollars to fund Vertex's research, both from established drug companies for collaborative ventures and from Wall Street investors. Kidder Peabody, the bank underwriting Vertex's initial public offering, only just manages to get the issue away, at a price cut from the original Dollars 13-Dollars 15 range to Dollars 9 per share, by calling in every favour it is owed by the investment community - and allowing Boger and Rich Aldrich, his business development director, to sell a fifth of the offering to their own contacts. How does Werth, a freelance science writer, know all this? At the back of the book he says he had 'nearly complete freedom to come and go at Vertex for almost four years'. In exchange he allowed the company to 'review my manuscript for factual accuracy and proprietary disclosures'. Werth also agreed that anyone quoted directly in connection with Vertex could review the quotes 'to ensure accuracy and confidentiality on scientific matters'. But he does not say how much he left out. The book's theme is competition. The most immediate rivals of the Vertex researchers are their own colleagues, fighting for laboratory resources and professional recognition. The names that go on Vertex's scientific papers - and in what order - are an explosive issue. The most important external competitor is Merck. The scientists whose careers started with the world's top drug company are desperate to show that they can do better outside its bureaucracy. And Vertex is in a commercial race with Merck in its first two research projects: to create better drugs to suppress the immune system (to treat transplant patients) and to treat Aids. Less predictably, Vertex also develops an obsessive rivalry with Stuart Schreiber, a brilliant young professor of organic chemistry at Harvard University and the only character in the book to match Boger's supreme self-assurance. Schreiber starts off as the star member of Vertex's scientific advisory board. (Boger has deliberately set the company up in Cambridge, Massachusetts, so as to be able to draw on Harvard's chemical expertise.) But Boger soon suspects that Schreiber is passing on confidential information to Vertex's competitors - and fires him. The most surprising strand in the whole book is the race between Vertex and Schreiber's academic team to discover the structure and function of biological molecules associated with the immune system. Boger and Aldrich are driven by an anti-Schreiber passion and 'gloat radiantly' when Vertex manages to upstage him on a scientific publication. 'Imagine Stu-Bob (their name for Schreiber) driving in his Porsche on his way to Harvard, hearing it on National Public Radio,' Aldrich says. 'He'll wrap it around a tree.' But there is also public relations value in a Nature paper for an obscure biotech company trying to raise money. So Boger devotes a lot of energy in twice convincing the venerable science journal to change its mind after initially rejecting Vertex papers. The Billion Dollar Molecule has several flaws. For example, the purple prose is frequently tinted with cliches and the book lacks the illustrations that would help non-scientists to follow the story. But, in all, it is the liveliest and most revealing story written so far about the biotech industry.</p>

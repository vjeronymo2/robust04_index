			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Letter: Confidence in auditing standards body's work Sir, Your article 'Financial Reporting Council willing to adopt audit board' (December 15) fairly reflects what I said to Mr Jack. As the article makes clear, the FRC is not at all making a pitch to bring the Auditing Practices Board within its aegis. We have every confidence in the work the board is doing, and give it warm support. Bill Morrison, its chairman, is a member of the FRC and through that we have an excellent working relationship. The best course now is to encourage the APB to get on with its job. Ron Dearing, chairman, Financial Reporting Council, 100 Gray's Inn Road, London WC1X 8AL</p>

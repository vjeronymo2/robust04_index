			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz from the "ACIR Radio News" </F> newscast]    [Text] President Carlos Salinas de Gortari affirmed that  his administration has fulfilled its commitment to keep the oil  industry under Mexican control and ownership. He added that  Pemex [Mexican Petroleum] had been restructured and strengthened  because, otherwise, it would have deteriorated into an  unproductive and weak corporation thereby becoming easy prey for  local and foreign, private interests.    At midday today at the main Pemex administration offices,  President Salinas led the ceremonies marking the 56th oil  nationalization anniversary. This was the sixth and last [Pemex]  public ceremony the president will attend before his term in  office expires.    [Begin Salinas recording] The government's responsibility  toward this enterprise can only be fulfilled if we establish  conditions that guarantee Pemex's future permanence as a  nationalized enterprise. We have worked expressly to fulfill  that duty and the facts prove this. I hereby state that Pemex is  stronger because it is more productive and efficient. On the  domestic front, Pemex can guarantee the country's energy needs;  it strengthens the public economy for social spending; it  increases its own reserves and investments; and restructures its  activities. Pemex's fortitude is enhanced abroad because we did  not allow any international relationship whatsoever that could  subjugate Pemex decisions to any other will than that of the  Mexican people. [end recording]    Cabinet members and representatives of government branches,  workers unions, and business organizations attended the  ceremony. The president recognized Pemex General Director  Francisco Rojas' honesty and dedication. He stressed that he  will keep his commitment to keep Mexican oil in the Mexican  people's hands for our exclusive benefit until the very last day  of his administration.</p>

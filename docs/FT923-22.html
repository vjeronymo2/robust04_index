			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Survey of Finland (11): Taking the sauna way of life - How the Finns relax FINLAND IS the homeland of the sauna. To most Finns it is neither a luxury nor a status symbol but very much a way of life. There are an estimated 1.5m saunas in a country with a population of only 5m. Indeed, no city apartment seems to be complete without one. Most Finns take one to two saunas a week. The sauna is traditionally made up of a hot room, washroom and a dressing room, and its walls are constructed mainly out of either pine or spruce with concrete floors. The stove or open fireplace of stones lies at the centre of the sauna, heated by electricity in urban areas and by wood in the countryside. The technique of the sauna involves throwing the heated water onto the stones to intensify the humidity. The air temperature around your head needs to be 80-100 centigrade and ventilation should be regulated at 60kg an hour. The sauna is nothing like a shower. The more time you spend in it, the more relaxed you become as you sit naked on a small towel on wooden planks and absorb the heat through your pores, hitting yourself from time to time with bundles of birch leaves to intensify the sweating. Coming out, you should take a cold swim and then drink some fresh juice or beer. Up in Lapland in the winter, a sauna is generally followed by a run into the snow. The sauna is not merely a washing place for Finns but also somewhere to create a sense of well-being and relaxation. It has been recommended as a useful antidote to modern stress, although many Finnish businessman tend to carry their work troubles into the sauna where they can discuss them together with their male colleagues, away from eavesdroppers. There are plenty of don'ts about taking a sauna. Warnings are given that there should not be a competition to see who can stand the highest temperature. Big meals and alcohol need to be avoided beforehand. People with high blood pressure or heart complaints should avoid swimming in cold water after their sauna. The Finns are annoyed at the way in which the sauna, like the massage parlour, has degenerated abroad into a kind of sexual experience. Traditionally, it has served in rural areas as not just a health centre for all the family but also as a maternity clinic. There are no signs that the sauna is in decay. On the contrary, it remains an important daily event for most Finns.</p>

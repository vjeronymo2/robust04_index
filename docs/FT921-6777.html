			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of European finance and investment, Overview (7): Ambitions widen across the world - Profile: Banco de Santander LAST YEAR Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco de Santander, sold a bank network in Spain and bought a sizeable stake of a US bank. He told Santander's annual general meeting this month that he was 'very satisfied' with the investment. Santander is not going to disinvest from Spain in order to concentrate on global banking. The domestic market remains very much the foundation of the group's business and this was underscored by the opening of 107 Santander bank branches in Spain last year and by the launching, with considerable publicity, of innovative mutual fund products. But 1991's twin developments, on the home and the external fronts, were a clear indication of widening ambitions; Mr Botin stressed to shareholders the growing internationalisation of the Santander group. By the end of last year, 36 per cent of the group's assets were based in a total of 27 foreign countries. The assets, a combination of subsidiary banks, finance companies and branches of the parent bank, contributed some Dollars 200m, or 27 per cent to the group's consolidated profits. The objective, according to Santander's chairman, is to lift the non-Spanish contribution to the group's income, from diversified businesses in different countries, to 33 per cent of the total. With such a target in mind acquisitions and investment are more likely to be abroad than on the domestic front in the coming months. Santander certainly has a treasure chest to draw on should it wish to buy. It raised its net profits by 17.8 per cent last year to Pta75.1bn (Dollars 777m), increased its Return on Assets (ROA) from 1.30 per cent to 1.36 per cent, put aside Pta64bn as provisions for reserves, an amount that doubled the non-recurring profits generated last year, and augmented its BIS capital adequacy from 10.5 per cent two years ago to 13.2 per cent in 1991. Last year Santander paid Dollars 220m to acquire 13.5 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorporation, the 23rd largest financial group in the US, with an option to increase the equity to 23.4 per cent. It was the first Spanish bank to step meaningfully into the US market and a subsequent placement of Dollars 150m preferential share on the American market fuelled expectations that it was seeking further properties in the US. Other European banks acquiring US institutions have encountered mixed fortunes. Mr Botin attributed the success of the First Fidelity venture to three principles: Santander paid a satisfactory price for its equity, it limited its capital commitment and it supported a skilled management team which was already in place. Only two Santander nominees joined the First Fidelity board and both were senior group executives with long track records in US banks. Back at home, Santander sold Banca Jover, a subsidiary based in Catalonia, to Credit Lyonnais, the French giant which had a year earlier bought another Santander network, Banco Comercial. The group still owns Banco de Murcia, a profitable 66-branch network in south-east Spain, and Mr Botin says that 'if the price is right' he sees no reason why this subsidiary should not be likewise sold to either domestic or foreign buyers. No less important to the international profile of Santander group are the manner in which it has built on its traditional activities in Latin America and the onset of wholly new business prospects in Europe that result from the parent bank's now four-year-old alliance with Royal Bank of Scotland. The group was quick to focus on financial possibilities in Mexico where it earned goodwill by providing Dollars 100m of financing in the privatisation of Bancomer, one of the largest privatisations in Latin America. Last year, Banco Santander de Negocios, the group's merchant bank offshoot, was awarded the underwriting for the first Pta10bn issue of Matador bonds for the United Mexican States. There followed a second issue of Matador bonds for the Interamerican Development Bank at the end of last year and a third, last month for the Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior de Mexico. In what is evidently a strategy that the group will pursue in other Latin American climates, Santander broadened its retail banking activities in Chile by consolidating its life insurance and leasing subsidiaries and by setting up Chile's first factoring company. In Europe the bank's pet project is IBOS, an acronym for Interbank On-line System. This electronic banking venture, has been developed jointly with the Royal Bank of Scotland, a bank in which Santander owns a 10 per cent stake under a cross share agreement, and Mr Botin hails it as the 'most innovative and efficient (project) of the European Single Market'. A sophisticated update of an existing real-time banking interconnection between Santander and the Royal Bank of Scotland, IBOS has already been introduced into Banco de Comercio e Industria in Portugal and CC-Bank in Germany which are both jointly owned by Santander and Royal Bank of Scotland. The plan is to allow access to the system for as many banks as wish to join the network.</p>

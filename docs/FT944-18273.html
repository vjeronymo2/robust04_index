			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Pearson optimism Media conglomerate Pearson stood out as the best performer in the FT-SE 100 as investors responded to press speculation that BSkyB, the satellite group in which Pearson has around 17 per cent, would be the subject of a Pounds 5bn flotation. The story was published in the Sunday Times, which is owned by Mr Rupert Murdoch who also owns 50 per cent of BSkyB. It encouraged SG Warburg to upgrade its calculation for the contribution BSkyB makes to Pearson's share price by 32p to 160p and recommend the Financial Times owner at its morning meeting. The house forecast for Pearson shares is now 712p and the stock closed 17 stronger at 599p. Leisure and rental group Granada, holder of a 13.5 per cent stake in BSkyB, ended a penny firmer at 510p, as analysts focused on the prospect of a windfall of between Pounds 450m and Pounds 500m to the company should a stake sale go ahead. News that food retailer J. Sainsbury had bought 50 per cent of the voting stock of US supermarket chain Giant Food for Dollars 325m helped the shares resist the market slide. The shares have been under a cloud in recent sessions on continuing fears of a price war among food retailers, but the stock was back in favour yesterday. The shares touched 409p before renewed fears of a price war and the weak market, particularly in the second half of the session, saw the stock surrender the earlier gain to close 1 1/2 up at 402p. Mr Bill Myers at Yamaichi said: 'The market was half expecting an acquisition. This one is in the right place geographically and is a quality outfit.' The attention of the rest of the sector focused on the intensifying supermarket price battle as Argyll Group's Safeway supermarket chain launched a Pounds 7m advertising campaign and Asda Group announced a price freeze on 7,000 grocery and non-food items until at least January 1995. Argyll slipped 4 1/2 to 270p, while the latter relinquished 3 1/4 to 62 1/4 p in trade of 5.7m. Comments by shadow chancellor Mr Gordon Brown that a Labour government would impose a 'windfall tax' on the profits of privatised utilities sent a chill through the shares of the regional electricity companies. The worst hit included Midlands Electricity, down 37 at 701p, Eastern Electricity, which tumbled 35 to 707p, and London Electricity, which fell 34 to 651p. Vodafone failed to climb above the weak market sentiment in spite of a very strong showing from new connections in its second quarter. The shares dipped 3 1/2 to 194p in 6.4m trading volume. The group took in 277,000 gross subscribers in the quarter, up from 98,000 a year ago, with digital connections accounting for one-third of new connections in September. Medeva, the pharmaceuticals group, rose 5 to 153p as the market responded to a positive presentation by the company in the US and a recommendation from Panmure Gordon. Both British Aerospace and nuclear submarine maker VSEL moved sharply lower as they awaited official confirmation of widely anticipated takeover talks. The former fell 6 1/2 to 442p and the latter weakened 32 to 1178p. VSEL is now 72p short of the price that most securities houses have been putting on any potential offer from BAe. Housebuilders lost ground following the Nationwide Building Society's gloomy view of house prices in September. Barratt shed 4 to 138p and George Wimpey slipped a similar amount to 134p. Among building materials, BPB held steady at 302p, helped by a buy recommendation from BZW. Plant hire shares were in demand, with Ashtead bouncing 7 to 437p on the back of a confident statement. A profits warning from retailer Shoprite left the shares trailing 4 at 28p.</p>

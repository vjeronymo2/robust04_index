			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhu Yuquan (2612 3768 3123)] </F>   [Text] Tianjin, 28 Dec (XINHUA) -- While inspecting grain  work in Tianjin, Li Tieying, member of the Political Bureau of  the CPC Central Committee, State Councillor, and minister of the  State Economic Restructuring Commission, pointed out the need to  seize the opportunities at hand, carry out vigorous exploration,  embark on bold reform, and establish a new grain system under  the socialist market economy as soon as possible.    From 27 to 28 December, accompanied by leading comrades from  the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee and Tianjin municipal  government, Li Tieying and his party inspected the Puji River  Course Grain Depot, Number One Flour Plant, North Station Grain  and Edible Oil Store, a trade fair market; and heard briefings  on grain work from the personnel of relevant departments in  Tianjin. They also held a meeting with Gao Dezhan, secretary of  the Tianjin municipal CPC Committee, Tianjin Mayor Zhang  Lichang, and other comrades.    Li Tieying touched on the issue of recent price increases  for  grain and edible oil in some regions. He said that the recent  fluctuation in the price of grain has provided food for thought.  The fluctuation occurred on the heels of several consecutive  years of harvests, at a time when localities reported ample  grain reserves. This has something to do with the structural  problem, the attitude toward grain work, circulation of hearsay  in society, people's psychology, and the inability to adapt to  the demands of a market economy. The fluctuation has taught us  a lesson. Of course, we will sum up the lesson of the market  fluctuation. We will not revert to the old system of issuing  ration cards and grain coupons; we will instead seek a way out  through reform. We should know that now is the best time to  establish a new grain system. There are three reasons: First,  the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  delineated a grand blueprint for the socialist market economy  system, second, there is a relatively relaxed external  environment, and we have an ample stock of grain, third, the  recent market fluctuation has provided us with a real chance to  study a grain system.    Li Tieying said that the grain price affects the stability  of  the entire market, public mood, and social stability.  Therefore, all levels of government should attach high  importance to the grain market and grain work and do a good job  of the macrocontrol of grain in a timely manner. It is quite  normal that the lifting of the control on grain prices will lead  to some price fluctuations as well as to the readjustment of the  production and marketing of grain because of changes in the  supply and demand for grain. However, grain prices must not be  allowed to rise excessively, and driving up prices is not  allowed. To protect the interests of farmers, grain departments  should buy up grain from farmers when the price tumbles on the  grain market. To bring about a fall in the price, to protect  the interests of consumers, and to reassure the mood of the  general public, grain departments should intervene and sell off  grain when the grain price rises excessively.    Li Tieying stressed that the liberalization of the grain  price does not mean that a new grain system has already been  established. He said it is necessary to seize the opportunity of  having grain in storage and step up studying and formulating a  complete and enduring grain system for China which will benefit  farmers and consumers. He said that such a grain system should  include the following: a grain production structure, a grain  procurement and marketing structure, a grain price structure, a  grain import-export structure, a macrocontrol and safeguard  system, and a grain industry system which takes into account  China's reality and meets the demands of a socialist market  economy. Li Tieying particularly stressed the need to establish  and improve a grain reserve system and a regulation fund system,  pointing out that only with abundant storage for grain and an  abundant storage fund can we expect to flexibly and freely  regulate and control the market and establish a grain system  that will promote production, guarantee supply, make the market  thrive, stabilize prices, and reassure the public.    Li Tieying gave high credit to Tianjin's timely adoption of  forceful measures to stabilize the grain market. He called on  localities to act according to the State Council's unified  arrangement and to immediately increase the grain supply so as  to help stabilize commodity prices, enable the masses to have a  peaceful and joyous new year and Spring Festival, and create a  favorable social and economic environment for the smooth  introduction of various reform measures next year.    Also accompanying Li Tieying during the inspection were Wan  Baorui, vice agricultural minister; Ma Kai and Wang Shiyuan,  vice ministers of the State Economic Restructuring Commission;  and comrades from relevant departments including those from the  Ministry of Internal Trade, the State Planning Commission, and  the Ministry of Finance.</p>

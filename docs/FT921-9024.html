			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Letter: Spending power answer to environmentally sound trade promotion Sir, The promotion of trade and good environmental policies need not be competing objectives as your leader (February 12) implies. Further, your underlying assumption encapsulated in your very last sentence ('. . .this concern should not pollute world trade and therefore deny the poor what the rich take for granted'), is that enhanced world trade necessarily benefits the poor. This assumption is certainly contestable in the short term. In many developing countries poverty is the single most important cause of disrespect for the environment as the well-documented cases involving tree-felling demonstrate. Enhancement of world trade would be achieved more effectively in the long run if the developing world had more of the world's spending power. More trade per se does not guarantee this.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council was concerned that the dollar thresholds for reporting known or suspected criminal activities as described in &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) were too low. It also stated that the respective $1,000 and $5,000 thresholds would result in reporting known or suspected criminal activities that law enforcement agencies would not prosecute, and that the thresholds were a radical departure from prior practice. The Council also commented that some district banks have been advised by U.S. Attorneys that criminal activities involving collateral conversion or misrepresentation of financial information are not prosecuted when the diversion or misrepresentation is less than $25,000 to $50,000 or if the institution does not incur an actual loss. As a result, the Council believes that the thresholds should be increased to higher levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Working Group, which included the FCA, established the same thresholds for all Federal financial regulatory agencies. The Working Group believes that uniform thresholds will enhance the ability of the Federal financial regulatory agencies and the law enforcement agencies to detect, investigate, and prosecute known or suspected criminal activities. The Working Group also believes that the lower thresholds are necessary to ensure the reporting of potential multiple criminal violations by one individual at several different institutions. The Department of Justice, as a member of the Working Group and oversight agency for the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys, assisted in the establishment of the thresholds. Therefore, as a participant in the Working Group and in concurrence with the Department of Justice's judgment on this matter, the FCA continues to support the Working Group and proposes the regulation with these thresholds. The FCA will reconsider this issue should the Working Group modify the threshold levels in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is important to note, however, that only a known or suspected criminal violation (meeting the dollar threshold requirements of &sect;617.2(a)) must be reported. Generally, a criminal violation that must be reported under this part involves a determination that a borrower or insider intended to ``defraud'' an institution in violation of a Federal criminal statute. Institutions, therefore, must make an initial determination of whether a misrepresentation of assets or a collateral conversion, for example, was done inadvertently or with the intent to defraud the institution. Accordingly, in ascertaining whether a criminal referral is appropriate, an institution should consider all facts and circumstances, including evidence of intent, to determine whether there is a known or suspected criminal violation. If the institution is persuaded that there is no evidence of intent and, hence, no criminal violation, then it need not make a criminal referral. Thus, System institutions are vested with considerable discretion. Should they feel the need for guidance in exercising this responsibility, they may consult legal counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to expressed concerns about the referral threshold, the FCA reviewed the Systemwide criminal referrals for calendar years 1992 and 1993. In 1992, there were 47 criminal referrals, of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar loss. In 1993, there were 53 criminal referrals of which 30 reported no dollar loss or an unknown dollar loss. In addition, the FCA received 7 criminal referrals in 1992 and 17 criminal referrals in 1993 reporting dollar losses over $50,000. Of the criminal referrals received, there was a total of four insider transgressions in 1992 and 1993. It appears from these statistics that System institutions may already be reporting criminal referrals consistent with the proposed thresholds and that the thresholds are not a radical departure from current practices. Accordingly, the FCA proposed regulation contains the same thresholds as originally contemplated. Commenters who continue to have concerns that the thresholds are too low are requested to provide empirical data indicating to what extent the thresholds would result in a departure from their current reporting practices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council remarked that the proposed regulation did not adequately define ``potential'' loss. In further explanation of the proposed regulation, it should be noted that the regulation (and Federal law) does not require that an institution sustain an actual loss; the potential for a loss satisfies the regulation (and Federal criminal law). Furthermore, the proposed regulation specifically states that the loss or potential loss is to be determined before reimbursement or recovery. In other words, whether or not the loan is adequately collateralized has no bearing on the determination of whether there is a loss or potential loss. For example, if a borrower with a loan that appears to be adequately collateralized converts $10,000 of secured property or makes a false statement by omitting a $10,000 liability from a financial statement, the institution would be required to report this known or suspected criminal violation to the appropriate authorities. This is necessary because the institution has a potential loss of $10,000 before it receives actual payment on the loan or recovers on the secured property. Although the loan may appear to be adequately collateralized notwithstanding the conversion of $10,000, the institution nonetheless has a potential loss before reimbursement or recovery. The loss need not actually have occurred for a reportable violation to exist. The FCA believes the foregoing explanation should adequately address the potential loss concept. It is further noted that, in attempting to clarify this section, the language of &sect;617.2(a)(2) and (3) has been amended to clarify that a situation involving a potential loss could arise through the use of a false statement or other fraudulent means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council further commented that the proposed regulation did not adequately address criminal acts that do not specifically require a monetary loss, e.g., false statements under 18 U.S.C. 1014. As discussed above, such a criminal act has a potential for monetary loss and should be reported in all situations where the threshold is met and it is reasonable to believe that a criminal act occurred. The proposed regulation has been amended to clarify that a referral would be required when there is a false statement that meets the threshold amounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Boost for US ethnic TV A newscast spotlights international events in Japanese. On another channel, a steamy love affair is taking place in Spanish. US television is turning into a smorgasbord of ethnic programming. In many urban centres, where new immigrants tend to congregate, the number of foreign-language channels is already staggering. And, with fibre optics about to boost the number of channels available, viewers can expect to see even more in future. New nation-wide distribution channels for cable, through computers or telephone lines, and pay-per-view services, should also help boost US-produced ethnic programming. Some of the Spanish stations already produce 50 per cent or more of their programmes for the American market, but most ethnic stations rely on purchases of shows from abroad. Many immigrants and minorities view ethnic stations as an affirmation of their importance in US society, and the surge in the number of immigrants in the US guarantees an expanding audience for many ethnic shows. In Boston, the cable station Celtic Vision hopes to launch soon with programmes catering to a large community of Irish and Irish descendants, estimated at 1.6m in Massachusetts alone. 'Potentially, we have a bigger audience in the US than in Ireland,' says Robert Matthews, chairman of Celtic Vision. But the role of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in encouraging more ethnic programming on cable remains uncertain. For instance, the commission may try to increase access for smaller companies - which include many of the ethnic stations - by creating 'must carry' rules for alternative programming. 'We've already sponsored a number of initiatives over the years that have allowed for more ethnic programmes', says Karl Kensinger, special assistant to the chief of the mass media bureau at the FCC. The increase in ethnic programming will not only reflect American society, but help to shape it. On the negative side, however, easy access to foreign-language shows may hold back immigrants' progress in learning English, and niche programming may increase the distance between different cultural groups. TV once represented the lowest common denominator for US society, and vastly diverse viewers tuned in for a single show, such as I Love Lucy, in the 1950s. Now, two Americans can watch television all week and never see the same programme.</p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Market struggles after large placing THE PLACING of a large stake in Sears, one of the UK market's most important retailing groups, proved the high point in an otherwise subdued London equity market. Apart from a burst of interest triggered by the Sears placing the wider market did little more than mark time. Senior traders pointing out another session of low attendance, attributed to many dealers taking an extended Easter holiday break. The probability of another nationwide rail strike on Friday did little to encourage enthusiasm in the market. 'Many of the important trading houses have written off the week and will not open any sizeable positions until next week,' said the head of trading at one of the big international dealing houses. The FT-SE 100 Index ended the session a net 4.7 lower at 2,842.1, again outperforming the FT-SE Mid 250 index which closed 8.6 down at 3,092.7. Turnover on the London market was substantially inflated by the placing of the 10.6 per cent stake in Sears, which, allowing for double counting, spoke for more than 300m of the market's 822m shares traded yesterday. The Sears stake, built up by the Al-Fayed brothers in 1987 was acquired and then sold on to a number of institutions, by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank via a bought deal thought to have netted the US investment bank a profit of around Pounds 1.5m. Despite the low attendance levels on Tuesday, the value of customer business in the equity managed to top the crucial Pounds 1bn mark, reaching a creditable Pounds 1.026bn. The equity market began the trading session in good form, with dealers hoisting opening prices after the latest improvement on Wall Street which followed up Tuesday's 31 points surge with a rise of almost 16 points. However, dealers said the Sears placing, which they described as the equivalent of a Pounds 150m rights issue, took the steam out of the market which, having improved over nine points within the first hour of trading, came under pressure for the rest of the day. Another strong opening by Wall Street, which which was a good 11 points higher soon after it opened, failed to galvanise a London market looking increasingly weary as the session wore on. At its worst, the Footsie 100 was down 8.5 points at 2,838.3. Marketmakers said the slide was not wholly down to the big Sears placing. 'There were a number of big lines of stock on offer, and that unsettled the market nearly as much as the placing of Sears,' said one trader. He added that despite the generally good news on European interest rates there was a feeling that the equity market would now struggle to make any further headway. The utilities areas of the market continued to attract strong selling pressure with the big institutions said to have switched out of the water and electricity areas and back into the food manufacturing, retailing and brewing areas of the market. Drug stocks, mauled in recent weeks by a succession of bad news, staged a good recovery led by ICI. Hong Kong-related stocks, which continued to surge ahead on Hong Kong markets after the agreement between the Chinese and British governments to resume talks about the 1995 elections, remained in the forefront of the Footsie 100 index.</p>

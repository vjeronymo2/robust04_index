			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Moves on Boulogne freight ferry TWO MOVES were announced yesterday to fill the gap created by the closure on Monday of the Dover-Boulogne ferry service operated by P&amp;O European Ferries. The French company Opale Ferries, which operates a freight-only service between Boulogne and Folkestone, indicated that it was likely to add a second ship to the route in the near future because it was close to capacity even before P&amp;O's withdrawal. Boulogne's Chamber of Commerce said it was seeking shipping companies prepared to invest in the passenger route.</p>

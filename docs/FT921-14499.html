			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / International Company News: Primerica registers Dollars 132m record profits PRIMERICA, the US financial services group, yesterday announced record fourth-quarter earnings of Dollars 132.1m, due primarily to another strong contribution from Smith Barney, its Wall Street broking subsidiary. The buoyant final quarter took Primerica's full-year earnings to Dollars 478.8m, well up on the Dollars 372.9m booked in 1990. Breaking all previous records in the firm's 118-year history, Smith Barney's Dollars 49.8m profit in the fourth quarter and its Dollars 152.4m in the full 12 months were achieved on the back of bullish domestic equity markets, big increases in new stock issues and increased market participation by individual investors. Within the broking firm, the biggest improvements were recorded in investment banking, retail and institutional commissions, principal trading, and asset management fees. At the same time, profit margins were boosted by reductions in fixed expenses. The insurance unit, Primerica Financial Services, suffered a decline in earnings, which dropped 15 per cent to Dollars 41.8m in the quarter, although full-year profits actually increased slightly to Dollars 174.6m. More worryingly, sales of new life insurance fell in the quarter and in the year. Earnings from the consumer services businesses increased slightly to Dollars 45.2m in the quarter. Annual earnings from the consumer lending and direct marketing divisions, however, were Dollars 175m, well up on the Dollars 153.5m posted in 1990. Primerica's figures were well received on Wall Street, with the group's share price rising Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 40 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

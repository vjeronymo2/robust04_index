			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Late program buying lifts blue chips Wall Street AFTER A hesitant start, blue chip stocks posted solid gains yesterday in spite of weakness in technology and airline shares, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 19.65 at 3,511.65. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 1.16 firmer at 447.43, but the Nasdaq composite finished 1.09 down at 696.25. Trading volume on the New York SE was 267.5m shares. The morning's economic news had little effect on the markets: industrial production rose 0.2 per cent in May, capacity utilisation was unchanged, and housing starts were up 2.4 per cent, all of which was in line with analysts' expectations. The figures, however, did nothing to dispel concern among investors that economic recovery may be stalling. Although this means that inflationary pressures in the economy should remain subdued, and interest rates low, it also means corporate profitability will probably not improve over the next year as much as investors had hoped. A string of recent profits warnings from companies seem to have backed up that view, and have unnerved investors. Consequently, prices spent most of the day virtually flat, before a round of late program buying closed the session on a broadly positive note. Hewlett-Packard recorded one of the day's biggest declines, dropping Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 83 5/8 in volume of 3.96m shares after the chief executive was reported to have delivered a downbeat assessment of Hewlett's second-half prospects at a meeting in Germany. The company later said, however, that the reports were misleading and that its views on its near-term prospects remained positive. Other technology stocks were also lower. Motorola lost Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 82 3/4 , Compaq Computer Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 54 1/8 and Digital Equipment Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 42 3/8 . USAir dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 after the airline said its May revenues were lower than expected, and that it would report a loss in the second quarter and for the full 1993 year, although the losses would be smaller than incurred in 1992. The airline sector in general was weaker. Delta declined Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 7/8 , AMR, parent of American Airlines, dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 66 and UAL tumbled Dollars 4 to Dollars 126 3/4 . Club Med advanced Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 25 5/8 after the holiday group announced a bigger than expected improvement in second-quarter earnings. Also higher was Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, which bounced back from recent losses to post a gain of Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 as bargain hunters moved into the stock. On the Nasdaq market, Price Co jumped Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 and Costco Wholesale climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 on news that the two discount warehouse retailers are to combine forces in a multi-billion dollar merger. Canada TORONTO finished with a slightly firmer bias, although the real estate sector featured weakly. The TSE 300 index gained 4.6 at 3,892.4 and advances outpaced declines by 410 to 304 after volume of 61.9m shares valued at CDollars 575m. The real estate sub-group index dropped 96.96, or 3.15 per cent, to 2,977.73.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Finance charges limit Welsh Water advance Welsh Water yesterday announced a 3 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits and lifted its dividend by 8.3 per cent, slightly above the trend among its privatised colleagues. Mr Graham Hawker, chief executive, said the dividend increase to 8.45p (7.8p) from earnings per share of 49.2p (49.1p) illustrated the group's confidence in a solid outcome for the full year. The shares closed 7p higher at 699p. Pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 rose from Pounds 75.3m to Pounds 77.3m, on sales 41 per cent higher at Pounds 261.8m (Pounds 185.4m). The pre-tax figure was held back by interest charges of Pounds 200,000, against a gain of Pounds 5.6m last time. Mr Hawker repeated Welsh Water's earlier reassurance that Acer, the consultant engineer purchased for Pounds 56m in February, would be earnings enhancing this year. Its order book was running 10 per cent ahead of last year, Mr Hawker said. Last year, Welsh Water took goodwill write offs of more than Pounds 40m for Acer. The engineering services division, which includes Acer, contributed sales of Pounds 6.4m and operating profits of Pounds 1.6m. Welsh was less fortunate in some of its other non-regulated businesses. The future of the pipeline business was under review following a Pounds 1m loss on a single contract, against a Pounds 1.4m deficit for the division as a whole. Together, the non-regulated businesses contributed operating profit of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 200,000 loss) on sales of Pounds 102m (Pounds 28.4m). The hotels operation incurred a loss of about Pounds 100,000. On the regulated side, there was an 11 per cent increase in sales to Pounds 196.7m, with operating profits ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 77.8m. Mr Hawker said Welsh Water would be seeking price rises of at least 2 percentage points over inflation when the industry regulator sets the next round of increases. He rejected the regulator's claims that the water industry was low risk. The company has pledged to spend Pounds 1bn between 1995 and 2000. 'We think a business does contain significant risks when it has a large capital expenditure programme representing a big chunk of turnover.' See Lex</p>

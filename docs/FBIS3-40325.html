			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Serbian Patriarch Pavle by Mirjana Kuburovic </F> in Belgrade; date not given: "The Healthy Do Not Need a Doctor"]    [Excerpts] His Holiness Serbian Patriarch Pavle  consented to the request of the editors of NIN for a Christmas  interview to be published in the first issue of this weekly,  which in the future will be independent. He received us in the  red salon of the Patriarch's Palace in Belgrade, which is  "reserved" for all official visits to the head of the Serbian  Orthodox Church. Visibly fatigued because of his numerous duties  and still more frequent requests from many foreign media wishing  to convey what the patriarch has to say in their respective  countries, Patriarch Pavle responded--in his own way--to all the  questions we put to him.    [Kuburovic] It is often said--in differing connotations,  unfortunately--that the Serbs are a chosen people, "people of  heaven." What, in your opinion, Your Holiness, does that mean,  and where is that promised land of Serbia?    [Pavle] You recall the words of Mother Jevrosima, that is,  the words of our people spoken through the person of Mother  Jevrosima: "Do not, son, speak falsely, influenced either by  your father or your uncles, but look only to the justice of the  true God. Better to lose your head than to commit a sin against  your soul." Those lines contain in compressed form the  historical and evangelical view of the Serbian people, the rule,  the core and soul of that people, by which it has lived for  centuries. It is true that we are men, children, of the earth,  but we are also children of heaven. That is why down through the  centuries there have been members of our people--both men and  women--who have achieved the ideal of the evangelical doctrine:  Saint Sava, Saint Basil of Ostrog, Saint Peter of Cetinje, Holy  Prince Lazar, and so many others. We who live in these times are  of the same flesh and blood as they were, and so we should  strive to be the chosen people, that is, to live according to  evangelical principles. That, as far as I am able to understand,  is what it means to say that the Serbs are a chosen people.    [Kuburovic] A chosen people, then, is a people that tries to  live according to all the principles of justice....    [Pavle] Yes. According to the principles of justice, God's  truth, and everything that is holy and honorable and acceptable  to dear God. But to generalize and to say that all Serbs are  holy and honorable is not only inaccurate, it is immoral, to say  the least. So, we can only say with pride that there have been  individuals in our people who have set the standard, and it is  from them that we came to be called the chosen people and chosen  Serbia. But to say that all Serbs have been such, we do not even  dream of thinking that.    [Kuburovic] Does that mean that every people, thanks to  honorable individuals who have set the standard for entire  generations, can at a particular moment refer to themselves as  chosen?    [Pavle] Our church deals with quality, not quantity. It is  not the number of believers that is important, but the sincerity  and depth of their belief. This is pointed out to us by the Lord  himself and Jesus when he refers to Moses tending the sheep of  his father-in-law Jethro in the desert. He saw a bramble bush  that was burning, but was not consumed. Moses went to see this  sight and heard a voice from the bush: "Moses, put off thy shoes  from they feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy  ground. I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God  of Jacob." Abraham is the father, Isaac the son, and Jacob the  grandson. God refers to himself as the God of three men from  three different generations, although there were millions of  people in each of those generations. God does not refer to  himself as the God of the millions, but the God of the holy. It  is up to us, then, to try among the millions to be people who  are not inhuman, but among those individuals who strive toward  divine justice.    [Kuburovic] Recently, public interest of both believers and  others has focused on a letter which you sent out some time ago  to the clergy of the Serbian Orthodox Church, which in a way  fixed how much a priest could collect for his services. What is  that about?    [Pavle] Saint Paul the Apostle, in referring to maintenance  of the Old Testament clergy, told the Christians: "Do ye not  know that they which minister about holy things live of the  things of the temple, and they which wait at the altar are  partakers with the altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained that  they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel" (1  Corinthians 9:13-14). It is clear, then, that the faithful have  a duty to support their pastors who preach God's word to them  and perform services for them.    Over time, that maintenance has been provided in various  ways. Now, in most of our church this is done by the believers,  when services are performed, providing funds to the priest for  his support, either in money or in kind. This is not the buying  and selling of God's blessing, nor, as it is said, "a charge for  clerical services." The letter pointed out that the  parishioners' ability to pay must be taken into account, the  priest must bear in mind that now it is a question of survival  for both under these great economic difficulties.    [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the priests of the Serbian  Orthodox Church do not receive a monthly salary when they are  supported by the contributions of their congregation?    [Pavle] Ever since the war, priests have not had any pay  except what they received from their congregation. To be sure,  in the practice of the Christian church, and this goes back  almost 2,000 years, and in many countries that principle is  respected even today, congregations support their own priests.  To be sure, priests had a duty to take only as much as they  really needed, but today it is difficult to make a strict  definition as to how much is really needed. And we have been  informed that there are priests who have been raising their  standard of living in an unexemplary way and at the expense of  their congregation, which accounts for these disagreements,  dissatisfaction, and criticism. [passage omitted]    [Kuburovic] Some of your actions, including the frequent use  of public transportation, surprised the public. Although many of  our people have now become accustomed to meeting you on the  street, in a bus, or in a train, they nevertheless wonder: Why  is the Serbian patriarch not traveling by car like his  predecessors?    [Pavle] I have heard that there are people who think that  this is some kind of posturing on my part, because, as a man on  the street told me, "I understand that there are times when  there is a need to astonish people." That view is utterly  foreign to me as well as to Christianity in general. People  probably do not know that I come from the country, that after  the war I lived for a long time in an area where there was no  public transportation, and usually one had to go on foot, and  even when there were vehicles, the monasteries were almost  always left far from the main highway. In these times today, we  have all forgotten man's real need to walk, to clean his lungs  and limber up his legs. For years, I have been accustomed to  walk and this is no difficulty for me. But people are people,  they interpret everything according to their own thinking. I  will not deny that the patriarchate has a car and gasoline, but  in these times of scarcity it is essential to preserve what we  have. What would happen if we had no reserve of fuel in the  patriarchate and the patriarch of Istanbul came to visit? We  would certainly be in an inextricable position, but people from  the rest of the world have a hard time understanding our  troubles.    [Kuburovic] Your Holiness, you are a man known for not  liking  to attract public attention. Still, there have been very  frequent occasions when some act of yours caused a stir. I am  thinking specifically of Arkan's visit to the patriarchate and  to you personally. There is talk that in connection with that  visit about 300 priests held a meeting and informed you that  they objected to your having received him. Many are therefore  wondering whether you are aware that in these times of political  ferment there are party leaders who will represent that meeting  as an expression of your support for his party and policy?    [Pavle] I receive people in politics mainly as people, not  as  presidents or members of this or that party. That was also my  approach in this case, considering it my obligation to meet  everyone who requests this of me on the spiritual plane. Those  are the reasons why I acceded to the call of a man condemned to  death to visit him in the Nis prison and take his confession. I  also went to Zabela near Pozarevac to talk to a man sentenced to  20 years in prison, just as I responded to the call of Vuk  Draskovic when he was in prison. Why, then, would I not receive  Zeljko "Arkan" Raznatovic as well? I have made use of all these  meetings with political figures to call upon them, assuming that  they have certain influence, never to forget that it is their  obligation to always behave as men and adhere to the principles  of the Gospel. I remind those who have forgotten that Christ  said: "I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to  repentance." And then He said: "They that are whole have no need  of the physician, but they that are sick." Seeing it as my  pastoral duty that I should always talk to all people who seek  it of me, I am ready to accommodate whenever I can.    [Kuburovic] But you do not deny that certain people want to  misuse the meeting with you in an attempt to use the church for  certain interests of their own?    [Pavle] It is true that some people want, not only want, but  are in fact striving, to tie the church to their own boat and  yoke it up to their own cart. We all know that there are people  in politics today who want to manipulate everyone and  everything, including the church, but we in the Serbian Orthodox  Church cannot reconcile ourselves to that. The church does not  want to pull the wool over anyone's eyes by manipulating the  doctrine of the Gospel, but it likewise tries to protect itself  from all those who would use it, lead it, and mislead it.    [Kuburovic] Does that mean that the Serbian Orthodox Church  is neutral, more precisely, uninterested in politics?    [Pavle] We know it is not possible to be neutral, and that  is  why we always try to act for the good of our people, but in such  a way that that action does not harm any other people either.  The church, and the Serbian Orthodox Church in particular, has  never wanted to govern all and everything in this world; it has  always tried to be what the father is in the family, making  itself heard only when some serious situation arises. It is the  role of the church to advise both the people and individuals  what their duty is, which often we forget when some very serious  situation arises.    [Kuburovic] For years now, along with all the other troubles  which have befallen it, the Serbian Orthodox Church has suffered  from a dangerous disease: dissension. Incidentally, other  Orthodox churches have not been spared this either, they also  have their dissenters. Therefore, Your Holiness, please give us  your comment on the events in Cetinje on Saint Luke's Day. Is  autocephaly something to be demanded when someone has a  political need for it? And why do you think atheists are so  interested in having "their own" church?    [Pavle] The church was established 2,000 years ago in order  to serve the people, but not to serve it by human measure, but  by the measure that comes from God, and that means that it  ennobles the intrinsic characteristics of any people. If the  church, however, exceeds that measure, and because of interests  that come from this world it misses its aim and ceases to be the  "pillar and bastion of the truth," allowing people to hitch it  up to their own cart, then the church ceases to be God's church  and becomes a political church. It does not surprise us, then,  that the atheists should be striving to hitch the church up to  their cart, because they understand the role the church has and  could have among people, and so they want to use it for their  own purposes. Our duty, I am referring to the church, is not to  allow ourselves to be manipulated. Not because we want to be  above everyone else and to tell everyone what to do, but simply  because it is the obligation of the church to act for the good  of all men.    As for the church in Montenegro, it has always been a part  of  the Serbian Orthodox Church. Presumably, Patriarch Arsenije III  Carnojevic, who was born in Cetinje, and then Bishop Visarion,  and Bishop Sava, and then Bishop Peter I the Holy, and Bishop  Peter II, knew to what nationality they belonged and what church  they served. People who do not understand that, and it rather  appears they do not want to understand it, the less truth they  have in their hands and the weaker their evidence, the louder  they get. We should therefore remember the principle of the Holy  Father that in conversation we be mild in our speech and strong  in our evidence. Never the other way around. That is why it is  clear to us--upon hearing the strong words in Cetinje in defense  of a so-called independent Montenegrin church--we realized that  they had no evidence at all. You could see that these people  shouting in Cetinje, talking about some church of their own, did  not even attempt to cross themselves.    [Kuburovic] It seems that the Cetinje dissension is a  continuation of what happened a few decades ago according to the  Macedonian formula, which is special because church dignitaries  are chosen by the acclamation of the "people," that is, by a  particular policy.    [Pavle] Back in Turkish times in Montenegro, the popular  assembly did choose the political ruler, but never the spiritual  ruler. To be sure, it is another matter that in Montenegro the  spiritual and political leaders were often the same person. The  final split with the church in Macedonia, which has not been  recognized by any Orthodox patriarchate in the world, actually  occurred because our church could not allow spiritual leaders to  be elected in a secular council. It was clear to everyone that  this was a case of political abuse.    [Kuburovic] Now that splits in Orthodoxy have been  mentioned,  we cannot fail to ask you whether suffering in common has  brought the Orthodox peoples closer together and unified them?  After all, by all appearances today it is somehow the Orthodox  peoples suffering the most: the Russians, Jews, Serbs, and the  sanctions against our country are not bringing any good to the  Bulgarians, Romanians, and Greeks, inflicting immense financial  loss on them.    [Pavle] The Orthodox peoples have always had something that  joined them together, and that unity in trouble has become still  more pronounced and direct. You recall that Njegos said:  "Sympathy is a kind of support." It is enough for someone to  understand us, and if at the same time they offer material and  spiritual support, that is exceedingly important. There is a  rule that troubles shake up a person, indeed even entire  nations, so that they are able to sense what is essential, what  brings them closer to others. All of us Orthodox peoples have a  need for us to support one another with our common faith, to do  what we can--not less--and what is in our power, and what the  time and occasion requires, we believe that God will act on our  behalf, as he has done for our ancestors.    [Kuburovic] Some people say of this time that it is a time  of  trial for Orthodoxy and Christianity in general.    [Pavle] To be sure, in the place where they arose 2,000  years  ago--in Egypt, Palestine, and the East--Orthodoxy and  Christianity have been almost entirely wiped out. Only God knows  why this is the case. But if there must be suffering for the  truth and justice, then it is 1,000 times better for us to  disappear because of the truth and justice than for us to remain  on the road of falsehood, injustice, and evil.    [Kuburovic] Is not a world congress for the Orthodox peoples  and churches more necessary in this time than ever before? Is  that precisely what representatives of the 14 regional Orthodox  churches from all over the world agreed on some time ago in  Geneva?    [Pavle] Since the eighth century, the Orthodox Church has  for  one reason or another never had a worldwide congress, and the  issues have built up over the centuries. All the Orthodox  churches and peoples have a common need to resolve them. I  cannot say when the long-awaited Eighth World Congress of  Orthodox Churches and Peoples will take place. There are  difficulties in organizing the congress, from the question of  where to meet to political pressures and the Iron Curtain behind  which various Orthodox churches have lived at one time or  another. The Geneva meeting of representatives of the world's  Orthodox churches of which you speak will certainly help to  clear the way to holding future meetings and to resolving the  very important issues such as qualifying for autocephaly.  [passage omitted]    [Kuburovic] You talk to foreign journalists almost daily.  What do they ask you most frequently, Your Holiness, do they  understand that the world has contributed to the occurrence in  the former Yugoslavia of what none of the nationalities would  have wished upon themselves?    [Pavle] It is true that we frequently meet foreign  journalists, whom I try to introduce to things which I know are  not easy for them to understand. When they ask me: Who is to  blame for this unfortunate Yugoslav war? I answer what I really  think--that we ourselves are most to blame, and that means the  Serbs, the Croats, and the Muslims, but that Europe and the  United States also have a share in all our troubles. It is  difficult, however, for foreigners to understand our  reality--our historic divisions not only from the time of World  War II, but also earlier--even when they are the most  well-intentioned, but especially if they have certain interests  of their own. Unfortunately, the world wants to fit us with a  cap made for itself.    One of the journalists from the outside world to whom I  talked recently seems to have gotten a good understanding of the  world's influence on the disintegration of the former  Yugoslavia, and he told me: "What are you going to do when the  breakup of Yugoslavia is often being decided on by people who do  not distinguish Slavonia from Slovenia or Slovakia?" Thus, I  have been accused, after a recent visit to Austria, of talking  about events in Bosnia and making no distinction between the  Muslims and the Turks. Those who make those utterly groundless  accusations against me perhaps do not know that I lived in  Bosnia for 10 years before the war when I was going to junior  high school in Tuzla and in the classroom I had a Muslim on one  side and a Croat on the other. So I know Bosnia quite well, I do  not confuse the Turks with the Muslims, but neither do I accept  that the Muslims are Bosnians, that is, autochthonous, and the  Serbs aggressors who came I know not from where, presumably from  Serbia, having decided to drive that autochthonous people from  its home. If people in the outside world took a bit more care  with the facts, the historical facts, they would know that as  far back as the 10th century Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus  mentioned the Serbs in Bosnia, saying that they had a border  with the Croats at Livno and on the River Cetina. Historical  facts are historical facts: In the 12th century, the Priest  Dukljanin records that the Serbs were settled from the great  River Drina westward, which is called Bosnia, but eastward all  the way to Lab in Kosovo. Ignorant of this or not wishing to  know it, some people would at this point like to prove to us  that the Serbs belong only in Serbia.    It seems some people want to prove that the only place for  the Serbian Orthodox Church is in Serbia, and so they are  bombing the seats of the bishops, the church treasuries,  temples, and ancient monasteries. The most recent in the series  of these unfortunate examples occurred on the night of the  Catholic Christmas in Karlovac, where the headquarters of the  Orthodox bishop was bombed, the building was destroyed, and no  one knows what happened to the rich treasury, whether it was  looted or buried.    [Kuburovic] All of this is happening at a time when the  metropolitan of Zagreb and Ljubljana has been asked by the  government to return to Zagreb for the Orthodox Christmas,  having fled from there two and a half years ago. How will the  Serbian Orthodox Church react to all that?    [Pavle] In principle, as I understand it, no one has the  right to prevent church officials from visiting their  congregations and directing them. I am referring here not only  to the Orthodox, but to priests of the other faiths as well. But  in reality it is different: Seven Orthodox bishops cannot return  to their seats, and a new trouble has occurred, an explosive  charge was planted in the bishop's palace in Karlovac. How can  the Serbian Orthodox Church, then, tell Bishop Nikanor of Upper  Karlovac to return to Karlovac or Bishop Lukijan to go back to  Pakrac, when they have nothing to go back to there? That is why  the church will not tell anyone to go or not to go, but it is  clear to everyone that the conditions do not exist for going  back, at least for the present. We know of the need, the  important need, for priests to be with their people, but it is  difficult to expect people, not only if they have a family, but  even if they are monks, to risk their lives for the church they  serve. We hope that the time will come when priests can return  among their believers in safety.    [Kuburovic] Are you encouraged, Your Holiness, by the fact  that at the recent ecumenical meeting in Pecuj representatives  of all the religious communities of the former Yugoslavia  unanimously signed the declaration condemning not only the war,  but also the sanctions?    [Pavle] We are, of course, encouraged that everyone  unanimously--all the representatives of the Roman Catholics, the  Orthodox, and members of the Islamic Religious  Community--condemned the war and the sanctions, although, it is  true, they did not mention by name against whom those sanctions  were imposed. It is good to see a change beginning in the  conception that there is no collective guilt of one people,  because war crimes are committed only by individuals, not by  entire peoples. We have always felt and have tried to represent  to the world that in these times we cannot behave as in the time  of Hitler and Mussolini, who punished entire peoples for a  nonexistent collective guilt. To our great regret, again in the  case of the Serbian people the world has applied the principle  of collective punishment to an entire people. It is therefore a  particular success that representatives of the religious  communities from the former Yugoslavia unanimously condemned the  war and the sanctions, and sanctions were applied only against  the Serbs.    [Kuburovic] Does it not seem to you that the outside world,  although it does not recognize its own participation in  provoking the Yugoslav war, is trying in a way to correct its  mistake by issuing permits to the Serbian Orthodox Church to  import 4,000 metric tons of food from Bulgaria and Greece?    [Pavle] It is true that the UN Security Council did issue us  a permit to import a large quantity of food and drugs, but it is  also true that the period of time given us to accomplish that is  extremely short, and we are fearful about whether we will  succeed in getting together the necessary funds. And a great  deal is needed to purchase such a quantity of food and drugs.  But let us hope that the Serbs in the outside world will once  again this time help even more than they are able, and it is up  to us to do everything to distribute the aid as fairly as  possible. Unfortunately, it must also be said that people ready  to take advantage of the suffering of others for their own  personal gain always turn up in times of great trouble.  So-called war profiteers are making money from the misfortune of  their people. The government, of course, has a duty to protect  us from such people, but while evidence has been found for many  of them, innocent people are suffering.    [Kuburovic] At the time when this issue of NIN reaches its  readers, we will be celebrating Christmas. What kind of  Christmas message, Your Holiness, could you convey to all Serbs  both in the country and abroad, but also to all people of  goodwill all over the world?    [Pavle] I desire peace for all peoples in the world and hope  that God will help so that no nation and no state in the world  goes through what has befallen us. We need peace as the  foundation of everything necessary in this world, and for us  Christians Jesus represents our peace. He said: "I leave you My  peace, I give you My peace." How necessary peace is and the  extent to which we Orthodox know how to appreciate peace is  evident in the liturgy of Saint John the Eloquent, which is used  the most in the Orthodox Church. The word "peace" is mentioned  more than 30 times in that liturgy. The reference is, of course,  to man's peace with God, which then brings peace for man himself  and all people. That need for peace is very strong in our  people. That accounts for the custom of saying "God's peace be  with you," a greeting that the Serbs have used down through the  centuries on Christmas: "God's peace be with you! Christ is  born," just as the Serbian people long ago understood the value  and need for peace, I would like to see that peace prevail  between our people and among all peoples in the world, both our  friends and enemies, greeting them all with the old Serbian  greeting on the holiday of Christ's birth: God's peace be with  you--Christ is born!</p>

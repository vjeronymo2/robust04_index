			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "NEGA Reports" rubric: </F> "Abkhazia"]    [Excerpt] The Republic of Abkhazia Supreme Soviet  circulated a statement yesterday contending that "there is no  single bilateral document today attesting to the fact that  Abkhazia and Georgia are a single state having common  territory." It is also stressed in the statement that no  international-law agreement concluded by Georgia's leadership  has either anything to do with Abkhazia or is valid on its  territory.    Observers believe such a statement has appeared now because  the Georgian leaders have stepped up their foreign policy  activities and signed on behalf of Georgia, as a single state, a  number of interstate agreements.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashov report from Kazan under the "Republics" </F> rubric: "Tatarstan Heading for a Crisis of Authority.  Government Lacks Economic Program"]    [Text] The 19th session of the Tatarstan Supreme Soviet,  which began in Kazan and whose main agenda item is the adoption  of the republic's budget for this year, bodes no good for the  local government.    A crisis of nonpayments, which may be even graver than in  other regions, the pressure of the tax burden, and a nearly  complete paralysis of oil production -- the main source of  budget revenues -- have called into question not only the  viability of much-publicized social programs and the possibility  of old-style, large-scale assistance to agriculture, but also  the prudence of the Tatarstan government's economic policy as a  whole. The opposition, including both the nationalists and the  federalists, is criticizing the republic's leadership for  lacking any reform program whatsoever.    Moreover, the highest echelons of the republic's power,  which  have until recently been considered monolithic, suffered a split  the other day. First, the policy pursued by the republic's  leaders was challenged by Rafael Khakimov, President Shaymiyev's  closest adviser. In an article entitled "A Year of Missed  Opportunities" he accused the top authorities of "narcissism,"  pointing out that "everything is remarkably nice in our young  republic. Leaders do not blunder. They sign treaties and  agreements that the people fully endorse," whereas in Austria,  "Chancellor Franz Vranitzky asked me how far Tatarstan is from  Nizhniy Novgorod." In Mr. Khakimov's view, the first reformist  steps by the republic's government -- the regulation of prices  instead of "shock therapy," thought-out agricultural policy, and  social safety nets for specific sectors of the population --  were proclaimed reform proper, which actually marked an end to  it. "At the same time," Mr. Khakimov notes, "the Tatarstan  government has not explained the essence of the republic's  economic development model to the population." What he sees as  the main trouble is that "sovereignty has not yet become...a way  of life and the government has been hamstrung by `oblast'  thinking."    Mintimer Shaymiyev was swift to counter the charges, and  presently the institution of presidential advisers in Tatarstan  has been abolished altogether.    The tide of criticism of the republic's economic situation  has not subsided, however. Tatarstan Deputy Prime Minister  Ravil Muratov said in an interview for INTERFAX: "We are  wasting time and missing the chance to complete reform at the  minimum costs... We are beginning simply to lag behind certain  regions. The government is undertaking costly social programs..  but it does not care very much about finding actual sources of  financing them, primarily about the budget. Who will pay taxes?  Enterprises indebted to each other, entrepreneurs crushed by a  tax burden? Collective and state-owned farms that rely on  subsidies, most of them money-losing? We have long watched  Russian reform so as to avoid its mistakes. But by doing so we  have made those of our own, having failed to work out our  concept of economic development..."    Those responsible for the "idle time" have not been named  yet, but it is clear that the government officials' criticism is  directed at Svoboda Square, where the Cabinet of Ministers has  its seat, not at the Kazan Kremlin, residence of the Tatarstan  president. Given that rumors about Prime Minister Mukhammat  Sabirov's resignation have been circulating for a long time now,  one may surmise that the question will be discussed at the  parliamentary session that began yesterday.    So far, questions concerning the treaty and follow-up  agreements with the Russian Federation, which were signed in  February, and the proposal by Deputy Bayramova, leader of the  nationalist "Ittifak" party, on the discussion of human rights  violations in the republic, have not been included in the  session's agenda.    Although there have been no proposals to discuss the  government's report on its last year's performance, the deputies  will apparently have plenty of opportunities to say aloud  everything they think on the subject when discussing the report  on the implementation of Tatarstan's 1993 budget.    In addition, the session must consider the president's  budget  message for this year. Under the message, the republic's budget  will amount to 9,124,576 million rubles. At the same time it is  planned to transfer to the federal budget a total of 847.266  billion.</p>

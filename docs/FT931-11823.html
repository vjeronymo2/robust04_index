			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Saab cars to get big capital injection SAAB Automobile is to receive a SKr2.8bn (Pounds 254m) capital infusion from its two owners, Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, as part of a three-pronged drive to restore the group to profitability. Combined with rationalisation and the launch of the group's new model later this year, the injection is meant to turn round the group's fortunes after four consecutive years of losses. The funds are to be used for current operations and to assist in developing future car models. The money will be put into the company during 1993 with GM and Saab-Scania contributing SKr1.4bn each. In mid-1991 the joint owners ploughed SKr3bn into Saab, and the car group received an additional SKr2.5bn subordinated loan from Saab-Scania. When it first emerged that a new injection was being planned last November, Saab-Scania president Mr Lars Kylberg indicated it would be the last support the company would receive. Saab suffered a SKr1.3bn loss in the first nine months of 1992, and is expecting a full year deficit of more than SKr2bn. It has warned it faces an uphill task to return to profitability this year. Crucial to its prospects will be the success of its new model - a replacement for the 900 series - which until now has been kept closely under wraps. It is also carrying out a cost-cutting programme which will cut more than 20 per cent of its workforce, to save SKr2bn.</p>

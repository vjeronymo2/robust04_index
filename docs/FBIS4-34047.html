			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jun (NA) -- Today, Interior  Minister Carlos Ruckauf linked the alleged Shining Path [SL]  member who was arrested in Tucuman with the social outbursts  that occurred recently in the interior of the country,  indicating that those who escaped when the Peruvian was captured  "have been identified and arrest warrants have been issued."    Ruckauf confirmed that the alleged member of the Peruvian  Maoist SL organization is under arrest. He has been identified  as Jorge Diaz Reategui. The minister added that those who were  with him at the time of his arrest "have been seen wherever  social outbursts have occurred."    Reategui's arrest took place at a hotel in the poor district  of El Bajo, near the Tucuman city bus terminal. At the time, he  was meeting with other alleged guerrillas, who managed to escape.    The interior minister indicated that those who were with  Reategui "have been seen in other parts of the country,  participating in public outbursts." He emphasized: "They have  been identified and arrest warrants have been issued."    Reategui was questioned during the afternoon of 10 June by  Judge Ricardo Maturana, who heads Federal Court No. 2 of the  city of Tucuman. Details of the questioning were not revealed.    Police sources have confirmed that special security measures  have been implemented regarding Reategui to prevent any rescue  or escape attempt by his comrades in arms.    Authorities are concerned because Tucuman Province, where  the  terrorist was arrested, has been identified as a refugee camp  for SL members who clandestinely cross the border.    The Maoist guerrillas, infamous for their violent actions,  presumably install themselves in Tucuman Province to train  Peruvian and Argentine militants who support their ideology.</p>

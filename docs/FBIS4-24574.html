			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Article" by staff reporter He Chong (6320 0392): </F> "The United States Announces Delinkage of Trade From Human  Rights, and Sino-American Relations Tend to Seek Common Ground  While Reserving Differences"]    [Text] Hong Kong, 28 May (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE) -- After  judging the hour and sizing up the situation over the past year,  U.S. President Clinton eventually announced the renewal of  China's MFN status, and stated that in the future human rights  issues would be delinked from trade and MFN. This shows that  the U.S. previous policy of using human rights issues to put  pressure on China has failed, and that China's foreign policy  toward the United States "with good reason, advantages, and  restraint" has gotten the upper hand in the present  Sino-American diplomatic dispute. Sino-American relations in  the future might move in a new direction of seeking mutual  benefit, cooperation, and common ground while reserving  differences, which China has always advocated.    In the past, China did not occupy a decisive position in the  eyes of the United States. But now the United States has seen  this Tai Shan [a symbol of great influence] with its own eyes.  In his speech delivered on 27 May, Clinton admitted: "Our  relationship with China is important to all Americans. We have  significant interests in what happens there and what happens  between us. China has an atomic arsenal and a vote and veto in  the United Nations Security Council. It is a major element in  Asian and global security. We share important interests, such  as a nuclear-free Korean peninsula and sustaining the global  environment. China is also the world's fastest-growing economy.  Over $8 billion of U.S. exports to China last year supported  over 150,000 American jobs..." Therefore, Clinton has decided to  renew China's MFN status.    Before the above-mentioned announcement was made, it was  reported that, while renewing China's MFN status, Clinton would  increase customs duties on products manufactured by China's  state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises and  would use this as a stepping stone for personally overruling  [fou jue 0694 0414] the seven executive orders on human rights.  However, in his announcement, Clinton did not mention China's  state-owned enterprises and military industrial enterprises at  all. He only announced a ban on importing weapons, principally  guns and ammunition, from China with total value of less that  $200 million. Compared with the $31 billion of China's exports  to the United States, such an amount is trivial and only  represents a symbolic figure.    However, to placate congressmen and congresswomen who  advocate human rights, Clinton also announced "extending the  sanctions imposed as a result of the events in Tiananmen  Square," and continued to refuse China permission to participate  in the U.S. Trade and Development Aid Program, the Overseas  Private Investment Companies Program, and the United States and  Asian Environmental Partners Program, and denied licenses for  exporting dual-use civilian products to China, among others.  This shows that Clinton has not done things in a completely  unrestrained manner, because he has still kept some room for  maneuver.    Notwithstanding, Clinton has dared to go back on [fou ding  0694 1353] his campaign promise to strengthen pressure on China  as well as the executive order he issued after taking office on  attaching human rights conditions to the renewal of China's MFN  status. This has required great courage. In particular, while  admitting that the policy of "linking" trade with human rights  "no longer works," Clinton has acknowledged [ren tong 6126 0681]  China's views on seeking common grounds while reserving  differences, laying aside ideological differences such as human  rights, and working for the goal of developing common interests.    People still remember that, at the summit meeting of  Asian-Pacific countries held in Seattle in November last year,  President Jiang Zemin told Clinton: As the Cold War has ended,  we must focus our attention on economic development. China and  the United States must increase mutual trust, seek common ground  while reserving differences, and develop their common interests  in economic and trade cooperation, international peace, and  security. Handling relations between the two sides must be  considered from the angle of the global arena, the future, and  the 21st century. At that time, Clinton agreed with this view.    In Seattle, Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen also told  U.S. Secretary of State Christopher: "Sino-American relations  must always be based on common interests, but not on the same  social system, way of life, ideology, and values." With regard  to Sino-American differences, he maintained that specific  problems should be solved in specific ways. He opposed linking  specific issues such as democracy, human rights, and  proliferation of weapons with trade. He said that the two  countries must stop debating about ideology, democracy, and  human rights issues. They must seek common grounds while  reserving differences, expand areas of agreement, and work for  common interests, in particular economic interests.    Clinton's 27 May speech has shown that the United States is  treating Sino-American relations from the high strategic plane.  It has agreed to seek common ground while reserving differences  and develop common interests. This is precisely what is  required by the U.S. strategy of shifting its economic and  diplomatic focus to Asia, because China is a major country in  Asia as well as a locomotive of rapid economic development in  the region. If U.S-China relations become deadlocked or are  even brought to a confrontational stage, the United States' new  Asian strategy can be nothing but empty talk. Therefore,  Clinton's decision is being welcomed by various Asian countries.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / International Company News: Barrick earnings improve as Goldstrike lifts output American Barrick, the Toronto-based gold producer, raised third-quarter earnings by 5 per cent, due largely to higher output at the flagship Goldstrike property in Nevada, and a contribution from recently-acquired Lac Minerals. Barrick's per-share earnings were diluted by the issue of 66m common shares as part of the Lac purchase price. That deal closed on September 6. Net earnings climbed to USDollars 61.3m, or 20 cents a share, from Dollars 58.3m, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Revenues advanced to Dollars 216m from Dollars 178m. Earnings growth has been dampened by rising exploration expenses, as Barrick spreads its wings in Latin America and Asia. Exploration spending is forecast to rise to Dollars 30m next year, more than double 1994 levels. Lac's properties in North America and Chile contributed about 30,000 ozs to third-quarter production, which totalled 560,500 ozs, up from 413,800 ozs a year earlier. Output from Goldstrike's Betze-Post pit rose to 466,500 ozs from 368,000 ozs. Barrick forecast 1994 output from its eight mines at more than 2.2m ozs.</p>

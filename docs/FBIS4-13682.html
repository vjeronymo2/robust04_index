			<p>BFN     [Text] His Highness Crown Prince Hasan, the Regent,  received former Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella at the Royal  Hashemite Court today.    During the meeting, the two sides discussed prospects of  Arab  cooperation and detente as well as efforts to clear the  atmosphere and bolster inter-Arab relations.    President Ben Bella praised continued Jordanian efforts to  protect the holy places in holy Jerusalem and to maintain the  Arabism of Jerusalem against the Israeli siege imposed on it and  Israel's continued efforts to Judaize it.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Mr.  President, could you give us an idea about your meeting with his  highness the crown prince this morning?    [Ben Bella] I must say that I am not a visitor. I consider  myself from this country. The crown prince is my brother.  Frankly, it is a wedding day for me when I visit you. I came  to take part in the celebrations of the third  Hashemite-sponsored renovation of the al-Aqsa Mosque in  Jerusalem. I came to see my brothers and ask about them. We  are really proud of you all.    [Correspondent] Mr. President, how do you view talk in  Algeria about prospects of dialogue between the Algerian  Government and the Islamic Salvation Front?    [Ben Bella] It is a serious dialogue and I believe it will  bear fruit soon, God willing. The situation in Algeria is  difficult but not in the way it is being exaggerated outside. I  mean the situation is not easy, but the process of reaching an  agreement and achieving national reconciliation is going on.  Many elements, including the new president, are seeking to  achieve national reconciliation.    [Correspondent] The final question, Mr. President.  Throughout your years of struggle, you always called for better  inter-Arab relations for a better Arab future. How do you view  inter-Arab relations now and efforts to clear the Arab  atmosphere?    [Ben Bella] I am satisfied with this. The issue of unity is  a given. We must unite. The world is uniting. Europe is  uniting. America even united with Mexico. How can we not unite?  We must unite. God willing, we will achieve unity even though  this will take time and even though there are obstacles.  However, we must unite. To be or not to be. We will unite,  God willing.    [Correspondent] God willing, sir.    [Ben Bella] Our conscience is united. Regardless of what  governments may think, our conscience is united. We must unite,  God willing.    [Correspondent] God willing. Thank you Mr. President. [end  recording]</p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei edges ahead as pressure on JR East subsides AFTER AN early plunge through the 18,000 level, the Nikkei average finally closed marginally higher after a day of fluctuations, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. Share prices moved on arbitrage activity, margin selling and index-linked buying by financial institutions before the 225-issue average ended 4.00 better at 18,121.71. The Nikkei saw a low of 17,818.28 in early trading on selling by arbitrageurs and margin liquidation and a high of 18,227.92 later as a rise in the futures market triggered index-linked buying; but in the end, most of the gains were eroded by further selling. Volume rose to 395.1m shares from 315m. Declines led advances by 751 to 290, with 117 issues unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks shed 9.98 to 1,534.78 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.93 to 1,235.29. Fears of a further plunge subsided as selling pressure on East Japan Railway receded. Traders said the stock has become an important benchmark for the market, and many investors still fear that a further fall could drag down other leading shares. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the finance minister, blamed the decline of equity prices on the recent spate of sluggish corporate results. He said the government was not considering injecting more public funds into the stock market to stimulate prices. JR East closed unchanged at Y451,000 after initially falling to Y444,000. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y1,000 at Y756,000. Banks tumbled on index-linked selling: Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y30 to Y3,190 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Y60 to Y2,200. Margin selling depressed Fujitsu by Y8 to Y801 and NEC by Y10 to Y893. However, Sumitomo Metal Mining, which had recently lost ground on margin-linked selling, rallied Y10 to Y839 on bargain hunting. Housing issues were higher on firm condominium sales. Daiwa House Industry moved ahead Y30 to Y1,570 and Daikyo Y10 to Y1,060. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 137.21 to 20,164.03 in volume of 22.1m shares. The index declined on margin liquidation. Roundup THE FIRMER tone was mirrored in many of the region's markets. HONG KONG surged 2.6 per cent on a late round of overseas demand aimed at blue chips as the market refocused its attention on political developments. The Hang Seng index moved forward 236.97 to 9,325.44 in turnover that reached HKDollars 5.8bn, compared with HKDollars 5.7bn on Tuesday. The late demand was attributed to expectations of positive news from last night's meeting in London between Governor Chris Patten and a British cabinet committee to map out a strategy for future Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's political reforms. SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial index advanced 27.71, or 1.35 per cent, to 2,081.01 as institutional buyers and bargain hunters concentrated their attention on index-linked stocks. KARACHI was spurred higher by overseas demand on the view that Ms Benazir Bhutto, the prime minister, will maintain economic reforms begun by Mr Moeen Qureshi, her predecessor, writes Farhan Bokhari. The KSE index rose 41.00, or 2.5 per cent, to 1,655.47, its highest level for 22 months. BANGKOK moved ahead 2.45 per cent on heavy demand for financial and property issues. The market index closed at the day's high, up 32.29 at 1,347.62. TAIWAN finished firmer across the board on a technical rebound after five consecutive days of falls, and the weighted index recovered 18.97 to 4,191.41. A decline in turnover to a moderate TDollars 23.49bn from the previous day's TDollars 27.78bn was attributed to growing caution ahead of local government elections on November 27. MANILA rallied after a four-day correction, the composite index adding 27.8 at 2,367.87. KUALA LUMPUR was firm after its recent volatility and the composite index appreciated 13.23 to 950.89. NEW ZEALAND continued to be weighed down by post election uncertainty and the NZSE-40 capital index dropped 76.82, or 3.7 per cent, to 2,013.76. AUSTRALIA drifted lower for the seventh consecutive day in the absence of foreign buyers. The All Ordinaries index fell to 2,034.6 before closing a net 7.9 off at 2,042.9. Turnover totalled ADollars 382.9m. SEOUL was easier after a volatile day, the composite index dipping 2.31 to 777.89. A Finance Ministry plan to allow some financial companies to raise capital in the stock market sparked early strong demand for financial issues, but the activity came to an abrupt halt when investors discovered that the plan excluded banking institutions.</p>

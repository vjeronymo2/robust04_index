			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Gordeyev] </F>   [Text] Donetsk May 27 TASS -- At their meeting in Donetsk  today, leaders of frontier regions of Russia and Ukraine adopted  a number of documents which will regulate economic and cultural  cooperation between regions.    Representatives of the Rostov, Bryansk, Kursk, Voronezh and  Belgorod regions of russia, and the Kharkov, Lugansk, Sumy,  Chernigov and Donetsk regions of Ukraine have established an  executive committee of the council of leaders of frontier  regions and elected co-chairmen. During the first year the work  of the executive committee will be coordinated by Vasiliy  Ryabykh, head of the department in the administration of the  Belgorod region.    One of the main documents signed by participants in the  meeting is a package of proposals on inserting amendments in  standard acts of the two states regulating frontier relations.    The status of frontier regions envisages real business  cooperation between neighboring regions. On the basis of this  document import and export of industrial commodities  manufactured there and intended for the use at plants located in  neighboring regions, must be exempted from customs duties and  taxes.    Participants in the meeting also discussed the mechanism for  the implementation of the Ukrainian president's decree "on  measures on the development of economic cooperation among  regions of Ukraine and frontier regions of the Russian  Federation" which provides for the possibility for students of  one republic to study in educational establishments of the other  republic. It was noted at the meeting that positive experience  in this field was accumulated, for instance, by the Rostov and  Donetsk regions which are carrying out the exchange of students.    The meeting also considered a question of setting up an  association of economic cooperation called the  "Russian-Ukrainian Union".    However, participants in the meeting stressed that all these  documents just as cooperation between separate regions of the  contiguous states would remain only good wishes if the  aspiration for neighborliness was not legalized by corresponding  inter-state acts. In this connection participants in the  meeting appealed to the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to  speed up the working out and signing of a treaty on friendship,  cooperation and partnership between the two states.</p>

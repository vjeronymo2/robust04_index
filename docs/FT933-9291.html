			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Deflated expectations The Bank of England's contention that inflationary pressures remain weak is hardly controversial. Published data show that since sterling left the ERM any increases in prices of imported goods have been more than offset by falls in wage costs. With the labour market weak, sterling stable, a large gap in output below the economy's productive potential, and companies reluctant to try to push up margins, the Bank argues that there is no engine to power renewed inflation. While that is clearly true in the medium term, it may not be so once the output gap has been closed and the labour market has recovered its poise. Decades of inflationary behaviour may not be so quickly unlearned. All the more so since the fiscal deficit remains troublingly high, and, as the Bank points out, such difficulties have in the past been resolved by eroding the value of the public debt. Small wonder then that the gilts market remains sceptical that there has been a sea change in the UK's inflation performance. Low real yields will have to wait for harder evidence of government commitment to deficit reduction. Nor do lower short-term rates look imminent. The government's inflation targets look attainable for the next couple of years, but the trend is stable, rather than down. Unless there is a substantial fiscal tightening in the Budget, or the recovery falters, there is little hurry to act. That can hardly encourage an equity market which has whipped itself into a lather over immediate base rate cuts.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Lawson issues warning to Clarke: Common cause for Thatcher era adversaries TWO ERSTWHILE adversaries of the Thatcher era found common cause yesterday, advising Mr Kenneth Clarke, the new chancellor, on how to shape his policies. And Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor until a few weeks ago, this morning warns that government policy could be throwing away Britain's chances of economic recovery. Lord Lawson and Sir Alan Walters, who as former chancellor and a key government adviser disagreed openly during the latter years of Mrs (now Lady) Thatcher's term, yesterday delivered separate warnings over Mr Clarke's stance at the Treasury. Lord Lawson denounced any shift towards a 'go for growth' policy. He said 'no sudden burst of growth can produce anything other than a spurt of inflation'. Sir Alan launched a direct attack on Mr Clarke. He said on the BBC that Mr Michael Howard or Mr Michael Portillo should have replaced Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. Mr Clarke would spend public money to avoid political problems. He added: 'I doubt whether he has the sort of spine needed to control the books.' Lord Lawson, as chancellor, once said that there had been an economic miracle, and pushed the annual rate of growth to 5.1 per cent in early 1988. Last week he was implicitly blamed for Britain's recent economic difficulties by Mr Lamont, who claimed in his resignation speech that the recession of the early 1990s had its origins in the boom of 1988 and 1989. Lord Lawson, speaking at a seminar arranged by the investment managers Capital House, said cycles were the normal pattern of economic behaviour. But he warned of persistent inflationary dangers. 'The dragon of inflation is asleep but is not dead.' he said. 'It is highly likely to waken up again.' Mr Lamont, writing in today's Daily Mail, says government borrowing is 'far too high' and has to be curbed if Britain is to capitalise on falling unemployment and stable inflation. He felt 'pride and pleasure' when he heard that the policies he had put in place had resulted in this week's fall in unemployment figures.</p>

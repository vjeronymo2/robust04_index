			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (2): Admiration and a twinge of envy - Spain is all agog at the scale of the project EXPO '92 IS, on the face of it, a custom-built super-city with a six-month life span on a river island alongside Seville. But it is a lot more than just that and the rest of Spain is muttering as a result. Barcelona envies Seville its 300kph high speed train link with Madrid; and Madrid, cursed with a wholly inadequate airport, wonders why Seville's has passenger terminals quite out of proportion both to its runway facilities and to its projected traffic. Valencia, Spain's third city, is upset about both the train link and the airport and it asks why, as an infinitely busier commercial centre, it has not been favoured with fibre-optic communications, with 70kms worth of ringroads and with a dual carriage highway to Madrid. Spaniards in general would not begrudge Seville a couple of new bridges to help it straddle its Guadalquivir river. But eight? Seville's new bridges have doubled the city's existing number and three of them lead solely to the Expo island. Industrial Bilbao, hemmed in by the Nervion river, could certainly have done with a few of them. The government, led by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who is Sevillian born and bred, attempts to silence the mutterers by insisting that Expo is a modernising vehicle for one of Spain's least favoured regions; that there is far more to the Exposition than the 'come to the big party' hype would suggest. Mr Gonzalez frequently voices fears that Spain's richer areas, near the French frontier, will surge ahead in a Single Market Europe while the Southern belt of Andalucia, which lies within sight of Africa, risks a barren future. The threat of widening regional imbalances during the 1990s is real enough and the Prime Minister is determined to prevent his home region decoupling from the rest of Spain. Expo thus represents development economics with a vengeance. More than Pta900bn in the past five years has been pumped by the government into an area whose GDP is 20 per cent lower than the national average and 54 per cent of that of the EC. According to the government's thinking, market forces will improve Valencia's infrastructure and they will pay for the airport overhaul that is overdue in Madrid. They will also ensure a bullet train between Madrid and Barcelona and beyond to the French frontier. But were it not for Expo no meaningful capital investment, public or private, would have been lured to Southern Spain. Certainly the high speed tracks would never have reached Seville. Now, as Expo prepares to pack in the public, the administration's focus has uncompromisingly shifted from the Exposition itself to what happens afterwards to Seville and to Andalucia. There are few worries about the 18m who are expected to visit Expo. There is more concern over what will occur at the Exposition site when its last visitor has left. A project called Cartuja '93, named after the Cartuja island where the exposition stands, has been set up with the future specifically in mind. It seeks to fuel the technological development of the region by exploiting the global promotion that Seville will receive over the next six months and by re-utilising Expo's infrastructure and equipment. Funded by the Spanish government with the Andalucia regional executive and the Seville city council as minority partners, Cartuja '93 is a state project backed by Spanish and European research bodies including the EC's Institute for Prospective Technology and the International Centre for Technology Transfer. According to Expo commissioner-general Emilio Cassinello, it is 'the most important and ambitious programme' of the whole 1992 extravaganza. The hoped for scientific and technological complex has been given something of a start by those Expo participants that have already said they wish to remain on the site after the show is over. Italy seeks to convert its pavilion into an industrial design centre and IBM will base a Language Technology laboratory in its corporate pavilion with the aim of transferring to Spanish its breakthroughs in voice synthesis and recognition. Siemens and Rank Xerox are also understood to be studying continued use of their Expo pavilions and France has announced that its building will stay on the Cartuja island to house the biggest French cultural and bibliographical research centre outside Paris. Mr Rafael de la Cruz, a former senior official in the Spanish Treasury who was appointed Cartuja '93 chairman last October, says that he remains 'flexible' about the sort of businesses which will be welcomed into the future park. Much of his work to date has concerned with negotiating the details of fiscal breaks and other incentives to attract investment. The project's main promotional effort will start as soon as Expo opens its doors to the public. 'The six months of the exposition are going to be fundamental because they will allow us to explain our objectives,' Mr de la Cruz says. He claims two dozen companies so far have expressed an initial interest in the park. The success or failure of Expo '92 will be judged by the subsequent fortunes of Cartuja '93. Only if the project turns into a genuinely viable scientific and technological park propelling Andalucia into the 21st century will the immense investment be justified and the mutterers silenced.</p>

			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> ENGLISH CITY HOPES FOR NEW IMAGE IN CENTENNIAL  </P> <P> Now England's second-largest city, Birmingham has been around for at least 900  years, but this year it is celebrating a centennial and a new beginning.  </P> <P> It is marking its recovery from a severe recession, and it hopes people will  forget what they thought about the city before and notice what is good about it  now.  </P> <P> In 1889 Queen Victoria, who had her own misgivings about the place, granted  Birmingham its city charter. That is the reason for the centennial. But the  city is using the occasion to bury a recession that wiped out more than 200,000  jobs and ravaged its traditional metals industry.  </P> <P> The city of 1.05 million, which is 100 miles northwest of London, is hoping the  yearlong celebration will clear away its image as a cultural wasteland and  sterile, concrete jungle.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Birmingham-Bashing  </P> <P> Birmingham-bashing is as old as the city itself.  </P> <P> History books tell of Victoria's drawing the shades of her royal carriage to  block out its industrial soot, gloom and grime when she came here on her  travels through the English Midlands.  </P> <P> In her 1816 novel, "Emma," Jane Austen wrote: "One has no great hopes for  Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound."  </P> <P> Explained Andrew Fretter, City Hall's principal marketing officer:  "Manufacturing used to be a very dirty industry. It's not any more. People  haven't yet adjusted to that new situation."  </P> <P> Birmingham has been a trading center for centuries, although the "Domesday  Book" of 1086 rated it one of the poorest in Warwickshire County.  </P> <P> It prospered during the 16th Century as a finishing center and marketing outlet  for basic metal goods from the surrounding area and is acknowledged to have  been the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution long before it became a city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Diverse Population  </P> <P> As England's workshop, Birmingham attracted a rich diversity of immigrants,  primarily from Britain's far-flung empire, until the recession struck in 1979.  "It hit hard," Fretter said. "Vast swaths in the city of Birmingham were left  totally derelict."  </P> <P> Albert Bore, chairman of the economic development committee of the Labor  Party-controlled City Council, said: "The shakeout of the Birmingham economy  was catastrophic, to say the least."  </P> <P> Birmingham's recovery was spurred by the council's sponsorship of several  megaprojects, including a modern science park and the $215-million  International Convention Center scheduled to open in 1991.  </P> <P> It also spent the equivalent of $2.5 million on a bid to host the 1992 Summer  Olympics. The bid failed -- Spain won out -- but it signified the new  confidence of a city that only two years ago came in dead last in a survey of  the quality of life in 38 British cities.  </P> <P> Besides its traditional prides and joys -- more canals than Venice, Italy;  Europe's largest public library; a rating as having the best tap water of any  big city in the world, even if it is piped in from Wales -- Birmingham is  scheduling $2.5 billion for development.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Record Manufacturing  </P> <P> Manufacturing production has outstripped the previous record set in 1979, 80%  of manufacturers are working at more than 90% capacity and unemployment has  fallen to 7.5% from 1982's peak of 16.8%.  </P> <P> Herbert Austin set up his automobile works in the city's Longbridge district in  1905 and pioneered the popular Austin 7. Today, Birmingham holds Britain's only  street-circuit car race, the annual Super Prix, and the auto industry is once  again the city's largest employer, home to the Rover Group's modern robotic car  plant and the Austin Morris division of British Leyland Motor Corp.  </P> <P> Business travel to the city, streamlined by a modern international airport, has  helped create 73,000 jobs and has made Birmingham the fifth-most-visited city  in England. Visitors spent the equivalent of $635 million here in 1987.  </P> <P> "Brummies," as Birmingham's residents are known, concede that they must now pay  attention to how their city looks, as well as how it works.  </P> <P> In the 1960s, most of the city's Victorian heart was torn out and replaced by  featureless concrete and mirror glass buildings, surrounded -- some say  strangled -- by a beltway.  </P> <P> Its architectural style is still symbolized by two of its best-known landmarks  -- the Bull Ring, a covered shopping complex soon to be replaced by a  $688-million continental-style arcade, and Spaghetti Junction, a vast  crisscrossing of roads, cloverleafs and overpasses.  </P> <P> The planners "ripped the city apart in the 1950s and '60s," Bore said. "The  drive to clear the slums and to provide for the age of the motorcar lacked the  sensitivity the planning community now has."  </P> <P> The city has an eclectic mixture of performing arts: UB40, the acclaimed  multiracial rock group, comes from Birmingham; "Spitting Images," the wickedly  satirical puppet show, is produced here, and Simon Rattle, the Wunderkind of  British conductors, has led the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra since he was 25  years old.  </P> <P> In a recent coup, the City Council lured the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet from  London with a $10.3-million financing offer. The traveling section of the Royal  Ballet will move into the 1,950-seat Hippodrome in August, 1990.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Talk of the Week" feature] </F>   [Text] Changes in Vietnam because of the renovation process  have been noted around the world, even by those who do not  sympathize with the political system in the country. They also  identified the cause for these changes for the better.    During his second working visit to Vietnam, Mr. Lee Kwan  Yew,  the famous Singaporean statesman who has been called an adviser  to Vietnam in the market economy by the foreign press, frankly  commented that the Communist Party of Vietnam was the best  leadership for Vietnam. It is capable of maintaining the  country's security. It is also the party that has been leading  the Vietnamese Revolution since its embryo. The party was  experienced and the party leadership was needed by the people.  Vietnam has made steady progress. More changes will take place  in Vietnamese society. Those comments by Mr. Lee acknowledge an  irrefutable fact and that is, in the past, in the present, and  in the future, Vietnam and the Vietnamese need the Communist  Party leaderhip for their renovation process.    There exists in the world a scheme to change the political  system in Vietnam under the theory that pluralism and the  multiparty system are required to create real renovation. Those  who advocate this theory are doing what they can to carry out  their scheme. However, whether they can implement their scheme  remains a question. Meanwhile, the Vietnamese people are  seriously looking straight at the painful and costly lessons  from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. They see that  pluralism and multiparty system only lead to chaos and collapse.  [Words indistinct] fruits of the revolution which were obtained  by blood and sweat of many generations and without which they  cannot have independence, freedom, and prosperity. These  opposition forces are shamelessly making use of the human rights  issue in order to interfere deeply into Vietnam's internal  affairs.    Proceeding from the essence of democracy reserved for the  majority of people, Vietnam is prepared to dialogue to have  those who want to know all aspects of human rights. They  absolutely do not accept the imposition of human rights concept  from any countries as well as all plots which make use of the  human rights issue to interfere in Vietnam's internal affairs.  They are ready to consider opinions saying that the human rights  aspect in Vietnam is different from international law in order  to perfecting laws and courts in service of democracy by the  people and for the people. [sentence as heard]    In Vietnam, we are aware that current democracy must be  further constructed in the interest of the majority of people.  In its essence, this democracy is better than the one who  reserved for the minority of people or a certain class. Only a  democracy by the people and for the people can maintain a  lasting security for the country and lead the renovation process  to success.</p>

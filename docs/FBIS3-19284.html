			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jale Ozgenturk and Ridvan Akar: "Two Most </F> Painful Prescriptions"]    [Text] The Turkish economy has failed to get off to any  kind of a good start for 1994. The public deficits, foreign  deficits, and inflation that have been accumulating for years  ended up surfacing in a foreign exchange crisis...and  devaluation of the Turkish lira, resignation of the Central Bank  president, and the rapid rise of bank interest. Is the crisis  temporary? What will the effects of it be, and what measures  should be taken because of the crisis?    We asked for answers to these questions from Prof Dr Salih  Neftci, who drew up a draft stabilization package for TUSIAD  [Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association] two years  ago, and former DPT [State Planning Organization] Under  Secretary Yildirim Akturk, who was on the team that applied the  24 January measures. Both offered prescriptions that differed  from others by their "radical" approaches.    Neftci said that, first of all, it would be impossible for  the economy's own balances to pull it out of the current  impasse. He stressed that a stabilization package is definitely  required and that timing of the package is more important than  content.    Prof Dr Salih Neftci's views follow:    --It is too early as yet for a stabilization package. For  Turkey to accept a painful prescription it will be necessary for  the crisis to deepen and for inflation to reach three digits.  The crisis will deepen within one and a half to two years. Any  stabilization package whose implementation would be attempted up  until this time would inevitably fail.    --Stabilization packages are a price that all segments of  society have to pay. Today everybody is saying, "Okay, a  stabilization package is absolutely necessary." Everyone throws  the ball into someone else's court when it comes to shouldering  the cost. Which means that no one wants to make the sacrifice  yet for a stabilization package.    --All of the stabilization packages on the agenda at the  moment are similar. However, it is necessary that this  stabilization package concept not be allowed to degenerate.  Stabilization packages have to be radical in content. When the  crisis hits bottom there may be a question of 300,000 public  employees being left jobless, provided they are given  compensation. There may be a midnight decision to shut down a  bunch of KIT's [State Economic Enterprises]. All segments of  society must be prepared for this kind of decision.    --An important feature of stabilization packages is that  society must have confidence in the people who head up this  matter. Bearing in mind that the decisions they make will not  take effect in the short term, all must recognize that the  prescription cannot go forward without confidence in those who  will be implementing it.    --Attention must be paid to another very important point in  moving so rapidly towards the stabilization-package stage. It is  necessary to prevent the great losses that the government could  cause, in foreign loans in particular. If Turkey could not honor  its foreign exchange obligations, a credibility crisis would  occur in which no stabilization package could alleviate the  burden of this economy.    Akturk's "painful prescription," meanwhile, contains the  following measures:    --Turkey has reached the point of an impasse under the  influence of mistaken policies that have been pursued since  1988. Military spending went up. Black holes were created. You  get lost if you get into a black hole. Yet the governments were  positive in order to appear fashionable.    --This tableau created an ever-worsening illness. The tumor  grew rapidly. The scalpel is the only remedy. It cannot be done  without the knife. It cannot be done with drugs. We have to cut  the tumor out to eradicate it.    --The state, employers, workers, farmers, and business must  sit down together now and work out a compromise.    --Goals must be discussed, starting with inflation.  Agreement  must be reached on reducing inflation step by step to 45 percent  the first year, 35 percent the second year, 20 percent the third  year.    --The state must set a goal of 50 percent interest on  borrowing. Price increases in commodities must be at this rate  also. The need for government borrowing must be reduced. Price  increases are the way to do this. The rate must be reduced from  20 percent to 12 percent.    --As regards taxes, a system like advance taxation is  necessary. Tax collection should be turned over to the private  sector to increase tax revenues. Bonded financial consultants  are capable of doing this.    --The most important element is wage-related. Wages and  productivity must be linked. The message must be given that  wages will decline in businesses that suffer losses. Urgent  reduction of cadres is necessary. Only required employees must  remain.    --Some of the KIT's must be closed. Severance pay for  personnel working at the KIT's up for sale, such as Sumer Bank,  should be converted to shares, and employees should become  partners in these businesses.    --Politicians cannot achieve this alone. The police regime  must be given up. It is necessary for everyone to sacrifice. A  solid determination is necessary. This can be resolved only by  an above-party compromise. It does not seem possible for this  government to take stabilization measures, at least until the  local elections.    --The country will be saved if after the elections we get an  extraordinary government able to assume political responsibility  and if a workable cadre is formed that will last for a year.  Otherwise, inflation will reach three digits within a year, and  Turkey will have serious payment difficulties.</p>

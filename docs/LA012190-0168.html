			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO CANDIDATES HOPE THIS IS THEIR YEAR;  </P> <P> POLITICS: ACTIVISTS SEE THE APRIL 10 VOTE FOR 3 HUNTINGTON PARK COUNCIL SEATS  AS THEIR BEST CHANCE TO REMEDY UNDER-REPRESENTATION.  </P> <P> They met in a small room above a local Mexican restaurant, plotting political  changes for a city that never has had a Latino councilman even though its  population is more than 90% Latino.  </P> <P> Several of the 20 Latino businessmen, community leaders and residents who  gathered recently said Latino candidates have their best chance ever to win  seats on the City Council come election day, April 10. The city is facing  financial problems that demand new leadership, they said. And Latino voter  registration has grown significantly in recent years.  </P> <P> For years, voting rights advocates and Latino political activists have pointed  to Huntington Park as a glaring example of political under-representation. It  is a community where an ethnic minority has become a vast majority without  being able to cross the political threshold into City Hall.  </P> <P> "Hey, the Hispanic population is over 90% and there's a big problem there,"  said Rudy Griego, former Chamber of Commerce president who this year plans to  run for council himself or, for the first time, to support Latino challengers.  "It's quite important because the situation has become that we're being taxed  without representation."  </P> <P> Griego and two other Latino leaders, who have declared their candidacies,  complain that none of the city's nine top administrators are Latino and that  just two of Huntington Park's 18 appointed commissioners are Latino.  </P> <P> But such criticisms and talk of political change do not set well with the  city's veteran councilmen. Three of the five council seats will be up for  election. Councilmen William P. Cunningham and Jim Roberts say they will fight  to keep their seats. Councilman Herbert A. Hennes Jr. said he has not decided  whether to seek reelection.  </P> <P> The incumbents said they have been reelected over the years because they have  served the community well. There have been few Latino administrators,  commissioners and developers in Huntington Park because few have applied, they  said.  </P> <P> And the calls for Latino representation on the council smack of reverse racism,  the incumbents said.  </P> <P> "It's not my fault I'm not Latino," Cunningham said. "When I represent people,  I represent them all no matter what color they are. I always have."  </P> <P> Latino candidates have run -- and been defeated -- in every Huntington Park  City Council election since 1970. But the outcome this year could be different  for several reasons, political observers said.  </P> <P> The city's recent financial problems may have weakened the political strength  of the incumbents. Recent money problems forced city officials to lay off 25  employees last October and to cut services.  </P> <P> In addition, Latinos appear to be getting more involved in local politics and  are expected to make up a larger majority of the voters registered for the  April election. Latinos accounted for 53.3% of the city's registered voters in  1988, according to a survey. A Latino had the strongest showing ever that year,  falling 21 votes shy of being elected to the City Council. Community groups  plan registration drives in the months before this year's election.  </P> <P> Griego's break with the council also is viewed as a significant development.  Griego, 50, supported Councilmen Jack W. Parks and Thomas E. Jackson in their  successful reelection bids in 1988.  </P> <P> Two Latino candidates have said they will run in the April election. They are  Raul Perez, who lost the 1988 election by 21 votes, and Luis Hernandez, the  founder of a new citizens group of about 200 people called Huntington Park  Citizens for Responsible Government.  </P> <P> It will be the sixth time Perez has run for the council. Over the years, the  47-year-old loan officer and longtime resident has developed a following that  figures to be enhanced by Griego's support. Perez has been a member of numerous  civic organizations and religiously attends council meetings.  </P> <P> Hernandez, a 29-year-old financial analyst, grew up in and around Huntington  Park. He went to work in New York after graduating from college, but returned  about seven months ago. Hernandez led the campaign against a proposed 7% city  utility tax, which was overwhelmingly rejected by voters last year. He has been  castigating council members on a variety of issues at their twice-monthly  meetings.  </P> <P> If Griego decides to enter the race, he could be the strongest Latino candidate  ever to run, local political observers said.  </P> <P> But Griego has a liability. A former Huntington Park resident, Griego now lives  in Granada Hills and would have to move back into the city by the end of the  month to be eligible to run for City Council. He almost certainly would be  criticized as a carpetbagger.  </P> <P> Griego can point to his involvement in various Huntington Park business and  civic organizations, however. He also has had an immigration business in the  city since 1970. Griego's Americo International provides assistance to  immigrants seeking to become citizens, among other services.  </P> <P> Margin Has Slipped  </P> <P> The incumbents used to be shoo-ins for reelection, but they have seen their  margin of victory slip over the years.  </P> <P> In 1980, for example, the top incumbent voter-getter received 1,626 votes,  while the strongest Latino candidate received 844. In 1988, Councilman Jackson  finished first with 1,151. Councilman Parks finished second with 1,061 votes,  while Perez had 1,040 votes.  </P> <P> "No election was ever very close until last year," said Jackson, who has held  his council seat since 1968, and would face reelection in 1992. "I would think  that under the circumstances as they exist today, there's a good opportunity" a  Latino will be elected.  </P> <P> That would have been unthinkable before Huntington Park's transformation.  </P> <P> Huntington Park is now one of the poorest communities in the nation, according  to a recent report by a Chicago-based urbanologist.  </P> <P> The median household income in Huntington Park was $15,481 in 1985, compared to  $23,905 countywide, according to the latest projections based on the 1980  census. Unemployment in Huntington Park is higher than the county average,  according to figures from the state Employment Development Department. The  average unemployment rate in Huntington Park in 1988 was 7.4% compared to the  4.9% countywide average.  </P> <P> But in the 1950s and into the '60s, Huntington Park was a middle-class white  community that would have provided a perfect setting for "Leave It to Beaver,"  some longtime residents said. Pacific Boulevard, the city's commercial hub,  featured many top-name retail stores that attracted shoppers from miles around.  </P> <P> "In the 1950s we were very much a bobby-socks, poodle-skirt, homecoming-type  community," said Councilman Roberts, who has lived in the city nearly all of  his life.  </P> <P> Residents, businessmen and educators say the transformation began in the 1960s.  </P> <P> The student body was mostly white when Leon Leyson began teaching at Huntington  Park High in 1958. Yearbooks show campus institutions, such as the homecoming  court, changed from predominantly white to Latino by 1975.  </P> <P> By 1980, Huntington Park's population had grown to 46,223, according to the  1980 U.S. Census. Latinos accounted for nearly 81% of the city's residents.  Latinos accounted for 90.6% of the city's 59,000 residents in 1989, according  to projections based on the 1980 census. (The Census Bureau did not separate  Latinos into a statistical category before 1980.)  </P> <P> City officials and local residents cite different reasons for the demographic  change. Some say the 1965 riots in Watts, just south of Huntington Park,  triggered white flight. Others say the children who grew up in Huntington Park  naturally sought to live in newer suburbs outside the city.  </P> <P> Huntington Park became a city of renters. More than 76% of the 15,600 housing  units in the city were occupied by renters in 1988, the last year for which  figures are available, said Rudy Munoz, assistant director of community  development. Relatively low housing prices drew immigrants who have been pushed  northward by economic and political conditions in Mexico and Central America.  </P> <P> The change has affected virtually every corner of the city. Spanish is the  dominant language in the stores and restaurants on Pacific Boulevard.  Restaurants offering carne asada and pupusas, a Salvadoran dish, are as common  as those offering steak and potatoes. Most churches conduct services in  Spanish.  </P> <P> Civic organizations, such as the Kiwanis and Jaycees, have Latino membership  and leadership.  </P> <P> Low Voter Registration  </P> <P> But the makeup of the City Council, the most powerful institution in the city,  has remained unchanged. And the incumbents bristle at any hint that they have  tried to keep it that way.  </P> <P> "The lack of Hispanics on the council is not because of any actions the council  has taken," Councilman Hennes said. "They're free elections."  </P> <P> Local political observers and voting rights advocates identify various factors  that have kept Latinos off the Huntington Park City Council.  </P> <P> Latino voter registration in Huntington Park has been low.  </P> <P> Overall, voter registration in Huntington Park dropped from 19,284 in 1940 to  7,880 last September, according to a spokeswoman for the county  registrar-recorder's office.  </P> <P> Latinos accounted for only 21% of the city's registered voters in 1975 and 30%  in 1980, according to surveys by Richard Loya, a local teacher who has run for  City Council three times. Loya obtained his figures by counting Spanish  surnames on voter registration rolls.  </P> <P> Voter registration drives by local activists helped boost the figure to 53.3%  in August, 1988, according to a survey commissioned by the Southwest Voter  Registration Education Project, a Texas-based voter rights organization that  has an office in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Latino registration has been low, in part, because many of the city's residents  are immigrants who are ineligible to vote, city officials and political  observers said.  </P> <P> In addition, one voter rights advocate theorizes that some eligible Latinos may  have chosen not to register because they have been turned off by a political  system that has excluded Latinos. "They aren't apathetic. They just made a wise  decision. Our votes don't count so we don't vote," said Richard Martinez, the  local representative of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.  </P> <P> Another factor is campaign spending. Incumbents have been able to raise and  spend substantially more campaign money than their opponents. In 1988, for  example, Jackson and Parks ran a joint campaign and spent about $38,000  compared to $7,000 spent by Perez, according to campaign disclosure statements.  </P> <P> The Latino leaders said the upcoming election battle will focus on the city's  poor financial condition and the cutbacks. The recreation program, for example,  has been virtually eliminated at two parks since last year. City Hall also has  gone to a four-day week, closing every Friday. New fees for tree maintenance  and other services have been imposed on residents.  </P> <P> The opposition leaders said they will call for increased police protection to  deal with the city's increasing crime problem. The number of serious crimes,  including murder, rape and auto theft, has risen from 3,573 incidents in 1983  to 4,334 incidents in 1988, according to Police Department statistics. Gang  crime is on the rise, with six gang-related murders reported in the past six  months.  </P> <P> But they also said Latino representation on the council is important, that a  Latino who speaks Spanish will be better able to communicate with and serve the  residents of Huntington Park. A Latino council member would be more interested  in providing services such as civics programs to enable recently arrived  residents to become more involved in city affairs.  </P> <P> In addition, the Latino leaders alleged that the incumbents have excluded  Latinos from decision-making positions and from potentially lucrative city  programs and contracts.  </P> <P> Griego noted that few of the more than 80 redevelopment projects built or  planned by the city have Latino owners. Fewer than five Latinos have been  principal developers in city projects, said Jack Wong, director of community  development. The city has provided many of its developers with greatly  discounted land prices and other subsidies to encourage development.  </P> <P> "We're asking them to give us the same treatment as they give their people,"  Griego said.  </P> <P> But Councilmen Roberts said the economically depressed city has been in no  position to pick and choose developers. "We weren't searching for any race,"  Roberts said. "We were just looking for someone to do projects."  </P> <P> The city's redevelopment program, the biggest source of pride for the council  members, may also be a liability in the upcoming election.  </P> <P> Project delays in the early and mid-1980s left the city's Redevelopment Agency  without enough property tax revenue to repay its debts. As a result, more than  $14 million in city revenue for general services was loaned to the  Redevelopment Agency to cover the debt. Those loans helped contribute to the  cash shortage that forced the layoffs last October, officials said.  </P> <P> But the council members note that the financial drain is easing because  property values in the city's redevelopment zones have risen, producing more  tax revenue to pay the bond debt.  </P> <P> The incumbents said the redevelopment program will prove invaluable to Latinos  and everyone else in the community because the new developments provide  hundreds of jobs and hundreds of thousands of dollars in sales tax money for  city coffers.  </P> <P> They also note that hundreds of dilapidated housing units have been replaced  with new housing through redevelopment. Twenty-five percent of the 1,036  housing units constructed through redevelopment are for residents with low and  moderate incomes, said Munoz, the assistant director of community development.  </P> <P> The upcoming race is likely to test loyalties and strain relationships in  Huntington Park.  </P> <P> Cunningham and Roberts said they have begun seeking the support of local Latino  leaders. One of their supporters is Samuel Magana, a prominent local restaurant  owner who in the past has donated the use of his facilities for fund-raisers.  Magana said he endorsed Roberts and Cunningham because he thinks they are doing  a good job and they were the first to approach him.  </P> <P> "I consider it (Latino representation) important if the Hispanic is as  qualified as the (council members) we have there," Magana said.  </P> <P> Chamber of Commerce President Jessica R. Maes said she has not taken a position  in the upcoming election. But Maes did attend the recent meeting that was  organized by Griego to identify Latino candidates. The chamber president, who  has not campaigned actively in past elections, said the Latino community needs  representatives on the City Council who "understand our culture and our  traditions."  </P> <P> It is that type of interest from established members of the community that is  likely to make the April race the most strongly contested in city history.  </P> <P> Stan Daniels, vice president of administration at L &amp; F Industries in  Huntington Park, has worked on campaigns for incumbents Cunningham, Roberts and  Jackson. He said he will support Cunningham, Roberts and Hennes -- if Hennes  decides to run. But Daniels declined to predict the outcome of the race.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't put five bucks on it," Daniels said. "It's going to be close."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE INS AND OUTS IN HUNTINGTON PARK  </P> <P> INCUMBENTSTerm Expires 1990  </P> <P> WILLIAM P.

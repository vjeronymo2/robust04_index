			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP BEAT: O'JAY FOUNDER EMBRACES GENERATION GAP;  </P> <P> MUSIC: EDDIE LEVERT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND THE APPEAL OF EVERYTHING HE HEARS HIS  SONS' BAND PERFORM ON THEIR JOINT TOUR, WHICH INCLUDES ANAHEIM STOPS, BUT HE  KNOWS SUCCESS WHEN HE HEARS IT.  </P> <P> One of the most potent songs on the current hit O'Jays album, "Serious," is  "Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black," in which the veteran R&amp;B trio addresses  parents who criticize their children's music and ways, taking them to task with  the same vocal vigor they used to apply to back-stabbers and money-lovers.  </P> <P> Founding O'Jay Eddie Levert said the song's message is one the band has taken  to heart, and it's a good thing too: The group has been spending the better  part of this year touring with LeVert, the young multiplatinum-selling group  that includes two of Levert's sons, Gerald, 23, and Sean, 24. The two groups  appear at Anaheim's Celebrity Theatre tonight and Friday.  </P> <P> Reached on tour Sunday in Winston-Salem, N.C., the 47-year-old singer  acknowledged that he finds some of the music favored by younger radio  programmers to be "ludicrous" and that his sons say there are qualities to some  current music that he just cannot hear.  </P> <P> "I'm just calling it as I see it, no more than that, and who am I to judge?"  Levert said with a laugh. "We have to take 'Pot Can't Call the Kettle Black' to  heart. You have to accept the things you can't change, and I continually hear  these things on the radio, and people keep going to the store to buy them, so I  can't fret about it just because I didn't hear it. Who knows everything?"  </P> <P> For the "Serious" album, Levert and fellow O'Jays Walter Williams and Sammy  Strain brought in the "fresh, funky attitude" of Gerald and third LeVert member  Marc Gordon to produce four tracks. Among those are the rap-inclusive hit,  "Have You Had Your Love Today?" which put the O'Jays solidly back on the charts  after a long fallow period broken only by "Lovin' You" in 1987.  </P> <P> Since the group LeVert debuted with "Bloodline" in 1986, it has racked up nine  Top 10 R&amp;B hits, five of which have gone to No. 1. That success has  somewhat assuaged the elder Levert's reservations about his sons entering show  biz (his other son, Ed Jr., is a tour manager for LeVert).  </P> <P> "I didn't discourage them, but I really wanted them to go to college, learn a  craft, and then, if they wanted to do music and it happened for them, great,  but they would already have a craft that would generate a living. But they  didn't want to hear that; they wanted to be in show business."  </P> <P> Having seen firsthand the ups, downs and pitfalls of the musician's life since  he embarked on it in 1958, Levert worried about his children following in his  footsteps.  </P> <P> "I still worry, even now," he said, "But all you can do is basically give them  the right principles and morals, and then the rest is on them."  </P> <P> His advice? "Never be a follower. Never let other people lead you. Try to be a  good judge of other people, and try to judge people how you would want people  to look at you. And to remember that it's not all just about you: It's about  your mom, your dad, sister, brother, cousin and everybody that knows you and  cares for you. What happens to you affects them too.  </P> <P> "I think when you go out with that kind of consciousness about you, you give  things a second thought before you dive into stuff. I'd have to give their mom  a lot of credit for raising them right. She really was the spiritual leader of  the family."  </P> <P> Where many parents and offspring have seen quite enough of each other for a  while by the time the kids are out of school, Levert said touring with his sons  has been no problem.  </P> <P> "This is somewhat of a dream for us, to be performing together and to be doing  well at it. We know we're in business together, and the object is to do the  show. Plus we give each other a lot of room. Like today, they're in the same  hotel, but I might not see them at all until we leave tomorrow."  </P> <P> Levert enjoys his sons' music, as well as the work of producers Jimmy Jam and  Terry Lewis, Bobby Brown and Michael Jackson. "But you've got to remember, I'm  from the old school," he added. "I'm used to seeing Otis Redding, James Brown  and Jackie Wilson in their prime. I had some of my most memorable nights just  watching those guys from the wings.  </P> <P> "That's where I learned how to do a show, and that it comes down to you, the  microphone and the spotlight. That's when the crowd learns to appreciate you  and know that you're a legitimate talent."  </P> <P> Two decades after those giants' heyday, the O'Jays are still known to tear up a  stage. Levert said the shows stay fresh for him because "I still like to  compete. Above and beyond what everybody says, it still is a very competitive  business. They all want to have the No. 1 record -- and to have it be No. 1 the  longest. They all want to be the one to stop the show. And we do too."  </P> <P> Does that rivalry apply on the tour with LeVert? "Naturally. They know that  we've got a reputation of being very energetic performers -- though I don't  know how high the energy, or the kicks, are now that we're older -- but we  still get it up enough to know that we have to at least finesse our way  through.  </P> <P> "We have enough records and enough fans that it matches them pretty well. So  we're both trying out there, in a friendly way."  </P> <P>  The O'Jays and LeVert play tonight at 7:30 p.m. and Friday at 7:30 and 10 p.m.  at the Celebrity Theatre, 201 E. Broadway, Anaheim. Tickets: $20. Friday's  shows are sold out. Information: (714) 999-9536.  </P> <P> </P></p>

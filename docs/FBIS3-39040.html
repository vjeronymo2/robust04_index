			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Athens yesterday had no choice but to  reluctantly acknowledge receipt of U.S. advance notice that  Washington would soon announce the diplomatic recognition of  Skopje by the name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  (FYROM).    "A new U.S. position on the recognition of Skopje is  imminent," government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos told  reporters in the press room. He was referring to an earlier  meeting between Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou and  US Ambassador to Greece Thomas Niles. [passage omitted]    Mr Venizelos was reluctant to express Greek annoyance over  the US move, but refused to offer easy excuses: "The American  side has been preoccupied with this issue and has laboured over  its own position on it for some time now, precisely because it  takes into account the Greek stance. Up to a point, Washington  understands -- or that's how we would like to interpret its  stance so far -- that pressure has to be exercised on Skopje,  because that's where the knotty problem lies, namely, how to  bend the intransigence, the provocative attitude and the  pseudo-irredentism of Skopje." Nevertheless, he finally admitted  there would shortly be "an announcement of Skopje's recognition  by the U.S."    Asked whether the government considered revising its  "deterrent" diplomatic strategy after seemingly having lost its  last trump card (which was the erstwhile U.S. reluctance to  recognise Skopje) Mr Venizelos stopped short of admitting there  was no other alternative. "Deterrence is not a wish, but the  outcome of a determinate balance of international forces, which  is beyond the power of any single country to influence on its  own. However, a deterrent policy implies above all that we as a  country have accurately defined our objectives. And this is  what the government has done, reflecting a popular majority  which transcends the electoral appeal of the (ruling) PASOK  party."</p>

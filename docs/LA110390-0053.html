			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CONGRESS: 35TH DISTRICT;  </P> <P> QUESTIONNAIRES WERE DISTRIBUTED TO CANDIDATES THIS MONTH. ANSWERS HAVE BEEN  EDITED TO FIT THE AVAILABLE SPACE.  </P> <P> Mideast Crisis  </P> <P> Q. Do you generally support President Bush's handling of the Mideast crisis  precipitated by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait? Briefly  explain any differences you have with Bush's actions.  </P> <P> Johnson: No. I believe in a neutral foreign policy.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ultimate Goal  </P> <P> Q. Should the ultimate goal of the United States be to force Iraq to withdraw  from Kuwait? Or should it be to remove Hussein from power or at least greatly  reduce his military capacity, either through war or negotiations?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. Same as above.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weapons Sale  </P> <P> Q. Do you support the Bush Administration's proposal to sell billions of  dollars' worth of additional weapons, including F-15 fighters, TOW missiles and  Apache helicopters, to Saudi Arabia?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. The United States should control these weapons.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deficit Reduction  </P> <P> Q. President Bush and congressional leaders recently agreed to a compromise  package of tax increases and spending cuts designed to reduce the federal  budget deficit by $40 billion this fiscal year and $500 billion over the next  five years. This deal, if it gains final congressional approval, would increase  taxes on gasoline, cigarettes and alcohol; raise Medicare premiums; impose a  new tax on luxury goods, and reduce itemized deductions that can be taken by  taxpayers with incomes over $100,000. Do you support his plan? If no, why not?  What specific actions would you support to cut the federal budget deficit?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. Spending should be cut, specifically in the area of military and  economic aid to foreign countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Campaign Spending  </P> <P> Q. Do you support efforts to restrict campaign spending and reduce the amount  of contributions that can be made by special-interest groups?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. People should be free to spend as much or little as they desire.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Capital Punishment  </P> <P> Q. Do you support capital punishment? If so, do you think it should be imposed  on those convicted of importing or selling drugs?  </P> <P> Johnson: Yes, I support capital punishment, but not for drug dealers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abortion  </P> <P> Q. Do you support a woman's unrestricted right to an abortion within the first  three months of pregnancy?  </P> <P> Johnson: Yes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Abortion Funding  </P> <P> Q. Do you support federal funding of abortions for women who cannot afford  them?  </P> <P> Johnson: No.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unpaid Leave  </P> <P> Q. President Bush in July vetoed legislation that would have required  businesses employing at least 50 people to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid  leave per year for childbirth, adoption or serious illness to employees or  immediate family members. Do you favor this or similar legislation?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. Private employers have a right to make their own decisions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil Exploration  </P> <P> Q. Do you think the present Mideast crisis justifies opening up additional  parts of the California coastline to oil exploration?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. Private property rights justify oil exploration in California,  however.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Assault Rifle Ban  </P> <P> Q.

Do you believe our present strategy of criminal prosecution, interdiction of  supplies, and imprisonment of users and dealers is significantly reducing the  level of drug use in the United States? If no, what should be done?  </P> <P> Johnson: No. Decriminalize drugs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Congressional District 35  </P> <P> The predominantly Republican district includes the Antelope Valley communities  of Palmdale, Hi-Vista, Wilsona and Redman in Los Angeles County.

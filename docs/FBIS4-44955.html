			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Hani Salih: "Workers Do Not Know"] </F>   [Text] New phrases have invaded workers' lives. They now  have to deal with words heard for the first time, such as  privatization, stocks, employee unions, etc.    Citizen understanding and conviction about any new phrase or  situation is undoubtedly the first guarantee of the experiment's  success. In the past the experiment of the private sector  suffered from lack of comprehension by many.    How are employees now receiving these terms that are new to  their lives? How are they dealing with them? Have they indeed  understood them? Has anyone attempted to explain them to them?    'Abd-al-Mun'im Isma'il (age 54), senior overseer, said he  had  heard much about the business sector laws, but understood  nothing about them.    "The company has voluntarily begun deducting part of the  price of shares, but we are asking whether it is for our benefit  and what their system is."    Answering himself, he said: "The trade union committees and  company officials should have explained to employees the  importance of buying these shares and what guarantees will be  provided to workers, because the employees feel afraid of  privatization, and the union committee has no part in the  matter."    He said that he nevertheless approved of buying shares, but  that it ought to be done from conviction.  <H5>  Trading Workers' Shares </H5>   Yusri 'Abd-al-'Aziz, senior overseer, asked: "Can an  employee-purchased share be traded on the stock exchange? Has  the share been registered in my name or not? An employee ought  to be allowed to sell and buy, so that he feels the real benefit  of owning the share. The rules and regulations for stock  ownership ought to be announced among employees."    He warns about a new buyer's pressuring workers in order to  buy their shares when they take ownership of the company. He  also asks what rate of return these stocks will have. These  things should be completely clear to the employees.  <H5>  Decision To Invest--Whose Responsibility? </H5>   Hamsah 'Abd-al-Mun'im Kilani, female employee of the Egypt  Oils Company, said: "A share means a new kind of security.  Employee investment in stock purchasing ought to be voluntary  and not compulsory, because the owner of capital has the right  to decide freely whether to invest by buying shares within the  company, outside it, or through the stock market."    She asked: "When we think of recouping the price of the  share, can its value be converted immediately? At what price? Or  shall we be told to wait until the end of the fiscal year?"    Hanan al-Sayyid 'Abd-al-Khaliq, a female employee, said that  privatization was a word frequently used in recent years, but  she did not know its meaning. However, she believes that the  employee ought to own part of the shares of the company in which  he works. This will strengthen loyalty and affiliation. Workers  should be able to understand the terms of negotiation with new  buyers.  <H5>  Things Not Understood </H5>   Salah 'Abd-al-Maqsud, a member of the elected board of  directors of al-Nasr Automobile Company, said that a union of  shareholding workers has been formed and announced. Government  policy is to give workers ownership of a portion of the stock of  the company in which they work. Offering a company for sale has  not received sufficient explanation; the majority of workers do  not understand it. It was recently announced that a company  could be sold by a number of means--sale by the administration,  by stock purchase, or lease to utilize capacities.    He said these matters were not understood and unclear  because  there was a lack of information. Although it was government  policy and a shift from a directed system to a free economy,  workers must participate in this stage.    He declared that he as a worker did not object to the  company's new buyer. "But we ought to be informed about these  proceedings and their reason from the opening of bidding until  the sale is closed. The length of the selling process causes  anxiety for the workers and affects the company's contract  commitments with buyers of goods or importers of components."    He said that any new buyer must not reduce workers' wages  and  incentives. He must fully utilize productive capacity and employ  the work force without neglecting it.    Workers must be represented in the negotiating procedures as  an observer to guarantee their rights.  <H5>  Interest, Rights </H5>   Nasir Kamil Sulayman, decoration technician in the planning  division of al-Nasr Automobiles, asked whether purchasing stocks  would benefit the workers, and why the worker did not represent  himself when buying the stock.    He said that it was the first time he had heard about the  shareholders' union. Worker stock ownership would safeguard  their rights in the face of buyers and strengthen the sense of  affiliation, but these things had to take place with full  conviction and complete clarity.    'Ali Sa'id Gharib, senior overseer at the bus factory, said  that an employee's salary would not permit him to buy any  shares, even though ownership of company stock was necessary to  strengthen the employee's sense of affiliation with the factory.    He said that he understood nothing the media was publishing  about privatization. He asked whether it was some state secret.    He said that the company had 10,000 employees, although no  more than 3,000 were supposed to be working in it. The employees  were not against discharging part of the work force, provided  they were compensated appropriately and that it was clearly  announced instead of being covered up.    'Abd-al-Wahhab Mubarak said that one should not announce  policies that were not implemented. For example, it was  announced that vacations and foreign travel were being granted  to government employees, while at the same time some companies  were refusing to renew these vacations.    He asked why there was this contradiction and whose interest  it served.    Al-Husayni Muhammadi Mansur, secretary of the Union of  Worker  Shareholders at the Coca Cola Company said that workers had  recently realized the importance of forming the union to  confront the new buyers. They had deducted 3.8 months from their  dividends and 100 pounds from their savings for the purpose of  buying shares.    He asked whether the Union of Worker Shareholders would have  a voice in the board of directors proportional to the shares  they had obtained.    Sa'id Fathi, the trade union committee's representative on  the Coca Cola board of directors, said that the holding company  ought to sell shares to the employees immediately, regardless of  the new purchasers. Selling to Egyptians is better than to  foreigners, and the company's selling shares is better than  selling them by auction.    He explained that the trade union committees at the  company's  factories had been educating workers about the need for cohesion  and for regarding the company's interest as above any personal  consideration. Workers must realize the importance of the coming  period. They will have to change their behavior and increase  production, as is happening in private sector factories, so that  the new buyers find no opportunity to lay off any worker after  the period stipulated for no layoffs.  <H5>  Full Responsibility </H5>   Engineer Mamduh 'Abd-al-Halim al-Sharqawi, head of the Turah  factories division of the Starch and Glucose Company, said that  the operating style was different in the business sector from  what it was under the public sector law--through better  monitoring of production expenses and greater decisionmaking  responsibility for factory leaders, along with full  responsibility and greater ability to compete with imports.  <H5>  Never Heard of Shareholders' Union </H5>   Muhammad Shibl, a member of the trade union committee at the  Starch and Glucose Company, said: "We never heard about the  union of worker shareholders until after the [company's] general  meeting decided to deduct two months of dividends [paid to  workers] for the purpose of buying shares and promised to  subsidize the price of the shares by two similar months."    He said that worker purchase of shares in this manner was  encouraging, because the return on shares in profitable  companies was higher than interest in banks.    He said that 80 percent of the workers had participated in  shareholder development and had bought shares.  <H5>  Sale to Foreigners Rejected </H5>   Hijazi 'Abd-al-Rahim (age 58), senior overseer at the Starch  Company, said he had gone to work at the company before  nationalization, in the days of foreign owners. He indicated  that working with foreigners was very difficult, because it  meant no security for workers when they were sick or  incapacitated. He therefore preferred selling to Egyptians. In  the end they are our brothers: they love their fellow  countrymen, and will not easily treat them carelessly. A  diligent worker should not fear the new management; however,  they want guarantees against dismissal.</p>

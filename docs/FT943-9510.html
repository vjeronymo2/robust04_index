			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Moldova deal hit by Russian spoilers: A look at the complications for Russian army's withdrawal from TransDnestr Two years after a bitter civil war which at one point threatened to draw in neighbouring Romania and Ukraine, the break-away TransDnestr region of Moldova is in danger again of becoming a lightning rod for the discontent of ethnic Russians transformed into an embittered minority by the collapse of the Soviet Union. But this time the governments of Moldova and Russia, which yesterday appeared to be on the verge of an agreement for the withdrawal of Russian troops, are seeking compromise. Russian and Moldovan officials, meeting yesterday in the Moldovan capital of Kishinev in the tenth round of negotiations aimed at smoothing military, political and economic relations between the two states, were reportedly close to an agreement on the most contentious issue: the withdrawal of the Russian-controlled 14th army from the TransDnestr region. The 14th army backed Russian-speaking separatist leaders when TransDnestr violently split off from Moldova two years ago. The Slavic Russians and Ukrainians, who form a majority in the TransDnestr but are outnumbered in Moldova as a whole, refused to be a part of the newly independent state which they feared would eventually re-unite with ethnically kindred Romania. Russia, which has claimed the right to defend ethnic Russians beyond its own borders, at first offered political support to the TransDnestrian separatists, but now appears to attach more value to restoring normal relations with Moldova. However, ethnic Russian politicians and soldiers in the TransDnestr are refusing to go along with the Russian-Moldovan rapprochement. Like the defiant Bosnian Serbs, who have refused to toe Belgrade's new political line, ethnic Russian politicians and soldiers in the separatist TransDnestr region, which is dominated by Slavic Russians and Ukrainians, are expressing a mounting sense of betrayal. Accustomed, when the Soviet Union was still intact, to acting as Moscow's favoured envoys in a non-Russian land they looked to Russia for support when they launched their separatist bid two years ago. They have reacted to the growing rapprochement between Russia and Moldova over the past few months first with bewilderment and now with anger. The danger that the Russian soldiers and politicians in the TransDnestr could become a rallying cause for the neo-imperialist political opposition to President Boris Yeltsin's government in Moscow is heightened by the wide-spread popularity of General Alexander Lebed, the commander of Russian forces in the TransDnestr. The Russian ministry of defence announced plans last week to reassign the outspoken general, who became the darling of hardliners last month after he told Izvestia, a Moscow daily, that Russia needed a military dictator 'like Chile's Pinochet' and described Mr Yeltsin as 'a minus'. The discontent of TransDnestrian politicians manifested itself yesterday when embittered TransDnestrian officials walked out of talks between Russian and Moldovan representatives. A withdrawal of the 14th army will 'automatically lead to an imbalance of forces in the region and to a new spiral of confrontation', General Stefan Kitsak, the TransDnestrian representative, warned. Although often themselves at odds with the ramshackle TransDnestrian government, the equally disenchanted officers of the 14th army are also emerging as potential spoilers of a Russian-Moldovan concordat. Colonel Mikhail Bergman, a 14th army officer and ardent supporter of Gen Lebed, has been battering the Kremlin with an increasingly passionate series of accusations. He told Russian newspapers this week that the ministry of defence had been bribed by arms dealers to dismiss the fire-brand general and darkly warned that if Gen Lebed was ousted Russian President Boris Yeltsin's political future could be in jeopardy. 'Unless the president stands up for Lebed the way Lebed stood up for him, he won't remain in office for more than three months,' Col Bergman told Reuters in a reference to Gen Lebed's critical support of Mr Yeltsin during the failed hardline coup in Moscow three years ago. Col Bergman, whose fiery statements could strike a chord in Russia's poorly paid, demoralised and increasingly disorganised army, said that Gen Lebed 'will be president of Russia'. 'I tell you that as a fact. In Russia, people who are disgraced have always come to power.' This week a meeting of 14th army officers responded to Moscow's attempt to disband their army and reassign Gen Lebed with the declaration that they would not leave the break-away region. Some observers fear that the defiant stance of both TransDnestrian officials and 14th army officers could - despite the best efforts of Moscow and Kishinev - lead to a fresh outbreak of fighting in the impoverished region. If Moscow's already tenuous control over the 14th army weakens further many of the 8,000 soldiers and officers and their massive arsenal could fall into the hands of the bellicose TransDnestrian government. The mounting tension in the area is an unwanted distraction for both Russia and Moldova, whose governments would prefer to focus on painful but increasingly successful economic reforms. However, the increasingly volatile statements of politicians and soldiers in the TransDnestr suggests that Moscow, which helped to ignite the separatist flames in Moldova two years ago, will not find them so easy to extinguish now.</p>

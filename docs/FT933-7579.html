			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Computer lift for Kode A TURNROUND in the computer services business, which benefited from an acquisition, enabled Kode International to more than double its profits in the half year ended July 2. At the pre-tax level profit worked through at Pounds 710,000 (Pounds 330,000), on turnover ahead from Pounds 9.64m to Pounds 12.3m. DCM Services, the computer services operation, turned in a profit of Pounds 123,000 (losses of Pounds 453,000) in the face of 'unusually difficult' market conditions, with intense price competition on maintenance contracts. However, continued success was achieved in non-maintenance. The printed circuit board companies exceeded budgeted profit, but were down on 1992 because of the expected reduced business from one of Kam Circuits' principal customers. However, Kam was able to win orders from new customers and there had been an upturn in activity from existing sources. Earnings in the half year came to 4.3p (2.5p) per share and the interim dividend is raised from 1.5p to 2p.</p>

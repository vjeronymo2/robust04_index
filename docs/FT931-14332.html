			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at Ocean to involve 500 job losses SHARES IN Ocean Group rose 15p to 265p yesterday on the announcement by the freight, environmental and marine services company of changes to reorganise its management and overhead structure. Mr Nicholas Barber, chairman, said: 'We, like most other companies at the moment, are suffering the pain of recession. We're not looking for green shoots and aren't expecting any for a while.' The reorganisation will involve nearly 500 redundancies and is expected to incur one-off costs of about Pounds 8m, which will be taken in the accounts for the year to December 31 1992. It follows July's relocation of the head office from central London to Bracknell and the stripping out of the divisional level of the management structure. Mr Barber said that yesterday's move would not have much benefit in the 1993 year, but that in the full 1994 period, he expected the savings would more than balance the Pounds 8m exceptional costs incurred. Although some operating locations will be closed in the cost-cutting exercise, some '90 or more per cent' of the it concerns management level redundancies. The head offices in Bracknell and Liverpool will lose about 80 jobs between them and the balance will go from the regional offices.</p>

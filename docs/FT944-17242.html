			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Dishonoured cheque shakes economy: In Taiwan's informal system, a small default can make big waves Last week's precipitous drop in Taiwan share prices demonstrates how quickly a relatively minor missed payment could escalate into a spate of defaults in financial markets that thrive on rumour and black market borrowing. Taiwan authorities appear to have largely arrested the damage from TDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 184.3m) in share payments defaults which sparked a 7.8 per cent index tumble between Wednesday and Friday - Saturday's 6.13 per cent fall in the index was blamed on a different cause, rumours from Beijing of Deng Xiaoping's death. Presented with an inadequate formal banking system, the financially sophisticated Taiwanese resort to a panopoly of informal financing techniques ranging from relatively innocuous 'mutual savings societies' to underground lending by financial intermediaries referred to as jinchu or 'money-lords'. A sudden calling-in of loans by these 'money-lords' fuelled the sell-off in the stock market. Much of their money is channelled into securities and their large backers, including politicians and otherwise respectable companies, became nervous and wanted quick repayment. Taiwan remains an economy which runs on cash and post-dated cheques. The importance of cheques in the financial system is such that the ratio of dishonoured cheques to total cheques issued, both dollar amount and number, is published monthly by the central bank and is watched closely as an indicator of economic health. Companies commonly take deposits from employees and shareholders and pay above-market rates of interest to obtain funds to finance their day-to-day operations. Last month, the chairman and chief financial officer of listed Tatung, one of Taiwan's biggest electrical appliance manufacturers, were convicted of taking USDollars 390m in illegal deposits in violation of banking laws. At the centre of lask week's upheaval was a securities brokerage controlled by the Hualon Group, a textile and financial services conglomerate run by Mr Oung Ta-ming. The brokerage, Hung Fu Securities, had failed to honor a Dollars 200m cheque on Tuesday, prompting a rash of rumours and a string of defaults involving 27 domestic brokerage firms. Mr Oung is not only one of Taiwan's richest businessmen and the most prominent player in the stock market but an influential independent legislator in the country's parliament. He is a member of the parliamentary finance committee and has the support of on estimated 30 lawmakers in the 161-member body. Last week, regulators moved to restore calm amid panic share sell-offs by promising to meet defaulted payments out of fund established with contributions from all brokers in the wake of a similar crisis in late 1992. The incident highlights the fragility of the financial system's regulatory framework and its inability to cope with the underground financial markets. Other problems are the dominant role played in the financial system by institutions controlled by the government and the ruling Nationalist party, and the close but difficult to define relationship among the government, business and the underworld. These ties have arguably been enhanced by the advent of democracy in Taiwan over the past decade, which has prompted some politicians to offer favours in return for contributions to their election campaigns. However, senior financial officials are keenly aware of the issues at stake. Mr Liang Kuo-shu, governor of the Central Bank of China, has warned: 'We have to be very careful to prevent too much concentration of economic power in the hands of a few groups. Actually, you can see all the same faces controlling much of industry and finance.' Bringing the unofficial financial markets into line will be difficult. Office workers and blue-collar workers commonly join savings clubs known as 'hui' in Chinese to raise funds to pay for a wedding, put a downpayment on an apartment or invest in the stock market. Then there are the money-lords, which finance share and property speculation requiring larger sums. There are very roughly a dozen jinchu in Taiwan backing some twenty or thirty major market players such as Mr Oung. The money-lords take funds from companies or wealthy individuals wanting a higher return than banks offer. Interest rates start at 2.4 per cent per month and borrowers delay payment at the risk of more than their material assets.</p>

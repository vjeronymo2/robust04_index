			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P>  CITY ATTORNEY WINS ROUND IN DRUG FIGHT  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Atty. James K. Hahn, foiled by the court Jan. 18 in his  immediate attempt to halt drug dealing at six South Los Angeles locations, has  won agreement from owners of two of the houses to evict or bar any tenants or  visitors arrested for possession or sale of drugs.  </P> <P> On Friday, Hahn obtained a preliminary injunction, stipulated to by the owner  of a home at 2179 W. 21st St., where, Hahn said, narcotics trafficking has gone  on despite numerous arrests. The injunction requires the homeowner to install  self-locking doors, exterior lighting and a self-locking fence. Under the  agreement, no one but the owner's immediate family members may live in the  house.  </P> <P> Earlier, the owners of a house at 1733 Longwood Ave. agreed to evict their  tenant, who had been arrested for possession of cocaine.  </P> <P> Hahn's deputies in his new Narcotics Abatement Unit are scheduled to appear  Feb. 16 before Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Kurt Lewin seeking preliminary  injunctions in the four other cases.  </P> <P> Lewin denied Hahn's request for temporary restraining orders on the day Hahn  announced the crackdown on "cesspools of drug dealing" and filed the cases.  </P></p>

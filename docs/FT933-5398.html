			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / Observer: Some sum Reassuring news from the Central Statistical Office yesterday, which reveals that Britain's families were forking out 5.8 per cent more of their hard-earned pennies in 1992 compared with the previous year, despite all that recession doom and gloom. But take a look at the price of accessing this little gem. The 1992 Family Expenditure Survey report itself costs Pounds 24, a tidy 17 per cent more than last year. Seeing that the latest figure for the retail prices index, whose weightings are calculated largely from this very survey, was July's year-on-year increase of 1.4 per cent, the CSO seems to have a slight statistical anomaly to explain away.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mo Shang-wen (5459 1424 2429): "China's </F> Employment System Reform Faces Serious Challenges--Unemployement  Is a Concern That Spans the Century"]    [Text] China has never admitted to having an unemployment  problem. It merely termed unemployment "awaiting employment."  Nevertheless, as the situation developed, in 1993 China began to  admit to the existence of an unemployment problem and officially  formulated and extended measures providing relief funds.  However, many experts have noted that since reform of the labor  system, much of the labor force is bound to become armies of  unemployed. Thus the situation warrants greater attention. As a  joint Ministry of Labor and Ministry of Civil Affairs report  noted, China's unemployment situation is grim. It will become a  centennial worry.    According to reports, just as the State Council received  this  report, five separate long lines of people created disorder on a  nationwide scale while seeking work. Li Peng truly highly  regards the report. He says that we definitely cann ot allow the  unemployment problem to worsen. If peasants or workers rebel,  our CPC will be unable to hold onto state power.    As one concerned noted, the report proposed outlooks for  reform of China's labor and employment systems. There still are  two possibilities:    One, a balanced interim. At present, the masses of  enterprises have begun to be psychologically prepared for  unemployment and smashing the "three irons." They have  considerable psychological endurance to oscillation of the  labor and employment system tracks. At the same time, there will  be no big problems, especially with agricultural development and  in most villages if the unemployment insurance mechanism and the  unemployment-reemployment mechanism are gradually perfected,  price reform goes smoothly, price increases are not great and  the government evenly exchanges functions and streamlines  organization. With these conditions it is estimated that after  three to five years of painstaking work, labor demand and supply  relationships under market mechanisms gradually can be  established. Enterprises also will get great vitality from labor  and employment system reform, seizing the last opportunity of  this century to bring up economic development to a new stage.    China hopes for and seeks such results, yet there are two  crucial non-economic factors:    1. Political stability with no change in the overall  direction of reform;    2. Unemployment problems brought on by labor and employment  system reform do not threaten social stability.    These two non-economic conditions ultimately depend on the  judgment and choice of 1.2 billion Chinese people. Labor and  employment system reform will be a self-revolution. Whether it  succeeds depends on how many people have the determination and  the ability to accept such a revolution.    A short time ago, Shanghai did a sample survey of workers  throughout the municipality; 94 percent of workers appraised  reform and the open door policy as good or relatively good.  Their attitudes toward the next, greater reform dynamics are:  39 percent believe in supporting it provided the overall  situation is advantageous; 35 percent believe in supporting it  provided they can bear it economically. When asked about the  psychology and acceptability of drawing unemployment relieft,  several 10,000s of Shanghai's unemployed replied: 73.3 percent  felt it psychologically hard or very hard to bear; 78.24 percent  had economic difficulties while unemployed.    In electing labor and employment system reform, 15 million  to  30 million workers in state-owned enterprises face grim  challenges. Deeper and more thorough government organization  reform implies that nearly one-half of the 34 million cadres  nationwide must depart from government organizations and enter  the marketplace. These 10 million cadres will face yet an other  grim challenge. There also are those reckoned at one million  potential unemployed--the peasants. The spring of 1994 just  passed and a surging wave of public project workers arrived at  the coastal cities earlier, constituting a serious threat to  railway transport, railway stations and the social order of  large cities. To have a balanced transition of labor and  employment system reform, these all are unavoidable conundrums  which have to be faced and must be resolved appropriately.    2. Urgently step on the brakes and return to a planned  system. This is a result which China does not wish for and  hopes to avoid at all costs. But it is not impossible. In the  process of electing to reform the labor and employment systems,  if most enterprises and workers cannot accept it and the masses  underestimate the unemployment threat, they will be in a muddle  by the unemployment attack. Peasants congest the cities. Price  reforms are not in concert. Serious inflation and large scale  unemployment intersect. Establishment of unemployment security  and reemployment systems have not kept up. This may affect  social order and even bring on a social crisis. Ultimately the  government will have no choice but to resume direct  interference. To continue to ensure high employment goals,  enterprises will have to drop labor and employment system  reforms.    The aforementioned report also noted that in the 1990s,  China  still faces a stituation of total labor supply far greater than  total demand. According to forecasts, in the year 2,000 the  nationwide labor-age population will be 781 million people, up  84 million people over 1990; the average annual growth rate is  1.2 percent. Of which, the average annual growth rate during the  Eighth Five-Year Plan is 1.3 percent, and during the Ninth  Five-Year Plan, one percent.    Compared to the 1980s, in the 1990s the characteristics of  labor resources are:    1. Less population entering the labor-age and lower  growth rates. Between 1991 and the year 2,000, some 188  million people will be of labor-age nationwide, 6.25 million  less than i n the 1980s. The annual growth rate will fall from  3.1 percent to 2.4 percent.    2. More population pulling out of labor-age. In  the 1990s it will be 86.2 million people, up 12.8 million people  compared to the 1980s, up 17.4 percent.    Among the labor-age population, employment posts need not be  provided to a portion of it for various reasons. If the labor  force participation rate is calculated at 82 percent in the year  2,000, the labor supply seeking employment posts will reach 640  million, up 74 million over 1990, or an average annual increase  of 7.4 million people at an average annual growth rate o f 1.9  percent.    The situation of hidden unemployment within enterprises is  relatively serious. Within enterprises owned by the whole people  alone, surplus personnel have reached 15 million, and some  estimate there are 30 million. Surplus rural labor is even more  astonishing. According to predictions, at present agricultural  labor approximately has a surplus of 40 percent.    With overall consideration of various factors, in the next  decade the issue of employment will have to be resolved  nationwide for about 202 million people.    According to methods of calculating the employment growth  elasticity coefficient used by the World Bank, between 1979 and  1988, China's GNP increased 150.2 percent. Social labor grew  35.3 percent. The employment growth elasticity coefficient was  0.235. Inferred from the goal that the total value of GNP will  double by the end of the century, in the next 10 years the  average annual social labor growth rate is only 1.55 percent. A  10 year increase in labor force demand is only 94 million people.    Even if the economic growth rate is somewhat higher, if the  growth rate were eight percent, in the 1990s there would only be  about 120 million new employment posts.    Of course, one also must add the more than 8,000 employment  posts withdrawn from labor-age and vacated. In this way, it can  be expected there will be about 200 million employment posts.    However, two factors must be considered: first, the great  savings on labor force demand from technological advances and  the management revolution. The 1990s will not be like the 1980s  in terms of the employment growth elasticity coefficient  increase. Second, a considerable portion of the population  pulling out of labor-age may continue to remain in their  employment posts. Some of the labor age population may have more  than one job and occupy two or more employment posts.    Thus, this implies that China will bring an enormous  unemployment force into the 21st century. This is a worry that  will last into the next century.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Books: Prophet or misogynist? - Jackie Wullschlager considers Lawrence's sexuality LAWRENCE'S WOMEN: THE INTIMATE LIFE OF DH LAWRENCE by Elaine Feinstein Harper Collins Pounds 18.00, 275 pages ON Lawrence in love, there are two stories. In the first Lawrence the hero was a sexual prophet who understood women and whose novels - especially after the Lady Chatterley obscenity trial - hastened the sexual revolution of the 1960s. About 20 years ago, this character began to be challenged by Lawrence the villain, a puritanical misogynist who wrote about women's sexuality to compensate for his inability in life to relate to them, and whose books still encourage patriarchal oppression. This new account of Lawrence's lovers and friends extends the debate. Elaine Feinstein is perceptive and sympathetic, though offering neither a scholarly nor a radically new approach. But the old anecdotes are told with verve and pace; by condensing so many tales of friendships broken, romance ruined by fear, Feinstein draws a compelling portrait of a man whose defensive dogmatism wrecked his and other lives. Creativity and sexuality are threaded together in Lawrence as in no other writer, so the story of his women is at once the story of his life and the mainspring of his work. A sickly mother's boy who loathed his coal miner father - 'now we are going to be very happy while Father is away,' he announced when his father had an accident - Lawrence was a hit with the opposite sex from the start. In his teens, he began the turbulent but chaste friendships with women which lasted through life. He shared his literary hopes with Jessie Chambers, who launched him into print by sending his work to Ford Madox Hueffer's English Review and waited years for him to become her lover. But he was too deeply in thrall to his mother, and their brief, fumbling affair was an intense disappointment. Their story is Paul and Miriam's in Sons and Lovers, which Jessie called 'a fearful treachery.' Lawrence was unrepentant: 'If I need any woman for my fictional purpose, I shall use her. Why should I let any woman come between me and the flowering of my genius?' The pattern recurred, most famously later in his career in the satire on Ottoline Morell as the pathetic bohemian hostess Hermione in Women in Love, written while Ottoline was keeping Lawrence in funds. In 1912, the neurotic inexperienced writer met the older, worldly woman who could replace his mother: Frieda Weekley, the bored wife of a Nottingham University professor, was a German aristocrat, daughter of Baron von Richthofen, and a disciple of Freud. She repaid her husband for a disastrous wedding night - she perched naked on top of a wardrobe and he coldly ordered her to come down and get dressed - by a string of affairs: her elopement with Lawrence to Germany, and their subsequent wandering across Europe and America, is one of the great literary love stories of our century. John Worthern, in his superb biography DH Lawrence: the Early Years (1991), argued that Frieda's influence led Lawrence to see women's liberation in overwhelmingly sexual terms when the mass of women, like Jessie Chambers, felt as oppressed by class and lack of education as by sexual convention. Feinstein, by contrast, charts his work as the response to Frieda's voracious demands and his own sexual terror. It surfaces desperately in the poems ('Why were we crucified into sex?') and in The Plumed Serpent, which prescribed female passivity and denied satisfaction as a moral duty. It is also the undercurrent of Women in Love, about 'the difficulty in finding salvation through sexual love', and Lady Chatterley, written when Lawrence, like Sir Clifford, was impotent and his wife was betraying him with a younger, wilder man. Feinstein is excellent on Lawrence's mask of cruelty to cover weakness - denying his own TB, he called the tubercular Katherine Mansfield a reptile 'stewing in consumption' whom he hoped would die. Bertrand Russell, receiving a viperish letter which accused him of 'repressed mental blood lust', decided Lawrence 'led straight to Auschwitz'. Lawrence's refusal to face his own repressions created psychologically dishonest characterisations, such as Birkin, the self-portrait in Women in Love. Feinstein is not the last word on the fiction or on the life, but her jigsaw of the paradoxes make between them an account which no Lawrence lover, or hater, would wish to miss.</p>

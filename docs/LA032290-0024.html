			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A San Diego City Council committee authorized City Manager John Lockwood to  begin negotiations with Wackenhut Corrections Corp. to build a privately  operated 200-bed prearraignment jail at the East Otay Mesa Correctional  Complex.  </P> <P> The private jail, believed to be the first of its kind in California, would  house misdemeanor offenders beginning Dec. 6, if the city can award a contract  by April 9.  </P> <P> The full City Council must approve.  </P> <P> However, the city has not yet decided how to pay for the $6.5-million jail.  Negotiations with the county to lease the 4 acres on East Mesa also are  continuing. The city is seeking a state grant to pay for first-year jail costs.  </P> <P> The jail would house some of the more than 100 misdemeanor offenders released  from county jails every day because of crowding.  </P> <P> A selection committee chose from among four proposals to build and operate the  jail. Wackenhut Corrections manages 10 jails in seven states.  </P></p>

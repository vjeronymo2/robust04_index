			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 1 HURT AS GUNMAN FIRES INTO GROUP AT PUB  </P> <P> A man angry over a fight with his girlfriend shot into a group of people in  front of the Leprechaun Irish Pub in Van Nuys, killing one bystander and  wounding another, Los Angeles police reported.  </P> <P> A Salvadoran immigrant, who was not identified, was being sought in the  shooting, police said.  </P> <P> George Huck, 20, of Van Nuys was killed by a bullet in the head, and Gary  Frakes, 20, of Van Nuys was shot in the leg in the incident about 9:30 p.m.  Wednesday in the 6500 block of Ventura Canyon Avenue, Detective Don Tabak said.  </P> <P> Frakes was reported in good condition at Valley Presbyterian Hospital.  </P> <P> Lt. Warren Knowles said that an hour before the shooting, a couple had argued  in the bar and the man, in a jealous rage, struck the woman. The man then left  but was followed by two other women who caught up with him and hit him back.  </P> <P> He left in his car but a short while later telephoned the bar and "said he was  coming by to get even," Knowles said.  </P> <P> The threat was announced in the bar, and several patrons either left or went  outside to move their cars from the front of the building, Knowles said.  </P> <P> "After doing that, they were still standing outside when the suspect drove by,"  Knowles said. "They were clear targets because now there were no cars in  front."  </P> <P> The gunman fired six to eight shots at the crowd, striking Huck and Frakes,  police said. The victims apparently did not know the suspect or were acquainted  with him only through the bar. They had no connection to the earlier fight  between the suspect and his girlfriend, police said.  </P> <P> Police were searching for a brown Toyota Celica with white hubcaps that  officers believe carried at least two men during the shooting.  </P></p>

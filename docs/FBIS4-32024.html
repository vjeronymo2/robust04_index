			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Asen Michkovski, National Assembly deputy </F> for the Alternative Social-Liberal Party, by Todor Tokin; place  and date not given]    [Text] [Tokin] Mr. Michkovski, unlike most of your  colleagues in the ASLP [Alternative Social-Liberal Party], you  have not yet left the NSD [New Alliance for Democracy].    [Michkovski] I am still considering my decision. I think  there is always time to leave any organization, including a  parliamentary group. In this case, I am following the old  Bulgarian proverb: "The quick bitch gives birth to blind pups."  The main qualities that anyone who calls himself a politician  in Bulgaria should have are patience and sober thinking. In  politics I only support pragmatic actions that can really lead  to something important. I have proved this during the last five  years. The ASLP, of which I am deputy chairman, also displayed  its pragmatism, and I hope that this will continue in the future.    [Tokin] The ASLP was expelled from the SDS [Union of  Democratic Forces] because it supported Professor Berov's  government. Have you any regrets that this happened?    [Michkovski] ASLP Chairman Nikolay Vasilev most accurately  described the ASLP's expulsion from the SDS when he said that  the SDS is shedding its own brains. All in all, this has been  confirmed. Prof. Vasilev's definition has even been surpassed by  the SDS leadership's cretinism. The recent acts of the  so-called blue coalition can only be described in specialized  medical literature. Psychopaths, cretins, and people who cannot  see further than their own noses have dug a grave for the  coalition, so that it has no importance for Bulgaria's future.  The actions of Filip Dimitrov, Edvin Sugarev, and other  individuals with unstable psychological and hormonal conditions  have succeeded in really turning the SDS into a sect, making  them people of no importance for the next National Assembly, in  which they will have 10-12 seats. They have little chance in  the struggle for power, and they do not even want power. They  were in power, and at the moment they have a unique opportunity  to seize it again, but they do not want to. Their only aim is  to remain eternally in opposition and to guarantee places for  themselves.    These are people with no love for their fatherland. Their  blind allegiance to the United States or to anyone else, acting  as if Bulgaria was a satellite, has completely destroyed the  country's image. They continue to go about abroad defaming  their native land. In general, these people are bankrupt.    [Tokin] Will the ASLP not expel you because of your refusal  to obey the decision of the ASLP Political Council to leave the  NSD?    [Michkovski] The ASLP is the most democratic structure in  Bulgaria. Its organizational statute does not provide that its  decisions are binding on anyone, and this includes the ASLP  deputies. Furthermore, I have not said that I will not leave the  NSD, I am simply making use of the democratic provisions of the  party's statute to follow my democratic convictions.    [Tokin] Do you then concur with the reasons given by your  colleagues who have left the NSD, such as Prof. Nikolay Vasilev  and Georgi Kostov?    [Michkovski] I have absolute respect for the motives of all  of them, including the individuals whom you mentioned. We  simply differ in our assessment of the political moment, and  most of all the political future of such an act. I do not  consider that any formation that proclaims itself as so-called  liberals can win the elections in Bulgaria, nor even form part  of the political spectrum. Bulgaria is a state with a  totalitarian past, so that here the reforms can only be carried  out slowly and gradually, and on this subject I myself might  admit my mistakes. I too was a supporter of the shock therapy,  but this was about two and a half or three years ago. Now I  think quite differently. Bulgaria's evolution toward becoming a  modern state should proceed calmly, without shocks and without  stigmatizing anyone.    [Tokin] What do you think about the BSP [Bulgarian Socialist  Party]?    [Michkovski] What the BSP should do, but has not yet done,  is very simple. It needs public legitimization both within and  outside the country. It should admit the errors of those whom  it succeeded and condemn those responsible for bringing the  country into the present situation, but in no event is anyone  entitled to strip the BSP of the right to be a legitimate  political force. I am no supporter of the BSP and cannot be  one, but, objectively considered, things show that the Bulgarian  Socialists have a correct strategy and, all in all, it is only a  question of time before they assume power. In general, I think  that in the next parliamentary elections, whenever they take  place, a left-of-center coalition will really sweep away  everything else from the Bulgarian political scene.    [Tokin] Does the ASLP have a place in this coalition?    [Michkovski] This I am not sure about. In the final event,  the congress is the body that can define our political allies,  coalitions, and so on. I believe that social liberalism has a  place in such a coalition, everything is a question of how one  weighs things up. However, this should never be regarded as an  act of petition. The ASLP is the most intelligent political  formation and it has proved this during the last three years:  Starting with an organization consisting of a group of 28  people, it fought its way to power; it has taken part in power  for two and a half years, and I think that it will remain a fact  in the government of the country for a long time to come.    [Tokin] Will you personally continue to support the  government?    [Michkovski] I personally support only those of the  government's actions that relate to solving national problems,  such as the efforts to finalize the settlement with the creditor  banks of the London Club. I also support all actions by any  department of the Bulgarian Government that are aimed at  privatization and increasing the proportion of private ownership  in the country. I support any actions by the government that  encourage the development of Bulgarian national capital and  create successful Bulgarian businessmen. With the same proviso,  I also support what the government is doing to forge an  independent Bulgarian foreign policy.    [Tokin] Does the NSD have a future?    [Michkovski] It never has been a political formation, merely  a parliamentary alliance created to support sensible  legislation, nothing more. Politically speaking, the NSD has  never had any particular chances, and the same is true of the  future. Only the strong and emerging party formations have a  future.    [Tokin] Your colleagues who left the NSD claim that one more  government may be formed within the term of this parliament. Do  you share this view?    [Michkovski] I am skeptical. The only possibility is an SDS  government, but the degree of cretinism within the SDS  leadership has gone beyond all normal bounds. The Berov  government is the last government that this parliament will  have. I believe that no one in the country really wants  elections, and I do not think they will be held this autumn.  However strange it may seem, Prof. Berov's weak government will  turn out to be quite tough and will last until the end of 1994.    [Tokin] A Sofia daily called you "the terminator." How do  you react to this description?    [Michkovski] I can only express gratitude for such an  assessment, but unfortunately my own view is different. I am a  calm and normal person with no claims of being a terminator.</p>

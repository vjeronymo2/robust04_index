			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: Bangkok Bank climbs on higher fee income Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, yesterday announced a 31.9 per cent rise in net profit to Bt13.90bn (Dollars 546m) last year from Bt10.54bn in 1992. Pre-tax profit increased 31.7 per cent to Bt21.35bn from Bt16.21bn, while assets rose 17 per cent to Bt782.87bn from Bt666.01bn. Thailand's commercial banks have all profited from wide spreads between lending and deposit rates, but Bangkok Bank executives yesterday attributed much of last year's improvement to higher fee income from value-added services. Siam Commercial Bank, meanwhile, said its 1993 net profit rose 16 per cent to Bt4.85bn from Bt4.18bn in 1992, while pre-tax profit was up 15 per cent to Bt6.70bn. Assets rose 18 per cent to Bt325.08bn. Some stockbrokers said the fourth-quarter results of the two banks were slightly below expectations. Thai Farmers Bank last week announced that its 1993 net profits had risen 52 per cent to Bt7.94bn, although the bank later disclosed that Bt1.5bn of that came from the sale of shares in finance and securities companies; excluding share sales, TFB net profit was up only 23 per cent. Bangkok Bank's management was described by one stockbroker yesterday as 'a little bit directionless' following the departure last month of Mr Vichit Suraphongchai, the bank's president. Bangkok Bank is planning to issue Dollars 400m to Dollars 500m of convertible, 10-year Eurobonds, the largest such issue to date by a Thai company, in order to strengthen its capital base.</p>

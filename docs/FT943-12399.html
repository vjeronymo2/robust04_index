			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Camdessus to hold Kiev talks Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, is scheduled to make his first visit to Ukraine tomorrow to discuss financial aid in a signal that the new Kiev government is committed to painful economic reforms. Mr Camdessus' trip echoes his role in Russia, where he negotiated a loans agreement in spring which bolstered Moscow in pursuit of economic reforms. Meanwhile, Ukraine's repeat parliamentary polls, held on Sunday, left 92 seats unfilled and elected only 20 new MPs of centrist and moderate orientations, according to preliminary results from the Central Election Commission. Low turnout disqualified 47 districts, which will conduct further repeat elections later this year. In another 45, no candidate won enough votes and the top two contenders will hold run-offs on August 7. Observers predicted that even this small infusion of moderates would help to minimise the domination of Communists and leftist allies in the 450-seat parliament, because factions are so small. There are nine factions in Ukraine's parliament and three-quarters of MPs were elected last March and April.</p>

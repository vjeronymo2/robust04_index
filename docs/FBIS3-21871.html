In their hurry to disappear, they left the key in the ignition.  When the police searched the van they found a bag with several  molds containing an unknown substance. The unit in charge of  fighting organized crime within the General Police Inspectorate  checked these molds and found that they contained over 12  kilograms of heroin. We have found out from reliable sources  that other caches of drugs were recently seized when several  international drug dealing networks were destroyed.</p>

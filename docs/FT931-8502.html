			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Job agencies attack curbs in EC RESTRICTIONS on temporary work agencies are hindering job creation in the European Community, according to the International Confederation of Temporary Work Businesses. The employers' group has filed a formal complaint to the European Commission about restrictions in Italy, Spain, and Germany and it has written to Mr Jacques Delors this week asking for a 'quick response.' Mr Wim Ruggenberg, federation president, told Mr Delors that in view of concern about EC unemployment he should immediately lift all restrictions, saying 'our industry provides a mechanism for keeping in touch with the job market and in work, even if temporary.' He quoted a French survey which said 25 per cent of temporary workers get permanent jobs as a result of work found through the agencies. In the Netherlands and the UK temporary work agencies, such as Manpower, are encouraged. In Germany they are legal but severely restricted, but are illegal in Greece, Italy and Spain. The complaint has, so far, made little progress in the Commission despite support from the single market and competition directorates. The social affairs directorate is more hostile although its view may change if the International Labour Organisation revises its long-standing reservations on temporary work agencies. The three countries being targeted have all promised some reform but it is unlikely to be enough to satisfy the employers' federation. Greece has not been targeted because the potential market is too small.</p>

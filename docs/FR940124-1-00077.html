This subpart describes the procedures and criteria to be used for the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department invited individuals and representatives of groups involved in student financial assistance programs to the four regional meetings. At each meeting, the Department provided for a comprehensive discussion and exchange of information regarding the implementation of subpart 2 by providing participants with an issue paper that raised issues and questions with regard to the statutory provisions included in subpart 2. The following is a summary of the information provided to the Department by participants at the regional meetings. The section of the proposed regulations that is the subject of the information is provided as a reference. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Separate and independent requirement_&sect;602.3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants in the regional meetings suggested that, in order for an accrediting agency to obtain a waiver of the requirement that it be separate from and independent of, both administratively and financially, any related, associated, affiliated, trade association or membership organization, an agency should have to demonstrate that (a) its parent body has no role in making or ratifying its accrediting decisions, (b) it has sufficient budget and administrative autonomy to carry out its required accrediting responsibilities, and (c) information obtained in the course of its accrediting process is not made available to the parent body unless it is public information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Unannounced visits by the Secretary_&sect;602.10.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants discussed the conditions under which an unannounced visit to either an accrediting agency or an institution or program that it accredits, as part of the Secretary's comprehensive review and evaluation of the agency, was appropriate and suggested that such a visit would be appropriate only if (a) the Secretary had evidence of the agency's non-compliance with the statute or Departmental regulations and (b) an unannounced site visit would assist in investigating the non-compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Review by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity_&sect;602.12.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants discussed the role of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity in reviewing the applications of accrediting agencies seeking recognition by the Secretary and suggested that an agency should have an opportunity to appeal the Advisory Committee's recommendation before the Secretary reaches a final decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Limitation, suspension, or termination of recognition_&sect;602.14.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants discussed the process the Secretary should use in determining whether to limit, suspend, or terminate an accrediting agency's recognition if the Secretary determines, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that the agency has failed to satisfy one or more of the requirements for recognition. They suggested that the proposed regulations should afford the agency due process by providing (a) written notice to the agency, (b) opportunity for the agency to respond in writing, (c) public review by the Advisory Committee, (d) a written decision by the Advisory Committee, and (e) an appeal to the Secretary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

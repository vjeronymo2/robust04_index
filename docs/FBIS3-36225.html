			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Yelena Kuznetsova from the </F> Federation Council]    [Text] The prime minister's speech was expected. When it  turned out that Viktor Chernomyrdin was chairing the presidium  session, the work of deputies nearly reached an impasse and was  almost reduced to a discussion about the place of the Federation  Council in the political and power structure. Senators regarded  the fact that the prime minister was busy as a political step  aimed at diminishing the role of the upper chamber. It was the  first time that claims were made to Vladimir Shumeyko, who, in  the opinion of people's electors, did not ensure that the head  of the government was present and thus, I quote, behaved  dishonorably.    Work returned to normal when Economics Minister Aleksandr  Shokhin appeared on the rostrum and gave a forecast on the  social and economic development in 1994. Its main theses are:    -- to conduct a moderately tough financial policy, which  would allow the inflation rate to drop to 20 percent -- in  January it was higher due to the political situation. Figures  of 7 to 9 percent are being expected by the end of this year;    -- to make the financial and tax policy tougher;    -- to ease restrictions on exports and to render support to  the country's own manufacturers.    The economics minister agreed to the criticism that  insufficient attention is being paid to the social policy. He  assured those present that effective measures will be adopted in  the near future.    This was not the last meeting with the government on  Thursdays because, as a result of a name-vote held for the first  time, a decision was adopted to wait for the prime minister's  appearance, and to hear his report at any time. Thus, it was  said that the government leadership should take note of the  opinion of the upper chamber that will be giving recommendations  regarding amendments to the economic policy.</p>

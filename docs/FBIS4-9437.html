			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 24/4/1994 -- After the final  session of the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest,  Romanian President Ion Iliescu commented for ROMPRES the  problems of the Middle East and the conflict in former  Yugoslavia from the perspective of the relevant contacts during  the conference.    The works of the Crans Montana Forum conference in Bucharest  have offered the opportunity for a useful meeting between  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and PLO Leader Yasir  'Arafat and have increased the chances for peace in one of the  most blood-stained zones of the world, said President Ion  Iliescu.    To a question whether the contacts among the sides of the  conflict in former Yugoslavia were bringing hopes as much  encouraging, the Romanian president underlined the fact that  Bucharest had enabled the Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian  representatives to get informed with the opinions of the  international community about this conflict but also to have  contacts meant to get closer the divergent views.    "I had contacts with Yugoslav Foreign Minister Vladislav  Jovanovic, with the president of the Parliament of Croatia,  Stipe Mesic and with the foreign minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Irfan Ljubijankic. I have convinced myself that this conflict  is not an ethnic conflict and I have made all the efforts to  convince the sides to sit at the negotiations table. I have  succeeded to ease way for contacts, except for Stipe Mesic who  said he had no mandate to meet Jovanovic. The mere fact that  part of the players on the Yugoslav scene have meet and  discussed is a gain facilitated by Bucharest for the cause of  peace in former Yugoslavia," said President Iliescu.</p>

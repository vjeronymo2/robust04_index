They said police, acting on a tipoff that the Georgians who  came to Turkey about a week ago were looking for a market to  sell the uranium, contacted them as potential buyers.    When police tried to detain the Georgians, a brief clash  broke out and the sellers were wounded and arrested.    The Georgians were asking $150,000 for one kg of uranium.    It was not immediately clear how the Georgians acquired the  uranium but after the collapse of the former Soviet Union there  have been widespread reports of stolen nuclear materials.    The seized uranium was sent to Turkey's Atomic Energy  Institute for further research.</p>

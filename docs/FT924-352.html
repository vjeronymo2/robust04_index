			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Brenda Dean seeks top Acas post MS BRENDA DEAN, formerly Britain's senior woman trade unionist, and Mr Mike Bett, deputy chairman of British Telecommunications, are the front-runners to take over the chairmanship of Acas, the government conciliation service, David Goodhart writes. Sir Douglas Smith, the current chairman, retires next year and his successor will be announced next month. Along with several other prominent public-sector jobs, such as chairmanships of the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Acas job has for the first time been publicly advertised rather than filled privately. Another prominent applicant is thought to be Mr John Hougham, head of industrial relations at Ford UK. Mr Hougham would neither confirm nor deny that he had applied. Acas's terms of reference will be changed under the Employment Bill, currently going through committee stage in the Commons. Its new remit will be to 'improve' industrial relations rather than 'encourage the extension of collective bargaining'. Ms Dean, 50, former leader of the Sogat print union, resigned in May as deputy general secretary of the GPMU, which was formed by the merger of Sogat and the NGA.</p>

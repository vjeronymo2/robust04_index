			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / International Company News: The Limited earnings down 20% The Limited, the US clothing retailer that has been struggling to counter poor sales of women's fashions, reported a 20 per cent fall in net profits to Dollars 196m from Dollars 244m for its fourth quarter. Turnover rose from Dollars 2.3bn to Dollars 2.4bn, partly because Victoria's Secret and other specialty retailing subsidiaries did well and partly because the group opened more stores, but this was not enough to outweigh the sharp decline in profit margins at the group's The Limited and Lerner New York chains. Earnings per share fell from 67 cents to 54 cents. The final quarter's poor performance produced a decline for the full year, pulling net income down to Dollars 391m from Dollars 455m and earnings per share to Dollars 1.08 from Dollars 1.25 - although turnover rose to Dollars 7.2bn from Dollars 6.7bn. The company's shares rose Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 1/8 , just off their 12-month low of Dollars 16 5/8 . The Limited said it opened 322 stores last year, remodelled 239 and closed 124, producing a net addition of 198 stores and 1.57m sq ft of selling space. This year, the company plans to add 400 stores, remodel 200 and close 100 for a net addition of 300 stores and 2.1m sq ft of space. Mr Leslie Werner, chairman and chief executive, said he believed the group was well positioned to take advantage of the current year's emerging fashion trends.</p>

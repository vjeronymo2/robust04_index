			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb -- The third round of talks to settle  the Abkhazia-Georgia conflict, sponsored by the UN and SCSE and  with Russia as mediator, ended today in Geneva without the  signing of a final document. ITAR-TASS was told by the press  service of the plenipotentiary representative of the Republic of  Abkhazia in Moscow that the talks dealt with peace guarantees in  the region, return of refugees, and Abkhazia's political status.    The Abkhazian side put the failure to sign a final document  down to the Georgian delegation's "uncompromising position" over  a political status for Abkhazia. According to the press  service, this status amounts in essence to the relationship of  imperial center and colony, a lack of desire to accept current  realities. This toughening of the Georgian government's stance  is attributed by Abkhazia to "the signing of a treaty with  Russia and hopes that Russian troops will police Abkhazia, and  also an attempt by certain circles in the West to preserve the  Shevardnadze regime".    Despite the difficult nature of the talks, it was decided to  continue the search for a political solution to the  Abkhazia-Georgia conflict.</p>

The source said the subject was broached by the former enemy  powers in a two-day meeting in Tokyo of military brass,  government officials and academicians from the U.S., Russia and  Japan. The closed-door discussions on Tuesday and Wednesday,  the first of their kind to be participated in by all three  countries, took place in the Trilateral Forum on North Pacific  Security organized by the Japan Institute of International  Affairs.    According to the source, the participants discussed the  promotion of a "strategic partnership" between the U.S. and  Russia. He said it appeared from the discussions that talks on  joint military exercises were already under way. There were  suggestions that Japan also participate, but the idea was  dismissed by Japanese participants as premature, he said.    The U.S. participants included Assistant Defense Secretary  Graham Allison and Adm. Frank Bowman, deputy director for  political and military affairs on the Joint Chiefs of Staff at  the Pentagon.    Attending from Russia were Deputy Foreign Minister Georgiy  Mamedov, Gen. Andrey Nikolayev, head of the Russian Federal  Border Service and commander-in-chief of the border forces, and  Col. Gen. Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of Joint Staff of the  Armed Forces.    Japanese participants included Yoshiji Nogami, deputy  director general of the Foreign Ministry's Foreign Policy  Bureau, and Maj. Gen. Toshimasa Fujiwara, a member of the  Self-Defense Forces' Joint Staff Office in charge of plans and  policies.    The source said the Russian side expressed a desire to see  Russia's entry into the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  forum in the future, despite an existing moratorium on adding  new members. The meeting also covered such subjects as Russia's  new military doctrine, North Korea's suspected nuclear  development program, and the future situation surrounding China,  he said. Japanese participants endeavored to keep discussions  of China to a minimum since no Chinese participants were present  at the meeting, the source said. While China and other  countries may be invited to future meetings, there was not yet  any consensus on expanding participation, he said.    Two more such meetings are planned, the next to be held in  Moscow, possibly in September, after which a set of policy  recommendations may be issued to the governments of the three  countries.</p>

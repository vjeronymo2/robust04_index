			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / PM backs Lilley on welfare reform The prime minister yesterday gave strong backing to a speech earlier this week by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, calling for wide-ranging reform of the welfare benefits system. Mr John Major said it was right to point out that the costs of many aspects of welfare were outstripping economic growth across the western world. He said: 'What we need to do to maintain the welfare state is to make sure that we concentrate wealth where it really needs to be.' Mr Lilley's call for the welfare state to be replaced by a 'welfare society' was designed to sketch out the principles behind the government's long-term review of social security spending. But it was also seen at Westminster as an attempt to soften up public opinion for a harsh squeeze on welfare benefits in next week's Budget. One of the main principles for welfare policy outlined by Mr Lilley was a belief that people should take more responsibility for providing their own retirement provision. He also stressed that the Pounds 80bn social security budget, Whitehall's largest spending programme, would have to be contained in forthcoming years. Tuesday's Budget should contain measures that provide a step in that direction. The Budget may include a squeeze on invalidity benefit and a reduction in the statu-tory sick pay subsidy to employers. However, Mr Lilley said in a radio interview yesterday that the government would continue to stand by its commitment to maintain child benefit. 'We are committed to maintaining child benefit,' he said. 'We have a clear manifesto pledge. And I am very old-fashioned, as you know, about manifesto pledges.' He said that it would be 'very difficult' to tax child benefit. Mr Lilley's approach drew vehement criticism from opposition politicians, who regard it as a precursor to drastic benefit cuts in the Budget. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, last night attacked what he called the 'DIY benefits society' proposed by the minister, and warned that it would trap people in poverty and homelessness. Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security minister, also criticised the speech, saying that under Mr Lilley the welfare state was in danger of becoming a stigma-ridden 'second-rate safety net'. Mr Lilley's speech was the latest attempt by a minister to focus public debate on a long-term review of the welfare state. In recent months Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, has been conducting a fundamental review of welfare state spending.</p>

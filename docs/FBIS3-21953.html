			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Judicial Police Commander Brigadier General </F> Salim Salim by Claudette Sarkis; date and place not given]    [Excerpts] Sarkis: A large quantity of hashish  was seized recently. Then there were some other security  incidents, preoccupying the Government and the security  services. Will these incidents affect the security measures  that were decided on at a series of meetings, and will they also  affect the counternarcotics campaign?    Salim: There is a difficult drug problem all over  the world. However, we in Lebanon have decided to confront it,  no matter the cost. Some states are better equipped than we but  they still have a drug problem, whether in regard to the  quantities of the drugs or the numbers of addicts and users.  These states include the United States, France, Switzerland,  and Germany.    Despite our modest resources, in 1993 we in Lebanon seized  large quantities equal to half the amount seized in the whole of  Europe. Last year we seized about 22 tons of hashish. This is  three and a half times the 6 tons that was seized in the  previous four years -- 1989, 1990, 1991, and 1992. These  figures show that a great effort was made last year, in which we  also seized 292 kg of cocaine, compared with 37 kg seized in the  previous four years. We also arrested 1,400 drug merchants and  traffickers.    Sarkis: Does this mean that the counternarcotics  campaign is continuing?    Salim: Naturally. Especially in the Southern  Suburb [of Beirut]. Let us be frank and realistic. This is not  the first time we have entered this area. We have entered it  before and arrested wanted persons. Ordinary citizens do not  know this because of the lack of media coverage. We work far  from the limelight. The suburb is part of Lebanon and we reject  any special status for it. Last time an incident occurred in  which two judicial police were injured by a hand grenade tossed  from a distance in a place crowded with people. However, the  incident did not prevent the policemen from continuing their  searches, seizing a quantity of hashish, and arresting four  dangerous wanted persons.    We cannot prevent a citizen from tossing a hand grenade  while  we are carrying out our duty, whether in the suburb or elsewhere.    Sarkis: Why? What do you mean?    Salim: Because we work in silence. We do not  speak. We cannot broadcast that so and so deals in narcotics  and we will arrest him. The media here would cause harm and not  benefit.    Sarkis: Naturally you do not announce such news.  However, announcements have been made on the seizure and  destruction of narcotics.    Salim: Yes, last year we carried out five  operations to destroy narcotics seized in Lebanon. The  destruction of the narcotics took place in the presence of  liaison officers who had come from Cyprus at our request.    Sarkis: Why this presence?    Salim: Cyprus is a liaison center for officers  from Europe and the United States. We asked them to come so  they could see for themselves the seized quantities. Rumors  circulated in the past that cocaine had been seized but that  what was being destroyed was milk powder or white cement or  something else resembling cocaine. We insisted that they come  and inspect the material destined for destruction. This  actually occurred. We put a small quantity of these drugs in a  plastic bag containing a liquid. When the drug is mixed with  this liquid, it shows what kind of narcotics it is. There are  three colors marked on the bag. Violet means heroin, black  means morphine, and blue means codeine extracted from opium.    Last time, I told them when we arrived at the destruction  site that I had the testing bag with me. They answered that  they too had a testing bag. They were embarrassed to use it in  front of us after we insisted that they do so. On departing  Lebanon, they said they were expecting that only half of their  questions would be answered. They, however, left Lebanon fully  confident that we are completely doing our duty.    Yesterday, I received a telephone call from a U.S. officer  in  Cyprus. He congratulated us on the seizure of the hashish haul  in the Southern Suburb. Let us be frank, in the past the Suburb  sheltered outlaws and no one could enter it. We entered it. We  did not meet any resistance from the patriotic organizations,  who care about their reputation because we all agree that drugs  are an epidemic we must fight. Those who are confronting our  personnel are not [Hizballah] Party or [Amal] Movement elements,  but criminals.    Sarkis: What is the role of the Syrian Arab Forces  and the other Lebanese forces in fighting narcotics?    Salim: The Syrian brothers have greatly helped us  in combating narcotics. They still do so. The most important  help was their destruction of narcotics in al-Biqa' Valley,  where an estimated 200,000 dunams [one dunam equals 1,000 square  meters] planted annually with poppies, yielding a crop of 800  tons of hashish and 700 kgs of heroin.    Thanks to cooperation with them and with the Lebanese Army,  the State Security Department, and the Public Security  Department, we got results. We are all one team fighting this  epidemic, because everyone suffers from it. It is a very  dangerous disease that is worrying the whole world. [passage  omitted]    Sarkis: Several drug-trafficking operations have  been foiled. Does this mean there are still drugs around, even  if in smaller quantities than before?    Salim: I know this question is still being asked.  I have already said that a large hashish crop was produced  annually in al-Biqa'. For two years now, the area has been  clear of opium and hashish plantations. Last year they tried to  cultivate 8.5 percent of the area they formerly cultivated but  they were caught and the crop was destroyed. However, part of  the hashish crop of two years ago is still around and has not  been marketed.    Sarkis: How much of the original crop?    Salim: About six or seven percent, I think.  Stored hashish decays with time. It is not long-lived and the  oily narcotic substance in it evaporates, diluting the drug. We  proved this by conducting laboratory analyses on some  confiscated specimens. Over some period of time we found that  the narcotic was diluted by a ratio of 11 to 4.    Sarkis: Will a day come when the stored hashish  will run out completely?    Salim: It will end. We have received information  that they are burying the hashish underground or hiding it  inside wall cavities. This means that the drug is not as  plentiful as before and I expect this reserve to be used up in  one year. I wish to point out that hashish was first cultivated  in Lebanon in 1976. The opium poppy was first planted here 19  years ago. Two years ago Lebanon became practically clean as a  result of a decision by the highest authorities to combat the  narcotics trade. As a judicial police force, we made efforts to  achieve this objective on the instructions of our superiors.  [passage omitted]    Sarkis: Are there any statistics on the number of  addicts in Lebanon? Have decreased since the counternarcotics  campaign?    Salim: We must distinguish between an addict and  an occasional user. The latter uses drugs only occasionally;  this is a pre-addiction phase. I believe a user eventually  turns into an addict. On this point I differ with the  psychiatrists who say that whether a user becomes an addict  depends on his receptivity. In Lebanon there are occasional  users and also addicts. No definite number is known. There are  many occasional users. According to statistics, in some  villages 70 in every 1,000 citizens are occasional users. If we  consider the quantity of drugs that enters Lebanon and is then  reexported, we will realize that the number of addicts is not  very large. In my personal estimation there are 50,000  occasional users and addicts in the country. This is a  relatively small percentage of the population compared with  other countries. [passage omitted]    Sarkis: Does anyone active in the narcotics trade  enjoy protection?    Salim: The instructions of His Excellency the  President and other officials are to combat narcotics. No  Lebanese drug trafficker has protection, no matter who he is.  Anyone involved in the drug trade will be penalized. These are  the orders of the highest authorities. [passage omitted]</p>

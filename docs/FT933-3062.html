			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Warburg appoints head of German securities S. G. WARBURG, the London-based investment bank, has appointed Mr Lutz Wille as head of securities for its German operations. For the past two years Mr Wille, 54, has been chief financial officer of the Colonia insurance group, and before that he spent 20 years at Commerzbank, latterly as head of securities. The appointment is symptomatic of international investment banks' desire to recruit high-ranking German financiers to help them penetrate the difficult German market. Warburg has had problems in Germany, recently losing a managing director and its highly rated team of German equity analysts to separate US investment banks. It has also suffered disruption as it moved its office from Munich to Frankfurt this year.</p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOGGS-ADAMS AFFAIR  </P> <P> Come on, L.A. Times! An article on Wade Boggs-Margo Adams on the front page as  actual news? He's just another boy in the fraternity of sports players,  politicians and clergymen caught cheating on his wife. She's just another  opportunist using sex as a springboard to plastic surgery, a pictorial in  Penthouse or Playboy, and the talk show circuit. Wise up. Leave their sleazy  affairs to papers who thrive on their news -- the supermarket tabloids.  </P> <P> SUSAN KNIGHT  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

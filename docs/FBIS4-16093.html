			<p>BFN     [Text] As of today, the deputies' group The Union of 12  December has lengthened its name and become the  Liberal-Democratic Union [Liberalno-Demokraticheskiy Soyuz].  Explaining this decision, Boris Fedorov, the leader of the  union, told our correspondent: We are liberal and we are  democrats. We have simply taken a long time to see who we are  in the political spectrum. Many options were discussed, and we  decided that this one is the most appropriate. Incidentally,  the Russia's Choice had similar discussions, but they became  frightened. We believe that if we are liberal democrats, we  should not hide it. All we are doing is returning the true  meaning to the title of liberal democrats.</p>

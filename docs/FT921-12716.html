			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Tied agents 'are overselling life policies' LIFE ASSURANCE and pen-sions policies sold through tied and direct sales agents are much more likely to be terminated early than those sold through independent financial advisers, according to a study undertaken for the Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief investment regulator. The study will provide ammunition for the SIB, which is considering regulations which would require companies to tell customers more about policies before a sale was completed. The research commissioned by the SIB shows that up to 45 per cent of life assurance and pensions policies sold through tied and direct agents are terminated within two years. In contrast, policies sold through independent advisers have cancellation rates ranging from 22 per cent to 32 per cent. Sir David Walker, SIB chairman, has said high termination rates in early years suggest consumers are being sold products which are unsuitable for them. The SIB is considering new regulations which would require life companies to disclose the size of refunds if policies were cancelled before maturity. Cancellation in the early years of a contract can cost the customer up to 100 per cent of all premiums paid because they are typically diverted at the start of a policy to pay sales agents' commission and other administrative fees. The study found that between 23 per cent and 37 per cent of policies were cancelled within two years, regardless of how the policy was sold. It said early termination typically indicated 'overselling' or unsuitability. It may also reflect high unemployment, recession, falling house prices or other factors outside the control of sales agents or policyholders. The study, which examined terminations in 1990, was completed in December and surveyed the results of 61 UK life companies. It found that in all main categories of product, independent advisers had a lower termination rate on policies they sold than the industry average. Unit-linked life assurance policies, for example, had an average 37.1 per cent termination rate within two years. However, 39.2 per cent of policies sold by direct sales agents and 40.1 per cent of those sold by tied agents were terminated compared with 30.3 per cent of those sold by independents. Non-linked life policies had an average termination rate of 23 per cent, but 24.7 per cent and 24.8 per cent of those sold respectively by direct and tied sales agents were cancelled, compared with 22.1 per cent of those sold by independent advisers. The UK life assurance industry has moved to sign up banks and building societies to act as exclusive sales outlets.

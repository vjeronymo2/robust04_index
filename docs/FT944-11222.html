			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (12): 'Wait - and you'll be too late' - Multinational case study, Unilever in China Surprised by the success in Beijing of Unilever's face cream, a visiting scientist recently asked a Chinese secretary at the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group's local subsidiary what people had previously used to protect their skins against the very cold, dry winter winds. She was stumped for the product's English word but wrote down its chemical formula - 'Ah, glycerine]' said the scientist, grateful for the answer and impressed by the secretary's scientific training. Although Unilever and other multinationals are finding good staff, finding enough is a problem and the main limiting factor affecting Unilever's Chinese rate of expansion. 'We couldn't grow any faster if we wanted to,' says a senior executive. Starting with a handful of people in China a decade ago, Unilever has enjoyed one of the fastest growth rates of any foreign company in China. The 700 people it employed two years ago have reached 2,500 today, of whom only 80 are ex-patriates. The local employees range from production workers to more than 50 recent university graduates who, like the secretary, are being drawn rapidly into the multinational's management training programmes in China and abroad. From first contacts with Chinese authorities in the early 1980s, the company moved in the mid-1980s to negotiating joint ventures and finally to investing Dollars 9m in its first three projects in the late 1980s. Today, Unilever has eight joint ventures running or planned, with Dollars 200m of investment spent or committed. A further Dollars 100m will be spent each year for the next five years, it announced recently on the eve of opening an ice-cream factory in Beijing. China is 'top of the list' of Unilever's target emerging economies, says Mr Morris Tabaksblat, the group's Dutch co-chairman. The group expects its Chinese sales to rise from Dollars 200m a year to Dollars 1.5bn in 1999. It declines to discuss current profitability but 'we should see good returns by the end of the decade,' says Mr Alexander Kemner, head of Unilever's East Asia and Pacific region. Like some other multinationals, Unilever's Chinese roots go back many years. Lever Brothers, its British arm, built a factory in Shanghai in the early 1920s. It became China's largest maker of soap for laundry and personal use but operations were nationalised in 1951. During the 35-year hiatus until it re-established itself in China, Unilever's plant was used by state enterprises and its famous Lux brand lay dormant. Its first joint-venture in 1987 took it back to the old Lever Brothers site but to a different factory in the complex. The venture, Shanghai Lever, is owned 54.5 per cent by Unilever, 40.5 per cent by the Shanghai Soap Factory and 5 per cent by the Shanghai Daily Chemicals Corporation. The venture is a factory within a factory. Part of the soap factory was cleared, and re-equipped with the most modern machinery to make Lux toilet soap. The product range has grown to include shampoos, shower creams, fabric softeners and kitchen/bathroom cleaners. The other two ventures in Unilever's first phase were Shanghai van den Bergh (an equal joint venture with a local partner) to produce edible fats, mainly for baking and ice cream, and Shanghai Pond's (also equally split) making skin creams and lotions under the Pond's and Vaseline brands. Gaining experience in these projects, it has moved on to five more ventures in detergents, toothpaste, ice-cream and tea. It has taken a bigger stake in each successive business to a maximum of 85 per cent in its Beijing ice-cream factory. It says, however, that there will long be a need for a local partner to help guide ventures through the bureaucratic maze. Some foreign companies say they have been happy to leave their partners to solve problems, such as unreasonable demands from local suppliers and officials. The solution varies but can sometimes require payments. Unilever says it has found no such problems but has drawn heavily on its partners' local expertise for other purposes. Difficulties abound in virtually all aspects of the businesses from raw material supplies and transport to marketing and sales: price increases on some local raw materials have made imports cheaper; it can take three weeks to ship finished goods 1,000km from Shanghai to Beijing; TV adverts have to be produced abroad and sent to some 300 individual stations; copy for print campaigns has to be sent to each of hundreds of newspapers and magazines. It can also take up to six months to get a price increase approved by officials; distribution systems are product-specific so Unilever cannot, for example, send soap via its toothpaste distributor; reform of the government-dominated retailing system is only just beginning; and western-style advertising, marketing and management concepts have to be taught from basic levels. But for Unilever, the over-riding importance is to be in China building its experience, knowledge, brands and business - 'if you waited until the risks in China were lower, then you would simply be too late,' says Mr Anton Lenstra, chairman of Unilever China.</p>

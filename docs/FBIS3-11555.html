			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government and coca farmers failed yesterday to  reach an agreement that will pacify the coca producing zones in  El Chapare region of Cochabamba Department.    Following long meetings, the peasant leaders decided to  withdraw from talks with the cabinet members. They said the  ministers broke the preliminary agreement reached on 9 March.    The article that caused the breaking of relations sought to  make the coca leaders promise to engage in voluntary eradication  of plantations "without interference" from the peasants.    Until dawn on 10 March, considerable progress was made  toward  overcoming the atmosphere of violence that prevailed since 5  March when officials from the Coca Eradication Directorate  (Direco) and members of the Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas  clashed with 4,000 coca farmers in the Chapare.    Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar and Minister of the  Government German Quiroga, as well as coca peasant leader Evo  Morales and COB [Bolivian Labor Federation] leader Oscar Salas,  said yesterday that there are implicit threats to use violence  again in the tropical Chapare region.    Government and union leaders blamed each other for breaking  the agreement, which the public considered a positive step  toward an atmosphere of peace in the agitated central region of  Bolivia.    "The government will ensure that the law is respected,"  Minister Quiroga told journalists after meeting with President  Gonzalo Sanchez de Losada.    Minister Aranibar expressed "the government's disenchantment  and frustration at the result of the conversations." He said  the issue "was handled with full respect for the political will  to resolve the problems within an atmosphere dialogue,  understanding, and the spirit of Law No. 1008." He said that  the opposition of some coca leaders to the control of excess  coca crops is just as unacceptable as when organizations like  the JIFE [International Council of Narcotics Control] suggest a  ban on the consumption of coca leaves.</p>

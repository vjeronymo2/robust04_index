			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TUTTLE PUTS BRADLEY BACK IN WITNESS CHAIR  </P> <P> One day after he was questioned by the city attorney and his investigative  team, Mayor Tom Bradley again found himself in the witness chair Friday when he  was interviewed for several hours by City Controller Rick Tuttle and his staff.  </P> <P> Tuttle's session with the mayor was a clear signal that the controller's  special audits of questionable financial transactions were back on track. They  had been derailed several weeks ago when police investigators working with City  Atty. James K. Hahn requested that the controller hold off on interviewing  certain people until the city attorney's investigators were finished with them.  </P> <P> Hahn's office is leading a wide-ranging investigation of the mayor's financial  ties with people and institutions that do business with the city. Once Hahn  wrapped up his two days of questioning Bradley on Thursday, Tuttle lost no time  in resuming his own inquiry.  </P> <P> Tuttle has said his office is conducting a regular annual audit of the  treasurer's office as well as three special audits. They include the city's  transactions with Far East National Bank, which employed Bradley as an  $18,000-a-year adviser and which received city deposits during that time; the  city's funding of the Task Force for Africa/Los Angeles Relations, which is  headed by Bradley business associate Juanita St. John, and procedures in the  city clerk's office, which has responsibility for authorizing payments to such  groups as the Africa task force.  </P> <P> The controller was joined by investigators from the city attorney's office  Friday, but they were there only to "assist" the controller and did not ask any  questions, a spokeswoman for Tuttle said.  </P> <P> Neither Tuttle nor Bradley would comment on Friday's session, but aides to both  officials confirmed that the meeting took place in the mayor's City Hall office  and lasted for several hours.  </P> <P> In recent weeks Tuttle has interviewed under oath key aides to Bradley,  including Deputy Mayor Mike Gage. A source in the mayor's office said it was  "presumed" that Tuttle put Bradley under oath, although the city attorney did  not.  </P> <P> Tuttle's staff is also wrapping up its regular annual audit of the city  treasurer's office. Revelations about practices in that office rocked City Hall  last month when a council hearing into the treasurer's dealings with Far East  revealed that officials had placed $2 million in deposits there after an  inquiry from Bradley, had attempted to hide a reference to the mayor and then  had tried to hide the lack of competitive bids.  </P></p>

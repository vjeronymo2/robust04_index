Our  correspondent prepared this report.    [Correspondent] The news conference held by Mr Salim Ahmed  Salim, the OAU secretary general, ended a short while ago and  was attended by Habib Ben Yahia, the minister of foreign  affairs. [passage omitted]    The secretary general said the summit had seen the  participation of all the heads of state in the discussions,  either during the plenary sessions or the closed ones. The  African leaders discussed the points on the agenda, focusing  mainly on solving conflicts and disputes--especially events in  Rwanda. The summit was crowned with considerable achievements  in this regard. Some delegations expressed their readiness to  send peacekeeping contingents to this country.    Among the important results achieved in Tunisia's summit,  the  OAU secretary general said, a body, entrusted with settling  conflicts, was set up. This body will hold regular meetings to  take preventive measures against conflicts and problems and will  consist of Tunisia, Cote d'Ivoire, Mauritius, Benin, Nigeria,  Egypt, Ethiopia, and Chad.    Among the results, there is also the holding of an  extraordinary summit to discuss economic issues.    In reply to a question on why democracy and human rights  issues were not discussed in this summit, the secretary general  said the OAU was committed to these issues as they are issues of  international interest. He stressed that establishing democracy  and the respect of human rights in Africa was of paramount  importance and a matter of principle to his organization.    Regarding the financial status of the OAU, Mr Salim Ahmed  Salim said there was a number of countries who have not payed  their financial commitments to the organization which is  experiencing a critical financial situation. He called on the  member states to pay their contributions so the OAU can carry  out its role and duties, pointing out that the summit stressed  the importance of preventive diplomacy, which requires regular  payment of financial contributions. He said that during  Tunisia's summit some member states paid their contributions.  [passage omitted]    The next OAU summit will be held in the Ethiopian capital,  Addis Ababa.</p>

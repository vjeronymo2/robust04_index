			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: The Week Ahead THE main interest in GEC's interims, due on Wednesday, will be not so much in the profits figure as in the dividend. Last year's interim payment was merely held. But the final was raised by 5 per cent, in spite of unchanged earnings per share for the year overall. This time, profits are expected to be only modestly up, in the range Pounds 350-360m from Pounds 346m last year. But GEC is still accumulating cash at a ferocious rate. At the start of the year, net cash - including GEC's share of cash held in joint ventures - stood at Pounds 1.4bn. It is expected to reach Pounds 1.6bn by the year end. Lord Weinstock can thus certainly afford an increase. The question is whether the outlook has brightened enough to allow an increase materially ahead of growth in earnings. Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is expected to have suffered its first ever year on year fall in pre-tax profits when it announces its full-year results on Thursday. Pre-tax profits are likely to have fallen to around Pounds 1.24bn from Pounds 1.31bn. The fall is less than it might have been because more than Pounds 100m of exceptionals will be taken above the line in accordance with the new accounting rules. Allied-Lyons is expected to report first-half profits on Tuesday of Pounds 280m against last year's Pounds 276m, restated after adjustments of charges. Most of the gain will come from the spirits and wine business, helped by cost-savings from the restructuring of distribution in North America and a resilient performance in Spain and Japan. Brewing and pub retailing has been under pressure from the UK recession and the disruption caused by the government's beer orders. Forecasts of full year results from Bass on Wednesday range from Pounds 515m to Pounds 538m - an increase of between 20 per cent and 25 per cent on last year's Pounds 430m. The figures will be affected by the levels of exceptional restructuring charges and property disposals. Underlying trading profits are expected to be flat. Well-publicised trading difficulties for Grand Metropolitan's North American foods business will be reflected in a decline in full year profits on Thursday from Pounds 950m to about Pounds 920m. IDV, the group's spirits division, is expected to record another solid advance in trading profits but lower earnings are forecast from the retailing sector. Trafalgar House, the construction, engineering and property group, which is reporting its full year results on Tuesday, is expected to announce that Pounds 90m of profits were wiped out by a big tax charge and Pounds 50m of writedowns on housing and commercial property.</p>

Korea Is To Blame for Breakup of Working Contact"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The whole course of  eight rounds of working contact for the exchange of presidential  envoys between the North and the South of Korea was a touchstone  distinguishing between the stand of national independence and  that of dependence on outside forces, peace and war,  reunification and division, patriotism and treachery, says  NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article today.    From the beginning, the South side turned down our side's  reasonable proposals and measures without any reason, bringing  forward unreasonable proposals, and thus created deliberate  obstacles to the working contact, the article says, and goes on:    Prior to the eighth round of the contact, the South side,  making a surprise volte-face from understanding the  reasonableness of our side's four-point demand including the  suspension of large-scale nuclear war exercises against the  dialogue partner, totally brushed it off and perpetrated such a  perfidious act as getting on the nerve of the North and  fostering confrontation.    Such being the case, the North side, out of the desire to  prevent the collapse of the working contact at any cost and  promote it in conformity with its original nature, urged the  South side again at the eighth round to refrain from such a  perfidious act and stop getting on the nerve of the dialogue  partner, inciting confrontation, increasing tension and thus  bringing dialogue itself to a rupture.    The South side, however, categorically opposed the  fundamental, principled proposals put forward by the North side  concerning the maintenance of the principle of national  independence, the promotion of the great unity of the whole  nation and other matters related to the mission of special  envoys.    It became all the clearer through the whole course of the  working contact that "the improvement of North-South relations"  and "dialogue" advocated by the Kim Yong-sam group were a  ballyhoo and it was seeking to prolong its days as a group of  colonial stooges by slaying fellow countrymen and putting them  on the altar of a nuclear war in league with outside forces.    With nothing can the South Korean rulers cover up their  criminal acts in making the North-South relations worse than in  the period of the former military dictatorship and creating a  phase of confrontation and war by breaking up the working  contact, or evade their responsibility.    History shows that the days of the flunkeyist traitors  kissing outside forces, estranged from fellow countrymen, are  numbered.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Six MPs support Airtours' bid SIX MPs have supported Airtours in a parliamentary early day motion, hitting back at a larger group of MPs who last week called for the holiday company's bid for Owners Abroad to be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The MPs, led by Mr Barry Porter, Conservative MP for Wirral South, congratulated Airtours on its 'innovative practices'. The cross-party motion said the proposed acquisition would benefit consumers and would bring a wider selection of affordable holiday destinations departing from regional airports. The name of Mr Gordon Oakes, Labour MP for Halton, initially appeared on both the motion calling for referral to the MMC and the motion supporting Airtours. Mr Oakes is understood to be completely in favour of the takeover. A signature purporting to be his is understood to have been placed on an order paper at the Commons Table Office saying he was in favour of the motion calling for referral. His name has now been withdrawn from that motion. Yesterday Owners Abroad's shares rose 3p to 118p while Airtours slipped 1p to 280p as the market moved towards the belief that the bid would not be referred.</p>

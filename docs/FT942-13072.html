			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Consumer confidence at high US consumer confidence has risen this month to its highest level in nearly four years, indicating that economic growth remains robust. Separate figures show little upward pressure on wages despite the strong recovery. The Conference Board said its index of confidence rose five points this month to 91.7, a 36 per cent increase from April last year. Confidence is running at levels 'which have historically signalled a strong economy', said Mr Fabian Linden for the board. The rise in confidence from March mainly reflected more positive assessments of current economic conditions; consumers were slightly more optimistic about economic conditions in the next few months. Confidence varies regionally, with the strongest gains in the mid-western, southern and mountain states. Confidence remains relatively subdued on the east and west coasts. Labour Department figures yesterday showed little evidence of upward pressure on wages, despite rapid economic growth. The employment cost index (the broadest measure of wages and fringe benefits) rose 0.7 per cent in the first quarter and 3.2 per cent in the year to March, against gains of 0.8 per cent in the fourth quarter and 3.5 per cent in the year to December. The growth of benefit payments, such as healthcare, has slowed sharply since the late-1980s but still outpaces wage and salary increases.</p>

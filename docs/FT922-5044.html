			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Customers 'ignorant' of water penalties MOST customers of water companies in England and Wales do not realise they are entitled to compensation if certain guaranteed service standards are not met, according to a survey. That can arise when it takes longer to restore a water supply than the customer has been warned; where there are supply interruptions of more than a set time; when an appointment on a day promised in writing is not kept; or when there is no answer to a complaint or inquiry within a specified time. Customers can claim a Pounds 5 cash payment or credit for each infringement. The survey is the first commissioned by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), the industry's economic regulator, to discover what customers think about the standard of water and sewerage services and their priorities for improvements. Nearly a quarter of the 3,617 people surveyed by Mori between November last year and January 1992, thought water charges were 'fairly unreasonable' and 15 per cent thought their bills were 'very unreasonable'. Half thought the price they paid for water was reasonable, but more than three quarters were satisfied with the overall service. The findings come at a time of steep rises in water charges. Bills in England and Wales are due to rise in the next few years by an average of 5 percentage points above the level of inflation to pay for the industry's Pounds 28bn capital expenditure programme. The average rise this year is 9.3 per cent. Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, said it was important to know the opinions of the industry's customers, and the survey indicated where their priorities lay. The Customer Viewpoint.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed RF: "240 Million French Francs To Wake </F> Small- and Medium-Sized Companies Up to Innovation"]    [Text] Electronics is well-represented in the French  projects involved in the European Community's STRIDE [Science  and Technology for Regional Innovation and Development] program.  This program aids in the promotion of technological innovation  with small and medium-sized companies and industrial concerns in  those regions of Europe that are "slow developers" or which have  been affected by industrial decline. The Fourth STRIDE  Conference recently held in Metz gave an overview of the 104  French projects involved in STRIDE. Running since 1992, these  projects, which should be completed in a few months' time, are  worth a total of 240 million French francs. Aid awarded by the  program goes mostly to bodies such as chambers of commerce or  teaching establishments looking to develop awareness and  training programs in technological innovation aimed at local  industry.    Daniel Moers of ANVAR [National Agency for the  Implementation  of Research], one of the French program coordinators, said: "In  France, STRIDE has already reached thousands of companies.  Thanks to STRIDE, we are seeing an increasing number of small  and medium- sized companies and industrial groups coming to  ANVAR for aid for innovation."    With 26 projects, the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region is one of  the  main beneficiaries of STRIDE in France. Among the bodies in  this region implementing STRIDE projects are the Nord  Electronics and Microelectronics Institute and the Lille  University of Science and Technology, which runs a number of  awareness and training programs for small- and mid-sized  companies in the field of "intelligent instrumentation."    Another major French beneficiary of STRIDE is the Lorraine  reiogn, which has 19 projects. These include training programs  in electronics, home automation, and production automation  organized by the Metz-based center for the research and  application of technology for the Lorraine crafts industry.    Other French regions have also started up STRIDE projects.  In Saint-Etienne, for example, the ARUFOG (association for the  research and use of optical fibers and guided optics) is  encouraging small and mid-sized companies to start using  innovative optical instrumentation and photonics technology for  industrial control. The Dantec high school in Lannion is working  with local companies to heighten their awareness of laser  technologies and to encourage the use of lasers. At Dijon, the  regional agency for technological development is working to  spread the use of high-energy technologies to the small and  medium-sized companies of Burgundy, while in Besancon the  technical center for the clock and watchmaking industry is  establishing an awareness program in the use of microelectronics.</p>

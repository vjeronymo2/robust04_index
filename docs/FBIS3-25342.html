			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Feb 15 SAPA -- The mostly black racial  composition of the National Peacekeeping Force was unacceptable,  the defence sub council of the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] has found. According to a summary of the sub-council's  deliberations presented to the Executive Council on Tuesday, the  Executive Management Committee has mandated a sub-committee to  examine the problem.    The sub-council said the South African Defence Force had  explained that without conscription there were no riflemen to  draw upon and that new defence force recruits had not completed  their training.    The sub council said practical solutions had to be found to  rectify the racial composition if the peacekeeping force was to  play a positive role in ensuring peaceful transition.    A joint Executive Council, defence force and defence sub  council team is expected to finalise the peacekeeping force's  budget by next week.</p>

Ambassador Fulci went on to argue how an eventual air-strike  in and around Sarajevo, if the siege of the Bosnian capital is  not removed by February 20, "should not be viewed exclusively as  an act of reprisal or a response to the deadlock in the peace  process, but as a means to induce the sides to return to reason  and make every effort possible to come to an agreement." The  Italian diplomat then went on to stress the importance of  Italy's active role in the adoption of the ultimatum which  represented the "point of change in the attitude of the  international community towards the crisis in Bosnia" and a  "catalyst for new contributions in the search for a political  solution."    In his address, Ambassador Fulci reiterated how Italy has  put  its military bases and airports at the full disposition of the  Atlantic Alliance for any action in Bosnia.    The Italian ambassador concluded by making a host of  appeals,  asking that opposing forces in Bosnia "exercise moderation and  demonstrate political will to reach a negotiated settlement,"  extending this plea to "anyone who can influence the warring  factions with renewed vigor." He then called on those countries  participating in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent,  humanitarian organizations, international agencies and "all men  of good will" to not waiver in their efforts. "A peaceful  solution for Bosnia can be found" Ambassador Fulci said, "but  only if we all persevere." [passage omitted]</p>

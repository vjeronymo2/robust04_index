Rudy Lengkong,  head of the National Agency for Export Development (BPEN), was  commenting on reports that the United States was threatening to  revive its "Super 301" Trade Act and apply it to countries  Washington believes are guilty of unfair trade practices toward  the U.S.    Lengkong said many countries other than the protectiomist  developed ones, were still "wide open" for Indonesian goods.  "We should widen our marketing reach among the developing  countries, in other words: diversify our markets," he said. The  Latin American countries, former communist countries in Eastern  Europe and Middle Eastern countries were potential markets for  Indonesian products, he added.    Meanwhile , business circles in Jakarta said Indonesia  should  diversify its overseas markets not only in response to the  protectionism of certain developed countries but also because  its traditional foreign markets were suffering from a protracted  recession.    Previously Foreign Minister Ali Alatas had said the United  States should no longer use its Super 301 Trade Act against its  trade partner because such action would not be in line with the  GATT's (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) Uruguay Round  accords. "Super 301 should no longer be used since the Uruguay  Round of GATT has duly provided for certain clauses governing  settlement of disputes among countries," Alatas said.    Lengkong said Indonesia should be working hard to accomplish  the diversification of its markets and reduce its dependence on  its traditional markets.    According to private business observers, Indonesia is  lagging  far behind its partners in ASEAN (Associatcon of South East  Asian Nations) where export market diversification is concerned.</p>

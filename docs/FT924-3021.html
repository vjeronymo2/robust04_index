			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Budget row dulls the jewel in UK crown At five minutes to midnight on the last day of the Edinburgh summit, the plan for the future financing of the European Community is settled, and the British budget rebate, won by Margaret Thatcher in 1985, is secured for another five years. THIS WAS the unshakeable vision of a senior British official over six months ago, on the eve of the UK presidency. That assurance has evaporated, as the Community has sunk into perhaps its worst crisis of confidence, and relations between Britain and its partners have reached a low ebb. Getting a deal on the financing plan, known as the Delors II package, was to have been the jewel in the UK presidency's crown. 'Delors I', the EC's first five-year financing and budget control programme, was agreed in February 1988 under German chairmanship. It was and is regarded by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, and by German ministers and officials, as the decision which relaunched the Community, making possible the Single Market and signposting the road to political, economic and monetary union. Yet when Delors I was conceived there was confident prosperity - not, as now, a time of recession, intra-Community rancour, and political uncertainty across Europe. Getting a Delors II deal in Edinburgh may be possible, precisely because the EC badly needs to drag itself out of the mire. Few are betting on it. In 1988, Germany, the biggest net EC contributor, was willing to settle with Spain, the leading supplicant among poorer member states, and double the structural funds aimed at helping disadvantaged regions get ready for the Single Market. But since reunification, Germany is an unhappy paymaster. When Mr Delors unveiled his second five-year plan in February, only Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece - intended beneficiaries of a further doubling of fiscal transfers from the EC budget - were unalloyed enthusiasts. Germany and the UK, the two main net contributors, objected, backed by the Netherlands, and later by an Italy struggling to reduce its budget deficits and public debt in line with Maastricht's tight membership criteria for monetary union. The Germans and Dutch have also led demands that the UK's rebate, worth a total of Pounds 12.5bn since 1985, be reduced, even though Britain insists this is non-negotiable. Edinburgh has shaped up as a battle between UK restrictiveness, and Spanish unwillingness to settle for much less than the doubling in fiscal transfers to which it insists the Twelve committed themselves at Maastricht. The UK two weeks ago presented what it called a compromise. This would mean an increase in the annual budget from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to Ecu79.4bn (in 1992 money) in 1999. The original Delors II plan wanted a rise to Ecu87.5bn by 1997 - an increase of nearly a third in real terms. Last month, however, Mr Delors revived a plan rejected at June's Lisbon summit, to stretch a smaller increase over seven years, getting to Ecu80.2bn by 1997, and Ecu86.2bn by 1999. This would raise total fiscal transfers for regional and cohesion spending from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu27.3bn in 1997 and Ecu30.2bn in 1999 - close to what Spain and its allies want, but at the expense of planned increases in areas such as Research &amp; Development coveted by France. The British compromise would raise cohesion spending only to Ecu23bn in 1997, and Ecu23.8bn in 1999. The UK appears to believe that extending the new Cohesion Fund - created at Maastricht - for a further two years will be a sufficient sop to Spain. This fund, to help poorer members meet EC environmental standards and complete missing EC transport links, is charged with political symbolism. But it is worth less than a tenth of what these countries receive in EC development aid, known as the Structural Funds. Spanish ministers say the UK offer is not worth discussing. One senior Commission official calls it 'unacceptable: it is not a compromise'. This view is echoed among some French, Italian, Dutch and German officials because they fear the EC could become little more than a clearing house for fiscal transfers and farm spending. There would be little left over for other Community policies, and the looser, inter-governmental co-operation the UK favours would triumph over 40 years of integration. Much more is at stake than money for the so-called 'Club Med' countries. Nearly all 12 want more money for a beefed up common foreign policy, and France is leading a drive for more spending directed at industry. As Mr Delors said last week in a letter to EC leaders, 'let us remember that the Community devotes Ecu274 per inhabitant to research, against Ecu528 in the United States and Ecu619 in Japan'. There are many who agree the EC should give itself the financial muscle to compete internationally. This weekend should make clear if Community leaders will put EC money where their EC mouth is.</p>

			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: German warns on German influence COUNTRIES which slow progress towards European monetary union risk strengthening Germany's economic domination across the continent, according to Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, president of the German association of chambers of commerce and industry. Mr Stihl, who has emerged as an influential spokesman for German business in the debate over future European integration, labelled as 'short-sighted' countries such as Denmark and the UK showing opposition to the treaty. If the Maastricht treaty were not ratified, this would establish the D-Mark more quickly as the 'main currency in Europe', since the move to a single currency with a European central bank would break down, Mr Stihl said. 'This would mean the domination of the German economy in Europe,' he said. The Maastricht treaty might have to be implemented initially by a smaller group of EC states, he said. If monetary union went ahead with only a limited number of countries, this would have the effect of 'exerting pressure on other countries in Europe to maintain (economic) stability'. However, there were strong political arguments against too overt a move towards 'two-speed' Europe. The EC would try to ensure as many countries as possible took part in the final stage of monetary union. The most likely outcome was that the Maastricht process would continue, but more slowly than envisaged.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- International Trade and  Industry Minister Eijiro Hata on Wednesday [22 June] hailed the  enactment of a bill to provide consumers with greater protection  against accidents and injuries caused by defective products.    "The law is in line with the economic and social reality of  Japan and is also well balanced internationally," Hata said in a  statement.    The product liability bill was passed into law Wednesday by  the House of Councillors after the second chamber's plenary  session voted unanimously in favor of the bill. The more  powerful House of Representatives already passed the bill June  15.    Hata said his ministry will take adequate steps before the  law goes into effect in one year, including dissemination of the  law among concerned industries.    The product liability law will require consumers seeking  compensation to simply prove that a product was faulty, rather  than the present system whereby consumers must prove negligence  by the maker.    But the law does not incorporate a provision holding makers  liable for damages or injury through assumption of a link  between the damage or injury and a defective product.    It took almost 20 years for the bill to be enacted since the  Social Policy Council, an advisory body to the prime minister,  began debate on better consumer protection from defective  products in 1975.</p>

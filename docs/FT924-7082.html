			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Left behind in a changing market SINCE Amstrad launched its first personal computer, the PC 1512, in 1984, the PC market in the UK and elsewhere has changed dramatically and Amstrad - the quintessential 'pile them high, sell them cheap' electronics success story of the 1980s - has failed to keep pace. Today its machines are no longer leaders in either price or performance, are still sold through the traditional retail channels, and, with the exception of some portable models, are mostly viewed within the PC industry as uninspired. Driven by technology and fierce competition PC prices have been falling  - wiping out Amstrad's price advantage. The wide availability of low-cost components has spawned a flood of PC market entrants. 'It is not the same market that Amstrad launched into and pioneered, now everyone and his mother can produce a low-cost package,' says Mr Jerry Sanders, executive editor of Ziff-Davis' PC Magazine. Amstrad can still boast a large installed base, but brand loyalty has evaporated. It has also lost out to a new breed of PC manufacturers such as Dell in the US and Elonex in the UK who sell direct to their customers. Mr Michael Spiro, finance director of London-based Elonex, emphasises that with today's wafer-thin margins, PC manufacturers have to sell direct to retain control of overheads. Just as important, direct sales keep a company in touch with its customers. 'In the indirect channel you offer what is available, not what is wanted,' says Mr Spiro. Mr Charles Smulders of Dataquest, the market research group, also believes Amstrad's PC strategy lacks clear focus. While some of Amstrad's new machines are aimed at its traditional home PC market, it has also launched a range of desktop PCs based around Intel's powerful 80486 microprocessor which appear aimed at the business market. 'Amstrad seems stuck in the middle ground,' says Mr Smulders. Amstrad faces formidable competition in both markets. In the past six months even IBM and Compaq have launched cut-price 'clones' of their own. Amstrad still commands a 4.9 per cent share of the UK market, according to Dataquest figures for 1991, which ranks it sixth behind Commodore, IBM, Compaq, Atari and Apple. However, as Mr Sugar acknowledges, Amstrad is a 'me-too' competitor. It needs a 'blockbuster' product - like the old PC1512. It is difficult to see Amstrad coming up with one.</p>

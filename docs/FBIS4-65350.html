			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Free Democratic Party presidential candidate </F> Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher by Margit Gerste and Gunter Hoffman;  place and date not given: "Defining Our Identity Anew"]    [Text] [DIE ZEIT] Frau Hamm-Bruecher, 1989 was a year of  great changes. But since then people have become concerned  about the direction in which the united republic is heading.  What do you wish had happened?    [Hamm-Bruecher] I wish we had learned from western  experience  as much as we learned from eastern experience. This wish  incorporates my dream, which, as is usually the case with  dreams, is somewhat of an illusion. Things probably could not  have happened differently from the way they did, but I think we  missed an opportunity to stop for a moment and examine what was  proceeding successfully, what was not proving successful, and  what we should change. But instead, we in the west thought:  Well, we have to pay the solidarity tax surcharge for a certain  length of time, and apart from that the people in the east must  do the same as us. Most people here in the west have never  even considered the fact that people in the east have totally  different feelings and habits than we do, and that great efforts  are required to adapt.    [DIE ZEIT] Many people say that the Federal Republic was  also merely a sort of antechamber and that the chamber of  history is now empty. What do you think should be kept intact?  What kind of heritage should we protect?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Our "antechamber" has repeatedly produced  excellent democrats; we have overcome difficult cases; and we  have succeeded in reconciling the Germans to democracy which, by  the way, was always linked to economic growth and prosperity.  This is something that one must not only protect, but also  develop.    [DIE ZEIT] But one can extend the argument. Michael  Stuermer, Joachim Fest, and others have claimed that the past 40  years were but a diversion and now the Federal Republic can  follow the correct road at last. Do you agree?    [Hamm-Bruecher] It was a diversion insofar as we Germans  have finally realized that after one failure, or two if you  include the year 1848, democracy and free coexistence require a  new path. If people choose to see that as a diversion of the  old Federal Republic, that means that we are heading toward  quite a dangerous and reactionary tradition.    [DIE ZEIT] Do the politicians realize this?    [Hamm-Bruecher] No. There is an odd nostalgia for that part  of German history that is worthy of display, to the exclusion of  that part of German history that is best forgotten. That is  dangerous. We imagine that at last we have a democracy and have  completed our task. But in fact we must continue to work at it  for a long time.    [DIE ZEIT] One cannot say that we have come more Protestant,  liberal, and reform-minded since unification?    [Hamm-Bruecher] No. But even in the West, the new openness,  the realization that democracy is a form of coexistence that is  not limited to official institutions, did not materialize until  the end of the 1950's. We were also in a period of desolation  then. Look at all the men who fell in the war or were wounded  well as the incorrigible Nazis. No wonder there was no strength  for renewal after 1945. It took a long time to find this  strength. After 1989, many people in the West remained forsaken  and depressed. Because of that, renewal might only be possible  in 10 years. As you can see, I am hopelessly optimistic. Even  so I find our lack of concern about how a democracy is supposed  to develop on the threshold of the third millennium dangerous.  Representative democracy on its own serves no further purpose,  and all the political parties are handing the idea of  participatory democracy with kid gloves. On the other hand, we  have a "spectator democracy" with citizens who feel that if they  are only permitted to vote every four years, all they can do is  sit and watch the politicians and criticize them.    [DIE ZEIT] Some people recommend a sense of pride and  participation as a recipe for national awareness. As a liberal,  does the question of national identity have any relevance for  you?    [Hamm-Bruecher] No, I doubt whether the old type of  nationalism and patriotism have to be rediscovered and whether  women can do anything with these values. For me this is the  domain of men. Other things are more important for me. We must  make a serious attempt to redefine our identity. But this is  not the kind of patriotism illustrated by the saying "whether  the country does right or whether it does wrong, it is still my  country." It is something that involves a feeling for spiritual  and cultural values, not to mention an awareness of the failures  and terrible wars we have experienced this century.    We are discussing values that must be defended, on the one  hand, and necessary changes on the other. Can one not say that  Germany's openness to refugees is part of its identity?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. That is also the reason why I find it  so difficult to accept the change in the asylum law. Of course,  I also see the reality. But the asylum law is not just a  reaction to the fortunes of those who fled from Nazism. It is  also a genuine result of the changes. The things that burden us  and have a bearing on our consciousness are also a part of our  identity, for example the way one views human rights. Some of  the things that were said in the debate on the expulsion of the  Kurds sounded as if there was no right of asylum in Germany any  more. We must face up to these things. And when I consider all  this, I regret that I am no longer at the beginning of my  political life, but at the end. That is why I am so keen on  running for the post of president, because it gives me another  opportunity to oppose these alarming trends.    [DIE ZEIT] What is it that holds a disoriented society  together? Is it common values?    [Hamm-Bruecher] As a liberal, I oppose any kind of  indoctrination. On the other hand, we must consider in what way  we can teach young people to resist temptations posed by the  media and the behavior of adults. One must realize that one  cannot only do things that are to one's own advantage. One must  also work to the advantage of others, something that often  involves sacrifices.    [DIE ZEIT] What do you think of the liberal opinions in the  media, parliament, and the parties?    [Hamm-Bruecher] The unique candle procession, for instance,  was more than just a demonstration. It represented liberal  public opinion. People did not have to be told to get up and do  something to display their feelings. They just did it.    [DIE ZEIT] Have you any criticism of us journalists?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. Journalists play down such phenomena  as a greater degree of social commitment. It is not spectacular  enough for them. I even find the liberal press rather  disillusioned.    [DIE ZEIT] Perhaps because liberal opinion manifests itself  mainly as a kind of background noise?    [Hamm-Bruecher] There is a constant overfeeding. Things used  to be much clearer before. It also used to be more important  whether or not one appeared in DIE ZEIT. But, unfortunately,  DIE ZEIT is no longer the political institution that it used to  be.    [DIE ZEIT] In that case, where do you see liberal  authorities and persons linked to them?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Generally speaking, it takes more effort  these days to prevent something than to change it. That takes a  lot of energy. First we have to overcome right-wing extremist  violence before we can consider any constructive political  moves, otherwise we cannot establish a basis for peaceful  coexistence between Germans and foreigners.    [DIE ZEIT] Do you think that people encounter the limits of  politics so frequently that they no longer care what you do as a  politician or as a journalist?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Even a parliamentary deputy becomes  powerless  when he thinks every single political faction in compliance with  Article 38 of the Basic Law meeting means a loss of his  identity. When someone is not as crazy as I am, one can say:  Personal commitment is useless, so adapt yourself. But one  should establish a political career not just through adjustment.  It is bad that instead of doing something because of its  importance and then introducing it to the rest of society, one  introduces it first and then says it is impossible to achieve.    [DIE ZEIT] Would a future president have to do it?    [Hamm-Bruecher] I believe there is motivation to attempt a  joint course of action again, because the question of party  democracy versus a civil society remains unresolved. The  political parties are no longer able to implement the idea of  democracy as an ideal and as a reality and impart soul and life  to it.    [DIE ZEIT] How about a democracy without parties?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Impossible. But one day there might be a  formation gathering, for example, all the Pfluegers, Suessmuths,  Geisslers, Hamm-Bruechers, Hirschs, Gansels, and so on.    [DIE ZEIT] Are you in favor of an erasure of the GDR past,  or  a reappraisal thereof?    [Hamm-Bruecher] I know that what is being done is not right,  but I know of no better way of doing it, because the damage in  the GDR after 12 years was much deeper and more far-reaching  than here. To a major extent, the Germans were convinced Nazis.  But I do not think they were communists or SED [Socialist Unity  Party of Germany] supporters to the same extent. But we are  combining the Nazi dictatorship with the SED. That is  impermissible.    This reminds me of the case of Maunz, former Bavarian  culture  minister, whom I helped topple in 1964. I consider it a scandal  that a man like Maunz, following his resignation, could become  one of the most respected law professors in Germany.    [DIE ZEIT] Finally, I would like to ask you about the  presidential election on 23 May. We have the impression that  the FDP has not promoted your candidacy with enough militancy,  and there are even rumors that some people in the party  leadership want to make clear already in the first round of the  vote that Herzog is assured of a majority. Does this bother you?    [Hamm-Bruecher] I do not think that will happen, and I  expect broad support for my party.    [DIE ZEIT] But the question of a presidential candidate's  liberal qualities must come before coalition business?    [Hamm-Bruecher] Yes. It is important for me that in the end,  every democrat is accountable for his own actions. I have been  trying to do that for 40 years.</p>

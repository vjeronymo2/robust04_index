			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Let Us Nurture the Bud of Dialogue"] </F>   [Text] The issue of DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear  arms development program has entered a new stage. As a result  of talks between former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and DPRK  President Kim Il-song, it has become likely that high-level  U.S.-DPRK talks will be resumed.    Besides, an unexpected by-product was gained as ROK  President  Kim Yong-sam accepted DPRK President Kim Il-song's call for  holding a summit meeting. It is still uncertain whether the  summit will be realized or not, but if leaders of South and  North Korea can hold a direct dialogue, it will definitely bring  a historic turnabout in the Korean peninsula where the Cold War  structure still persists.    Since North Korea announced its withdrawal from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN Security  Council [UNSC] has been hurrying to work out a sanctions  resolution against this nation. The situation has been such  that if the council had gone ahead with the resolution, distrust  would have generated more trust, thus bringing about unexpected  developments.    We welcome the fact that the tension in the Korean peninsula  is easing for now and dialogue will resume. We strongly hope  that North Korea will attend the high-level U.S.-DPRK talks with  a sincere attitude to clear up the nuclear suspicion harbored by  all nations. We also hope that the United States will make the  most of this precious opportunity in finding a clue to a  breakthrough in the situation through tenacious negotiations.    Carter said that Kim Il-song promised to freeze the nuclear  development program on condition that the United States will  agree to resume talks with the DPRK and also will render support  in converting its [graphite] reactors into light water reactors.    President Kim is also supposed to have asked for assurances  that the United States and other nations will not make North  Korea their target of attack. This may indicate that North  Korea is extremely anxious that it is continually exposed to the  danger of a military attack. Nations isolating themselves from  others tend to have such notions.    Carter made his visit to North Korea as a "private citizen."  But his trip, which may bring a breakthrough to the situation,  showed to the world how important it is to keep open the  channels of dialogue no matter what happens.    Carter said he has received an invitation from President Kim  several times since 1991. He is said to have made the visit at  this time because confrontation over the nuclear suspicion was  intensifying and, meanwhile, there was no direct dialogue with  North Korea, which was the party involved. We would like to  praise his insight and willingness to act.    President Bill Clinton has indicated that in principle, he  will use the efforts made by the former president as a lead  toward finding a solution to the issue. We think that is a good  plan. We hope that the U.S.-DPRK working-level meeting,  expected to be held early next week, will lead smoothly to  high-level talks.    When looking back on the past, we realize that it is not  easy  to clear up nuclear suspicions. If North Korea truly does not  have either nuclear weapons or intentions to build them, it  should be able to accept full inspections to satisfy the  international community.    Meanwhile, the United States on its part should suspend its  current activities toward preparing for UNSC sanctions. China  and Russia, which are UNSC members, were originally opposed to  or skeptical about imposing sanctions immediately. In order to  elicit a sincere attitude from North Korea and to have the  international community united in dealing with the issue, we  must follow the direction of the dialogue to resume soon.    As far as the South-North summit talks are concerned, we  cannot make an optimistic prediction, since the holding of such  talks has been called for by both nations several times in the  past but has never been realized. But we would like to take  both leaders' intentions to hold a direct dialogue at face value.    Hopefully, this bud of dialogue will be handled carefully  and  nurtured into full bloom.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Survey of European Airports (6): Attention switches to Malpensa - Milan Expansion at Linate, Milan's principal airport, is hampered by its dependence on a single runway. Last year, the airport recorded a 2 per cent increase in aircraft movements to 114,157, and the number of passengers handled increased by 1.3 per cent to 9.5m. Passenger capacity is more than adequate, following the improvements to the airport terminal in the late 1980s. But rather than increasing the size of aircraft serving Linate, airlines prefer to increase frequency, and the airport - a mere 20-minute taxi ride from the centre of the city - cannot add a further runway because it is, as its spokesman puts it, 'hemmed in by concrete'. Attention has therefore switched to the city's second airport, Malpensa, which like Linate belongs to SEA, a profitable private company controlled by the Milan city authorities. Malpensa, 45km from the city, currently handles only about 3.6m passengers a year, on charter and intercontinental flights. A programme of improvements, Malpensa 2000, including a new fast rail-link with the city centre, is under way and should be sufficiently advanced to allow some flights to transfer to from Linate to Malpensa in 1998. A political decision will have to be made on whether to take the logical next step and move all international flights to Malpensa, keeping only the busy domestic operations at Linate. This year traffic at both Milanese airports is increasing. In the nine months to the end of September, the number of passengers using Linate was up 9.1 per cent against the same period last year, and at Malpensa, up 3.2 per cent. Linate, which handles only scheduled flights, is tailored to business users, who account for an estimated 70 or 80 per cent of all passengers.</p>

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The revolt of the Names: Reforms at Lloyd's insurance market are unlikely to satisfy those members who are facing huge losses The sad thing is how gullible we were,' says a Name at Lloyd's of London, reflecting on the 'exquisite lunches' and 'glib promises' that persuaded him to become a member at the insurance market in 1978. Today the Name - the individuals who commit a minimum of Pounds 250,000 to back underwriting activities - is one of several thousands facing potential bankruptcy as a result of the losses sustained by the market. The sharply deteriorating financial position stems mainly from US liability suits and claims arising from natural disasters. Names, who are formed into more than 350 groups, or syndicates, have unlimited liability for the losses they incur. For Lloyd's, the disillusion of many Names and the damaging publicity from current court cases has cast a cloud over the market's future as it seeks to halt the decline in its share of specialised commercial insurance and reinsurance. As Lloyd's prepares to close its accounts for the 1988 year, in line with its three-year accounting system, it is expected to record an overall loss of at least Pounds 150m. Its premium income for the same period amounted to about Pounds 6bn. In 1989, while premium income seems likely to stay at about the same figure, losses could be as much as Pounds 1bn, according to Mr John Rew, co-author of Chatset's Lloyd's League Tables, a comprehensive guide to the market. By comparison, in the golden years of 1986 and 1987, Lloyd's made overall profits of Pounds 649.5m and Pounds 509.2m, a return of 17.5 per cent and 12.1 per cent of premium income. Names are bearing the brunt of the downturn. Some estimates suggest that several thousand could become insolvent this year. 'The fact is that a horrendously large number of people are going bankrupt,' says the chairman of one group of Names considering legal action to recoup losses. The financial difficulties of the Names are being aggravated by the recession, with a depressed housing market making it difficult to raise cash by selling property. Dr Mary Archer, chairman of the Lloyd's Hardship Committee established last year to help Names in acute difficulties, and the wife of former Conservative party chairman Mr Jeffrey Archer, says the number of appeals for help has accelerated recently to about 150. She adds: 'I have to say that I would expect the case-load this year to be very heavy.' Until January 1990, Names had merely to show personal wealth of Pounds 100,000, and so it is people who joined the market before this date that have been most severely affected. Although Lloyd's membership carries an aura of wealth, many Names are middle class and joined the market because, says Mr Rew: 'They are strapped for cash. They need the income from Lloyd's for extras like school fees.' In a good year, Names could expect a return of at least 12 per cent on their investment. A fundamental and continuing attraction of membership has been that Names need only lodge 30 per cent of their Pounds 250,000 commitment with Lloyd's. They can continue to collect interest, dividends or rental income on the remainder. 'Over the years people have done pretty well. The money was easy to put up,' says one Name who works in a UK merchant bank and who joined the market in 1985. 'I just had to show property of Pounds 40,000 and a bank guarantee for Pounds 60,000.' Many Names, especially those who joined between 1977 and 1986 when Lloyd's membership nearly tripled, have insufficient capital to pay their share of current losses. Last week the personal columns of one national newspaper carried an advertisement that conjured images of Dickensian social disgrace. 'Ruined Name at Lloyd's,' it read. 'Must earn. Have wife. Will travel.' As the losses start to mount, more and more Names are refusing to pay up. Some Names are said to be 'protecting' their assets. There are reports that some Names have signed over their property and paper wealth to their spouses or have even shifted their money abroad. Increasingly, Names are resorting to legal action. Members of six syndicates have issued, and in some cases served, writs alleging that the negligence of their agents and underwriters is to blame for losses they have incurred. The court cases will be long. Much of the litigation stems from the market's exposure to US liability risks - asbestosis and pollution - which were not well understood at the time when syndicates contracted the original policies in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. Claims on these policies have resulted from court decisions of the 1970s and 1980s, in which US judges interpreted the law in a way that was more generous to policyholders than had been the case 20 years before. To complicate matters further, much of this 'high risk' liability business was insured and reinsured in London at a time when the rules governing Lloyd's market were not as stringent as they are today. From the market's point of view, the possibility of future claims on many of these US liability policies cannot be ruled out. The uncertainty means that syndicate managers have been unable to assess the scale of future claims and more than 90 underwriting years have been left open - syndicates' accounts cannot be closed. Since Names cannot leave Lloyd's while they are on an 'open year', many hundreds are, in effect, trapped. A look at some of the outstanding and potential cases against Lloyd's will serve to illustrate the problems the market now faces: Last week, a civil case brought by 33 Names - members of four syndicates formerly managed by Oakeley Vaughan Underwriting Agency, now in liquidation  -against the Corporation of Lloyd's, began at the High Court in London. This is the first time in the market's 300-year history that a case against Lloyd's has actually gone to court. The Names allege Lloyd's failed properly to supervise the market in the period between 1980 and 1982 when, as a result of financial mismanagement, the Oakeley Vaughan syndicates made heavy losses. A civil case involving more than 880 Names who were members of the Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 in 1982 is set to go to court in November. The Names are suing various agents at Lloyd's to recoup insurance losses of more than Pounds 200m. In 1982 Outhwaite reinsured the asbestosis exposures of about 20 Lloyd's syndicates. The action against Outhwaite alleges that the acceptance of so big a risk by Outhwaite without any corresponding reinsurance constituted negligent underwriting. The Names also allege that the members' agents that funnelled their Names on to the Outhwaite syndicate were also negligent. About 570 Names who backed syndicate 553, managed by the Warrilow agency, face losses of about Pounds 80m and have issued writs against the agency and members' agents, alleging negligence in the way business was conducted. The case is expected to come to court next year. Names on two syndicates, 90 and 334, managed by Pulbrook Underwriting Agency, face some of the heaviest individual losses. Two hundred and eighty Names who were members of Pulbrook syndicate 334 in 1985 lost about Pounds 30m and have issued writs against the syndicate's managing agent and members' agents. A further 250 Names who were members of Pulbrook syndicate 90 face losses of about Pounds 40m and have also sued members and managing agents. Names on syndicate 90 allege that Pulbrook Underwriting Management, which managed the syndicate, was negligent in failing to make full business disclosure to its reinsurers, thus enabling the reinsurer to deny liability. Winchester Bowring, the broker which placed the reinsurance contract, is also accused of negligence. Late last year over 100 Names who backed syndicates 106 in 1985 and 108 in 1986 issued writs against the syndicates' managing agency, John Poland, and members' agencies. Next week, more than 2,000 Names who face potential losses of Pounds 300m as a result of the failures of syndicates managed by the Feltrim agency are expected to decide whether to pursue legal action. If they go ahead, they will push the total number of litigating Names to more than 2,000, a figure approaching 10 per cent of the market's total membership. An official at one members' agency believes half the market's membership of 26,500 could be involved in court action before the end of the year. Though all these cases involve individual allegations of negligence or misconduct, a more fundamental problem provides the backdrop to them. Even without the losses sustained in the US, changes in the structure of the market itself would have made it a riskier place in which to invest over the past 10 years. During the 1980s the rate of underwriting profit that a typical Lloyd's member could expect to make fell by more than a third, says Mr David Newton, who runs an investment advisory service for overseas Names. After the introduction of a new self-regulatory regime at Lloyd's in 1982, syndicates and their agents incurred expensive new legal obligations which increased the cost of doing business in the market. Salaries also increased sharply. As a result, the fees that some Names pay to their agents have doubled over the past 10 years, says Mr Newton. Names also run more risk now. They can still deduct any underwriting losses against other income to reduce tax bills, but this is much less of an advantage than it was during the 1970s when the top rate of personal income tax was 98 per cent. More important is the fact that while only a minority of syndicates made losses in the early 1980s, more recently the market as a whole has been affected as a result of a combination of factors. First, premiums have been depressed as a result of competition between Lloyd's and international companies; second, Lloyd's syndicates have recorded a string of billion-dollar losses as a result of natural disasters; and third, there has been a continuing deterioration in results from US liability business because of the impact of pollution claims. In the past Names have typically relied on the advice of their members' agent, taking little interest in the results of the syndicates which they were backing. But because of the current harsh conditions they are less likely to succeed if they do not keep a close eye on their affairs. They must look at 'membership as a true business proposition,' says Mr Newton. But does the market provide enough of the right kind of information to make such an approach possible? And are its regulatory mechanisms adequate to protect Names? Lloyd's practices in two areas - the mechanisms to monitor premium income accepted by syndicates and the amount of information disclosed to Names - have both improved since 1982. But despite these improvements in the market's practice, there are still serious grounds for concern. One Name, who became a member of Lloyd's in 1984, says: 'They are not disclosing the truly significant business. I would hazard a guess that Lloyd's is 15 to 20 years behind the Stock Exchange in its requirements of disclosure' of business information. The chairman of Lloyd's Mr David Coleridge, who took over late last year, is receptive to criticism. His election was significant in several ways, not least because he represents the growing power of the bigger agency groups, such as Sturge and Merrett, whose interests are best served by a more stable relationship between a richer, more selectively recruited set of Names and a more professional market. A task force, on which Mr Anthony Haynes, the chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, as well as a several leading figures on the market is sitting, is conducting a through review of operations. Mr Haynes is optimistic that its report could lead to improvements. But for those embittered Names who face bankruptcy, reform could come too late.</p>

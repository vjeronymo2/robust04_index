			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Letter: Government cover for private export insurance Sir, Mr Price rightly points out (Letters, May 9) that some other EC governments provide export credit insurance cover for the more risky importing countries though they may do this indirectly through private-sector companies. This is indeed the set-up which will apply in the UK following the privatisation of the Insurance Services Group of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Mr Lilley - in the remarks to parliament to which Mr Price refers (May 2) - was making the point that the proposed changes to ECGD will bring it more into line with arrangements in other EC countries. As the minister for trade made clear at the report stage of the Export and Investment Guarantees Bill, the government, after privatisation of Insurance Services, will provide 100 per cent reinsurance through the continuing ECGD for business on a handful of importing countries which are not at present acceptable to the private reinsurance market. He stressed that the need for this will be kept under review but, subject to satisfactory financial performance within ECGD's trading account, it will continue for as long as the government considered it essential to meet exporters' reasonable needs. This support is likely to be a relatively minor ECGD facility, applying to only about Pounds 300m a year of exports - not because of government reluctance to provide a larger facility, but simply because of the successful progress in negotiating arrangements with the private reinsurance market which should ensure that the bulk of Insurance Services risks - both commercial and political - will be placed in the private market upon privatisation. It is, perhaps, in this latter respect that future UK arrangements may differ from those in some other EC countries. The government's aim has been to privatise the business of Insurance Services. This would not be achieved if a large element of that business continued to be reinsured by government, particularly when it could be placed in the private market. The government has, therefore, sought to maximise the scope of private market reinsurance in a way that some other EC governments may not yet have done and which is not damaging to UK exporters' interests. It is a difference of degree, rather than principle. The government believes that this approach is already being reflected in steps being taken in virtually every other EC country to increase private sector involvement in the provision of export credit insurance.

			<p>BFN     [Text] An amount equal to 50 Bn [billion] rubles has been  made available Thursday for the urgent needs of the coal mining  industry, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Shokhin told 12  pickets outside the government headquarters. Another 60 Bn will  be transferred Friday and in April 300 Bn rubles will be made  available to the industry every week from state funds.    Shokhin emphasized that these payments were made possible by  predictions of stable revenue next month. There are no such  predictions for subsequent months and so such a timetable could  not be outlined. "We don't wish to make promises on which we  cannot deliver," Shokhin said.    He added that he had been appointed Thursday to chair the  inter-sectoral commission on socioeconomic problems of the coal  mining communities (this position had once been occupied by  Yegor Gaydar -- IF) and intended to give much attention to this  work.    Shokhin and senior officials of numerous Russian ministries  will have a meeting with 500 miners representing various  communities who picketed the White House on 30 and 31 March.  Shokhin will also tell them about the steps the government is  taking to stabilize the coal mining industry.    "Local developments will depend on the miners' response to  these proposals," Vitaliy Budko, chairman of the Russian Coal  Mining Industry Trade Union, told Interfax following the meeting  with Shokhin.</p>

			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Clean break from acquisition strategy: Metallgesellschaft is selling assets and providing environmental services Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of the Metallgesellschaft mining and industrial group, has pursued one of the most aggressive acquisition trails of any German company in the four years he has been chief executive. But now, in a turnround of this strategy, the company is about to embark on a large-scale programme of asset sales. As Mr Schimmelbusch an-nounced last week, the plan is to sell non-core businesses to raise nearly DM1bn (Pounds 400m) by the end of the next financial year. He is not saying which companies are for sale but he has been through the group's 258 subsidiaries and a list of potential targets has been prepared. This strategic reorientation - combined with a 40 per cent cut in capital spending this year - follows two difficult years for the company. In the year to end-September 1992 pre-tax profits fell 23 per cent to DM245m, in spite of a 20 per cent rise in turnover to DM25.6bn reflecting acquisitions. In the previous year, profits had dropped 35 per cent from DM483m in 1990. The combination of the poor figures and the switch in strategy raise fundamental questions about what Mr Schimmelbusch - a 48-year old Austrian who worked for a Wall Street investment bank before he joined Metallgesellschaft more than 20 years ago - has achieved during his time as chief executive. 'We diversified because we were about to lose our shirt, our last shirt,' says Mr Schimmelbusch. 'We had to get out] Five years ago, we decided that it was essential to reduce our dependency on low-value added cyclical commodities like zinc and copper and base our future on the commercialisation of the technology we had developed to clean up our own metals business.' Over the five years, the group has spent at least DM1bn on smaller acquisitions. In addition, Metallgesellschaft completed one of Germany's largest corporate transactions at the beginning of last year with the DM1.45bn acquisition of the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel from Stora of Sweden. These include Buderus (heating equipment, building materials and stainless steel goods) and the Dynamit Nobel explosives and plastics company. The net result of the strategy is that via 88 subsidiaries in the sector, Metallgesellschaft has annual turnover of DM4bn in environmental services such as recycling, pollution control and decontamination. This, Mr Schimmelbusch boasts, makes Metallgesellschaft the biggest environmental services group in Europe. 'There is an endless market in eastern Europe,' he says, confident that the move into environmental services was correct. He points to 12 de-sulphurisation plants commissioned last year - one in Ukraine, two in Russia, three in Czechoslovakia and six in Poland - which brought DM500m of revenue. Environmental services may indeed be the market of the future, but for now profits from this area are not large. In fact, if the purpose of the diversification was to reduce the group's dependence on the cyclical base metals markets, it has not succeeded. Along came the next slump, and the group's profits tumbled as if there had been no diversification programme. 'We would have sailed through the downturn quite happily', says Mr Schimmelbusch, 'had the former Soviet Union not broken apart. When we were at the very height of our diversification programme we were hit by a massive flood of imported metals from the former Soviet Union.' He says that average non-ferrous metal prices have dropped by Dollars 200 a tonne over the past two years. 'When you're producing 1.2m tonnes a year, this leads to a substantial amount of lost earnings,' he says. Even without the influx of cheap metals from the east, there would have been problems. 'The corporate hospital is always full,' Mr Schimmelbusch says. The sickest patient in this hospital is Kolbenschmidt, Metallgesellschaft's car components subsidiary. Exposed to the full brunt of the downturn in the world car industry, Kolbenschmidt lost DM88.6m last year before tax. 'We would have been able to compensate for this, for everything, if it had not been for the imports from the east,' Mr Schimmelbusch argues. But he concedes that one big problem is of the company's own making. Mr Schimmelbusch says he and his board were aware of the irony of a base metal producer - one of the world's dirtiest industries - setting itself up as a provider of environmental services. It was important to bring the group's smelters up to the highest possible standards of cleanliness. Now, the smelters look like 'pharmaceutical factories, with people walking around in white coats'. This cost in excess of DM1bn over the past five years, money which Mr Schimmelbusch now admits was spent too hastily and in too large quantities. Customers have not appreciated the fact that their zinc or lead was produced in a more environmentally friendly way than a cheaper, dirtier version. Earlier this month, Metallgesellschaft said it would be closing its Ruhr-Zinc smelter for two months from the middle of April. The time will come when all producers in Europe will have to meet the high standards set by Metallgesellschaft, Mr Schimmelbusch believes. But in the meantime the group has to concentrate on making itself more profitable and winnowing down its portfolio of businesses. In the UK or the US, such a consolidation phase would often be seized upon as an opportunity to launch a hostile bid - especially as the stock market value of Metallgesellschaft's holding in other quoted companies exceeds its own market value of DM2.9bn. 'Some cold capitalist with no heart for the environment would make a bid and sell off the holdings,' jokes Mr Schimmelbusch. He is free from such pressures as 70-75 per cent of the company's shares are in the hands of safe, long-term shareholders such as Deutsche Bank, Allianz and Dresdner Bank. They, Mr Schimmelbusch says, are prepared to be patient. Anything but patient, Mr Schimmelbusch jumps up and brings the interview to a close with a half-joke: 'I have to go now and sell some companies to improve the group's profitability.'</p>

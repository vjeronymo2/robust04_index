			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / Arts: The Country Wife - Theatre In the mid-1980s a run of Wycherley's The Country Wife at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre dazzlingly summed up that decade's attitudes through the prism of Restoration comedy. Nicholas Hytner's strutting, rapping production portrayed a predatory jungle where people are commodities, where the innocent survive only by learning duplicity, and where the clowns in authority are not only buffoons but can be brutes as well. It worked. Above all, though it disturbed, the production's sheer swish, style and swagger were exhilarating. The Royal Shakespeare Company now brings what is, incredibly, its first Country Wife from Stratford (premiered last August) to The Pit. What does director Max Stafford-Clark see in the play for the sober and grim-faced 1990s? Chiefly, sobriety and grimness. A visually conventional production (the only anachronisms are the modern-looking banknotes oiling the intrigue, and Horner's skin-tight Lycra breeches) has been decked out with a needless new prologue (by Stephen Jeffries) and songs by Ian Dury and Mickey Gallagher that are unnecessary to the point of embarrassment. And nobody seems to have told some accomplished actors how to play comedy. This is glaringly apparent in the pivotal relationship between the over-protective Pinchwife, suspicious of London's debauched society, and his naive spouse, a rustic fruit ripe for plucking. Robin Soans presents neither a comically jealous clown nor a grotesquely possessive jailer but a well-spoken little man who at times seems the most reasonable person on stage: a basically correct man whose virtue, taken to impracticable extremes, topples him into social unacceptability. All comedy must be played straight, consistently and true to its context; but this Pinchwife is given no context. When he threatens to stab out his wife's eyes or 'write whore with this pen-knife on your face' the words are neither frightening nor funny, since the character exists in a vacuum. This is particularly hard on Debra Gillett who in other circumstances might prove an outstanding Margery. Round-faced and saucer-eyed, she makes a droll boy in her masculine disguise, and works hard to play her scenes as comic though often with no support from a partner who has apparently been directed otherwise. Pinchwife's new reasonableness, in a character usually depicted as a boor and a bully, naturally necessitates some adjustment in his rivals and competitors. The nearest thing to romantic interest, Harcourt is played by Jonathan Phillips with a cold, calculating urgency that suits a conniving machiavel more than a dashing lover. Horner, the compulsive lecher, is not, by definition, moderate; but he should at least give some inkling as to his irresistible appeal to women. The excellent Jeremy Northam has incisiveness, intelligence, voice and physical presence, but nary a glimpse of charm apart from those Lycra breeches. And when the production comes up point blank against an inescapeably comic figure, it falls flat. The usually sensible Simon Dormandy makes Sparkish a stereotype fop. Such characters can be made to come to life: one thinks of the RSC's own Simon Russell-Beale. No, the 1990s, whether cynically disillusioned or thoughtfully caring, still await a zeitgeist production of Wycherley's great comedy. At The Pit (071-638 8891).</p>

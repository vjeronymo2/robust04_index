			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> AT HOME;  </P> <P> PET STORE AT YOUR DOOR  </P> <P> DOGS ARE BARKING, cats are purring -- all pandemonium has broken loose. The  animals seem to know that a good friend has arrived.  </P> <P> It's Tracy Parsons, president and co-founder of Critter Caterers, and her  packed station wagon. "We're a complete food, toys, treats, gifts and even  apparel delivery service for dogs and cats," Parson says. "We don't charge a  delivery or membership fee, our prices are comparable to pet stores' and we  even have an animal-care specialist for dietary evaluations."  </P> <P> This is not just another superfluous faddish service. Those who have pets know  how often they must fit a trip to the pet store into their hectic schedules and  how often they run out of pet food. Critter Caterers delivers everything pet  owners need, from leashes to dog houses -- and it takes orders daily from 7  a.m. to 9 p.m.  </P> <P> A popular specialty, Bentley's Biscuits, are fresh, homemade treats named after  Parsons' own Old English sheep dog. "We use only fresh, 'people' ingredients,"  Parsons says, "like whole-wheat flour, chicken broth and eggs. Pet owners have  told me that the biscuits are so good they eat them too."  </P> <P> Critter Caterers serves the dogs and cats of Los Angeles, Hancock Park, Beverly  Hills, Marina del Rey, Santa Monica and Malibu; (213) 837-8783.

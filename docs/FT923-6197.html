			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / The Markets Under Strain: ERM hit by weak dollar and high interest rates THE combination of the dollar's fall and high European interest rates brings a series of sharp dilemmas for the governments and central banks running the European monetary system. Not only in the UK, but also Germany, France and Italy, the pressures are on the rise. The German Bundesbank, whose tight monetary policies represent one of the root causes of the strains in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM), faces a more difficult predicament than is often supposed. The weak dollar, by reducing the competitiveness of German exporters, represents a further depressing influence on the west German economy, starting to flag after three years of buoyancy. While sales to the US account for only 7 per cent of total German exports, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew estimates German industry's total exposure to the dollar is about 15 per cent, including other dollar-linked markets. Mr Richard Reid, an economist with UBS in Frankfurt, says the Bundesbank might well accept the need for more companies to produce abroad as the price for inflationary success at home. Another analyst, concerned about the effect of the dollar's weakness is Mr Thomas Mayer, a Frankfurt-based economist at Goldman Sachs. 'This puts an enormous squeeze on the German export industry ..it also increases the risk that the German economy will fall into recession in 1993.' Worries like this accounted for a further fall in German share prices yesterday, with export-oriented stocks leading the decline. In Frankfurt, the DAX share index lost nearly 2 per cent, bringing it to the lowest level since February, 1991. Fears of economic downturn will raise pressure on the Bundesbank to cut interest rates this autumn sooner than it currently wants to. On the other hand, if it maintains its tough interest rate stance, the Bundesbank may end up provoking heavy speculative currency inflows into Germany which would counteract its efforts to damp money supply growth. If sterling or the lira fall to their ERM floor, the Bundesbank is obliged, along with central banks of the weak currencies, to sell D-Marks to maintain parities. The close link between the ERM turbulence and the September 20 vote brings particular problems for the French finance ministry. The currency unrest could scarcely have come at a worse time for the French government, anxious to paint a picture of economic and political stability during the run-up to the referendum. The government knows that its standing could be damaged if monetary pressures cause it to change its economic policy, either by raising interest rates or devaluing the franc within the ERM. If the French government was forced to raise interest rates to protect the franc, this year's economic growth would almost certainly fall short of the 2 per cent forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. None the less, the dollar's decline could still have an effect on the electorate by adding to worries about the economic outlook. French companies have fared well on the export front so far this year. However exports could flag if the dollar remains at current levels. In Italy, the government's options in response to ERM pressures are even narrower than in France. Italy's new administration seems ready to watch the lira lose ground against the D-Mark, even if the exchange rate is widely taken as a barometer of the country's economic health. The government appears to be making a distinction between adverse currency movements which affect the lira alone, and those which are part of a general trend, as at present. Last month, the Bank of Italy moved quickly to raise the discount rate in two stages to 13.75 per cent when the lira came under immense speculative pressure. By contrast, the lira's current plunge is conceived as part of a much wider problem based on the gap between German and US interest rates. As long as the lira is not singled out for particular attack on the foreign exchanges, the government seems willing to put the onus on the Germans to act. Should speculative attention turn specifically against the lira, then a further rise is inevitable.

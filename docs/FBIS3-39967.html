			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Maltese Prime Minister Eddie Fenech Adami by </F> Andre Riche; place and date not given: "On Malta Candidacy to  European Union"]    [Text] [Riche] There is a great deal of talk about the  expansion of the European Union [EU]. Negotiations with Sweden,  Finland, Norway, and Austria are ending. But negotiations with  Malta, which is also a candidate, are a long way from starting.  Are you satisfied with the way in which the EU is treating your  candidacy?    [Adami] We are satisfied with the opinion that the European  Commission has given on our candidacy. It stresses Malta's  European vocation and indicates in what sphere the Maltese  economy will have to be restructured with a view to joining the  Union. Since then, we have had technical discussions with the  European Commission's offices. The result is very satisfactory.    [Riche] In what spheres are there problems?    [Adami] There are some overprotected economic spheres which  we will have to open and tariff barriers which we are  dismantling. We will have to continue the program to liberalize  our economy, particularly in the financial sector.    In the fiscal sphere, we will have to come into line with  the  European directives, but I think that Malta will always play a  special role as a financial market place in the Mediterranean  without being a tax haven. In general, all the provisions which  the Commission recommended to us are already planned in my  government's program.    [Riche] Your country's small size has often been cited as a  possible obstacle to membership and to the normal functioning of  the institutions.    [Adami] I am aware that there is an institutional problem  brewing in the Union which relates to small countries. But  there is no reason for delaying the membership negotiations if  Malta fulfills the necessary conditions.    [Riche] Would you agree, for instance, that because of its  small size, your country should not be taken into consideration  in the Union's rotating presidency?    [Adami] I could not accept such discriminatory treatment.    [Riche] What benefit could your membership bring to the EU?    [Adami] If Malta was a member of the Union, it would bring a  new political dimension, as a country occupying a central  position in the Mediterranean, on the Union's southern flank.  Malta could play an important role as a link between the Union  and its southern neighbors.    [Riche] At present, the Union is negotiating expansion to  four countries which are much richer than the Community average  and which will contribute to the budget. Do you think that it  will quickly negotiate with poorer countries, like Malta, and  all the other declared candidates?    [Adami] Malta is such a small country -- 350,000 inhabitants  -- that notions of net contributor or net beneficiary from the  Community budget lose all relevance. Our economic wealth is  comparable to the levels of Greece or Portugal. Our current  growth rate is around 4.5 percent. Our inflation is low: Less  than 4 percent, as is our foreign debt. And unemployment is 4  percent. Our public deficit is within the Maastricht convergence  standards. Indeed, we could be members of the Monetary Union.    [Riche] What benefit will Malta derive from accession to the  Union?    [Adami] Better opportunities for economic expansion. In a  way, our economy is already integrated into that of the Union  because almost 80 percent of our exports go there. In the  political sphere, membership will bring greater stability to  Malta and the Mediterranean region. And this stability is bound  to benefit everybody.    [Riche] Are you not afraid that your case will be paired  with  that of Cyprus which is also a candidate but which will probably  have to await a settlement between Greece and Turkey?    [Adami] It emerges from all the recent European summits,  that  the membership applications of Malta and Cyprus will be taken  into consideration on their own merits. It is true that the two  questions have been linked in speaking of "Mediterranean  candidacies" but since then it has been clearly admitted that  they are different.    [Riche] What is the Maltese public's feeling with regard to  membership?    [Adami] Very largely positive. There is not one organized  group -- party, trade union, and so forth -- which is opposed to  it.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any previously analyzed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This change only affects the use of the ESW system under postaccident conditions. The LPCI system will continue to function as credited in the accident analyses. No other systems or components are affected by this proposed Technical Specification change. Therefore, this change cannot create a new or different kind of accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  3. Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This proposed Technical Specification does not affect normal LPCI operation for torus cooling. This Specification establishes controls which ensure that an unmonitored release does not occur, even if the positive differential pressure does not exist in the LPCI heat exchanger due to the throttling of LPCI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Removal of the differential pressure by itself does not promote failure of the LPCI heat exchanger. For a release to occur, the heat exchanger has to fail by an independent method. Both heat exchangers will be eddy current tested each refueling outage to ensure integrity. Also, routine surveillance of the torus water would detect any leakage in the heat exchangers during the operating cycle. These measures provide confidence that the integrity of the heat exchangers will exist at the time of the postulated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The period of time when ESW pressure may be lower than LPCI pressure is limited to several days. Considering the integrity of the heat exchangers, it is very unlikely that they would develop a leak during this period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although unlikely, if a leak were to develop, it will be detected by the monitoring and sampling. Survey monitoring would be initiated prior to loss of positive differential pressure. Sampling ensures that any release lower than the sensitivity of the survey meter would also be detected and quantified. The quantity of the release can be estimated by assuming that any measured release existed continuously from the time that the positive differential pressure was lost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Although not relied upon for maintaining system integrity, the positive differential pressure does provide an additional layer of defense in depth. In some accident scenarios, it may be replaced by a monitoring and sampling program. If a release is detected, appropriate action will be taken as the situation requires. Considering the small likelihood of a release, the small consequences of such a release, and the compensatory measures available, the proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination. Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice will be considered in making any final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expiration of the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change during the notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazards consideration. The final determination will consider all public and State comments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publish in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  a notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur very infrequently.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules Review and Directives Branch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication date and page number of this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. Written comments may also be delivered to Room 6D22, Two White Flint North, 11555 Rockville Pike, Rockville, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Federal workdays. Copies of written comments received may be examined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  By July 7, 1994, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a written request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR part 2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 which is available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the local public document room located at the Learning Resources Center, Three Rivers Community-Technical College, Thames Valley Campus, 574 New London Turnpike, Norwich, Connecticut 06360. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition; and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

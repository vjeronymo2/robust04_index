			<p>BFN     [Text] The NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] says  the Nigerian contingent of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West  African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] is continuing its  disrespect for the Government and Constitution of the Republic  of Liberia.    According to an NPFL press release, the arrest and  imprisonment of thousands of Liberians by ECOMOG on grounds of  merrymaking and curfew violation shatters the pride of the  Liberian people. The NPFL release says ECOMOG cannot be  permitted to play the role of being a judge, jury, and  executioner in the Liberian conflict when there is a  constitutional government to give clearly-defined instructions.    The NPFL is, therefore, calling on the people of Liberia,  especially those in Monrovia, to be vigilant in protecting the  civil liberties of the nation.</p>

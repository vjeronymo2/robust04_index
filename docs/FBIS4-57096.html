			<p>BFN     [Text] San Carlos de Bariloche (DYN) -- If you are a  Peruvian and you want to do business with the cloth dyeing  method discovered by the Incas centuries ago you can't because  the process has been patented by US companies, the President of  the Peruvian national pharmaceutical companies association  Alvaro Villalobos said yesterday.    Speaking at the XV ALIFAR Latin American association of  pharmaceutical companies meeting being held here, Villalobos  added that "and if we wanted to use the dyeing techniques we  should have to pay royalties to these US companies."    Another odd story recounted by Villalobos is that the Nazca  drawings, purported to be messages to the gods, have had a  patent taken out on them in France and now no products  containing those drawings can be sold in France.    These are just some of the sore points that have cropped up  at the meeting of Latin American pharmaceutical companies  discussing the patents issue here.    Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador have succumbed to US  pressure  and have recently implemented a patents system, Argentina and  Brazil however continue to show strong resistance to any system  being imposed on them from abroad.    Although CILFA [Argentine Industrial Center of  Pharmaceutical  Laboratories], Argentina's local association of companies have  resisted tooth-and-nail any efforts to impose a patents law, on  this occasion they will be adopting a more moderate approach and  unlike some of the extreme views being expressed by other  delegations, will be seeking to get the other countries to  accept the GATT's Uruguay Round proposals on the patents issue.    The GATT treaty, signed recently by 117 countries proposes a  transition period of ten years for developing countries and the  possibility of awarding obligatory licences so as to ward off  monopoly situations.    In Argentina government officials have teamed up with  senators to try and bring the patents bill currently before the  Senate, into line with the GATT provisions.    Despite the fact that the US signed the GATT Treaty it has  been attempting to gain further advantages as was the case with  Brazil where Brazilian President Itamar Franco has promised the  US that Brazil will eliminate or substantially reduce the  transition period.    However the Brazilian patents bill has still not been  approved by its Congress.    US pressure has also grown considerably on Andean Pact  countries.    Peru has a patents law since January 1, as does Ecuador.    Venezuela adopted a law last October while Chile adopted a  patents law in 1991.    However according to the head of the Chilean pharmaceutical  association Jose Plubins, "the pressure being exerted by the US  on Chile to change its patents law is becoming unbearable."    In Chile's case the US is attempting to extend the life of  the patent from 15 to 20 years and that patenting should be  retroactive by five years.    Nor does a patents law guarantee foreign investments, as the  multinationals proclaim.    In Chile Pfizer, Bayer, Squibb, Schering and Parke Davies  have left Chile since the patents law was implemented.</p>

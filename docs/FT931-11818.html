			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / International Company News: AAH paying Pounds 11m for retail pharmacy growth AAH HOLDINGS is expanding its retail pharmacy interests through the acquisition of Clark Care Group at a total cost of up to Pounds 11.3m. Clark Care runs 20 pharmacies in Kent and East Sussex. For the year ended January 31 1992, the latest available period, it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 210,000 and is expected to contribute not less than Pounds 1.2m in the year to March 31 1994 as a result of operational synergies and reduced overheads. Net assets at end January 1992 were Pounds 756,000, including goodwill. Initial consideration is Pounds 7.5m, of which Pounds 4.8m is satisfied by the issue of 842,106 AAH shares; a further 549,658 shares have been placed on behalf of the vendors with institutions to finance the balance. Additionally, 636,364 shares have been placed to facilitate the repayment of all borrowings of Clark Care at completion, which amounted to some Pounds 3.5m. Dependent on the final valuation of net assets, an additional maximum Pounds 300,000 will be paid post completion. AAH said with retail pharmacy margins currently under pressure, volume related purchasing opportunities have increased in importance. Clark Care will expand group retail turnover by some 12 per cent.</p>

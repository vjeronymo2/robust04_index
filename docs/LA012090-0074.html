			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EDISON LOSES LEAD, FALLS TO OCEAN VIEW  </P> <P> Another game, another collapse and Edison High School sank a little further in  the Sunset League standings.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive game, the Chargers couldn't hold a fourth-quarter  lead. Ocean View rallied from a nine-point deficit to win, 50-48, on two free  throws by Darren Ernst with three seconds left Friday night at Edison.  </P> <P> The loss dropped Edison two games out of first place, while Ocean View moved  into sole possession of first place, one game ahead of Marina.  </P> <P> "This was a great team effort," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. "They did a  good job of taking everything away from us for three quarters, but we pulled  together at the end. This is a big, big win."  </P> <P> For Edison, it was an all-too-familiar way to lose.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the Chargers had a nine-point lead against Marina entering the  fourth quarter only to lose, 61-55. On Friday, all that changed was the  opponent.  </P> <P> Part of the reason for the collapse was foul trouble. Center Bill Martineau and  forward Steve Thobe each picked up his fourth foul early in the final quarter.  Thobe eventually fouled out.  </P> <P> The Chargers (13-6 overall, 2-2 in league play) also were without Brandon  Jessie for part of the fourth quarter. Jessie missed more than two minutes  because of leg cramps.  </P> <P> The Seahawks (12-6, 4-0) trailed, 40-31, after the third quarter but held the  Chargers scoreless for the first three minutes of the fourth quarter. During  that time, Ocean View scored nine points to tie the score.  </P> <P> Ryan Martin (13 points) scored five points and Marcel TenBerge (13 points) had  four during the run.  </P> <P> "We haven't had any problems in the fourth quarter until this week," Edison  Coach Jon Borchert said. "Ocean View just executed better than we did in the  fourth quarter."  </P> <P> Especially during the final two minutes.  </P> <P> Jessie returned to the game to score five unanswered points. His three-point  field goal gave the Chargers a 48-42 lead with two minutes left.  </P> <P> The Chargers made nothing but mistakes from then on. They missed three shots  and turned the ball over three times down the stretch.  </P> <P> Martin and freshman Jim Harris made back-to-back three-point field goals to tie  the score, 48-48, with 1:08 left.  </P> <P> With 28 seconds left, the Chargers had the ball in the right hands, Jessie's,  who scored a game-high 18 points. However, Jessie missed a 15-foot jump shot  with eight seconds left and, in the scramble for the ball, he fouled Ernst with  three seconds left.  </P> <P> Ernst made both free throws. They were his only points in the game.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley 68, Marina 65 -- The Barons trailed, 65-64, with 30 seconds  left, but Derrick Corcoran made a three-point field goal and a free throw to  give Fountain Valley (8-10, 2-2) the victory at Marina. Corcoran finished with  23 points. Cherokee Parks had 21 points and 13 rebounds for Marina (11-8, 3-1).  </P> <P> Huntington Beach 70, Westminster 63 -- Scott Jahr scored 24 and Mustapha Abdi  17 for Huntington Beach. Mark Murphy scored 17 for Westminster (5-11, 0-4).  </P></p>

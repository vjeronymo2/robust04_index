			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Municipal Mutual plans provide for insolvency MUNICIPAL MUTUAL, the local authority-owned insurance company which stopped writing new business last year, yesterday published details of an arrangement which will come into effect if the company becomes insolvent. MMI transferred most of its continuing local authority business to Zurich Insurance in March 1993 and 17 other subsidiaries have been sold off. The company is continuing to meet claims on policies which remain in force, however, and believes it will have net assets of Pounds 907,000 following the 'run-off' of all insurance liabilities. Creditors, mainly local authorities, will be asked to approve the scheme at a meeting in January before it is submitted to the courts for final approval. Mr Maurice Stonefrost, chairman of MMI, said the directors of MMI believed that a solvent run-off could be achieved, although this would take many years. He added: 'The directors have put forward this scheme to ensure that creditors' interests are not disadvantaged by a period of uncertainty if a solvent run-off becomes unlikely.' The scheme has a provision which will enable portions of claims paid to scheme creditors after September 30 this year to be clawed back if the main provisions of the scheme are triggered, which should allow faster claim payment. The scheme does not affect the business of Municipal General Insurance, an MMI subsidiary which underwrote commercial business.</p>

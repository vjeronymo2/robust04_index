			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Delay hurts Gas Prolongation of a Monopolies and Merger Commission (MMC) inquiry hit British Gas shares as some securities houses argued that this would cause continued uncertainty for the company and shareholders. The MMC inquiry was expected to conclude at the end of April but it was announced late on Thursday that it would be delayed until the end of July. Hoare Govett and Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull were selling stock on the uncertainty. Dealers said Kleinwort Benson and UBS were buyers of Gas, and that there was a two-way pull which left the shares 6 down at 308 1/2 p with active turnover of just under 10m. Negative sentiment surrounding Wellcome helped to depress parts of the drugs sector. Glaxo fell 11 to 579p and Fisons lost 4 at 198p. However SmithKline Beecham gained as analysts spoke about the prospects for a rival drug to Wellcome's headline anti-herpes treatment Zovirax and in delayed reaction to a company presentation in the US this week. SmithKline shares lifted 14 1/2 in the 'A's to 422p and 10 in the Units to 365p. Chemicals group BOC fell 18 to 720p as some analysts cut forecasts. Stores stocks, which led the market's morning charge, faded rapidly, although most managed to remain on the positive side of the ledger. Particularly strong was Kingfisher, the shares surging 11 to 589p in turnover of 2.2m. There were a number of positive brokers in support of the stock. NatWest Securities was among them, the B&amp;Q home improvement arm the focus of its strong buy recommendation. Others were pointing to improved sales figures from Darty, the French electrical retailer bought by Kingfisher for Pounds 560m in February. However, there were also some dissenting voices in the market warning of the dangers of the stock overunning. Several retailers benefited from the good results turned in by Next on Thursday. Burton Group spurted forward, but slipped to close 1 1/2 ahead at 80 1/2 p in turnover of 3m. Great Universal Stores added 30 to 1613p, Storehouse 3 to 204p and Next a penny to 173p. There were further whispers heard on sales at Marks and Spencer, with food and womenswear both said to be particularly strong. The shares firmed a penny to 345p. More speculation over prospects for Dixons' US businesses saw the shares gain 6 to 211p. After several sessions in the doldrums, Argyll Group was wanted with dealers suggesting the stock had fallen far enough. The shares lifted 11 to 341p with turnover reaching a hefty 7.8m. The effect of Ladbroke Group's scrip dividend offer, which came after the market had closed on Thursday, failed to affect the shares which, after an initial spurt, slipped to close steady at 176p. The offer is for new ordinary shares to the value of 9.34p for each ordinary share. This equates to 8.88p, or half as much again as the 1992 final dividend of 6.23p, in cash terms. Leisure specialists predict the offer should benefit the shares by around 5 per cent. Profit-taking continued in Euro Disney following last week's flurry of information on the theme park's performance. The shares fell 35 to 1085p. Shares in building products and printing company MB-Caradon improved 2 to 320p after the sale of its 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, 163 lighter at 2475p. Selling of Smiths Industries continued, leaving the shares another 8 lighter at 321p. However, NatWest Securities believes the shares have fallen far enough and predicted a bounce. 'A dead cat bounce' is how one trader described the improvement in BM Group, up 3 at 21p. A profits upgrading from Carr Kitcat was said to have prompted the improvement in T &amp; N, 3 better at 189p.</p>

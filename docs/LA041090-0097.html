			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PRICES END 3-MONTH FALL, RISE 5%  </P> <P> After falling for three straight months, the average resale price of a  single-family house in the San Fernando Valley rose 5% in March to $307,100  from $293,800 in February, the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors reported  Monday.  </P> <P> The average was 11% higher than in March, 1989, when the average single-family  house was resold for $276,600.  </P> <P> Sales of single-family homes picked up markedly in March, rising 23% to 739  from 602 in February. But the total number of sales was still 38% under the  level of March, 1989, when 1,192 single-family houses were resold.  </P> <P> The average resale price of a condominium, meanwhile, rose less than 1% in  March, but hit a record high of $156,500, up from $156,000 in February.  </P> <P> The new average marked a 16% increase since March, 1989, when the average  resale price of a condominium was $134,900.  </P> <P> Condominium resales rebounded 23% in March to 341 from 277 in February. But  there were still 22% fewer condominium resales than in March, 1989, when 439  condominiums changed hands.  </P> <P> Despite this month's price increases, the Valley realty board said the large  inventory was curbing prices, as reflected in the record number of 11,682  condominiums and houses available for sale in March.  </P> <P> "The theory of supply and demand is taking over because there are more homes  for sale and buyers have more bargaining power on their side," Jim Link, the  board's executive vice president, said in a statement. "That's forcing many  sellers to negotiate and take a little less profit."  </P> <P> The Valley realty board is California's largest, and it reports on the resales  of houses and condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to  Agoura.  </P> <P> MARCH VALLEY HOME SALES  </P> <P> NORTH EAST -- Avg. Price: $170,900. Sales: 146  </P> <P> NORTH CENTRAL -- Avg. Price: $328,700. Sales: 110  </P> <P> NORTH WEST -- Avg. Price: $377,500. Sales: 30  </P> <P> SOUTH WEST -- Avg. Price: $387,500.

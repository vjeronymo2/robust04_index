			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> MAN, 70, KILLED AS CAR, TRUCK COLLIDE  </P> <P> Royal Dean Fadely was trying to do his son a favor by taking a look at his  dishwasher before the repairman came. When he left his son's condo Tuesday  morning to return home, he was struck by a tractor-trailer and killed.  </P> <P> Police said Rialto resident Leanne Fargon, 30, was driving the truck carrying  sand off a hill on Chapman Avenue just east of Crawford Canyon Road. Fadely,  70, was driving south on Crawford Canyon.  </P> <P> Police said both vehicles were in the intersection when the truck struck the  driver's side of Farley's white Thunderbird. Police could not determine who ran  the red light. No traffic tickets were issued, and Fargon was released at the  scene.  </P> <P> Fadely, a 17-year resident of Tustin and a retired advertising manager, was  pronounced dead about 20 minutes after the accident while still pinned in his  car. An official from the coroner's office said Fadely was wearing his seat  belt but that it didn't help since the truck smashed directly into the door on  the driver's side.  </P> <P> Several area residents gathered around the scene and spoke about the frequent  accidents that occur at the intersection, which is at the bottom of a hill  outside Santiago Canyon, where a lot of construction work has taken place in  the last few years, residents said.  </P> <P> Ron Roper, a driver's education teacher at Santa Ana High School, has lived in  a house about 100 feet from the intersection for about 10 years and said at  least one serious accident happens there every six months.  </P> <P> "When you have the green arrow at that intersection, you don't assume the other  trucks are going to stop," he said, referring to facing traffic that is coming  down the hill. He said he has often waited at a green turn signal while  fast-moving vehicles, mostly trucks, ran red lights. He said that many car  drivers also speed down Crawford Canyon Road.  </P> <P> "No amount of engineering is going to stop an accident if someone runs a red  light," said Chuck Glass, a traffic engineer with the city of Orange. He added  that all city equipment in the area, including the lights, was working  properly.  </P> <P> Glass would not comment on the safety of the intersection compared to that of  other intersections, but said that one fatal accident there every six months  was possible. The speed limit on the hill just east of the intersection is 45  m.p.h., he said.  </P> <P> The city installed a traffic light about halfway down the hill several months  ago, residents said, and the signal has helped slow traffic. Glass said the  light was installed to accommodate traffic from new housing developments, not  because of the truck traffic. LUCY CHABOT  </P></p>

			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Sinking funds: The so-called pensions experts to task The enormity of the scam perpetrated by the late Robert Maxwell on present and future pensioners of his ailing business empire still leaves even sophisticated observers aghast. Yet there is something equally shocking about the loud protestations from pensions experts that no pension fund can be fully protected from a determined crook bent on theft. This is beside the point when the inadequacy of a regulatory structure based on the rickety protection of trust law has constituted an open invitation to crooks for 30 years or more. Employees and pensioners both in and out of the Maxwell empire deserve a better answer to the question of why it was allowed to happen. The warning signals have been there for years - not least in the newspaper industry. After the News Chronicle went bust in 1960, employees and pensioners discovered that their retirement incomes were funded out of revenue without the backing of a fund. When a shareholder challenged an attempt to compensate people at the defunct paper for the loss of pension rights, the High Court ruled against compensation. Since then there have been countless cases where directors of relatively small companies have looted pension funds when their company ran into trouble. Pensions experts said the abuse was confined to a small minority of funds. Some consolation for those whose retirement was wrecked. Then there was the plight of hundreds of thousands who lost their jobs in the recession of the early 1980s. The rules of most pension schemes ensure that so-called early leavers end up subsidising the benefits of those who are lucky enough to keep their jobs. The huge resulting transfer of real wealth from the less fortunate to the more fortunate went largely unremarked. Yet this abuse of trust was arguably a far worse scandal than anything done by Mr Maxwell. But the biggest scandal of all is that this Pounds 400bn industry has been hijacked for purposes quite different from those for which occupational pension schemes were originally set up. A pension fund exists to deliver the best possible retirement benefits to employees or it is nothing. Yet the trustees of pension schemes across the land have allowed pension funds to be turned into profit centres for the company. Money that should have been devoted to improving pension benefits - not least for existing and deferred pensioners who have been appallingly short-changed - has been used to bolster profits through pension holidays and now withdrawals. This may differ from the Maxwell case in that there is not necessarily any suggestion of illegality and such practice has been encouraged by government and by Inland Revenue rules on the uses of pension fund surpluses. But is it moral? The scandal extends far beyond Maxwell. And clearly politicians and their officials are substantially to blame. Having failed to deliver a decent state pension scheme, successive governments failed to deliver adequate regulatory arrangements for private occupational pensions. Industrialists, in their role as trustees, have also behaved less than admirably, since they have increasingly lost sight of the real purpose of the trust (and in some cases made disproportionate claims on their own pension funds for inflated retirement incomes). But in the final analysis perhaps it is the ever-vociferous pensions lobby that deserves most scorn. I recall, as long ago as 1978, writing an investigation for The Economist on incestuous financial relations between companies and their pension funds - in other words, incipient Maxwellitis. The response of the then chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds was that 'the last thing we want is more legislation and control'. As irony would have it, the gentleman in question was also director of pensions at Reed International, then the owner of - you've guessed it - Mirror Group Newspapers. No doubt the 'we' in question referred not to the pensioners but to the pensions industry - that gaggle of actuaries, lawyers, bankers and consultants who have profited so mightily over a long period from one of Britain's richest gravy trains. Their response to calls for tighter regulation, better treatment of deferred pensioners or better treatment of virtually anyone else, has invariably been to appeal to the lowest common denominator of 19th century corporate behaviour by claiming that the slightest increase in costs would cause employers to reduce benefits or close down the funds. They even managed to argue that the introduction of compensation funds to protect victims of abuse would be too expensive, while simultaneously claiming that abuse was minimal. When the government finally and belatedly frames a new pension act in response to Maxwell, it should treat this dismal, self-serving lobby with the disrespect that its past performance deserves. It should aim for a thorough ring-fence around the fund to ensure the greatest possible independence from management; better treatment for pension rights in a winding-up; a decent compensation scheme; and an end to the ambiguity over the ownership of pension funds. Pension rights that can be so easily removed from employees are not worthy of the name. They are a fraud, like the late Mr Maxwell.</p>

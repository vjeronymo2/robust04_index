			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government has  tentatively decided to suspend the South Korea-U.S. joint  military exercise Team Spirit until mid-May, the deadline for  North Korea to allow further inspections by the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), informed sources said Monday.    The United Nations Security Council told North Korea to  permit IAEA checks by the middle of May in a presidential  statement issued March 31.    The government will hold a meeting of related ministers this  week, after Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu returns from trips to  the United States and Japan, to discuss Team Spirit's  suspension, the sources said. A final decision on suspending the  war games will be made at a South Korean-U.S. defense  ministers' meeting.    U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry will visit Seoul on  April 17 to discuss the North Korean problem and meet with his  South Korean counterpart Yi Pyong-tae.    The South Korean Government is considering suspension of  Team  Spirit because it wants the North to respond positively to the  Security Council president's statement.    If Pyongyang refuses to allow inspections by mid-May,  however, Seoul may resume Team Spirit in late May or sometime in  the second half of this year, the sources said.    Seoul also plans to allow deployment of Patriot missiles as  scheduled since the Patriot is purely a defensive weapon.</p>

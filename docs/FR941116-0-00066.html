Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 22, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) about market-based rates for oil pipelines. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In the NOI, the Commission first inquired whether it should continue to permit oil pipelines to seek market-based rates on a showing that they do not have significant market power in the relevant markets. The Commission also inquired about how it should make a market power determination and, in that connection, raised a number of substantive and procedural issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Inquiry, 58 FR 58814 (November 4, 1993), IV FERC Stats.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &amp; Regs. Notices &para; 35,527 (October 22, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) in response to the NOI and the comments to the NOI. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  In the NOPR, the Commission concluded that oil pipelines may continue to seek market-based rates upon a showing that they do not have significant market power in the relevant markets. In addition, the Commission concluded that no consensus existed on the substantive standards to be used in determining whether an oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets and that, therefore, the appropriate course of action is to develop oil pipeline precedents on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the Commission did not propose in the NOPR any substantive rules about market power determinations. However, the Commission did propose in the NOPR appropriate procedural rules to govern applications by oil pipelines for a market-power determination that could lead to market-based rates. The Commission has received comments on the NOPR from eleven commenters. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  In brief, after analyzing those comments as discussed below, the Commission is adopting the procedural rules proposed in the NOPR with minor modifications and some clarifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 59 FR 39985 (August 5, 1994), IV FERC Stats. &amp; Regs.

The Continuation of Market-Based Rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As in the NOPR, the Commission concludes that oil pipelines may continue to seek market-based rates on a showing that they do not possess significant market power in the relevant markets. Most of the commenters support or do not oppose the continuation of market-based rates. Only Sinclair and the Farmers oppose the continuation of market-based rates. Sinclair maintains that there is no need for a market-based methodology in light of the indexation approach adopted by the Commission in Order No. 561, coupled with the cost-of-service alternative. The Farmers argue that market-based ratemaking is not needed in that the Order No. 561 ratemaking options provide pipelines with ample flexibility in obtaining just and reasonable rates and that market-based ratemaking will create an unnecessary potential for abuse of market power.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that it is appropriate for oil pipelines to continue to be able to seek market-based rates because this approach comports with the spirit of the Act of 1992 by retaining a light-handed regulatory method to complement the indexing approach adopted as the generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines. In addition, as the Commission has previously stated, a market-based approach is clearly within the Commission's authority under the ICA. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  Further, the Commission believes that the market-based approach will be of use in circumstances where the oil pipeline needs the flexibility to compete provided by market-based rates, rather than other approaches. Under the market-based approach, the oil pipeline will be able to engage in competitive pricing in order to react to changes in market conditions, such as increased demand for its service. This can result in pricing that is both efficient and just and reasonable.

But rates based on historic cost do not function well to signal individuals how to efficiently respond to changes in market conditions. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Historic cost-based rates, even if indexed for past inflation, do not perform this function well, which generally requires one price to change relative to another. Therefore, where appropriate, it is reasonable to permit a market pricing option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The classic statement on the informational role of prices is F.

In that vein, both Sinclair and the Farmers in general support the rules proposed in the NOPR. Those rules will enable the Commission to comply with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Farmers Union  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> by not permitting market-based rates until there is an affirmative showing that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Such a showing will assure the Commission that the oil pipeline's prices are just and reasonable. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> FERC,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 734 F.2d 1486, 1510 (D.C.

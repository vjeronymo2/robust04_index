			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The autonomous regional discipline inspection and  supervisory work conference held its second plenary session at  the Tibet Great Hall of the People on the morning of 28 April.  Autonomous Regional Party Committee Secretary Chen Kuiyuan  delivered an important speech at the meeting. Autonomous party,  government, and military leaders including Guo Jinlong, Basang,  (Hu Yongchu), Yang Chuantang, Lieque, (Buqung), (Lu Huimin),  Puqung, Pudoje, (Tian Fujing), Baima Duoji, (Cui Jiguo), Cering  Sangzhub, (Chai Dan Zhuo Ma), and (Zhou Qishun), and Zhang Zhu,  political commissar of the Tibet People's Armed Police Force,  attended the meeting. All cadres attending the autonomous  regional discipline inspection and supervisory work conference,  and leading member cadres from organs at regional, prefectural,  and city levels attended the conference.    Comrade Chen Kuiyuan's speech consisted of three parts: 1)  basic evaluation of the anticorruption drive carried out at an  earlier stage, 2) strengthening of anticorruption awareness and  further enhancing self-consciousness of the anticorruption  struggle, and 3) some opinions on furthering the anticorruption  drive this year.    Touching on conditions of the anticorruption drive carried  out at an earlier stage, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: Since the  autonomous regional party committee and government launched the  anticorruption drive, overall, the attitude of party committees  and governments at various levels has been resolute, and their  actions have been positive with certain results being achieved.  The trend of the anticorruption struggle has been favorable and  its development has been healthy. Judging from the present  conditions, corrupt phenomena remain very serious. The  anticorruption mission has been formidable and should never be  allowed to slacken. We should continue to soberly keep track of  the situation and unswervingly deepen the fight against  corruption so that the party's basic line can be thoroughly  carried out in Tibet.    Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: Anticorruption is the  fundamental requirement for upholding socialism, the objective  demand for developing a socialist market economy, the basic  guarantee for making the party the firm leading core in  socialist undertakings, and an important aspect in stabilizing  the situation. All our work should proceed from reality. When  we talk about anticorruption, we should direct ourselves to  problems actually existing within the party and among cadres in  the region, and firmly oppose them. Corrupt elements, no matter  where they are, must be investigated and handled according to  law and discipline.    On ways to deepen the anticorruption drive this year,  Comrade  Chen Kuiyuan emphatically pointed out: First, we should uphold  the principle of firmness, solidity, and sustainability. In  carrying out the anticorruption struggle, party committees, and  governments at various levels should be firm in enforcing law  and discipline in their investigations and handling of party  members and cadres found to be violating law and discipline.  Corrupt elements should be penalized seriously. The  anticorruption drive should not remain as empty talk and  arrangements that have been decided in meetings and entered into  documents must all be solidly translated into concrete action.  Second, in unfolding anticorruption drive, we should start with  the investigations and handling of law and discipline  violations. Law and discipline violations committed by leading  organs and cadres--which tend to cause more harm, carry  far-reaching effects, and are difficult to investigate and  handle--have seriously discredited the party and damaged  party-masses relations. We should continue to focus the  anticorruption drive on investigating and handling law and  discipline violations committed by leading organs, cadres, and  law enforcement, supervisory, and economic management  departments, and their work personnel. Third, we should tighten  political discipline and consolidate stability and unity. All  members and cadres, particularly leading cadres, must thoroughly  implement the party's basic line of "one center and two basic  points" and resolutely safeguard the motherland's unification  and nationality solidarity. Cadres who oppose the four cardinal  principles, promote bourgeois liberalization, and collude with  splittist forces in carrying out activities designed to split  the motherland should be resolutely investigated and handled one  after another. Fourth, we must exercise comprehensive control  over the anticorruption drive; constantly educate the broad  members and cadres in the party's guiding principles,  objectives, ideals, disciplines, and fine work style as well as  the correct outlook on life, values, and morality; strengthen  their ability in resisting the trend of decadent ideologies,  including money worship, hedonism, and ultra individualism; sum  up, popularize, and strengthen fine experiences in intensifying  building of party work style and clean government; and  incessantly carry on the party's fine tradition and style.    Fifth, we must effectively strengthen leadership over the  anticorruption struggle, making it an important item on the  agenda. The principal party and government leaders should  personally assume leadership in solving major issues, especially  deep-seated ones. Henceforth, leaders shall be made accountable  for failures to advance economic work. Likewise, they shall be  made responsible for failure to advance anticorruption work, and  to bring corruption and unhealthy tendencies under effective  control. Organizations, discipline inspection and supervisory  organs, and public security, procuratorial, and judicial  departments at all levels should coordinate their work in  addition to assuming their respective responsibilities. Party  committees and governments at all levels must support the work  of discipline inspection and supervisory departments. At the  same time, these departments should constantly strive to improve  themselves, play the key role in the anticorruption drive, and  serve Tibet's reform, development, and stability by doing their  work outstandingly.    At the meeting, Puqung, member of the Standing Committee of  the regional party committee and deputy secretary of the  regional discipline inspection commission, delivered a report  entitled "Unremittingly Combat Corruption, Encourage Honesty,  and Implement the Three Tasks in an All-Round Way in Order To  Serve Reform, Opening to the Outside World, Economic  Development, and Stability."</p>

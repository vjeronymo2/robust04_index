			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE CLEARS WAY FOR FERGUSON TO RUN FOR SENATE  </P> <P> State election officials have cleared the way for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson to  run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special election that was set for Feb.  6.  </P> <P> Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov. George  Deukmejian on Tuesday set the Feb. 6 date for the primary election and April 10  for the general election to replace state Sen. William Campbell, who resigned  Friday.  </P> <P> Ferguson was assured a spot in the Feb. 6 primary on Tuesday when election  officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he  moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run.  </P> <P> The announcement sets the stage for a brief and intense seven-week Republican  primary battle among Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), Assemblyman Frank Hill  (R-Whittier) and Brea Councilman Ron Isles in a sprawling, strongly Republican  district that runs from Laguna Beach north into southern Los Angeles County,  including Whittier, La Mirada and La Habra Heights.  </P> <P> The short period could favor Assembly members Hill and Ferguson because they  are known to the greatest number of voters. But Isles said he is prepared to  spend $500,000 of his own money on the campaign, which could give him a  financial advantage in a short race.  </P> <P> Isles launched his first attack Tuesday, charging that Hill "is moonlighting  for special interests." He issued a statement saying Hill collected $52,412  last year in gifts and honorariums -- more than Hill's $44,000 legislative  salary.  </P> <P> "Where I come from, it looks like Frank Hill has a second job; he is  moonlighting for the special interests," Isles said.  </P> <P> Ferguson said Tuesday that he is happy he will be able to run for the seat, but  he still charged that the quick election put him at a disadvantage and that it  was evidence that Hill's Sacramento colleagues are meddling in the process.  </P> <P> "This means the voters will only have about 30 days to learn about the  candidates," Ferguson said in a statement. "I am the best qualified candidate  and am determined to win this race. No amount of back-room maneuvering or  setting of election dates can stop our huge volunteer army."  </P> <P> Hill did not return repeated telephone calls to his office Monday or Tuesday.  But Sal Russo, campaign manager for Hill, said his candidate's name is the most  prominent in the field and, therefore, he should be helped. "Think of it  practically," he said. "Would Hill have been for an early election if he didn't  think it would help?"  </P> <P> The 31st State Senate District seat officially became vacant Friday when  Campbell, a 20-year legislative veteran, resigned to become president of the  California Manufacturers Assn. In addition to the Republicans, at least one  Democrat, El Toro attorney Thomas M. Whaling, has also announced his candidacy.  </P> <P> Deukmejian announced the election dates Tuesday evening after returning from  the scene of a fatal train crash in Stockton. Tom Beerman, a spokesman for the  governor, said Deukemejian wanted to schedule the general election on April 10  because it coincides with several local elections in the district and would  therefore save money for the county governments.  </P> <P> Deukmejian and state Republican leaders were also concerned about clearing up  the questions surrounding Campbell's seat and the two Assembly seats before the  election in June.  </P> <P> If the special election were held later, it could force Ferguson and Hill to  file for both reelection to the Assembly and election to the Senate seat. If  that happened, Republican leaders feared that a Democrat might be elected in  the confusion.  </P> <P> The residency requirement for Ferguson came into play when he was forced to  move into the 31st State Senate District in order to run.  </P></p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Allied-Lyons aims to lick Russian ice-cream market ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food, and retailing group, has formed a joint venture with the Russian ministry of trade to build a Pounds 30m ice-cream manufacturing plant in the republic. Work began yesterday on the factory which, from early 1994, will produce 8m gallons of ice-cream a year to supply Allied's expanding chain of Baskin-Robbins stores in Russia. Agreements have been signed with 10 dairy farms in the Ruza region to supply the factory with milk and cream. Technical support will be given to the milk producers and equipment for the factory will be supplied by APV, another UK company. Baskin-Robbins opened its first franchised store in Russia four years ago. It now operates five stores in Moscow and four more are opening in St Petersburg, Zelenograd and Novgorod. Ice-cream is shipped to the stores at present from the US. Mr Tony Hales, Allied's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We are conscious of the current economic difficulties the Russians are encountering and hope that this move, which offers both technical and financial assistance, will contribute to the rebuilding process.' Allied was establishing 'a promising position' in eastern Europe, and the group intended to develop further joint ventures, he added.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AVERAGE PRICE OF HOUSE REACHES RECORD $289,700  </P> <P> The local housing market set record prices for single-family houses and  condominiums in April, according to the San Fernando Valley Board of Realtors.  </P> <P> The average price for a single-family house rose to $289,700 in April, up 5%  from the March average of $276,600, and bested the previous high of $280,200  set in December. April's average price marked a 24% jump since April, 1988.  Last month, 1,202 single-family houses were sold, an increase of less than 1%  from March.  </P> <P> Condominiums, which haven't matched the appreciation levels of single-family  houses, set a record average price of $140,500 in April, breaking the record of  $134,900 set in March. Last month's average condominium price marked a 19%  increase from April, 1988. Last month, 402 condominiums were sold, down from  439 units in March.  </P> <P> Although the sales figures continue to be impressive, mortgage rates have  continued to climb in recent months and a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage now  carries an interest rate between 11% and 12%, up from 10% to 11% late last  year.  </P> <P> Buddy Bernard, president of the Valley realty board, said he expects  condominium demand to hold strong for the rest of the year because condominiums  remain relatively affordable for first-time buyers who can't afford a  single-family house.  </P> <P> He also said the market for single-family houses appears to be quieting a bit.  "The days of five, six or seven offers on a single property appear to be  ending," he said.  </P> <P> The Valley realty board, California's largest, reports sales of houses and  condominiums by its members in the area from North Hollywood to Agoura. Its  statistics do not include most new residences, which generally are not sold by  real estate agents, or sales by homeowners who sell their homes without agents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> APRIL VALLEY HOUSE SALES  </P> <P> NORTH WEST  </P> <P> Avg.

What Japan agreed to do in the phone trade talks is not  anything like a "government guarantee," said the official at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry, who declined to be  identified.    The comment came in response to remarks by U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor on Saturday's settlement of a  dispute involving Motorola Inc. and Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp.  (IDO) over the U.S. company's access to the Japanese cellular  phone market.    Referring to part of the accord that says Tokyo will take  "all available measures to ensure compliance with the  commitments" undertaken by IDO, Kantor said the expression  "validates the result-oriented approach" Washington wants in the  future.    The MITI official said Japan cannot accept an interpretation  that would lead to the setting of "numerical targets," an idea  Tokyo has adamantly turned down in its trade talks with the  United States.    MITI fears that the difference of interpretation between the  two countries over the wording in question might develop into  another source of bilateral contention, the official said.    Under the private-level agreement between IDO and Motorola  that was reached before the governmental accord, the Japanese  cellular phone company promised to open 159 new relay stations  for Motorola-format phones.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cavaco Silva is on his way back to Lisbon, having  spent the last few hours of his 11-day Far East tour in Hong  Kong. It was in Hong Kong that the prime minister quantified  the economic results of the contacts established in China and  Macao, specifically business deals worth over 100 million contos  [1 conto equals 1,000 escudos].    [Announcer] Cavaco Silva's meeting with the governor of Hong  Kong was the last official act of the prime minister's 11-day  visit to China. Cavaco is now on his way home, but while still  in Hong Kong he made an appraisal of his trip and declared  himself very pleased. The visit achieved all the objectives we  set ourselves, the prime minister stated, and proceeded to  justify his statement with the economic results: The 60  Portuguese businessmen who travelled with the head of the  government left China with 100 million contos' worth of  contracts either signed or under negotiation, 25 millions  corresponding to deals already guaranteed between Portuguese and  Chinese companies, and the remainder still dependent on further  talks. This represents a degree of Sino-Portuguese economic  cooperation that has surpassed the best expectations of the  Portuguese delegation.</p>

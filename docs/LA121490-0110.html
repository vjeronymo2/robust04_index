			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> PLANNERS OPPOSE REZONING FOR POOR  </P> <P> Plans for up to 32 homes for indigent families received a setback this week  when the city Planning Commission voted against a zoning change.  </P> <P> The site is 1 1/2 acres at the south end of property owned by Our Lady of  Guadalupe Roman Catholic Church on La Habra Boulevard.  </P> <P> The proposal was to rezone it from R1, allowing up to eight units per acre, to  R2, allowing up to 14 units.  </P> <P> About 200 people packed the City Council chambers to hear zoning arguments.  </P> <P> City Planning Director Kathy Kim said 67 postcards had been received favoring  the project. Real estate agent Lynne Rolnik presented a petition that she said  contained 300 signatures opposing the project.  </P> <P> Commission Chairman Paul Thornburg ruled that neither the postcards nor the  petition was appropriate because the commission was considering only zoning  changes and not possible developments.  </P> <P> Lisa Baker, who lives near the site, told the commission that in her work as a  law enforcement officer she has contact with homeless people. "I know what kind  of area this could become," she said. "If you change the zoning, you're going  to have a lot of different kinds of people coming into that neighborhood."  </P> <P> Thornburg responded that the zoning could result in low-income housing or  "high-priced condos."  </P> <P> Rolnik said her major concern is home values. She told the commission that a  sale she had hoped to finalize fell through because of the proposed zoning  change. "Neighbors are concerned about property that they've owned for years,"  she said.  </P> <P> The next step will be a discussion of the proposal by the City Council. DAVID  F. BURKE  </P></p>

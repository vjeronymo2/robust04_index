			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L. RON HUBBARD'S CHURCH OF SCIENTOLOGY  </P> <P> I have just completed reading the last report on Scientology (six-part series,  Part A, June 24-29). I find an applicable equation of thought progression  reflected. Simply stated: An idea never leaves its source. This means that an  idea will be reflected in all the outcomes it generates, whenever it is  applied. The Church of Scientology is a reflection of the man who founded it:  L. Ron Hubbard. His fragile ego and sense of external threat is mirrored in the  elaborate defenses he seemed to think were necessary to protect himself.  Hubbard built himself and his church on the thought forms of fear and  defensiveness.  </P> <P> Fear and threat pervade the very fabric of the scriptural structure of the  church. The supreme irony of fear-motivated behavior is that it creates the  very fears which seem to motivate it. Hubbard, fearing that he was being spied  upon and criminally invaded, used burglary and bugging as a defensive tool in  response. Out of a sense of persecution, Hubbard, and his church, sought to  persecute; out of a sense of threat, they became threatening, and no lie or  deceit was too outrageous a vehicle to protect and perpetuate Hubbard's  "Truth."  </P> <P> The method of dealing with the Church of Scientology, however, is not to  condemn, but instead, to understand, and ultimately, forgive. Those who wish to  give pain only do so because they are in pain; my responsibility to someone in  pain is to give succor and release through forgiveness. It is only in this way  that the church and its basic "fear-motivated" scriptures can begin to reflect  the idea that there is nothing to fear, and nothing to defend against, and,  therefore, no reason to attack and threaten. Perhaps if the climate of  suspicion and anger could be extricated from the church doctrines and  supplanted with the idea of forgiveness and mercy, all the good ideas Hubbard  ever had may have a chance to do what, but for his fears and self-doubts, he  might have accomplished: to, at last, really help someone.  </P> <P> DENNIS L.

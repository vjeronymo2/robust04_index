			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Option to reserve greater number of units for non-elderly disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The owner, at the owner's option, and at any time, may reserve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater number of units for non-elderly disabled families than that provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The option to provide a greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of units to non-elderly disabled families will not obligate the owner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to always provide that greater number to non-elderly disabled families. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of units required to be provided to non-elderly disabled families at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any time in an elderly project is that number determined under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secondary preferences <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An owner of an elderly project also may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elect to establish secondary preferences in accordance with the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this paragraph (d) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the owner of an elderly project determines, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an insufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of elderly families who have applied for occupancy to fill all the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vacant units in the elderly project reserved for elderly families (that is,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all units except those reserved for the non-elderly disabled families as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in paragraph (c) of this section), the owner may give preference for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy of such units to disabled families who are near-elderly families. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preference for near-elderly disabled families in units reserved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-elderly disabled families <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If the owner of an elderly project determines,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section, that there are an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient number of non-elderly disabled families to fill all the vacant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units in the elderly project reserved for non-elderly disabled families as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in paragraph (c) of this section, the owner may give preference for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupancy of these units to disabled families who are near-elderly families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Availability of units to families without regard to preference <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An owner shall make vacant units in an elderly project generally available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> otherwise eligible families who apply for housing, without regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences and reservation of units provided in this section if either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The owner has adopted the secondary preferences and there are an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference, and secondary preference has been given, to fill all the vacant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> units; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The owner has  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> adopted the secondary preferences and there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an insufficient number of families for whom elderly preference, and reserve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference has been given to fill all the vacant units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Determination of insufficient number of applicants qualifying for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . To make a determination that there are an insufficient number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants who qualify for the preferences, including secondary preferences,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided by this section, the owner must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Conduct marketing in accordance with &sect;881.601(a) to attract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants qualifying for the preferences and reservation of units set forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this section; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Make a good faith effort to lease to applicants who qualify for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferences provided in this section, including taking all feasible actions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fill vacancies by renting to such families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal preferences <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An owner that gives preferences to elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families and reserves units for non-elderly disabled families in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with this section also shall select applicants among each respective group in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with the Federal preferences contained in &sect;881.613. Projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under National Housing Act programs and receiving section 8 assistance may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to preferences in addition to those contained in &sect;881.613 which also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be applied in selecting applicants among each respective group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Prohibition of evictions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . An owner may not evict a tenant without  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> good cause, or require that a tenant vacate a unit, in whole or in part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because of any reservation or preference provided in this section, or because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any action taken by the Secretary pursuant to subtitle D (sections 651  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 661) of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (42 U.S.C. 13611 through 13620).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 883_SECTION 8 HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS PROGRAM_STATE HOUSING AGENCIES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 5. The authority citation for 24 CFR part 883 continues to read as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> : 42 U.S.C. 1437a, 1437c, 1437f, 3535(d), and 13611&hyph;13619.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6.

(i) An owner of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project assisted under this part (including a partially assisted project) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families (an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``eligible project'') may, at any time, elect to give preference to elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families in selecting tenants for assisted, vacant units in the project,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the requirements of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) For purposes of this section, a project eligible for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preference provided by this section, and for which the owner makes an election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to give preference in occupancy to elderly families is referred to as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``elderly project.'' ``Elderly families'' refers to families whose heads of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> household, their spouses or sole members are 62 years or older.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) An owner who elects to provide a preference to elderly families  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with this section is required to notify families on the waiting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list who are not elderly that the election has been made and how the election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may affect them if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The percentage of disabled families currently residing in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project who are neither elderly nor near-elderly (hereafter, collectively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to as ``non-elderly disabled families'') is equal to or exceeds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum required percentage of units established for the elderly project in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and therefore non-elderly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families on the waiting list (including non-elderly disabled families) may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> passed over for covered section 8 units; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) The project, after making the calculation set forth in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)(1) of this section, will have no units set aside for non-elderly disabled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) An owner who elects to give a preference for elderly families in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with this section shall not remove an applicant from the project's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiting list solely on the basis of having made the election.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD approval of election not required.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) An owner is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to solicit or obtain the approval of HUD before exercising the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election of preference for occupancy provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section. The owner, however, if challenged on the issue of eligibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> project for the election provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to support the project's eligibility through the production of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relevant documentation in the possession of the owner that pertains to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original design of the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Department reserves the right at any time to review and make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations regarding the accuracy of the identification of the project as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an elderly project. The Department can make such determinations as a result  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of ongoing monitoring activities, or the conduct of complaint investigations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601 through 3619), or compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviews and complaint investigations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794) and other applicable statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (b) Determining projects eligible for preference for occupancy by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elderly families <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

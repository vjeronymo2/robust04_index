			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Players falling foul of Fifa's forcefulness - The implications for the tournament of the increased numbers of yellow cards This is not a trivial question. Apart from the fact that they sound as if they were separated at birth, what do John Harkes and John Starks have in common? Answer: they are both ignorant of the basic laws of the games which they play. Harkes is the gifted US mid-fielder who, in an act of supreme idiocy, allowed himself to get a yellow card in the US match against Romania, not for hacking someone down to prevent a goal but for refusing to retreat the required 10 yards from a free kick. It was his second yellow of the first round, meaning that he must miss the next US match. The fact that he plays in the English premier league is no excuse. Any red-blooded American, playing on the most successful soccer team this country has yet produced, should give his eye-teeth to play in his national colours - probably against Brazil - on July 4, of all weekends. Harkes, unrepentant and savagely critical of a pair of team-mates who, on and off the field, dared to criticise his foolishness, claimed ignorance of the yellow card law. The fault, in his view, naturally lay with the evil Carpathian, Gheorghe Hagi, whom, he charged, was 'a cheat,' and with Fifa, for not disseminating the rules more widely. If he had watched television or read a newspaper with his ears and eyes even half open, which he could hardly not do over the last two weeks, because the US team and the World Cup have been getting good play, he would have to concede that his defence was ludicrous. Yellow cards, now averaging over four a game, have been one of the stories of the tournament. In any case, Fifa advised all teams of the rules as long ago as last December. John Starks plays for the New York Knicks who play basketball, a sport one of whose basic laws is that it is invariably a good idea to pass the ball to the team-mate in the best position to put the ball into the basket. The great Knicks team of a generation ago - some of whose members have gone on to other fame and fortune, even, dubiously, the US senate - was predicated on the principle of finding the 'open man.' In last week's championship finale, Starks forgot the basic law. Assuming that the game against the Houston Rockets was winnable only by his own efforts - and it takes some nerve to believe that one man can beat five - he neglected his fellow Knicks and hoisted hapless shot after hapless shot. Houston won by seven points and, to give him the credit that Harkes does not yet deserve, Starks was more or less contrite. But he was also dumb. From a managerial or coaching point of view, team psychology, as Jeeves might have put it, can be a factor. Jack Charlton, Ireland's manager, was never about to back down in the face of obscure Fifa officials complaining about his wandering of the touchline in the Ireland-Mexico match, even though it cost him his perch in the Norway game. Likewise, Earl Weaver, a great baseball manager, would berate umpires and kick dirt all over their painted black shoes so as to inspire his Baltimore Orioles to fly again. Soccer has more than its share of sharp practice, which has not been eliminated even by this most tightly policed of tournaments. Most tackles get the dying swan treatment from the tackled; most goalkeepers fall down at the slightest suggestion of halitosis from an attacker; and many goals are appealed for offside even though half the defending team is camped on the goal-line. But the interesting thing is that sporting authorities, which make the law, are starting to get tougher. Take ice hockey. Here is a sport, beloved by Canadians with no teeth and by lots of eastern Europeans, which was falling into serious disrepute because of its lack of observance of nominal law. A shocking thing happened last year when the game came under a new commissioner. In the play-offs, a Washington player reacted typically to a Pittsburgh goal by sharply bringing down his stick on the scorer's wrist, breaking it (the wrist, not the stick). Old hockey would have puffed itself up and given the offender 10 minutes in the penalty box. New hockey suspended him for the best part of half a season, without pay. This year, the renaissance of the sport has been astounding. There is no way of knowing what thought processes and precedents passed through Fifa's collective mind in laying down the law for this World Cup, beyond the obvious: that it had half an eye on making the game attractive to America. But, having done what it has done and having seen its referees carry out their mandates with some precision, no player can conceivably claim ignorance of the new rules of the game. Not all are new - no-one has been sent off yet for over-acting - and some, like the limits on passing back to a goalkeeper, have been in use for some time. The yellow card rules, likewise, were not clothed in legalese or deliberately hidden from the players. The simple lesson is this: those who know the law can bend it most effectively; those in ignorance can only be caught by it, with heat of the moment no mitigating excuse. Harkes and Starks, in their different ways, need to go to law school. Come to think of it, Harkes and Starks has a nice ring as a law firm.</p>

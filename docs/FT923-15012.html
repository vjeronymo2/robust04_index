			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Fuller Smith dips 13% in year of mixed blessings FULLER SMITH &amp; Turner, the west London-based brewer, yesterday reported a 13 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 9.01m to Pounds 7.8m. A 'year of mixed blessings' saw a substantial increase in its beer sales to the free trade while its own pubs, hotels, and wine shops were hit by recession. Turnover for the year ended March 28 rose 9 per cent to Pounds 76.23m, but higher costs reduced operating profits from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 8.52m, and interest charges of Pounds 722,000 were nearly seven times higher after the purchase of pubs from Allied-Lyons. Earnings per share, helped by a one-off tax credit of Pounds 1m, rose 3 per cent from 24.38p to 25.18p but would otherwise have declined to 21.15p. However, a final dividend of 4.46p - reflecting 'optimism for the future' - makes a payment 10 per cent higher at 6.71p. Mr Anthony Fuller, chairman, said the current year had started well with beer production up, but hotels still affected by recession. 'It is extremely difficult for me to indicate when there will be a full recovery.' Fuller's brewed a record 113,000 barrels of beer last year as sales of cask-conditioned ales to the free trade increased 52 per cent. Volumes of its London Pride brand rose 23 per cent. Free trade gains were made without giving excessive discounts, Mr Fuller said. Further benefits were expected from a trading agreement with Bass in southern England, and the company was spending Pounds 1.76m on expanding the Chiswick brewery. Exports - to North America, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and France  -increased 20 per cent and now accounted for 4 per cent of production. Beer volumes sold in Fuller's own estate fell 5 per cent, in spite of the acquisition of 44 more pubs. 'The severity of the recession affecting the average pub customer was certainly greater than we had expected,' Mr Fuller said. Profits from the company's 77 managed pubs and three hotels were Pounds 1m lower and sales through its wine shops fell by Pounds 335,000.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Appliance Energy Conservation Act separates water heaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into three product classes by fuel type: Gas, electric and oil. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  Also, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act directs the Secretary to develop different standards for product classes within an appliance type if they ``consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products within such type.'' <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the Department did not compare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters of different fuel types. However, the Department considered the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of fuel-switching caused by the standards, as forecasted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory Residential Energy Model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Standards for Water Heaters; Pool Heaters; Direct Heating Equipment.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 42 U.S.C. 6295(e). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Special Rule for Certain Types or Classes of Products'',  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> 42 U.S.C. 6295 (n)(1)(A). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The American Gas Association and many of the gas utilities proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional classes for gas water heaters based on several factors. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included the utility of having hot water if the power fails and the high cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of bringing electricity to locations without electric outlets near the water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heater. The American Gas Association argued that a precedent already exists  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with ranges/ovens for separate product classes with or without an electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cord. (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 4&hyph;6.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several comments proposed that DOE establish four classes for gas water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heaters: With and without draft hood, and with and without electric cord.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (American Gas Association, No. 23 at 2; Southern Gas Association, No. 4 at 3;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lone Star Gas Company, No. 39 at 3; Southern Natural Gas Company, No. 46 at 2;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LaClede Gas, No. 55 at 3; Equitable Resources, No. 72 at 1; Madison Gas &amp;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Electric, No. 77 at 1; Louisiana Gas, No. 81 at 1; United Texas Transmission,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 26 at 2; Southern Union Gas Company, No. 22 at 1; Colorado Interstate Gas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 14 at 2; Wisconsin Gas Company, No. 33 at 1; South Carolina Electric and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Gas Company, No. 34 at 2; Bay State Gas, No. 52 at 1; Arkansas Oklahoma Gas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 56 at 1; Providence Gas, No. 62 at 1; Southern Connecticut Gas, No. 63 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1; Arkansas Western Gas, No. 64 at 4; ENTEX, No. 58 at 5; Essex County Gas,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 69 at 1; K N Energy, No. 70 at 3; and Delta Natural Gas, No. 73 at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association stated that DOE should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognize the particular utility and performance characteristics of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conventional gas water heaters and preserve the availability of this product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the American consumer. (Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association, No. 40 at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two gas utility companies proposed three product classes for gas-fired  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters: with a draft hood with and without electric cord, and with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electric cord (no designation on presence of draft hood). (Atlantic Gas Light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company, No. 29 at 2; and Energen, No. 12 at 4.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some gas utilities proposed two product classes for gas water heaters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> namely, with and without electric cord. (Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 1; and Northern Indiana Public Service, No. 48 at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arkansas Western Gas Company listed several benefits provided by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standing pilot in water heaters. These benefits include keeping the flue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> warm, helping maintain water temperature in the tank, providing a low-cost,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail-proof ignition system, allowing operation during power outages, and low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cost. (Arkansas Western Gas Company, No. 64 at 5.) Piedmont  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Natural Gas Company, Inc. urged the Department to evaluate fully the benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of standing pilot ignition systems. Many citizens in North and South  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Carolina continued to have hot water and were able to cook after hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hugo caused extensive power outages which lasted up to several weeks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Piedmont Natural Gas Company, No. 71C at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department considered only one product class for gas-fired storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters. The Department believes that designs that eliminate draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hoods or add electric cords do not change the utility of water heaters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, these designs do not warrant inclusion in a separate class. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design options were evaluated solely on economic considerations. Additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation cost to bring electricity to water heaters not close to outlets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was included in the analysis of those design options. When condensation from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mid-efficiency water heaters would damage masonry chimneys, the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relining or power venting was added to the installation costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): No time to taste the main dish - The UK is promoting niche food but ignoring the volume market The ballroom of the Copdock Hotel, Ipswich, had never smelled as good. Even out in the car park wafts of the delicious aroma were inviting. Once inside the sight of beautifully presented fare together with offers to taste completed an enjoyable gastronomic experience. Before I become a candidate for pseuds corner in a perhaps less auspicious organ I should explain that I was attending the inaugural exhibition of Tastes of Anglia - launched last year to encourage small, speciality food companies in Cambridgeshire, Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk. Membership of the initiative is about 100, and more than 30 of those were showing their wares on trade stands at the hotel with a view to attracting more buyers for their products. The range of food and drink varied from a number of different types of apple juice to Essex-reared venison and from quails eggs to chutney. In between were such delicacies as home-baked meat pies for the pub trade, cooked hams, smoked salmon and ice cream made from real cream. It all looked - and I can vouch that most of it tasted - excellent, and a fair number of East Anglian caterers turned up to search for new suppliers. The promotional organisation, Food From Britain, was there supporting the only sector of the UK's domestic food production now within its remit. A few weeks ago, the minister of agriculture, Mrs Gillian Shephard, ruled that FFB should concentrate on exports. But she included speciality foods in the UK within its responsibilities and they are eligible for a small part of FFB's Pounds 7m budget. The minister of food, Mr Nicholas Soames, also attended the exhibition to cheer the initiative along and to put his ministry's seal of approval on a very jolly occasion. FFB hopes to have another half-dozen such regional groups running soon and some are well advanced. They have developed from county associations, which failed to gather momentum, mainly, according to FFB, because they 'lacked critical mass'. In other words they could not attract sufficient members to stage a show like that at Ipswich. Moreover, only one-third of the members of Tastes of Anglia exhibited at the event. The rest, presumably, were too small to fill and staff a small booth. Now I am in danger of damning the enterprise of those who organise and show at such events with faint praise. I do not want to do that for I wish them well and applaud their energy and their products. I also believe it is entirely appropriate that government money should continue to be spent on aiding individual small producers to improve their marketing. But the fact is that in national terms the producers at the Ipswich show represented a tiny niche in the food market. And if all the production of similar regional groups were added together the volume of food would still be insignificant when compared with national consumption. Niches can, of course, grow as Michael Marks' penny store in Leeds and the small butcher's shop of the original Mr Sainsbury prove. But in the meantime, most of the attention of the media and more seriously the government seems to be dominated by niches, and volume sales seem to be neglected. Giant retailers, of course, promote their own brands very efficiently. But as competition for customers intensifies, with the launch in the UK of discount and warehouse clubs, it is inevitable that all such companies will seek to squeeze the prices they pay their suppliers in order to preserve profits. Once that possibility is exhausted they may well seek further advantage by buying more from marketing organisations abroad. Surplus producers in Europe would grab the opportunity for a bigger slice of the lucrative UK food market with both hands. In the meanwhile, however, the UK's food trade gap - the gap in value between the food we import and the food we export - has risen to Pounds 6bn a year, and food is now the trade sector with the biggest deficit. By far the majority of these imports, the volume of which is still rising, come from other northern European countries. In other words, the goods could easily be produced at home. If the government is serious about containing and then reversing this trend and improving the balance of payments at the same time (as the prime minister and agriculture ministers have been claiming for at least two years) it is vital that it acts urgently. The recently announced Pounds 6.4m of group marketing aid over three years to help more small businesses like those at Ipswich is welcome, of course, but inadequate to the scale of the task. The food industries of France and Germany have Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m a year each to promote their produce. No wonder the UK is being left behind. What is needed is a new co-ordinating body to replace and develop the curtailed activities of Food From Britain on the domestic front and to address volume markets. Its remit should include initiating national food quality assurance schemes, promoting the superiority and safety of home-based production, and persuading retailers and consumers that British food is best value. It would be unrealistic to expect the government to pay for all that, but most of the cost could be funded by statutory levies from the farming and food industries. As Mr Nicholas Soames said at Ipswich the other day, food and farming together employ some 14 per cent of the British population and between them produce 10 per cent of the gross domestic product. The UK cannot afford risk the security of such a large and important sector of the economy. Nor can it afford a food trade gap that could rise to Pounds 10bn by the end of the decade if nothing is done to stop it.</p>

He added that "the purpose of the current meetings is to  work  for the implementation of what the signatories spelled out in  their memorandum, particularly exercise of democracy in the  management of PLO affairs and the employment of qualified  Palestinians, irrespective of political and personal factors."  Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi, who was speaking to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT by  telephone from Tunis, described the meetings already held as  good, with no fundamental differences and no emotionalism. The  purpose of these meetings, he said, was to exchange views.    He said that last night's session was devoted to a  discussion  of the brief memorandum submitted to the Executive Committee  during the meeting.    It should be noted that, in addition to Dr. Haydar  'Abd-al-Shafi, the reform delegation includes 'Abd-al-Hafiz  al-Ashhab (independent), Taysir 'Aruri (People's Party), Nabil  'Amr (member of Fatah's Revolutionary Council), Ibrahim  Abu-'Abbas (former engineers' doyen in Jordan), Tawfiq Abu-Bakr  (independent journalist), and Ghazi al-Khalili (Fida Party).    Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi refused to say what the memorandum was  about but said that it was derived from "the main document."  Asked if the brief memorandum included practical steps for the  implementation of their demands, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "Let  us not anticipate events."    Commenting on the statement attributed to him that he would  not leave Tunis "empty-handed," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said: "We did  not come to Tunis just to look at one another. Our people are  facing major challenges and the necessary measures must be taken  to meet these challenges."    In reply to the question what do you hope to achieve, he  said: "That our viewpoint should be upheld in principle. Before  leaving Tunis we would like to feel somewhat reassured that our  demands will be met or that they are on the way to being met."</p>

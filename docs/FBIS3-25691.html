The meeting took place at State House  in Kampala. During the meeting, Mr. Claes briefed the president  about the steps being taken by the EC to strengthen and enhance  cooperation. He said that Belgium is ready to enhance  cooperation with Uganda, as well as encourage regional  cooperation and integration on the continent. He said that  Africa now needs to strengthen regional cooperation because the  regional alternative ensures peace and stability, which are  essential for development.    President Museveni told the Belgian foreign minister that  Uganda emphasizes neutrality (?when) dealing with developed  nations. He said developed countries could work beneficially  with Uganda by concentrating on investment and trade, as well as  giving soft loans that would help the government in capacity  building.

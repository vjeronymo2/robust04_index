			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karam Sinnarah: `Asyut's Terrorism: A Very </F> Special Case']    [Text] You ask about Asyut? It is an Upper Egyptian society  that has alternated much between the oppression of historical  changes and the harshness of geographical realities.    There are three sensitive points that must be carefully  noted  when you visit Asyut:     -  An investigation into the nature of terrorist action there  confirms that Asyut's terrorism is a very special case.    -  A change in the old development program is responsible for  the  issuance of harsh laws against the dead--who died years ago!    -  A close reading of the results of the parties' role shows  that  they define the type of land on which the rising generations  stand, and the future of the promising generations, and exposes  the gap between the separate generations.        These three points meet in vicious circles, and come close  enough to meet in a place that was already prepared for high  temperatures, and tribal conflicts and struggles passed from  grandfather to father to son. The voice of vengeance still  prevails as the way to solve most issues. An environment that  seeks deliberately to hurt itself by spending most of its money  on purchasing and stockpiling arms. There is pride--great  pride--taken in owning the greatest number of weapons, and the  most modern varieties. Extremism paid a visit, and found the  climate suitable; the worry is that this will be not only a  visit but a permanent stay!    How can the heat been turned down under this smoldering  society? What levels of development can turn its tendency toward  hostility into the direction of constructive aspirations? And  what are the sure ways of delivering it from the evil of  extremism? Come, let us move in closer to the details of this  picture, and look for the answers in this report.    Asyut is now experiencing the calm after the storm, the  storm  of events it experienced before the month of Ramadan, and the  period following the 'Id al-Fitr [post-Ramadan holiday]. But the  overworked security forces are trying to consolidate this calm  with sufficient guarantees so that it will not be affected by  winds blowing from any direction.    Despite the extremist groups' claim that the security forces  persist in pursuing them and ridding the governorate of them,  they have adopted a new tactic in carrying out their criminal  operations: trying to take advantage of the nature of the  geography in the extremists' areas, far from the commercial  center of the governorate.  <H5>  Coca-Cola Vendor </H5>   The situation did, in fact, turn into something like a  cat-and-mouse game. The groups contrived new methods of  disguise. The members carrying out the operations were dressed  like a variety of persons: a Coca-Cola vendor; a fruit seller; a  salesman of ready-to-wear apparel who visited houses to sell his  goods. Sometimes they used the role of a distributor of butane  gas pipes, and still other methods to find out the addresses of  the people they were targeting, as well as to complete the  process of misrepresentation. They also depended on people of  specific ages, between 14 and 18 years, most of them students,  to carry out [their operations]. And so young people of this age  are monitored by the security forces, and arouse the suspicions  of the citizens of Asyut now, whenever they walk by. On another  front, the groups carry out their strikes at any hour of the day  or night, while in past months they were confined to night time.  They have tried to make their wicked missions successful by  relying on two factors: the first is belief that they can act  freely now that a number of senior officers have been  transferred out of Asyut in the last round of transfers, in the  belief that the new officers would need time to find out where  they were active; and the second is their attempt to flee and  hide within seconds, when they needed, in the topographical  slopes in the curving range of hills and cane fields surrounded  by the hills on at least three sides. They also have hide-outs  in the mountain hollows created by natural formations in  long-past geological eras.  <H5>  All These Arms? </H5>   All these arms and ammunition...where did Asyut get them?    Most of the people we asked were as surprised as we were,  and  were not generous with straight answers. They did just allow us  to put our ears to some of the locked doors so that we could  hear from one of the "chat" sessions that:     -  Most of the arms and ammunitions of all types do not come  from outside the governorate.    -  Security forces are sparing no effort to control unlicensed  arms and infringements of the licensing and confiscation law.  But within just a day or two after the date of withdrawing arms,  the violators were obtaining alternative arms by all  methods.        Because of the revengeful atmosphere, some prominent  citizens  keep, in their own way, a balance in the quantity and type of  arms in their families, to keep up with what neighboring  families have.    As to those in the middle, who feel secure that they are not  condemned by the vengeance of other families, or vice versa,  they are not averse to selling some of them at high prices,  regardless of who is doing the buying!    We cannot ignore another important point, which is that some  citizens are hell-bent on revenge; if there happens to be a  terrorist incident and the relative of one of these is wounded  by a bullet along with the intended target, and if he knows who  the terrorist perpetrator was, he only very rarely tells the  police. Why? Because he believes that if he passes it on, the  legal measures will take a long time reaching trial and  punishment. This, he thinks, belittles his honor; it is  preferable to to keep the identity secret until such time as he  can take his own revenge in Upper Egyptian style.  <H5>  Suspicion </H5>   Security forces have recently expanded their field of  investigation and suspicion, with the aim of establishing  control over the movements of terrorist elements and containing  them no matter where they are. This is now being implemented by  way of vehicle patrols and permanent and mobile ambushes,  although the officers involved say their mission is difficult  and very tough and the stuff of rumors, for many reasons.  Chiefly, the residents of the historically poorest rural areas  have never taken much care to register their births, or get  identification cards. It has reached the point where marriages  are held publicly and licitly but without official documents for  a long period. In addition, some fathers hope that by not  registering the births of their sons they can save them from  having to perform military service. On top of all this, Upper  Egyptians by nature have habits and customs grounded on their  knowledge of others through the family tree, and are always  angered by anyone whose asks them to produce identification  cards.  <H5>  The Gap </H5>   Are the channels of communication and contact open between  the university and various other segments of society? Dr.  Muhammad al-Subayti, vice rector of Asyut University, was the  first to offer an answer: "We have limited responsibility in  lecture rooms in all actuality. This has deprived us of  political representation, even though most of us are natives of  Asyut, and some are afraid to deal with us, to confirm that we  will face the bitter truth of the scale of the terrorist tragedy  and those behind the escalation of extremism. We will announce  publicly: security requires the cooperation of other parties in  order for the current wave of terrorism to be overcome. Yet  these other parties prefer not to appear."    The expression "political opportunism" was used early by Dr.  Muhammad Kamil, Dean of the Faculty of Commerce, indicating that  the distribution of political roles is not commensurate with the  level of the governorate have been overwhelmed by influential  families, including prominent citizens, in view of the fact that  the majority, which includes numerous intellectuals, found  itself prevented from playing any role. The majority thus grew  frustrated. Dr. Kamil believes that this frustration could add a  new negative dimension to a society in which development has, in  recent years, strayed from acknowledged standards--thus leading  to the development of extremism.    Professor of Chemistry at Asyut University's Faculty of  Sciences, Dr. Mahmud Zarif Badr, says, however, that the  parties' failure to serve the masses, and to take serious action  to find solutions to problems, led to a serious political  vaccuum. Had these parties been built on sound foundations,  bringing together in their ranks models of awareness, and been  keen on the public interest, they would have succeeded in  carrying out their mission, and thus helped rid Asyut of the  evil of extremism.    Assistant Professor of Agriculture at Asyut University Dr.  Ibrahim Faraj points to the fact that the door of political  participation is closed to professors and intellectuals, helped  to attract the circle of terrorism to extremist elements among  the young generation. Especially as interest and follow-up on  the part of the mosques were late in coming.    We asked him: But can't they in turn play a role out of a  feeling of responsibility?    "It is hard to hold awareness, counsel, and guidance  meetings  as long as that is not asked of them to avoid misunderstanding!"    What of the role of responsibility toward development?    "Many commissions visit their committees in the governorate,  but their course is being limited and their members are asked  not to have friction with the university."    Do you have studies and research in this regard?    "Many, and linked to the governorate's situation, but  unfortunately we send them to specialized authorities, where  they remain in desk drawers and we get no reply."    So, what, in your view, is the reason?    "Ask them!"    And so...    These are the details of the picture in Asyut; more light  needs to be shed upon it. We need to examine and isolate its  mingled colors, over and over again, so that we may know which  one is blurring the picture of stability in the whole  governorate.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- Vice Foreign Minister  Hong Sun-yong suggested Tuesday the imposition of phased  sanctions on North Korea to solve the nuclear problem, starting  with a cutoff of all aid and even exchanges on peaceful use of  atomic power.    "We have to press North Korea by stages in order to solve  the  nuclear problem," Hong told a conference of the ruling camp's  chapter leaders.    "We will continue to show our efforts for a peaceful  resolution in order to secure Chinese participation, but phased  sanctions are inevitable after a statement by the UN Security  Council president," he said.    The council initially planned on adopting a resolution  demanding that Pyongyang allow inspection of its suspected  facilities, but has backed away to a presidential statement in  the face of Chinese opposition.    The statement is likely to be issued this week or next week.    Possible sanctions could start with a halt to technical  assistance and exchanges on peaceful use of atomic energy, then  move to a ban on all exchanges of strategic materials, a ban on  money transfers or trade in raw materials, and finally to a full  embargo, Hong said.    "The North Korean economy would be fatally wounded even if  just 5 to 10 percent of its crude oil supply or money from  Chochongnyon in Japan was embargoed," the vice foreign minister  said.    Chochongnyon is an association of pro-North Korea residents  operating in Japan.    North Korean-U.S. diplomatic normalization would take  considerable time because it requires not only an international  consensus but an understanding of bilateral issues including  American POWs, missile export controls and human rights, said  Hong.    On the results of President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China,  Hong said he was under the impression that Beijing had  emphasized its commitment to a peaceful solution rather than  sanctions.    "It seems to indicate China is unwilling to provoke North  Korea," he said.</p>

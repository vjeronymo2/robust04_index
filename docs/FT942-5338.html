			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Arts: A northern family makes its mark - Theatre I have an affinity with Rutherford &amp; Son apart from the title. The author, Githa Sowerby, grew up within a stone's throw of where I, too, spent formative years. This was Low Fell, Gateshead, which a note in the National Theatre programme quaintly locates in Northumberland. It is, in fact, in Durham. There were - and still are - Rutherfords all over the place, though probably diminishing south of Darlington and north of Berwick. K. Rutherford Davis, who wrote the definitive book on the subject The Rutherfords in Britain: a History and Guide says that we were all descended from a Scottish laird in the late 12th century. Githa Sowerby plainly knew her background. Just after the successful opening of Rutherford &amp; Son at the Royal Court in 1912, she told The Queen (the magazine) that her original title, The Master, was blocked by copyright, so she switched to Rutherford as one of the oldest and best known names in the north. She never had such a theatrical triumph again. The reference books, if they mention her at all, list her under her married name of Mrs John Kendall. She died in 1970, having long since left the north-east for Chelsea, then Kensington. Ms Sowerby, as she would now be called, thoroughly deserves this revival. Rutherford &amp; Son is an excellent play, somewhat in the manner of Harley Granville Barker, who had his successes at the Court a few years earlier, and of a kind much admired by Richard Eyre, the NT's director. In other words, it is a grown-up piece for grown-up people. A temptation nowadays may be to see it as early feminism, and certainly it is a powerful plea against male domination. Historically, however, that is not entirely surprising. The play coincided with the suffragette movement, a body that might have achieved its aims much earlier had it not been for the outbreak of the first world war. The most fascinating aspect of Rutherford &amp; Son is the insight into family business, the industrial revolution and the implicit realisation that, even in 1912, Britain was in relative economic decline. The business is glass making. Sowerby had some knowledge of it because her father had inherited the family company in Gateshead. But glass needs new processes in order to remain competitive. There is an uncanny resemblance in Rutherford &amp; Son to some of the problems faced by another glass-making company, Pilkington, in the 1950s. Without the new processes, the firm would be dead. Still, it is as drama, not history, that the play succeeds. Katie Mitchell, who directs, has not pushed the feminist line too far. True, the old Mr Rutherford who owns the glass works is a tyrant. He has little time for anything but work and practically none at all for women, except as servants. He regards his own sons - one of them a curate - as useless. But it would be a one-dimensional interpretation of the piece to suggest that this was all. Old Mr Rutherford, magisterially played by Bob Peck, has both thoughts and feelings. He knows that the business is running down: when women, and perhaps even male subordinates, stand up to him, he responds. He does not like it, but he accepts reality. The two women who matter most are his daughter-in-law, Mary, and his daughter, Janet, played at the Cottesloe by Phoebe Nicholls and Brid Brennan respectively. The daughter is prepared to walk out; the daughter-in-law is prepared to stay, but only after dictating her own terms. This is emancipation, and it is magnificently done. Whether you will take to the accents depends on how well you know the north-east. Some of them sounded awry. Vicki Mortimer's set catches superbly the frugality of the well-off northern businessman. In repertory, Cottesloe, (071) 928 2252.</p>

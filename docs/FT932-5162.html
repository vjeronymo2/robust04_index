			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / EC go-ahead for Klockner relief THE European Commission yesterday formally agreed to write off 40 per cent of its DM175m (Pounds 71m) loan to Klockner-Werke, the troubled German steelmaker, clearing the way for a far-reaching debt relief scheme at the group. The Commission claimed it had managed to improve Klockner's original offer of capacity cuts so that the debt relief scheme would not upset wider EC plans to support the Community steel industry. However, Klockner said yesterday that it had not changed its plans during the month-long negotiations, and that the Commission had simply accepted the original conditions for the debt rescheduling. In Duisburg, Klockner said the EC had accepted the planned capacity cuts in its original restructuring plan. 'We convinced the EC that our plans were viable,' Mr Bernd Kruger, a director in the company, said. Klockner said, however, it had agreed to cut 400 more jobs than planned. The company will bring its current workforce of 6,200 down to 4,100 by the end of 1994. The company said the way was now cleared for its debt rescheduling scheme to go through. Klockner, which filed for protection from its creditors earlier this year, will have DM1.7bn of its DM2.4bn net debt written off. In return, the Commission said yesterday it had won binding commitments from the German group to close down one blast furnace in its Bremen steel plant. Under the deal, pig-iron capacity will be cut by 33 per cent, and crude steel capacity by 20 per cent. Capacity at the group's hot strip rolling mill will come down by 500,000 tonnes a year, from 4.2m tonnes to 3.7m tonnes. Klockner has also promised to cut capacity in line with overall EC plans if it enters into partnership with any other steel producers.</p>

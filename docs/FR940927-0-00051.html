			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (15) Navajo EPA stated that it would be in the Navajo Nation's best interests if NAMLRD inventoried and listed their priority 3, 4, 5, and 6 projects, since that would include all public facilities projects. This comment was not made in reference to a specific provision of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 or the Navajo Nation Rules; however, the comment appears to be directed at noncoal reclamation and having NAMLRD complete an inventory and list of public facilities projects. A Tribe or State is required only to inventory priority 1 and 2 coal sites in accordance with section 403(a) of SMCRA. NAMLRD, in accordance with section 403(c) of SMCRA, has already inventoried priority 1 and 2 coal sites. Navajo EPA also stated that it is interested in receiving a copy of the inventory of priority 1 and 2 sites to assist it in ongoing abandoned uranium mine joint reclamation projects. OSM suggests that Navajo EPA request the information from NAMLRD or contact OSM's Albuquerque Field Office. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) Navajo EPA suggested that since section 405(f)(7) of SMCRA requires NAMLRD to report to OSM annually on projects funded under the previous year's grant, Title IV, section 405(f) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should be revised to require that the same kind of information be provided to the Division of Natural Resources and the Navajo Nation Council at the same time such information is reported as required under SMCRA. OSM responds that the Navajo Nation is complying with SMCRA reporting requirements, and if Navajo EPA requires information contained in the documentation provided by NAMLRD to OSM on an annual basis, then Navajo EPA should request this information directly from NAMLRD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (17) Navajo EPA expressed concern that Title IV, section 407 of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 pertaining to acquisition and reclamation of lands adversely affected by past mining practices does not clearly state whether its provisions apply only to private lands within the Navajo Nation boundaries, or to lands such as homesite leases, and individual allotments. Section 407 of SMCRA does not specify the applicability of its provisions as they relate to Indian lands. However, the Navajo Nation's jurisdiction over Navajo Nation lands was clearly defined in the approval of the Navajo Nation plan (53 FR 17186, 17187; May 16, 1988) and is addressed in finding No. 1.e. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (18) Navajo EPA stated that Title IV, section 411(a) of the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 should be changed to be consistent with the Navajo Nation Rules and provide that the Navajo Nation President will certify completion of coal reclamation rather than the Director of NAMLRD. Section 411(a) of SMCRA provides that the head of an Indian tribe will certify to the completion of coal reclamation. The request from the Navajo Nation for the Secretary's concurrence with its certification of completion of coal reclamation was made by the President of the Navajo Nation, which meets the requirements of section 411(a) of SMCRA and which is the tribal authority Navajo EPA asserted should make the certification. Therefore, although consistency between the Navajo Nation AMLR Code of 1987 and Navajo Nation Rules is desirable, it is not an issue in this instance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

[passage omitted]    He also threatened to use force to stop the  Bratstvo-Jedintsvo bridge between Serb and Moslem lines in  central Sarajevo being reopened as planned at 1100 GMT on Monday.    UN Bosnian commander General Michael Rose's approach is "to  give notice and then run convoys," UN High Commissioner for  Refugees (UNHCR) spokesman Kris Janowski said in Sarajevo on  Sunday.    He said convoys in the past had negotiated their passage  with  the warring parties who often blocked humanitarian aid at their  checkpoints. The convoys did not always have armored escorts.    But now the convoys would have an armored UN Protection  Force  (UNPROFOR) escort which would give notice of their passage but  not negotiate in advance about whether they could move through  certain territory.

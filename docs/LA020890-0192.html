			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIGURE SKATING U.S. CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> YAMAGUCHI GETS MORE ICE TIME THAN ZAMBONI  </P> <P> Kristi Yamaguchi was out of bed to make the trip to Bountiful at 8 a.m., which  must have seemed like sleeping in to her considering that she often is on the  ice for practice by 5 a.m. No, it wasn't the starting time Wednesday that gave  Yamaguchi that iron-poor blood look. It was the stopping time.  </P> <P> After becoming the first woman since Margaret Graham in 1953 to win medals in  both singles and pairs at the national figure skating championships last year  in Baltimore, Yamaguchi, 18, was advised by some well-meaning people within the  sport to give up one or the other before she burned out. Not only did she not  listen, it's a wonder she didn't start looking for a dance partner.  </P> <P> "She might look meek, but she has a mind of her own," said her singles coach,  Christy Kjarsgaard Ness. "Don't let the quiet ones fool you."  </P> <P> So Yamaguchi, from Fremont, Calif., has no one but herself to blame for the  schedule Wednesday at the national championships.  </P> <P> From 10:30 a.m. until 1:30 p.m., she was at the Bountiful Ice Rink for the  singles compulsory figures. That meant she had to miss her scheduled pairs  workout with partner Rudi Galindo of San Jose. Under the circumstances, the  U.S. Figure Skating Federation made a concession, allowing them to practice  immediately after the figures.  </P> <P> After that workout, she began another for singles. A few hours later, she went  to the Salt Palace for the opening phase of the pairs competition, the original  program.  </P> <P> "She can only endure this sort of nightmarish schedule because she has such  great talent," said John Nicks, who has worked periodically with Yamaguchi and  Galindo since the death of their pairs coach, Jim Hulick, in December.  </P> <P> As expected, they won the original program. In second place, however, was the  unexpected pair of Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Todd Sand of Thousand  Oaks. Even if Kuchiki and Sand finish among the top three, they will not go to  the World Championships next month in Halifax, Canada, because Kuchiki is only  13. Sharon Carz of Playa del Rey and Doug Williams of Los Angeles were third.  </P> <P> Earlier, Yamaguchi finished fifth in the singles compulsory figures, a  significant improvement over her eighth-place finish a year ago. With a skating  style that belies her small body (4-foot, 11 inches, 82 pounds), she managed to  finish second overall to Jill Trenary.  </P> <P> A two-time champion, Trenary, 21, was first in the figures Wednesday. She said  afterward she is more prepared mentally this year for a challenge from  Yamaguchi. A clear favorite last year, Trenary left a news conference in tears  after she won the championship because so much media attention was devoted to  the ingenue.  </P> <P> This year, Yamaguchi has a different role as a contender. But if there is more  pressure, she doesn't acknowledge it.  </P> <P> "She's detached, almost unemotional," Nicks said.  </P> <P> Perhaps that was her saving grace last year. After the World Championships in  Paris, where she finished fifth in pairs and sixth in singles, her singles  coach, Ness, moved to Edmonton.  </P> <P> Yamaguchi commuted between there and her home in the Bay Area, where she worked  with Galindo and Hulick. But Hulick, who learned in 1988 that he had cancer,  died in December. He was 38.  </P> <P> "That was hard for them at first," Ness said. "Both of them felt he was always  going to be there. When they actually had to deal with his death, it was  traumatic."  </P> <P> Galindo and Yamaguchi spent two weeks in December in Costa Mesa and a week  earlier this year in Salt Lake City with Nicks, who was Hulick's pairs coach  when he competed. But they also have spent time without a pairs coach in  Edmonton, practicing programs that Hulick gave them.  </P></p>

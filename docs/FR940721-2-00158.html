These resources should be documented by letters or documents of commitment of resources, not merely letters of support. ``Letters of support'' merely express another organization's endorsement of a proposed project. Support letters are not binding commitment letters or documents that factually establish the authenticity of other resources. Letters and other documents of commitment are binding in that they specifically state the nature, amount and conditions under which another agency or organization will support a project funded with ANA monies. For example, a letter from another Federal agency or foundation pledging a commitment of $200,000 in construction funding to complement proposed ANA funded pre-construction activity is evidence of a firm funding commitment. These resources may be human, natural or financial, and may include other Federal and non-Federal resources.

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Nissan UK chiefs sent for trial TWO SENIOR executives of Nissan UK charged with multi-million-pound tax evasion were yesterday sent to the Old Bailey for trial. Mr Michael Hunt, 58, assistant managing director and deputy chairman of the former importer-distributor of Nissan vehicles, and Mr Frank Shannon, also 58, the company's finance director, are alleged to have cheated the Inland Revenue out of Pounds 170m. It is alleged that the money found its way to them after false invoices were filed for freight payments. Magistrates at Worthing, West Sussex, committed the men for trial at the Central Criminal Court. Mr Hunt, of Hove, East Sussex, and Mr Shannon, of Brighton, East Sussex, were remanded on conditional bail until the trial. Mr Hunt was granted bail on condition that he lives at his present address and gives the Inland Revenue 72 hours notice if he travels abroad. He has also given the court sureties of Pounds 200,000. Mr Shannon was granted bail on the same conditions and his sureties were worth Pounds 225,000.</p>

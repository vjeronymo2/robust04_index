			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, April 10 (XINHUA) -- War planes of the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) bombed the positions  of Serb-besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde today, U.N. officials  said.    A U.N. military spokesman in Sarajevo said that two NATO  F-16s, which are U.S. war planes based in the northern Italian  town of Aviano, attacked the Serb positions after a request by  the United Nations.    The U.N. officials said two Serb tanks were hit during the  attack.    It was the first time during the two-year Bosnian war that  the United Nations requested attacks on ground positions. In  late February, NATO war planes shot down four Serb aircraft  which violated the "no fly zone" over Bosnia.</p>

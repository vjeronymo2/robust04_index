			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jan Lipold: The Government Wants To Present </F> NATO a Clear Idea of Partnership"]    [Text] Prague--The Foreign Ministry expects no need for  major changes by the North Atlantic Alliance to the Czech  Republic presentation document on the Partnership for Peace plan  that will be handed over to the NATO center in Brussels.    On the basis of the report approved by the government on  Wednesday [11 May], the NATO leadership will draft the specific  program of cooperation with the Czech Republic and submit it to  Prague.    "The proposal for cooperation with NATO is realistic," Ivan  Busniak, director general of the Foreign Ministry Euroatlantic  Section opines. According to the experience of the diplomats,  the ideas of certain other states that signed the Partnership  are too ambitious for NATO.    In the end, there will apparently be fewer than 20 countries  that join the project. Although the plan of close cooperation  with the North Atlantic Alliance facilitates an individual  approach on the part of the Alliance to each of the countries,  it is expected that the mutual relationship that each of the  Central European countries will have with NATO will be analogous  and closer than that of the East European countries or the  former Soviet Union.    "NATO will not wait with the cooperation plan for Central  European countries until it is clear what the position of Russia  will be with respect to the Partnership," Ivan Busniak concludes.    The Partnership for Peace does not give the countries that  join it any security guarantees from NATO; rather, it assures  them of security consultations with the Alliance in the event  their independence or territorial integrity are threatened. The  outcome of the consultations could be, above all, diplomatic  activities of the NATO countries. Direct military assistance is  considered only as the last recourse.    The expenses arising from the participation of the Czech  Republic in the Partnership are estimated at tens of millions  annually. According to Busniak, however, the Czech Republic is  one of the few states that have realized from the very beginning  that they will have to pay the necessary costs.    The Czech Republic offered NATO in the presentation document  the UN base near Cesky Krumlov and training facilities in  Boletice. This year, the Czech military zones are to be used for  exercise purposes also by French and German soldiers.    The joint training and cooperation with the NATO armies  should also facilitate the participation of Czech soldiers in UN  peace operations. After all, the core of UN peacekeeping forces  is often the units of the NATO-member countries.</p>

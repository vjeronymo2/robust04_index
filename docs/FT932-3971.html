			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Letter: US not yet satisfied with semiconductor share Sir, From reading your article on the US-Japan semiconductor agreement ('US may alter line on chip market share', June 7) your readers might be led to believe the US semiconductor industry is so satisfied with the progress being made on market access in Japan that we are willing to declare victory and go home. Unfortunately, that is not the case. We must build on the accomplishment of the 20 per cent foreign market share, an achievement that has taken seven years and two trade agreements. We support US trade representative Mickey Kantor's position that, with steady progress, an average 20 per cent foreign market share during 1993 is an appropriate minimum measure of further progress. In addition, the US semiconductor industry supports the Clinton administration's results-oriented trade policy toward Japan. In the case of semiconductor trade, a quantitative yardstick for measuring progress and strong government and industry co-operation, along with the industry's commitment to serving the Japanese market, have been essential to the increased market share that has been achieved in Japan. We will continue to pursue the programme of the past seven years which focuses on increased market share in Japan consistent with our demonstrated competitiveness in world markets. At a time when American semiconductor manufacturers' market share outside Japan is greater than 56 per cent, it is clear that more progress must be made before the Japanese market can truly be considered to operate solely on free market principles. There should be no misunderstanding regarding the resolve to gain greater access to Japan's semiconductor market. There should also be no mistaking our willingness to work in partnership with the US government and to seek whatever actions may be needed to ensure continued progress.

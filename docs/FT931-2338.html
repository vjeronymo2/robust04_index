			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram faces further questions on profits fall DESPITE a 10p recovery in its share price to 73p yesterday, Spring Ram, the kitchens and bathrooms company, still faces some searching questions from analysts and institutional shareholders when it announces a substantial profits fall on Monday. Although it released an explanation on Thursday as to why 1992 pre-tax profit, at about Pounds 26m, would be Pounds 13m less than expected, analysts say the announcement raised many questions. The most important is the reason for Pounds 5.6m of profit being pushed back into 1993. As it seems this is not connected with the exceptional gain taken on selling spare ACT capacity, the questions centre on the more regular trading activities. For instance, do the contracts concerned relate to sale and return arrangements with customers or to stock being held for customers on Spring Ram sites? The company pointed to Fred 4, a financial reporting exposure draft, as the cause of the changed timing on the Pounds 5.6m profit. The draft rules introduce tough requirements on the treatment of many devices used to conceal liabilities or inflate profits. A second area of questioning concerns the light that different accounting treatments throws on the group's previous profits record. The reported figures showed rapid growth from Pounds 1m in 1982 to Pounds 36.2m in 1991, and high operating margins, which were 17 per cent in 1991. According to Thursday's statement, the 1991 pre-tax profit has been revised downwards by Pounds 1.4m to take account of FRS 3 and a more conservative depreciation policy.</p>

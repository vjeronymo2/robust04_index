			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Zhelyu Zhelev stated as follows in an  interview for the Sofia Khorizont Radio Network today:    No basic reforms have been accomplished in Bulgaria as yet,  hence it is superficial to talk about recommunization as long as  we have not restored private property and the land to their  original owners, as long as we have not achieved a certain stage  in privatization, and as long as the restitution has not been  completed. The term recommunization has a meaning only if  applied to the return of cadres from the old nomenklatura to the  organs of state power, he pointed out.    The opposition is not behaving properly, according to  President Zhelev. It could have overcome bitterness and mutual  insults by restoring the old majority of the people who won the  last elections and who should once more take over the executive  power in order to promote the reforms. Elections under the  current circumstances are likely to involve the risk of  uncertain results, the president stressed.    President Zhelev sees the Union of Democratic Forces as a  democratic coalition rallying the democratic, antitotalitarian,  and non-communist forces, namely all those who are really called  upon to carry out the reforms in Bulgaria.    This is what determines the future and fate of our country,  President Zhelev stated at the end of his interview for the  Khorizont Radio Network.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. of Economic Sciences Anatoliy Aleksandrovich </F> Porokhovskiy, deputy director of Russian Academy of Sciences  United States and Canada Institute, under "Russia-United States:  Dialogue About Partnership" rubric: "In Conditions of Sharp  Competition"]    [Text] Two laws have been adopted while Bill Clinton has  been in power -- the so-called freedom support bill and the  friendship with Russia bill. The first removed a number of  problems and granted Russia most-favored-nation status in trade  with the United States. The second virtually entirely removed  all tariffs and duties on trade with Russia -- which is  considerably more than most favored nation terms.    It has to be admitted that the United States is doing  everything to promote rapprochement with Russia. The Clinton  administration has taken particularly significant steps in the  sphere of attracting private U.S. business to Russia. The U.S.  Department of Commerce has allocated special funds to open 17  U.S. business trade centers in Russia. The largest of these are  already functioning in Moscow. The rest will be scattered  throughout the territory.    It should be pointed out that, as one more step, the state  has allocated more than $2 billion to guarantee credits and  investments by U.S. companies in the Russian economy. Along  with the 17 important agreements signed earlier between the  United States and Russia, which make it possible to avoid double  taxation and create guarantees for state credits, all this  ensures a favorable atmosphere for U.S. private business, which  has virtually gotten a surety from its government.    America is motivated by not just political but also economic  interests. In recent years the entire Western world has been  experiencing a grave economic slump, and the United States  itself has a big deficit in trade with certain countries,  including Japan and China. This greatly affects the  competitiveness of U.S. companies, which are feverishly seeking  additional markets. The huge Russian market is of extraordinary  interest to them. It is also a known fact that each additional  $1 billion in U.S. exports creates 20,000 new jobs. When  approximately 7 percent of Americans are unemployed, this factor  is also of by no means minor significance.    I would also point out another fact: In endeavoring to push  forward onto the Russian market, America takes into account the  fact of increased competition in the world economy. Under  conditions of the growing influence of the European Union and  other international economic organizations in which the United  States retains a significant role, Russia, which is on the  Eurasian continent, is a very convenient base for strengthening  the positions of U.S. private business in this region.  Therefore it turns out that from an economic viewpoint America  has an interest in ensuring that Russia is a reliable economic  partner -- only not a weak one but a reliable and strong one.  This is pure economic reality.    At the same time America is concerned, above all, for its  own  economic security. It understands that the solution to internal  U.S. problems lies outside its borders -- in the world economy,  where such an important partner as Russia has now emerged. At  the same time most of the U.S. Administration's efforts are  aimed at present at creating the infrastructure to strengthen  business ties between the two countries. Private U.S. business  is still somewhat cautious about developing them. Even so, U.S.  companies are in first place in terms of the number of joint  ventures in Russia. U.S. firms are also ahead of their  competitors in terms of the number of offices in Russia.    These are the "pioneers" of U.S. business, who might  develop business at any moment but are refraining at present,  waiting to see how events develop in Russia in the future.    If we look at Russian reality from this viewpoint, we should  acknowledge that things here are far from favorable at present.  This is, of course, connected with the fact that the elimination  of the foreign trade monopoly has brought out onto the world  market a large number of new agents who do not coordinate their  actions and who have their own quotas for sales of a particular  product. Competition has arisen among Russian contracting  parties proper in such important export sectors as oil, gas,  mineral fertilizers, and a number of others where Russia could  earn currency.    On the one hand, the elimination of the foreign trade  monopoly is a positive phenomenon, but because of organizational  mistakes, we have to a considerable extent obtained a negative  result instead of a positive effect. On the whole, the  country's currency revenues have proved not as substantial as  was intended. A considerable part of the proceeds from trade  ended up abroad, and our exporters were not interested in  transferring money to the Russian economy. Only now, since the  president signed the edict on currency-export controls, has the  situation begun to change for the better.    I would particularly like to emphasize that we should not  have any illusions about trade and economic ties between Russia  and the United States. If U.S. companies do not gain at least  some advantage, they will not come here. If the U.S. state does  not gain at least some economic advantage, it will not invest in  the Russian economy. It is pointless to hope that money will be  spent just because Russia needs help. The market system can  work on the basis of political priorities only thanks to budget  funds, which in the United States are under the rigid control of  Congress.    Account must also be taken of the fact that, whenever the  United States allocates funds to support a particular country,  it supports, above all, its own companies which will help this  country. That is, up to 80 percent of the total sum will be  realized through U.S. private business, and just 20 percent of  the aid will directly reach projects on our country's territory.</p>

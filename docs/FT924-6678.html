			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Decline in land prices accelerates LAND prices in Japan's largest cities have fallen by about a fifth in the last six months, threatening to exacerbate the Japanese banks' mounting problems with non-performing loans to real estate developers, according to a report published yesterday. The report by the Japan Real Estate Institute said that commercial land prices fell at an annual rate of 22.5 per cent in the six largest cities, Tokyo, Yokohama, Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe in the six months to the end of September. Residential land prices in these cities fell by about 20.5 per cent. The institute said the falls were the worst results since it started the survey in 1936. The continued fall in land prices will eat into more of the collateral used for many of the real estate loans which the banks made during the boom in land speculation in the late 1980s. The collapse in real estate prices is the main reason for the sharp rise in the bank's non-performing loans over the past year. In the six months to September non-performing loans held by the top 21 Japanese banks rose by more than 50 per cent to Y12,000bn (Pounds 63bn). This increase largely reflects last year's fall in the property market, when average residential land prices for the six largest cities fell by 9.7 per cent. The acceleration in the rate of decline in land prices means the banks bad debts will continue to rise for the foreseeable future. Senior bankers admit the amount of non-performing loans is still rising rapidly. The findings of the report, based on a survey of 22,000 sites in 223 cities, suggests the government's public works programme, which includes measures to bring forward purchases of land for public infrastructure schemes, has had little impact on prices. Average land prices throughout Japan fell by 2.6 per cent in the six months to the end of September, with residential prices down 2.5 per cent and commercial prices down 3.3 per cent.</p>

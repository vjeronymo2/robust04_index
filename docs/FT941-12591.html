			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Insurers threaten Names over offer Insurers for Lloyd's agents yesterday threatened loss-making Names with long and expensive court battles if they reject the insurance market's Pounds 900m settlement offer next month. In a letter to Names, the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market, errors and omissions (E&amp;O) underwriters at Lloyd's ruled out additional money, denting Names' hopes of an improved offer. Insurers are understood to have agreed to contribute about Pounds 400m to the deal announced last month. Further funds will come from Lloyd's central fund - which meets claims when Names cannot meet their obligations - and voluntary contributions from agents. 'We have assessed the potential liability of the agents when set against the limited amount of insurance in force,' the E&amp;O underwriters' letter said. 'On this basis we can justify our contribution, but not more. The only way we can be persuaded is by the courts, and even then funds are limited.' Insurance funds likely to be available if legal actions are successful 'will be well short of the Pounds 900m currently on offer', the letter added. Many agents had inadequate insurance, while others who have more than enough insurance have very little exposure. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, the largest organisation of loss-making Names, said: 'I can only characterise these letters as a regrettable attempt to mislead the Names.' Based on figures supplied by the E&amp;O insurers, the offer document estimated 'cover available for the losses of about Pounds 2,800m' of between Pounds 820m and Pounds 1,085m. The Gooda Names, whose main legal case is scheduled to begin in April, are also aiming to sue for losses which are not covered by the offer document. Successful claims could trigger more than Pounds 200m in extra E&amp;O cover, said Mr Deeny. Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, has written to Names conceding that the market had been forced to revise its offer terms to some lossmakers as a result of arithmetical and other errors. The revision follows the discovery of another set of errors late last year and subsequent amendments to the offer. It is thought to affect about 2,000 Names, although the amounts of money involved are small and the overall shape of the deal is not affected. Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations Working Party, said: 'Names still have no confidence in the methodology.'</p>

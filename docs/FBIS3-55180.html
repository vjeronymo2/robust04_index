			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The President Guarantees"] </F>   [Text] Boris Yeltsin has decided to take additional steps  to guarantee the right of citizens to information. This is  served by the edict "On Additional Guarantees of the Right of  Citizens to Information," which ITAR-TASS received yesterday.    The president has entrusted the Legislative Proposals  Commission with preparing a draft law "On the Right to  Information," which will be submitted to parliament as a  priority legislative initiative. Pending the adoption of such a  law, the edict establishes the responsibilities of state organs,  organizations and enterprises, public associations, and  officials in ensuring information openness. In particular, it  guarantees the accessibility of information which is of public  interest or affects citizens' personal interests.    The essence of state organs' decisions will be explained  more  extensively on radio and television.    One of the points in the edict particularly stipulates that  the activities of federal organs of legislative, executive, and  judicial power are given equal coverage in programs.    By means of another edict Boris Yeltsin has decided to form  the Judicial Chamber for Information Disputes under the Russian  Federation president on the basis of the Information Arbitration  Court which operated during the period of preparation for the  parliamentary elections.    The edict, which ITAR-TASS also received yesterday, states  that the main functions of the Judicial Chamber are to assist  the president in defending rights and freedoms in the mass  information sphere; to ensure the objective and reliable nature  of reports; to ensure the principle of equality of rights in the  mass information sphere; to ensure protection of the moral  interests of children and young people in the mass media; to  ensure pluralism in news and sociopolitical television and radio  programs; and a number of other tasks.    Anatoliy Vengerov has been appointed chairman of the  Judicial  Chamber for Information Disputes.</p>

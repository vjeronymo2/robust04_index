			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Massimo D'Alema, deputy secretary of the </F> Democratic Party of the Left, by Luciana Di Mauro in Rome; date  not given: "D'Alema: `Latch on to the Center? Berlusconi Did  Not Manage To'"]    [Text] [D'Alema] The political operation attempted by  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi, namely that of latching on to  the Center, did not succeed. At most, they managed to secure a  few votes under the table. Our task now is to strive to create  a broad opposition in parliament, not limited to the forces on  the Left. In this sense, voting for Spadolini was a positive  choice. [D'Alema ends]    Thus the PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] outgoing  speaker, who now prefers to simply call himself the Gallipoli  deputy, commented on the two-day session which led to the  election of the two parliamentary speakers nominated by the  majority.    [Di Mauro] Deputy D'Alema, do you believe that the majority  obtained for Scognamiglio's nomination may result in a political  majority being formed in the next few days?    [D'Alema] Clearly the election of the Senate speaker, who  was  elected by a majority of one, does not solve the problem of  achieving a political majority in the Senate, although this does  not detract from the result itself. The majority forces are  still confronted with the problem of winning the votes that they  may require each time. However, the basic political question is  that of an agreement with the Italian Popular Party [PPI].    [Di Mauro] But [outgoing Interior Minister] Mancino clearly  said "no" to Berlusconi's proposal.    [D'Alema] Precisely. It do not think that we are dealing  with a very likely possibility, but in any case this reveals a  political orientation or, in any case, an intention. I would  say that the majority has obtained the result that it was aiming  at. It was easier in the Chamber of Deputies, and more  difficult in the Senate. Yesterday morning I heard [National  Alliance leader] Fini quoting the figures: Obviously he knew  whom he had contacted. This means that the Second Republic is,  from its outset, marred by the worst characteristics of the  first: arrogance and callousness, in short, the worst side of  Craxism. It is no mere coincidence that Scognamiglio was,  together with De Michelis, the co-author of a book called  "Governing Italy in the Year 2000." He collaborated with  Altissimo [former Liberal Party Secretary]. We are faced with  the same political-intellectual caste, or at least a closely  related one, which found its shock troops in the Right. The  fact that they constitute the same political caste does not mean  that they are pursuing the same policies.    [Di Mauro] Is a tug of war between the majority and the  opposition now likely?    [D'Alema] The problem is not a tug of war. Disagreement is  only natural in the dialectics between majority and opposition.  What is serious, however, is the fact of monopolizing the  guarantee functions. While appointing a man who had "super  partes" [standing above the contending parties] characteristics,  the majority could have sought a dialogue with the opposition  forces. What authority does [Chamber of Deputies speaker] Irene  Pivetti have to say that parliament must set its hands to  amending the Constitution? This is not her task.    [Di Mauro] In a majority-based parliament, the opposition's  role will change. In what ways?    [D'Alema] A majority-based parliament does not mean that the  opposition's control role is reduced to zero. Usually, in  bipolar systems this role is highlighted. In Britain, the  speaker of the House of Commons is a Labor Party member. Here  associationism has been mistaken for the need to safeguard the  "super partes" [standing above the contending parties] role of  the speakers. A test of strength has been attempted with a view  to forming a governing majority. The way in which the problem  was tackled is apparent from the fact that recourse to new  elections was being proposed should their candidates not be  elected. A rather disturbing fact. It is right for a majority  to want to be self- sufficient for the purpose of governing the  country, but it cannot be self-sufficient for the purpose of  changing the rules of the game. Having said this, I do not  think that too much importance should be given to a result which  stems from the general election results.    [Di Mauro] On his first day as a deputy, Berlusconi said:  Spending so many hours here is giving me an itch. Why is this?  Is he allergic to procedures?    [D'Alema] I do not know what Berlusconi may have said.  Allergy to democratic rules and procedures, however, is nothing  new. Craxi went as far as calling parliament a "cattle pen."    [Di Mauro] The test of strength over the house speakers  seems  to foreshadow a rather more important confrontation over the  amendment of the Constitution. The majority people are always  speaking of a minority that will have the right to express its  opinion but not to cause any disruption, almost as if they never  need to concern themselves in the future with the control  exercised by the opposition.    [D'Alema] We must defend the rules of the game without,  however, renouncing the reformist approach which we adopted  during the election campaign. The question is: what rules of  the game? It must be taken into account that this is a  parliament, a constituted body, not a constituent assembly. It  can make amendments, but it cannot redraft the Constitution. I  am not convinced by that mixture of uninominalism and  presidentialism which is being mentioned. The quality of the  reforms is also part of the problem. However, we must be clear  that the arrogance and would-be self-sufficiency characterizing  the majority's attitude must not lead us to adopt a conservative  line. I repeat: We must develop the reformist approach which  we advocated in the election campaign, in the course of which we  did not repropose the "status quo."    [Di Mauro] Is there not also an element of novelty in the  way  that the new majority is presenting itself?    [D'Alema] They emphasize novelty, whereas in fact they are  continuing the old politics. The novelty lies in their  arrogance and their claim to be self-sufficient. Continuity  lies in the lotting process. They have apportioned the first  positions, and they are preparing to share out everything else  within a coalition made up of new parties -- but the logic is  the old one.</p>

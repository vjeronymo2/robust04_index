			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Let Moscow join European Union, says Seguin Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the French national assembly, last night called for radical changes in the European Union to widen its membership to Russia, to create a European Security Council, and to relaunch the European economy with interest rate cuts and massive public borrowing. The impact of the views of Mr Seguin, who led last year's French referendum campaign against Maastricht, and the degree to which they might rock the foundations of the Balladur government's European policy, may depend in part on the outcome of the Gatt negotiations. If a Gatt crisis were seriously to divide the French government, and particularly Mr Edouard Balladur from his party leader, Mr Jacques Chirac, then the latter might lend a sympathetic ear to some of Mr Seguin's views, at least those on economic and monetary policy. Mr Seguin, who has led the criticism of government policy, particularly its failure to stem unemployment, within the prime minister's own RPR Gaullist party, has been competing with Mr Balladur for Mr Chirac's ear. The National Assembly president shares much of the Euroscepticism prevalent in London. But, in his speech last night to a Paris university audience, he pushed the thesis of a wider-rather-than-deeper European integration further than any British conservative minister would dare or probably want to. He called for the EU to consolidate the peace of Europe by extending its membership to Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Capping his vision of a 'Grand Europe' would be a European Security Council, modelled on the United Nations version with four or five main European powers on it and able to dispatch peace-keeping forces throughout the continent. He proposed a radical downgrading in most EU institutions, with the Brussels Commission losing its right to make proposals and with the European Parliament confined to ratifying European legislation 'which would be collectively elaborated by national parliaments'. To stop Europe's 'collective suicide' in the form of ever-rising unemployment, Mr Seguin called for a 'rapid and substantial lowering of interest rates', and for recognition that the plan for a single European currency, is 'strangling the whole of Europe'.</p>

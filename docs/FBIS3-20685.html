			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The 13 February issue of the Belgrade  daily POLITIKA on page 7 carries an interview with Veljko  Knezevic, new head of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY]  diplomatic office in Zagreb. Knezevic reveals to POLITIKA that  he was born in the vicinity of Knin and that he had lived in  Zagreb for 40 years, before leaving in 1990, when "first  unpleasantnesses started," after resigning from the position of  director of Radio-Television Zagreb. Knezevic states that the  FRY office will be located in the center of Zagreb, "three  tramway stops away from the place where he used to live."  POLITIKA states that Knezevic personally knows many current  Croatian leaders, including his successor at Croatian Television  -- Antun Vrdoljak. Answering a question on the order in which  the normalization of relations between the FRY and Croatia will  be carried out, he responds that first postal, then railroad,  and finally road links will be established.</p>

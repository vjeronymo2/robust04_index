			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing for Phoenix Timber Phoenix Timber yesterday launched a refinancing following trading problems, the breaching of its banking covenants and the need for substantial provisions to be announced with its results for the year to March. It will make a 5-for-8 rights issue at 8p a share to raise Pounds 1.44m, underwritten by Co-operation Retirement Benefit Fund, an existing shareholder. CRBF will end up with between 14.8 per cent and 55.2 per cent of the ordinary share capital after the rights issue. It will also subscribe a total of Pounds 1.44m in loan notes subject to shareholder clawback. If the refinancing is successful Phoenix' banks have agreed to extend banking facilities to the end of this year.</p>

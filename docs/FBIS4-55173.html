			<p>BFN     [Text] Just under an hour ago, President Lech Walesa  returned to Warsaw from his two-day visit to Estonia. Here is  what he told newsmen at the airport:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] What is the  significance of the visit to Estonia?    [Walesa] I had to sort out matters in Europe. We have to  take  all opinions into account, because we are building democracy,  after all, and on this road a revisit to Estonia was in order. I  think that that country indeed has many possibilities, and it  would be worth doing a bit of business with it. And I think  that after my visit, some such business will be done.    [Reporter] Is cooperation with the Baltic states the  direction for Poland and the central-eastern European states?    [Walesa] Well, it isn't the only direction, but it's  nevertheless quite an important one. The Scandinavian route --  via the Baltics, as they call it -- the whole idea is a very  good one, and I think Poland should join it as quickly as  possible. [end recording]</p>

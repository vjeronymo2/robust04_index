			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / The Labour Party Conference: Prescott reveals government's rail plans A LEAKED COPY of the transport secretary's working diary over the next two months was used yesterday by Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, to highlight a number of initiatives likely to be announced at next week's Tory party conference. Mr Prescott said Mr John MacGregor's conference speech will probably include the following: The Victoria to Gatwick rail franchise service will begin on October 10. The first Channel tunnel train will visit Waterloo station in October. Work on the Jubileee line extension will start on November 1. The Pounds 150m leasing decision on rolling stock in the run-up to privatisation will be announced and 'undoubtedly go to Network SouthEast'. The diary also confirmed that the announcement of rail fare rises was to be delayed until later next month, said Mr Prescott. Later, Mr MacGregor said his diary only contained what people expected to be coming up. 'There are no surprises in it at all,' he said. In his speech Mr Prescott said a future Labour government would take a privatised rail network back into public ownership. 'Let me make it crystal clear,' he said. 'Any privatisation of the railway system will be quickly and effectively dealt with, on the arrival of a Labour government, by returning it to public ownership.' Mr Prescott, whose speech prompted a standing ovation, said the government was pushing ahead with rail privatisation to 'rob' the railway workers' pension fund 'to pay for the Treasury's failures'. He said Mr MacGregor was 'obsessed' by roads. The government's concern for roads was motivated by 'the crisis in the Treasury' rather than by the needs of a transport system. 'The government exploits roads for the Pounds 18bn a year they generate in taxes,' said Mr Prescott. VAT on public transport would raise a further Pounds 2bn, he warned. Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT transport union, demanded a halt to plans for the rail privatisation. He warned: 'Railway workers are slow to get angry, but I can tell you there is now a deep, deep anger burning in us about what is happening.'</p>

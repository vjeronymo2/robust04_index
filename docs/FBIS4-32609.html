			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kemal Muftic, adviser to Bosnian President </F> Alija Izetbegovic, by unidentified KURIER correspondent in  Sarajevo; date not given: "`If the Serbs Do Not Withdraw, We  Will Liberate Ourselves'"]    [Text] [KURIER] Is the Muslim-Croat Federation working?    [Muftic] Yes, it is working well. The fighting between the  two armies has been reduced. It is not easy to defend Bosnia  because the destruction was well prepared. But we believe in  Bosnia.    [KURIER] In the United Nations' plans, the Federation is  based on 51 percent of the territory. But you have only 30  percent....    [Muftic] Bosnia does not mean 51 percent, but 100 percent.    [KURIER] The Federation only includes the Muslims and  Croats. Would you consider yourself represented by it if you  were a loyal Serb?    [Muftic] Yes. The Serbs must understand the political  realities. The Federation is a political process that has  stabilized the situation. Now Karadzic's Serbs cannot make any  more conquests. The war has turned from a war of defense into  one of liberation. The army is getting larger every day, morale  is high -- but logistics are lacking.    [KURIER] The Bosnians want to achieve a lifting of the arms  embargo. Would this not mean another outbreak of war?    [Muftic] It was the imbalance of forces that led to the war.  Without the embargo we could have stopped the aggression right  at the beginning.    [KURIER] Do you want to liberate the territories occupied by  the Serbs?    [Muftic] The Serbs only understand the language of violence.  Either the aggressor's army withdraws -- or we will liberate  ourselves. If the international community does not stop the  Serbs, we will have no other choice.    [KURIER] Is there a Bosnian ultimatum to the international  community?    [Muftic] That is top secret.</p>

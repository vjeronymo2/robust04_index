			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFESSION A KEY ISSUE AS EX-HARVARD STUDENT IS TRIED FOR ROBBERIES  </P> <P> It has been more than three years since Jose Luis Razo crouched in a trash bin  outside a La Habra dairy and made a decision that changed the course of his  life.  </P> <P> The Harvard University freshman had just returned home from Cambridge to spend  the holidays with his family. Now, the day after Christmas, he hid behind the  Driftwood Dairy, down the street from the Catholic church where, as a  precocious grammar school pupil, he first demonstrated the academic and  athletic abilities that would take him out of the barrio.  </P> <P> With a .22-caliber pistol in his hand and a ski mask pulled over his face, Razo  waited until there were no customers in the store, then emerged from the  dumpster and robbed the elderly owner of $60.  </P> <P> "I was afraid he would kill," said the robbery victim, Damnang Meas, during  Razo's preliminary hearing in 1987.  </P> <P> It was the first of more than a dozen holdups that Razo, now 22, says he  committed while home on breaks during his first two years at Harvard. His  confession to police -- and later to The Times and other newspapers -- in July,  1987, shocked La Habra's close-knit Latino community, which had been enormously  proud of Razo and had expected great things of him.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Razo's trial for 10 robberies he says he committed in Orange  County began in a Santa Ana courtroom as his lawyer and a county prosecutor  began in pretrial motions to argue over what is shaping up as the key element  in the case -- the admissibility of Razo's confession as evidence. Jury  selection in the case is expected to follow in a week or so, and Razo's trial  in Los Angeles County for three more robberies and five assaults is scheduled  for May 31.  </P> <P> But 18 months after Razo called La Habra police and confirmed their suspicions  that he was the "ski-mask bandit" who had terrorized clerks in fast-food  restaurants, markets and stores, the question of why remains baffling.  </P> <P> Until his arrest, Razo's life had had a storybook quality: A Mexican immigrant  raised in humble surroundings, he had excelled as a student and athlete at  demanding parochial schools and taken on responsibility as a community youth  leader. At Harvard, Razo was an above-average student and a hard-nosed,  respected football player.  </P> <P> What few people knew then was that there were also a few blemishes on his  record. In 1983, a "theft matter" involving Razo was handled "informally" by  Fullerton police, according to court documents. No further information about  that incident was available.  </P> <P> In 1984, Razo, then 17, was made a ward of juvenile court for stealing a wallet  from an unlocked car in La Habra. That same year, he was charged with assault  and battery after he got involved in a fight at a party in Brea, but the  charges were later dropped.  </P> <P> And in 1986, Razo was arrested and charged with misdemeanor grand theft. The  incident involved the theft of a watch and sunglasses from a student from a  rival high school at a party in La Habra. That charge was dismissed the  following year "in the interest of justice," court records show.  </P> <P> Richard Guthrie, director of the Boys' Club of La Habra, where Razo spent many  hours as a youth, said that he and others at the club knew about the 1986  incident, but no one paid it much heed.  </P> <P> "He kept it very well hidden," Guthrie said. "It could have been a strong  signal that something was amiss."  </P> <P> Razo and family members declined recent requests to talk before his upcoming  trial. In his statements to reporters and police in 1987, Razo said that he  used the money from the robberies to help his family and friends and also to  buy drugs.  </P> <P> "Whatever my family wanted, it got," Razo said in a jailhouse interview in  July, 1987. "I needed money for school and plane flights back and forth from  Harvard."  </P> <P> He also said that he didn't fit in at Harvard and that no one there understood  him.  </P> <P> "I am a homeboy now," Razo said, then added in Spanish: "I don't sell out my  own ethnic identity."  </P> <P> Before he dropped the case because of an unspecified conflict of interest,  Orange County Deputy Public Defender James S. Egar said the case revolved  around "mental issues" -- the pressures Razo felt as the symbol of success for  a depressed neighborhood and the isolation he experienced as one of the few  Latinos at Harvard.  </P> <P> Razo's current court-appointed attorney in the Orange County case, John D.  Barnett, is less inclined to talk about the problems his client might have had  bridging the distinctive worlds of Harvard and La Habra, saying only that  Razo's background "will have a place in the case."  </P> <P> Barnett, in contrast with Egar, steadfastly maintains that his client is  innocent.  </P> <P> He plans to introduce evidence showing that Razo confessed to crimes he did not  commit and that his statements to police were obtained by "constitutionally  deficient" means, he said.  </P> <P> During Razo's preliminary hearing, defense attorney Egar attacked the validity  of the confession on a number of grounds, contending, for example, that Razo's  unusual behavior while talking to the police showed that his state of mind was  "confused, vulnerable, volatile."  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Arthur D. Guy Jr. ruled, however, that Razo's statements were  made voluntarily and were admissible.  </P> <P> The prosecutor now on the Orange County case, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ravi Mehta,  says he expects Barnett to attack the confession in every way imaginable -- and  then, if it is once again ruled admissible, to drop the not-guilty plea and try  to negotiate a reduced sentence for Razo.  </P> <P> "I don't really expect this case to go to trial," Mehta said. "He's just got  too much to lose."  </P> <P> Because he is also charged with five counts of assault with a deadly weapon in  Los Angeles County, Razo could face a sentence of as long as 20 years there as  well, Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Philip Millet said.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, he is charged with robbing a pizza parlor in Whittier on  two occasions and a McDonald's restaurant in Pico Rivera. During the second  pizza parlor robbery, on Jan. 12, 1987, Razo did something he had not done in  any of the other incidents -- he failed to cover his face with a ski mask or  scarf, wearing only a baseball cap on his head, police said.  </P> <P> That robbery is the only one in which Razo was positively identified by a store  or restaurant employee.  </P> <P> Razo spent a total of 16 months in Orange County Jail before friends and  relatives were able to secure his release in November on $150,000 bail pending  his two trials.  </P> <P> Since he got out, Razo has tried to reconstruct some semblance of a normal  life. He attended his brother's football games at La Habra High School last  fall. He works for a longtime family friend and is enrolled in courses at  Fullerton College, Boys' Club director Guthrie said.  </P> <P> Razo's time in jail was a "tremendously sobering experience for him," said  Guthrie, who sat with Razo and his parents at a couple of football games. "His  mental attitude is very good. He seems to be somewhat quiet, subdued, very  aware of what's going on in the world around him.  </P> <P> "He realizes he's been through some rough times. . . . I think he's hopeful  that it (the trial) will come out in the best possible way for him," Guthrie  said, adding that exactly what that would be is "hard to define."  </P> <P> "He wants to get it over with," Guthrie said.  </P></p>

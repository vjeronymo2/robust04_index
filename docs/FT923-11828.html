			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Greenspan fails to boost dollar THE DOLLAR extended its rally against the D-Mark at the start of European trading yesterday but showed new signs of weakness by the close, writes James Blitz. The US currency continued to derive strength from Monday's concerted intervention by the Federal Reserve and European central banks to keep the dollar above its all-time low. In the morning it rose nearly two pfennigs to peak at DM1.5020 as corporate demand for dollars intensified. By lunchtime the rally had petered out and it retreated to close in London at DM1.4885. In New York the dollar finished a shade lower at DM1.4865. The dollar is underpinned by the market's belief that if the currency tests its record low again, the central banks will intervene. Mr Angus Armstrong, an economist at Morgan Grenfell in London, commented: 'The reputations of nearly a dozen central banks are at stake here, so I think they will be keen to underpin the dollar for now.' Yesterday's dollar downturn was partly due to the market's disappointment with the testimony on the US economy given by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve. He said US GDP would be in the area of 2.25 to 2.75 per cent in 1992, compared to a previous forecast of 1.75 to 2.50 per cent. However, Mr Christian Dunis, a currency analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said Mr Greenspan's upward revision of US growth estimates for 1992 was unconvincing. 'In recent times we have seen the Fed consistently over-optimistic about the economy,' said Mr Dunis. 'What the market did not want to hear was wishful thinking about the scope for a US economic recovery.' The dollar's later weakness could also be put down to the continued strength of the D-Mark, with many operators remaining convinced that the Bundesbank will put up its Lombard rate when it next meets in August. A clear sign that the German currency has not been seriously weakened by the central bank intervention was the D-Mark's gain against the French franc yesterday. France has a trade surplus, while Germany has a trade deficit. The French also have an inflation rate 1 percentage point below Germany's. But the D-Mark still rose yesterday, ending at FFr3.3780, against a previous close of FFr3.3750. The D-Mark was also firm against sterling, which has failed to track the dollar's rise in the last two days. The pound managed to finish unchanged at DM2.8425, but it was down in morning trading to DM2.8367. The Italian lira was weak in spite of the Bank of Italy's huge intervention on its behalf the previous day. It dropped to a low of L761.20 against the D-Mark, but improved later to L759.40.</p>

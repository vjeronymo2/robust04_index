			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Swedish parties attacked on policies SWEDEN'S main opposition parties - the Moderates and the Liberals - were accused yesterday of wanting to introduce Thatcherism into the country if they form a government after the next general election. 'They want to put Mrs Thatcher's discarded coat over Mother Sweden,' said Mr Allan Larsson, finance minister of the ruling Social Democrats, in an attack on their joint economic programme revealed at the weekend which is designed to transform Sweden into a more market-oriented economy. 'What they want to do is nothing more than to introduce the policies that were tried out in Britain during the 1980s and which led to very high unemployment and increased social division,' he added. Today Mr Larsson will introduce Sweden's supplementary budget for 1991 which will indicate the Social Democratic alternative to the Moderate-Liberal economic programme. The two main opposition parties have indicated they intend to fight the forthcoming general election campaign on a common economic strategy. It contains promises for a direct cut in Sweden's value added tax from 25 per cent to between 18-20 per cent as part of a staged reduction in public spending and tax pressure for adjustment to future European Community membership. The parties also pledge to cut the proportion of Sweden's gross national product of 60 per cent that goes to the public sector, reform the sickness insurance system to deal with the scandal of high absenteeism from work and privatise the state industry sector. They will also abolish monopolies, encourage saving and share ownership, and strengthen market forces in the labour market as well as in the financial system and in industry. Both Mr Carl Bildt, the Moderate leader and Mr Bengt Westerberg, leader of the Liberals said their programme would not be changed to satisfy any other possible coalition partners in a future non-Socialist government. The Christian Democrats who are expected to enter Parliament for the first time will back the far-reaching economic manifesto. But Mr Olof Johansson, Centre party leader, said he could not agree with much of it and doubted whether the Centre would support such a market strategy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hohhot, April 21 (XINHUA) -- A forest fire which  broke out in a lumbering site of the Hulun Buir League  (prefecture) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is still  raging on after six days concerted efforts of fighting.    Two fires started in the operational area six days ago. One  was reported to have been brought under control and the other is  still going on due to strong winds and difficult terrains.    Acting Premier Zhu Rongji and State Councillor Chen Junsheng  are being kept up-to-date with reports on the firefighting.  They have sent messages of encouragement to fire fighters via  the regional government of Inner Mongolia and the Ministry of  Forestry.    Xu Yufang, China's forestry minister and Zhu guangyao, the  vice-minister, as well as Zhang Tingwu, vice-chairman of the  Inner Mongolia Regional Government, are on the spot to direct  fire fighting operations.</p>

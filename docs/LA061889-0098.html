			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE ELECTIONS TO TEST MEXICO'S RULING PARTY;  </P> <P> OPPOSITION PARTIES POSE STIFF CHALLENGE TO PRI AND PRESIDENT SALINAS'  COMMITMENT TO REFORM  </P> <P> The purple scar that cuts across Carmen Zalpa's nose and under her left eye has  become a badge of courage for the Indian woman who heads a village committee in  support of leftist leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas.  </P> <P> Zalpa was hit in the face by a brick last month during a confrontation with  police who were escorting the ruling party's candidate for the state assembly  on a campaign swing through her village of Acachuen.  </P> <P> To protest the incident, Zalpa and dozens of other peasants have occupied the  city hall in this rural town in the state of Michoacan and have built stone  barricades in the streets to prevent the police from evicting them. They are  demanding the dismissal of the Institutional Revolutionary Party mayor, local  justice officials and the six-member local police force, and are calling for  honest state assembly elections July 2.  </P> <P> "Before, it was joy that made me a Cardenista. Now it is anger," Zalpa said.  "We will vote legally next month, and we will win. If not, we are willing to  die here."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Test for Salinas  </P> <P> Although the election is for the traditionally powerless state legislature, it  has taken on national importance as a test for President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari's commitment to democracy and political reform. It is one of three  hotly contested state elections that will be held on the same day.  </P> <P> In Baja California, the PRI, as the ruling party is called, faces stiff  competition in the gubernatorial race from the rightist National Action Party,  whose candidate, a popular former mayor of Ensenada, is tied with the PRI  candidate in the polls. In its 60 years, the PRI has never lost an election for  governor.  </P> <P> Municipal and legislative elections also will take place in the state of  Chihuahua, another stronghold of the National Action Party, called by its  Spanish initials, PAN. The right-wing party held seven mayoralties there from  1983 to 1986, including Ciudad Juarez on the border and Chihuahua City, the  state capital. These cities as well as the governorship were claimed by the PRI  in 1986 elections that the PAN charged were fraudulent.  </P> <P> But while all three state races are expected to be close, it is in Michoacan  that the PRI may face its toughest challenge to maintain order and the  legitimacy of the election. Here, the name Cardenas is nearly sacred and the  Cardenistas are militant.  </P> <P> Cardenas' father, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, was one of the country's most beloved  presidents. He is regarded as a national hero for expropriating the nation's  oil industry in the 1930s. After his term, the general returned home and, for  the next 30 years, acted as benefactor, channeling demands of the poor to the  government.  </P> <P> Cuauhtemoc Cardenas was a popular governor of this Indian farming state before  he broke with the ruling party to run for president last July. Many of the  peasants note proudly that Cardenas has dark skin, as they do.  </P> <P> In the presidential election, Cardenas won 64% of the vote in Michoacan. His  coalition of parties took 12 of the state's 13 seats in the lower house of the  federal legislature, an unprecedented opposition victory.  </P> <P> With their new-found strength, Cardenas' supporters occupied more than 50 city  halls last fall to demand the removal of Michoacan Gov. Luis Martinez  Villacana. Martinez Villacana, who followed Cardenas into office, has fired  hundreds of Cardenas supporters from state government posts and overturned many  of his policies. Ironically, many Cardenas policies, such as a ban on weekend  liquor sales, were unpopular until the new governor reversed them.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Removed 2 Governors  </P> <P> Among Salinas' first acts as president was the removal of Martinez Villacana,  along with the equally disliked governor of Baja California, Xicotencatl Leyva  Mortera. Although the latter's term is up this year, the Michoacan term has two  years to run. The PRI-dominated state legislature named Genovevo Figueroa as  interim governor but, theoretically, a new legislature with a Cardenista  majority could appoint a governor to complete the term.  </P> <P> The PRI, therefore, is running hard in the race for 18 legislative seats, and  it is campaigning from the awkward position of both incumbent party and  opposition. National PRI President Luis Donaldo Colosio has made five trips to  Michoacan and plans another before the vote.  </P> <P> "We're dedicating three days a week to these elections (in Baja California and  Michoacan) and the other three days to the rest of the country," Colosio said.  </P> <P> The PRI moved from its old offices in downtown Morelia, the capital of  Michoacan, to four floors of a modern high-rise building that also houses the  federal secretaries of treasury and budget and planning. The party has set up  an elaborate campaign structure with 26 departments, including ecology and  sports. The national party has sent in dozens of campaign workers, several of  whom expect to remain through mayoral elections scheduled for November.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Among the Poorest States  </P> <P> Michoacan, west of Mexico City, is among the poorest of the nation's 31 states  and is a primary source of illegal immigrants in the United States. Mexico's  ailing economy can only work against the PRI in the legislative election, as it  did last July.  </P> <P> Early this year, interim Gov. Figueroa and federal authorities announced a  multimillion-dollar development plan for the state. It is not clear how much of  the money has been forthcoming, although several highways have been repaved  recently and at least a few other long-promised public works projects have been  started.  </P> <P> Opposition parties charge that the PRI uses such government programs before  elections to win support for the party. Cardenas supporters say the government  promised more than it could deliver in the Michoacan plan, and so it may  backfire.  </P> <P> The Cardenistas have problems of their own. The coalition of four parties that  backed Cardenas for president has since fallen apart, and Cardenas has formed  his own party, the Revolutionary Democratic Party. Cardenas is not a candidate.  Not only does his new party lack name recognition, but one of the old parties  that split with Cardenas also bears his famous last name. The party that  delivered the most votes to Cardenas last July has its own slate of candidates.  </P> <P> Political analyst Jorge Zepeda Patterson, a university researcher in Zamora,  Michoacan, said that many urban voters who cast ballots for Cardenas last July  did so as a protest against the PRI and not necessarily in support of Cardenas'  policies. Those protest votes do not automatically translate into backing for  Cardenista candidates.  </P> <P> The government and Cardenas' party both charge that the other has been  fomenting violence to frighten voters away from the polls. Michoacan  traditionally has suffered a high level of violence involving land disputes and  marijuana trafficking, but in the last year there has also been political  violence between the PRI and the Cardenistas.  </P> <P> In such confrontations, one person was killed and three others were wounded in  the town of Charapan, four were wounded in Mirandillas, the PRI municipal  president was stoned in Maravatio and eight Cardenistas, including Carmen  Zalpa, were wounded in Acachuen.  </P> <P> Cardenistas are still holding at least a dozen city halls to demand, in most  cases, a new municipal president, or mayor. In several towns, among them  Cheran, they have set up parallel governments.  </P> <P> Cheran's "Mayor Elected by the People," Adalberto Munoz Estrada, occupies the  first floor of the town hall and presides over public celebrations, such as  those on Cinco de Mayo. The "Mayor Elected by the Congress," Manuel Sta. Clara,  works at home signing official documents.  </P> <P> The state government apparently has decided against using force to evict the  Cardenistas from the town halls. Sta. Clara said that congress initially  advised him to stay in his house and avoid provoking the opposition. He said he  did not go out for two months after the state named him to replace another  unpopular mayor.  </P> <P> In Chilchota, Cardenas supporters say they were attacked by the municipal  police force that accompanied PRI legislative candidate Ramiro Pena Diaz to  Acachuen last month. Pena Diaz has charged that his group was attacked by the  Cardenistas and that the police intervened.  </P> <P> There is some question about how much control Cardenas and his national party  exercise over local supporters. The PRI insists that Cardenas could order his  people out of the town halls; Cardenista federal deputies from Michoacan say  that the people made the decision to take over town halls on their own.  </P> <P> The other looming question is whether the PRI government would be willing to  recognize a Cardenista majority in the state legislature. The ruling party has  long been accused of stealing elections.  </P> <P> Salinas, who the opposition claims won through fraudulent elections, has  committed himself to fair and open voting. Analysts argue that Michoacan would  not be a threat if the PRI lost it because it is not vital to the country's  economy or national security. Moreover, an opposition congress, especially with  the PRI governor, could be an experiment for Salinas' goals of political  reform.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Salinas and the PRI have an aversion to Cardenas, whom they  view as a traitor for leaving the ruling party elite, called the Revolutionary  Family. Cardenas continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of Salinas, and the  PRI is said to fear giving him a statewide power base.  </P> <P> But the cost of fraudulent elections could be high.  </P> <P> "It is very possible that electoral fraud could unleash violence that not even  the Cardenista leaders could stop," Zepeda Patterson, the university  researcher, said.  </P> <P> Even if the PRI were to win fairly a majority of the legislative seats, many of  the poor and semi-literate Cardenas supporters are not likely to believe it.  They do not trust the PRI government.  </P></p>

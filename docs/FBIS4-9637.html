			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gabor Juhasz: "Christian Democratic People's </F> Party: Changed Image; Faith, Hope, Origin"]    [Text] "Family, economy, social justice, and purity,"  proclaims the election watchword of the Christian Democratic  People's Party [KDNP], preparing to assume a governing role.  Indications are that the smallest coalition party of today is  trying to transcend its own shadow: The organization that has  always been a loyal follower of the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF] is increasingly underscoring its independence and its  people's party character.    "Everyone has a bitter taste in his mouth, not as a result  of  envy, but because of the apparent difference between law and  morality," KDNP chairman Laszlo Surjan said in his opening  campaign speech on 13 February in Szeged. He demanded that legal  order be based more on morality; these remarks pertained to the  sales transaction involving the headquarters building between  the MDF and Fidesz [Federation of Young Democrats]. The  unusually sharp statement by the chairman of today's smallest  coalition party, the minister of public welfare in both the  Antall and the Boross cabinets, indicates that the KDNP believes  that the party's four-year subordination in governance expires  in 1994. They hope that the elections in May will  redistribute--favorably, from KDNP's standpoint--the roles to be  played among the parties: i.e., that the KDNP remains a ruling  party and that its weight is going to be definitive in the new  coalition.    Doubtless, the KDNP is the only ruling party whose election  prospects have improved, as compared to the situation four years  ago. Most recent public opinion polls indicate that the KDNP's  popularity among voters regarded as certain to vote varies  between 4 and 5 percent (HETI VILAGGAZDASAG, 5 March 1994),  i.e., it barely surpasses the threshold limit applicable to  parties to be seated in parliament, the fact is that of the same  people questioned, the fewest number reject the KDNP from among  all the ruling parties. This year the KDNP's chances are also  better than they were in 1990, because they have, by now, made  up for the lag caused by their late start in 1990. The KDNP was  formed on 2 April 1989 (or, to be more accurate, it was  reorganized, because the KDNP regards itself as the successor to  Barankovics's Democratic People's Party, which, officially,  never ceased to exist); it ran in the 1990 elections with 3,200  members, and with no press of its own. (In those days, the MDF  had 21,000 dues-paying members, and the SZDSZ [Alliance of Free  Democrats] had 15,000.) One of the reasons for the delay in  reorganizing the KDNP was that the "veterans," including  then-party chairman Sandor Keresztes, the present ambassador to  the Vatican, did not believe for long in the possibility of  organizing a party, and pursued political discourse in a cover  organization called "Aron Marton Society," or, for that matter,  within the MDF. As a result of the delay, the KDNP was unable to  establish slates of candidates in five counties, and thus,  primarily in the southeastern part of the country, people could  not vote for the KDNP even if they wanted to. (Each of the other  five parties seated in parliament in 1990 ran 20 slates, but  while the KDNP acquired more than 10 percent of the vote in five  counties, FIDESZ managed to do the same in only three counties.)    The KDNP faces this year's elections with almost 30,000  members, and tries to introduce new, albeit familiar, faces in  the course of the campaign, along with Laszlo Surjan, who heads  the national slate. Most frequently mentioned are an active and  a former minister: Janos Latorcai, present minister of industry  and commerce, and Ferenc Rabar, an independent, who served as  the first finance minister of the Antall government, until his  resignation in late 1990. The KDNP is also endeavoring to make  up for its "lag in the media"; ongoing, detailed negotiations  pertain to conditions for PEST MEGYEI HIRLAP becoming a  newspaper under KDNP influence.    The election program was also adjusted, of course. This is  indicated by the change in the title of the program: The 1990  title (The Christian Way) was replaced by what has been a  chapter title: "We want a society centered around the human  being." According to the new program, the KDNP is "a party  having the character of a movement, based on the Christian  ideal, and with an independent, modern program." This definition  was amended by the words "democratic and patriotic people's  party" and "an organization independent from the churches." On  the other hand, as the title shows, four years ago the KDNP  emphasized that "a Christian outlook is the ideological  foundation of our party," although even then, they added that  "our party is not a `clerical' party."    The change in emphasis obviously represents an endorsement  of  the pragmatic policies Surjan followed for the past four years.  The minister of public welfare became a member of the KDNP's top  echelon, and then its leader only after the elections, moreover,  only after the government was formed, and only after the party  leadership of Sandor Keresztes and Emese Ugrin was let go in May  1990. The odd aspect of his party career is that based on  confidence in him manifested by Jozsef Antall, Surjan became a  minister before he became the leader of the party or a  representative, based on confidence expressed by the KDNP  membership (in March 1990 he ran third in an individual voting  district, and 15th on the party's national slate, and thus he  entered parliament in September 1990, inheriting Sandor  Keresztes's mandate after his ambassadorial appointment). The  top position at the KDNP appears to be stable; Sandor Keresztes,  who has been observing the events of the past years from the  Vatican, and who is going to return to Hungary for the  elections, ranks only fifth on the party's national slate.  Keresztes is preceded on the slate by party Chairman Surjan,  party Vice Chairman Laszlo Varga, Tibor Fuzessy, representative  and minister without portfolio, and by Janos Latorcai, minister  of industry and commerce. The secure positions of Surjan and his  team is indicated by the fact that radicals within the party,  such as Miklos Gaspar, Miklos Hasznos, and Miklos Palos, rank  ninth, 10th, and 12th on the KDNP's national slate.    Surjan visibly endeavored to tide over the past few years by  remaining loyal to the MDF as the "last satellite," while  showing his independence everywhere, especially in the form of  rhetoric. All this led to spectacular actions from time to time:  Most recently Representative Tamas Lukacs criticized the  government's privatization practice, and called it "unacceptable  to society," but the official KDNP position in this regard spoke  only about slowing down and the correction of mistakes. All this  mostly served the purpose of allowing the KDNP leadership to  once again try to prove to voters that it should not be held  responsible for the mistakes made in privatization, because,  based on the division of labor in government, the KDNP exercised  no authority with respect to privatization. (Undoubtedly,  however, the KDNP supported a "well-considered," "well thought  out" privatization program in 1990.)    Several other old theses, virtually forgotten during the  past  four years, have gained new emphasis in the new KDNP program.  For example, the KDNP returned to the principle of having the  president of the Republic chosen in direct elections (the KDNP  supported this alternative in the November 1989 popular  referendum, but it did not in July 1990, after the party became  part of the government); they regard an increased state role in  the economy as indispensable, recommend central economic  revitalization programs (the stimulation of enterprising,  increased investments), and support the idea of establishing a  peak economic ministry. A government under more forceful KDNP  influence would protect producers with state-imposed  restrictions (such as customs duties and quotas), according to  the KDNP program. Regarding arable land, the KDNP would not even  permit Hungarian-owned corporations domiciled in Hungary to  acquire ownership (only Hungarian citizens, local governments,  or the state would be entitled to do so), and the maximum limit  of privately owned land would be 300 hectares or 6,000 gold  crowns, (with no limit on the size or value of leased land).    Incidentally, due to events that transpired during the past  four years, it was the land program that needed the greatest  change, because four years ago the KDNP took the position that  lands owned by the state and by cooperatives be given to local  governments (and people from whom the land had been taken away,  could have reclaimed their land from the local governments). But  this concept no longer made sense as a result of the  compensation process. Nevertheless, an accounting of the  accomplishments, as presented in Laszlo Surjan's opening  campaign speech in Szeged, is flattering to the party: The KDNP  managed to implement 80 percent of its campaign promises. For  example, the party chairman made special mention of the fact  that autonomous local governments have come into being, and that  laws have been created concerning church property and the  minorities. At the same time, however, he also mentioned the  failure of "making inflation disappear quickly," and of reducing  state expenditures as some of the fiascos.    Based on four years of experience in governance, they  omitted  several theses from their program, which flow from "roots of  one's world view," but which nevertheless proved to be  unworkable in their original form. For example, they no longer  demand the "development of a state power and state organization  that corresponds with Christian ideals and the Christian world  view"; on the other hand, they demand the limitation of the  Constitutional Court's power (e.g., by removing its power to  declare a law null and void). An "abortion-free Hungary"  continues to be the declared goal of the KDNP, but by now,  partly due to disputes that have arisen regarding the abortion  law proposed by the KDNP party chairman and minister, they want  to accomplish this as a result of educational work molding  people's outlook, and they no longer talk about "preventing,  without delay," "the organized extinction" of already conceived  "Hungarian lives."</p>

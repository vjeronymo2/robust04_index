			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Clinton warned on dollar Japanese finance minister Yoshiro Hayashi yesterday said he had told President Clinton in Washington that the dollar must not plunge because it is a key global currency, Reuter adds. Mr Hayashi noted that in theory, a sharp decline in the dollar's value could undermine the stable world economy and cause inflation in the US. Mr Hayashi said Mr Clinton told him that sound US and Japanese economies should have a good impact and called for closer bilateral ties.</p>

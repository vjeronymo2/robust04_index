			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Paribas forecasts recovery Recovery at Paribas, one of France's leading banking groups, will accelerate this year as the economic climate improves, according to Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman. 'The first months of 1994 have confirmed that this year will mark a new step in the improvement of the group's results,' he told the annual general meeting in Paris yesterday. Paribas, like other French banks, came under intense financial pressure in the early 1990s. It reached its nadir in 1991 when it fell into the red for the first time, and was then dogged by a scandal over off-balance sheet share dealings at Ciments Francais, the French cement company in which it was a substantial investor. The group returned to the black in 1992 and increased its net profits in 1993, to FFr1.45bn (Dollars 257m) on operating income of FFr32.68bn. It made substantial profits last year from its currency trading operations, but had problems in the commercial property sector and was affected by the depressed state of the retail banking market. Mr Levy-Lang said Credit du Nord, the group's main retail banking subsidiary, had continued to experience problems in the opening months of 1994. He warned it was likely to incur an operating loss during the year, but said there was 'every reason to think' it would move back into the black in the future.</p>

Major projects under construction include seven power  plants,  five railway lines, three airports, 19 reservoirs, ten optical  cable and microwave lines, 200,000 program-controlled telephone  lines and six main roads, according to official sources.    One of the relatively underdeveloped provinces in China,  Jiangxi hopes to develop its economy through the development of  basic industries.    Last year the province invested 3.9 billion yuan, nearly 90  percent of the total capital construction funds, in basic 33  industrial projects.    According to official statistics, last year the province's  industrial output value increased by a record 20 billion yuan.    Meanwhile, the total output value created by rural  enterprises also hit a record of 58 billion yuan, up 92.2  percent from 1992.</p>

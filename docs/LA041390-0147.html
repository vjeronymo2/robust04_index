			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> LAW EMPOWERS CITY TO REMOVE FLYERS  </P> <P> The City Council passed an emergency ordinance this week that gives the city  the power to remove signs illegally placed on public utility poles and other  public property.  </P> <P> The vote Monday was considered an emergency measure because City Council runoff  elections are scheduled for May 8 in council Districts 1 and 3, officials said.  </P> <P> Seal Beach regulations already make the posting of bills anywhere other than on  private property illegal.  </P> <P> The new measure is designed to promote safety of public workers, drivers and  pedestrians, City Manager Robert Nelson said.  </P> <P> Mayor Victor S. Grgas said signs posted with nails and staples on utility poles  make it difficult for workers to scale the poles and can make their jobs more  hazardous.  </P> <P> "Signs placed in the roadway (also) may block the view of drivers or distract  the pedestrian or the driver from paying attention to their safety," Grgas  said.  </P> <P> A special provision was made in the ordinance to allow the staff to investigate  how the city can accommodate local real estate agents, who protested that the  sign laws hinder their ability to advertise properties for sale.  </P></p>

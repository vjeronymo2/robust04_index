Silva said Tamplin was  unfit to be tried as a juvenile because of his previous criminal history and a  record of failing to respond to rehabilitation. Tamplin also faces six counts  of attempted murder, four counts of robbery and five counts of assault with a  deadly weapon. He could face life imprisonment without parole.  </P></p>

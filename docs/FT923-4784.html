			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bulmer gains continental foothold with Belgian buy HP BULMER Holdings, which has 45 per cent of the UK cider market, has acquired Cidrerie Stassen, a Belgian branded cider company, for BFr414m (Pounds 7.2m). Stassen, based in Aubel, near the Dutch and German borders, recorded pre-tax profits of BFr39m in the year to August 1991 and had assets of BFr115m. Bulmer said the purchase, which will be funded from additional committed bank borrowings, was intended to increase its continental presence. Bulmer already exports cider to Greece, Spain and the US. But has been eager to obtain a foothold in the growing market on the Continent, where cider has been successfully marketed against beer as an alternative to wine. Belgian cider makers have been particularly successful in capitalising on the growth of the European cider market. Their exports have more than doubled over the last three years. Stassen, a family owned company, has expanded its product range in recent years by the addition of fruit-flavoured ciders to its traditional continental-style light cider. Mr John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive, said: 'With the single market fast approaching, the acquisition of Stassen provides a bridgehead for Bulmer's European initiative and for the development of high-quality ciders in the UK.' In the 12 months to April 24, Bulmer raised pre-tax profits by 19 per cent to Pounds 17.1m (Pounds 14.4m) on sales up 5 per cent to Pounds 221.9m.</p>

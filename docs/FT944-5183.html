			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Raised glasses should show a fair head - S&amp;N/Bass Two brewers' results this week will exemplify the industry's trends and investors' intentions. Scottish &amp; Newcastle, reporting today, has outperformed Bass, reporting on Wednesday, in both beer and stock markets. They share beer and leisure as their two main lines of business, but Scottish &amp; Newcastle has done better than Bass in both. The main factors behind a rise in its interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 145m from Pounds 109m are the acquisition of the Chef &amp; Brewer pub chain and expansion of its Center Parcs holiday villages. Brewing profits could be slightly ahead thanks to cost savings. Scottish &amp; Newcastle is not the darling of the sector, however. The speculation that it might pick up some or all of Courage is making investors cautious. Bass is expected to report a more modest rise in pre-tax profits for the year ended September to about Pounds 540m from Pounds 508m. Its brewing margins are likely to have slipped because of discounting and rationalisation costs while it has done well to hold volume in a market down about 1 per cent. Its pub estate has enjoyed a pick-up in profits, but it is less well-developed than some others in, for example, food. On the positive side, Holiday Inns has enjoyed rising occupancy and room rates, particularly in the US. Under firmer management, it is raising the standards of laggard hotels in its chain while expanding rapidly worldwide. The good news for investors is that Bass appears to be changing its tune slightly on beer. In the past its ambition was to defend its leading market share, currently 23 per cent. Heavy discounting, particularly against Courage, took a toll on profits. It still wants to be number one but it placed more emphasis on profits and brand development in its trading update two months ago.</p>

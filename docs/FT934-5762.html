			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / Finance and the Family: Rush is on for the BES - The latest issues Many sponsors and companies involved in business expansion schemes are urging people to invest before Tuesday's Budget because of speculation that chancellor Kenneth Clarke might decide to axe the BES immediately instead of December 31, as announced previously. But while it is in their interests to urge swift action, investors should make sure they get financial advice before acting; otherwise, they could find themselves regretting any hasty action. Budget fever has led some sponsors to increase their exit prices. The Allenbridge group, a leading BES analyst, says this should help keep up the price of new issues. Accumulus Froebel, a cash-backed, arranged exit scheme sponsored by Terrace Hill Capital, has raised its exit price from 120p to 124p after five years for every 100p invested. Terrace Hill says the return to a higher-rate taxpayer will increase from 14.1 per cent to 14.8 per cent a year as a result. The issue is almost fully subscribed. Neill Clerk, sponsor to St Anne's Residences, has also raised its exit price from 120p to 122p. However, sponsor Hodgson Martin which has launched St Andrews' Residences for the Scottish university, has dropped its exit price by 1p to 122p. The net return should be 14.3 per cent a year to a higher-rate taxpayer. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Downing Corporate Finance, which saw its Chiltern housing programme over-subscribed, has now launched a second issue. It aims to raise up to Pounds 5m for the housing association to provide homes at affordable rent to low income families. The exit price of 124p equates to 14 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer (the calculation of BES rates of return depend on a number of factors, such as when tax relief can be claimed). The scheme, fully cash-backed with a minimum investment of Pounds 2,000, is described by the British Taxpayers' Association, a tax consultant, as 'a top of the market, cash-backed, contracted exit for a worthy cause.' The Tenth Johnson Fry Cash-Backed scheme aims to raise Pounds 5m for Nottingham Trent University. The contracted exit price is 121p, equating to 13.7 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. The buy-back obligation is being secured by a certificate of deposit. Minimum investment is Pounds 3,000. Meanwhile, the Pounds 30m BES launched early this month by Nationwide building society and Merrill Lynch, the investment bank, has become fully subscribed. But another Pounds 30m is being raised to buy properties repossessed by Nationwide to be let on assured tenancies. The terms of the scheme are almost identical to the previous issue. Investors can choose a fixed return of 121p after five years for every 100p invested, equating to a compound annual return of 14.3 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. Alternatively, they can have a 60p minimum return plus 1.2p for every 1 per cent rise in the FT-SE 100. The return will be calculated from the level on the start date to the highest closing level during the five years, thereby locking-in the highest point. The index would have to rise by 51 per cent in order to beat the fixed return. Both returns are backed by certificates of deposit. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. Terrace Hill Capital and Neill Clerk are sponsors to South Eastern Recovery IV, a 'predator' BES which does not have a secured exit route but aims to profit from the still-depressed residential property market by buying now, letting to private tenants for five years, and then selling in the hope of a handsome profit. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000. Pavilions of Splendour is an estate agency specialising in unusual buildings. Its managing director, Marianne Watson-Smyth, is a former secretary of Save Britain's Heritage. It aims to raise Pounds 250,000 through the BES to market and sell Grade I or Grade II properties. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000.</p>

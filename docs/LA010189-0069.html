			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe by  delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the  European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had made the  traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged France's  11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying: "Only a  Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival Japan and  the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head before  the powers that dominate the world."  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Kundzins: "Latgale Does Not Want To Secede, </F> It Craves Development."]    [Text]We say very little about folks on the Latgale side,  and even then, as if we are observing them from the sidelines.  We would like to hear from the Daugavpils natives, themselves  --Valdis Lauskis, City Mayor, Anatolijs  Susko, President of the Latgale Joint-Stock Commercial  Bank, Janis Spagis, Chief of the Immigration  Department, Arturs Prieditis, State Language  Commission Chairman, and Inara Ostrovska, Director of  the Saules School. The discussion, which was moderated by the  editor of the "Lauku Avize", Voldemars Krustins,  started emotionally and about decentralization.    Valdis Lauskis: If there is talk about solving the  economic problem and the necessary loans, then, in all these  years, it has not gone beyond the Riga rayon. Control is held by  the administration, the Saeima, and this also applies to the  educational and cultural programs. But these are also essential  factors for the development of Latgale. Do we have any permanent  banks? Yes, a grand total of two. Where else do we see this?    An envoy arrives in Daugavpils and says: "I came because I  realized - Latvia is not only Riga." This was the realization  made by a particular state envoy, but our administration does  not realize this. The matter revolves around the fact that we  are asking for decentralization, not the creation of an  autonomous region. In addition -- there is financial  decentralization.    Disguised as reform, all of our financial strength is being  removed, or more precisely -- it is being turned over through  taxes on our profits, and we are told-- work! But we have  nothing to work with. The administration cannot provide us with  solutions to our problems of education, project development and  realization. Therefore, leave us the money, and we will find  solutions here on location -- that is the type of  decentralization we are asking for. We have been allowed to play  around a little with privatization, licensing, and the sale of  alcohol. But even that is being taken away from us, and we are  told that licenses will be issued in Riga, in collaboration with  the municipal governments. But they have forgotten about  collaboration and no money has been left for the municipal  governments.    We are not asking for a Ministry to be relocated here,  although that would not be such a bad idea with respect to  national development. Why couldn't we have, for example, the  Ministry of Economics, since there is a great industrial  potential concentrated here? We also have a good railway network.    A. Susko: Why haven't the deputies from our city  done anything in the Saeima?    V. Lauskis: I represent the Latgale Democratic  Party. We grew tired of waiting. Tell me, how much longer do we  wait before we are noticed and heard in Riga? That is why we  decided to think for ourselves. There are entire institutes  sitting around in Riga, and they cannot work out a program. They  need funding and also to operate in Latgale. But the experts are  not receiving money. Where are the plans being developed for  education, and other specific questions? If there are no plans,  there won't be any action. If Latvia doesn't have any plans,  then there won't be any for Latgale. In a comparison of our  region with other national regions, we have 20 percent less  investment -- this is according to the data from the Latvian  Development Agency. There is an entire list of specific  questions -- how many choral groups, how many Latvians, how many  national schools, what will receive financial support, what  priority does the Latgale language have in schools, etc. Is  someone considering this at present? This is why we are  exhibiting political activity, but there is no desire to secede  or become autonomous.    When Latvia was in the process of becoming an independent  nation in Kurzeme and Vidzeme, we, in Latgale, were living under  the rule of the Vitebsk province. And Latgale was the one to  come out for a unified nation of Latvia. Whose idea was it to  create the Saules school? Was it needed by the state? No, they  thought of it independently, and it was a good thing that there  were understanding people in the Ministry in Riga.    I. Ostrovska: We don't have funds, so it's a good  thing that the municipal government is helping. Yes, there is a  Latgale program -- we are starting to develop. This school was  founded in 1922, but it was closed in 1954 because it was too  nationalistic, and then reopened in 1992. It is one of the  oldest art schools in Latvia. We presented the proposal to the  Latgale program, but where is it? The school needs a great deal  of funding, so that we can serve our area. We are also receiving  students from Jekabpils, Preili, and Ludza, and the competition  is four applicants per one opening -- even more intense than for  the university. But they can't even show us the Latgale program.    V. Krustins: Daugavpils has a future in both  business development and in economic activities.    V. Lauskis: I think we have to change our status.  Is Daugavpils one of the provinces, or is it the second largest  city in the nation? That is the basic question. It must be  answered by everyone who lives here. We formed the Latgale  Democratic Party because it was one of the parties founded by  Francis Trasune. Seventy years have elapsed, and the attitudes  towards education, the church, the Latgale language have changed  profoundly.    V. Krustins: Our Russian language press emphasizes  that Daugavpils is a unique city, and that this unique character  must preserved. What do we interpret this uniqueness to be?    A. Susko: We still have the publication of "Soviet  Youth" -- "SY". Why? Daugavpils also has a newspaper called  "Dinaburga". Why -- because the Russians don't want to call the  city by its Latvian name. They specifically found a historic  name. These people, supposedly unintentionally, want to delay  the development process. Our city has the company "Vladlen"  --from the name Vladimir Lenin. People were also given such  names in the nineteen twenties -- Vladlen, Vilen, Viulen. But  this company was formed recently. When its owner came to the  bank, I asked him -- are you preparing to work, or to scare  people? He answered -- who knows, but that name is sacred to me.  And, as long as it remains sacred to him, we will be unable to  move forward.    V. Krustins: These activities can be stopped by  the entrepreneurs, since they need your money to thrive. You  shouldn't despair, just provide support.    V. Lauskis: Up to 1990, Daugavpils was faring very  well. This was a good training ground for the cadre. People came  to the city, went through the "Lokomotive" plant, on to the  Communist Party committee, and into the Ministry. They were  living high off the hog. When the government was chased out in  1991, a vacuum was created. Loyal forces were forming in spots,  but there were no longer any connections. We are fighting for a  change in any way we can. If we could receive concrete support  from the top down, then it would be much simpler -- we could get  out of the crisis, deal with the Russian "Dvinskies".    If the state wants the press to be active, then the  administration should personally provide financial support for  publishing a newspaper. If this is not done, then this region  will be lost. We created our own television and radio, and the  government took away all of the resources. We cannot get any  financial support for anything through the budget. The loyal  forces, which we represent here, are being further taxed by the  circulation tax for last year. And we have no one to sue in  court. We, the loyal forces that stand and fall for Latvia, must  sue the Saeima or the Cabinet of Ministers!    V. Krustins: Mr. Lauskis, you elected the Saeima.  Isn't anyone there from Latgale?    V. Lauskis: Show me the legal state organ that can  help solve this financial problem! On what basis did the Cabinet  of Ministers take away 643,000 lats from the city budget? Who  should we complain to? We don't have a constitutional court.  Providenko can voice complaints, but I have to keep silent. And  yet, I can't keep quiet -- if just by writing something.    V. Krustins: We are hearing from all sides that  the administration is destroying culture, education, industry,  the ballet -- everything. Now you are saying that the  administration also wants to silence Daugavpils, since you  didn't use the word "destroy". Aren't we piling too much on the  administration? I don't believe that Birkavs wants to harass  anyone.    V. Lauskis: The administration doesn't have any  money. Thus, I can't get any money from them, nor can I hold on  to what I have.    A. Susko: The manager or entrepreneur must see  results. You can't just keep taking their profits away. If he  knew that such and such would remain for him, then it would be  worth the effort. Taxes are around 80 percent in Israel, and  still the country is thriving.    V. Lauskis: There is a great deal we could do. The  land is fertile for various applications, which should be noted,  and the same is true for industry. There is Ventspils, which is  sitting on a petroleum pipeline.    V. Krustins: Daugavpils is just like Ventspils,  but on dry land. Where could you find a more convenient location?    V. Lauskis: Forgive me, but there is a major  difference right now. We must restore the proper order of  yesterday, but it is desirable that this be a joint effort.  Where is the investment in industry? In shipbuilding, there is  no need to wonder, since their salaries are five times higher  than ours. Petroleum goes to Ventspils, but for us, everything  was orientated towards the East. Reorientation requires a  longer period of time. If Mr. Birkavs would familiarize himself  with the documents he has in front of him, he would see that  already over one year ago the German side presented a proposal  for the reconstruction of the airport. Four times we asked that  the proposal be evaluated. The state does not recognized  Daugavpils.    J. Spagis: Does the state have a grudge against  Daugavpils for some reason? Maybe they have some complaints. I  have some. Maybe we have earned such an attitude. Most of the  managers in the manufacturing plants have not been replaced.  Riga doesn't like that.    What do you in Daugavpils think -- that we will make  investments and give you subsidies, if there are others more  deserving than you? Lembergs is talented and has earned it. If  we are crying about how we are forgotten, then there are many  points on which we deserve to be. Who should receive these  investments, Providenko? I know where he stands on the ballot,  and the press supports him. But he has an achilles heel, and we  will get to it -- the Latvian National Independence Movement.    People are being tested for their knowledge of the language.  I turned to Mr. Lauskis, thinking -- he, as a teacher, would  best understand. We have a student production line -- a major  railway technical school with 900 students. And do you know what  happens there? With the help of certain Daugavpils natives, they  are continuing along in the old spirit -- Latvian language  studies are ignored, Leninism in being taught. The military  wives are the teachers. Going into a savings bank, you will only  hear "what" in Russian. I don't know, Mr. Prieditis, where you  pay for your public services, but as being responsible for  promoting the state language, you should be upset, because no  inroads have been made into the attitude towards language in the  city. Our people are calling me and asking if I have read  Prieditis' response in the newspaper to the complaints by the  National Front members. If this is the attitude, then subsidies  in Riga, as well, should only be paid after the job is  completed. And that is only one instance.    V. Krustins: The discussion has drifted away from  economic matters. The banker has not yet had a chance to speak.    A. Susko: If people are saying that they are  oppressed and cannot get into the Saeima because they don't know  the language, then I am indignant. What good is a person in  parliament, if, because of language, he cannot become actively  involved in the work. I wish to help those who want to work.  When someone comes to me, I can already see from the hands who  needs the thousand for a tractor so that he doesn't lose what he  has started, and who wants to "do business". I would never give  200,000 dollars to some risky venturer. I wouldn't even give it  to Providenko, because I know his destructive politics. On the  other hand, there are entrepreneurs, like Locs, Pocs, Ambainis,  and others, who are truly working for the good of Latvia. Right  now, a problem has come up that there is no one to receive the  loans. I could get 100, even 500 million dollars, but I need the  administration's guarantee. And I also need guarantees that I  will get back the money loaned. Unfortunately, there are many of  those who will not return the money. Worldwide, banks plan on  writing off loses of 3 to 5 percent.    V. Krustins: How many borrowers do you have? Seven?    A. Susko: Not much more than that.    V. Krustins: So, the Latgale Bank has a few  million kicking around?    A. Susko: We are not exactly on the verge of  failure. If this was a free market zone, then there wouldn't be  a problem with where to put the money. There is now a lack of  people active in business who would be able to borrow a good sum  of money.    V. Lauskis: There is a whole category of people  who are not unwilling, but are unable to pay back the money.  State policies also have to get involved. When the borders are  properly regulated, then, within six months, the policies will  change both here and in Russia. More precise legislative actions  are needed. We should know what we will be dealing with at least  three or four years for now.    As recorded by A.

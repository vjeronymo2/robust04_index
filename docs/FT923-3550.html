			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Observer: Travellers' tales So what subject aroused the keenest discussion in yesterday's meeting of Britain's cabinet - the first since the summer vacation? Not the recession, nor even the turmoil on the foreign exchange markets, Observer's mole advises. True, Norman Lamont explained his strategy for beating off the currency speculators. But his recital excited no more than nods of assent and murmured hear-hears when John Major congratulated the chancellor. The hot topic was what the assembled company had done on their holidays. It turned out that the great bulk of them had visited France and wanted to air their personal judgments of the Maastricht referendum campaign. But not even Euro-sceptic Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, was bold enough to suggest that their personal straw polls pointed to a No vote. Instead, the general consensus was that President Mitterrand could count on a narrow victory. The only one to venture that the result would be a resounding Yes was William Waldegrave, and he hadn't been to France. The name of the minister who then spoilt the fun by reminding the cabinet of the entirely unexpected humiliation of President de Gaulle in the late 1960s must sadly remain anonymous.</p>

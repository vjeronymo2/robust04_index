			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Black Sea beckons Greek Cypriots A PLAN for Cyprus to help develop the Krasnodar region of Russia, on the Black Sea, is an unprecedented challenge for the growing number of Greek Cypriot companies working in former Soviet-bloc countries. A joint Russian-Cypriot development agency should be operating by summer in Krasnodar, capital of a territory with 4.8m people. The area includes Novorossysk, largest Russian port on the Black Sea, and the tourist centre of Sochi. Mr George Vassiliou, the Cyprus president, who speaks Russian and is backed by the island's strong Communist party, suggested the project to former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev more than five years ago. Mr Vassiliou, once a marketing and management consultant, believes an agreement signed last October with President Boris Yeltsin can provide a secure framework for long-term trade and foreign investment. 'The most frustrating thing for a foreign businessman in Moscow is the maze of bureaucracy, itself not certain what it can do,' he says. 'Under this arrangement, Cyprus will support the local government in Krasnodar with approval from the centre. It will be possible to avoid Moscow.' Greek Cypriot consultants will set up a legal framework for foreign investment in Krasnodar, organise training for local officials and make economic and feasibility studies for development projects. The agency will have a branch office in Cyprus, financed by the Cypriot government. Greek Cypriot companies already have a lot of trading experience in eastern Europe. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Greek Cypriot lawyers and accountants have been helping Russian clients set up offshore companies on Cyprus. Greek Cypriot travel companies are already showing interest in developing tourism in Krasnodar. But Mr Vassiliou's larger purpose is for Cyprus to become a gateway for west European and US investors in south Russia. Next month, the Cyprus Telecommunications Authority (CYTA), the state telecoms monopoly, will open a satellite phone link with Moscow as the first stage in improving communications with Krasnodar. Under CYTA's agreement with the Space Research Institute in Moscow and Astra, a state-owned company that has taken over a former military telecommunications satellite, 60 international lines will be added to the Russian network, to be routed through an earth station on Cyprus. 'This may not sound like a big step forward until you consider that the whole of the former Soviet Union may have had fewer than 1,000 international lines - compared with 2,000 on Cyprus,' says Mr Adam Kritiotis, CYTA assistant general manager. Russia's communications ministry has decided Cyprus is to be one of two big 'teleports' linking it with the rest of the world. By the time the development agency is set up, Krasnodar will be one of a dozen Russian cities whose international connections pass through the Astra satellite and the Cyprus earth stattion. In the next three years, CYTA plans to reinforce the satellite link with Russia through a Dollars 25m project to lay a submarine cable to Krasnodar across the Black Sea from Bulgaria. The connection with Cyprus would be made through an existing fibre-optic cable network across Bulgaria and a submarine cable from Greece.</p>

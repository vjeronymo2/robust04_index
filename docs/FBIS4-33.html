			<p>SUMMARY:       Both the South Korean and Chinese press confirm a  growing Korean surplus in bilateral trade, although there is some  question as to the exact magnitude of the trade imbalance.  Press  sources attribute the surplus to structural differences in the two  countries' foreign trade regimes.  Bilateral investment has been  hampered by problems in China's investment environment and is  currently dominated by the ROK.  To address the situation, the press  suggests that China adjust its export mix and the type of investment  it attracts, while South Korean firms focus more on participating in  China's market.      Recent articles in the South Korean and Chinese press discuss  basic structural problems that are contributing to the growing  imbalance in bilateral merchandise trade and limiting the scope of  bilateral investment.  The articles also suggest several measures to  address the problems.   Trade      South Korea ran a $2.31 billion trade surplus with China in 1993,  according to statistics published in the 2 February issue of Seoul  SILMUL KYONGJE, the journal of the Korea Institute for Industrial  Economics and Trade.  (Official Chinese customs statistics as cited  by China Economic Information report this figure as $2.5 billion.)  SILMUL KYONGJE predicted that in 1994 South Korea will enjoy a  bilateral trade surplus of $3.86 billion, with exports to China  projected at $8.73 billion and imports at  $4.87 billion.      By contrast, Korea Trade Promotion Association statistics as  cited in the 27 February Beijing JINGJI CAKKAO BAO are much lower,  putting South Korea's 1993 trade surplus with China at $1 billion,  with South Korea exporting $4.8 billion to the PRC and importing  $3.8 billion.  Furthermore, the association projects a 1994  bilateral trade imbalance of only $2.1 billion in favor of South  Korea, with ROK exports to the PRC expected to total $6.6 billion  and imports from the PRC $4.5 billion.      Articles from both the Chinese and South Korean press have  attempted to analyze the causes of the bilateral trade imbalance.  According to the 9 February Seoul CHUGAN MAEGYONG, a business  weekly, the trade imbalance is a result of Chinese products being  diverted to domestic markets instead of export markets, of large-  scale foreign investment in the PRC, increased plant imports by  foreign-funded PRC firms, and lower PRC import tariffs.      An article in the February Beijing GUOJI MAOYI WENTI, the  University of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade monthly, however,  pointed to basic inequities in the composition of bilateral trade as  contributing to China's growing deficit.  For example, the PRC  monthly noted four categories of processed products--fiber products,  chemical products, iron, steel and metal products, and electronic  products--account for 90 percent of ROK exports to China, while four  categories of mainly primary commodities--agricultural products,  mineral products, nylon products, and chemicals--account for 85  percent of Chinese exports to South Korea.  The 2 February SILMUL  KYONGJE also indicated that growth in Chinese exports to South Korea  has been at a standstill since 1991 precisely because ROK demand for  these imports has plateaued.      The December issue of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and  Economic Cooperation journal, GUOJI MAOYI, noted that another factor  in the trade imbalance is the trend to shift ROK labor-intensive  industries to China, which necessitates large-scale imports by the  PRC of equipment and raw materials for processing.  SILMUL KYONGJE  also pointed out that most ROK investment in China has centered  around manufacturing industries--such as textiles and footwear-  -which have lost competitiveness in South Korea.      The February GUOJI MAOYI WENTI article also mentioned the lack of  competitiveness of Chinese products and limited access to ROK  markets as other causes of the bilateral trade imbalance.  Not only  are prices of Chinese products becoming less competitive as Chinese  domestic labor prices rise, these exports still cannot measure up to  ASEAN exports in terms of quality, packaging, and other non-price  factors.  Furthermore, "overly low" domestic prices in the past have  led to "over exporting" of certain commodities to South Korea, and,  in response, South Korea has raised tariffs and adopted other  measures to limit Chinese imports in order to protect its domestic  industries.  The lack of ROK market access, according to the  article, contrasts with China's efforts to open its own markets and  drop tariffs in preparation for entry into GATT.      The 11 January Seoul HANGUK ILBO discussed the possible impact of  China's currency and financial reforms on ROK exports.  China's  recent unification and devaluation of its currency is expected to  strengthen the price competitiveness of Chinese goods in overseas  markets for which both ROK and Chinese goods compete.  Furthermore,  the paper noted that, while these reforms bring China's trading  system closer to international norms, and thus may increase its  exports in general, they will also likely curb PRC imports.  Chinese  currency devaluation and the imposition of a higher VAT and a new  consumption tax will act as a "double trap" for South Korean exports  to the PRC.  However, ROK firms in China who manufacture for export  will see their price competitiveness improve.   Investment      Bilateral investment is very one-sided, according to press  reports from both countries.  An article in the December issue of  GUOJI MAOYI cited 1992 bilateral investment figures showing that, as  of the end of 1992, South Korea had invested in 259 projects in  China, with investments valued at $159 million.  These figures  contrast sharply with Chinese investments of only $4.86 million in  South Korea.  Furthermore, ROK investment continues to increase.  According to SILMUL KYONGJE, ROK direct investment in China totaled  $213.6 million  (26 projects) in 1992, some $507 million (550  projects) from January through November 1993 and is expected to  reach $875.4 million (970 projects) in 1994.      In addition, GUOJI MAOYI claimed that a generally poor investment  environment in the Bohai region--including the two provinces of  Shandong and Liaoning, which account for 75 percent of ROK  investment--is responsible for the "decreased enthusiasm" of ROK  investors targeting China.  The investment environment is marred by  low productivity, poor discipline, high turnover of Chinese workers,  and an "over-concentration" of investment zones in Shandong and  Liaoning, according to the journal.      Moreover, these negative aspects of the PRC investment  environment have been exacerbated by the high concentration of ROK  investment in China's labor-intensive processing industries, which  accounted for 90 percent of ROK investment in the first half of  1992. South Korean investors have also favored small and medium-  sized projects with quick returns.  GUOJI MAOYI indicated that the  average size of ROK investment projects on the Shandong peninsula as  of the end of 1992 was $750,000.  SILMUL KYONGJE reported that the  average size of ROK direct investment projects in China was $800,000  in 1992, rose to $1.4 million in 1993, and is projected to drop to  $900,000 in 1994.      SILMUL KYONGJE also cautioned that the higher cost of imported  raw materials and labor deriving from PRC currency devaluation will  affect ROK firms' production activities in China.  In the long run,  SILMUL KYONGJE expects to see large-scale ROK investment aimed at  China's domestic market rather than the traditional export-oriented  investment that takes advantage of low wages to produce labor-  intensive goods.   Suggestions      Both of the Chinese think tank journals outlined steps China can  take to improve its trade deficit with South Korea.  The February  GUOJI MAOYI WENTI article, for example, maintained that China cannot  equalize the trade imbalance by simply increasing the quantity of  its exports to South Korea.  It must also increase the per-unit  value of exports.  The article went on to suggest increasing exports  of technology-intensive products such as electronics and machine  parts.  The December GUOJI MAOYI article cited two other areas of  possible export growth--microcomputers and numerically controlled  machine tools--in which China is already competitive on the world  market.  It further recommended that specialized Chinese  organizations conduct pricing and consumer research in South Korea  and pass the information to Chinese enterprises so that they can  tailor their prices and products to the ROK market.  On the  noncommodity trade front, GUOJI MAOYI WENTI noted that South Korea  is an excellent market for Chinese labor exports, especially for  laborers from nearby Shandong, Hebei, and Liaoning provinces while  GUOJI MAOYI proposed targeting ROK conglomerates to invest in  projects worth over $10 million or ceding equity in cash-strapped  Chinese companies to ROK conglomerates to attract capital.  GUOJI  MAOYI called for encouraging investment in finance, commerce,  tourism, and real estate while discouraging investment in projects  that are energy- or capital-intensive or that produce rough-wrought  products with little value-added content.      As for indirect investment, GUOJI MAOYI suggested attracting ROK  mutual funds and even setting up a "Bohai Start-Up Fund" to be  issued directly in the ROK.  GUOJI MAOYI also stressed the  importance of encouraging ROK investment in technology-intensive  industries, such as machinery and electronics, chemical, and  automobile industries.  The journal further recommended that China  trade market share for capital and technology and that commodities  from ROK-invested enterprises could "take the place of imports" or  fill gaps in domestic production.      South Korean publications have stressed the importance of  upgrading investment in China and managing the bilateral trade  relationship well.  CHUGAN MAEGYONG noted that China's economic  reforms will give less preference to foreign investors and foreign-  invested firms in the future and suggested that ROK firms could  benefit from breaking away from investments focused on using China's  cheap labor and raising their image and participation in the local  market through technological investments.  The business weekly  recommended that ROK firms increase their investment in  transportation, real estate, and social infrastructure markets in  order to expand their exports, profits, and opportunities.  SILMUL  KYONGJE advocated big increases in large-scale investments targeting  the domestic Chinese market and noted that ROK investment has moved  recently into cement, automobiles, machinery, petrochemicals, and  other capital-intensive sectors.      SILMUL KYONGJE commented that, as South Korea's trade surplus  with China continues to expand, adjusting the bilateral trade  imbalance will become an issue.  To reduce this friction, South  Korea must work to balance exports to China with imports from that  country.  At the same time, competition for markets in the United  States, Japan, and the EU will become "even more heated."  China is  already revising aspects of its foreign trade system that act as  stumbling blocks to its participation in the global market.  These  reforms, coupled with future GATT membership, would further  strengthen China's competitiveness.  For this reason, the journal  deemed South Korea's prospects for exports to developed countries as  not all that bright, even if there is economic recovery in those  countries.

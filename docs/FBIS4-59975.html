			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says he does not  accept the clarifications of PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat that he  was referring to a peaceful jihad during his controversial  address at a mosque in Johannesburg earlier this month. Rabin  says 'Arafat's explanation is far-fetched. Rabin says the  episode is making the process with the Palestinians more  difficult and will continue to do so in the future.</p>

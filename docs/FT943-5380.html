			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / International Press Review: Caution on bridging the divide - Ireland Germany's editorial writers were given a wonderful opportunity to proffer advice to the British and Irish governments following the IRA's decision to bring in a ceasefire. After all, Germany actually went through the experience of unification five years ago. But the commentators opted for caution. Perhaps they were reluctant to explain to Dublin how, despite a common language, German unification has created internal economic, psychological and social divisions. There was little editorial dissension across the political spectrum. The leader writers agreed that the response by the British government to the ceasefire was crucial for determining the future development of the peace process. 'The peace prospects now depend on the Unionists and the British government,' wrote the left-wing Frankfurter Rundschau. The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung went further. In its editorial, the paper blamed the British government for failing to cope with the IRA, but added that the IRA had failed in its attempts to get London to stop protecting Northern Ireland. The FAZ returned to the subject a day later, arguing that 'the IRA has manoeuvred the British government into a situation of imponderables. London cannot allow the impression to be created that violence has led to the goal (for peace).' The liberal Suddeutsche Zeitung settled for scepticism. 'The prospects for a permanent peace settlement could be illusory,' the paper warned. It was left up to the small Nordbayerischer Kurier, based in Bayreuth, to use the ceasefire to reflect on other ethnic and political conflicts throughout the world. It speculated that if a solution in Northern Ireland was possible, would it be too much to expect that one day 'the Kurds and the Turks would sit at the same table, the Chinese would grant independence to Tibet, and North and South Korea might be reunited. Nothing is impossible.' But, in South Korea, the coverage of the breakthrough was particularly low-key in contrast to the copious coverage that the South Korean media gave to the civil war in the recently united Yemen earlier this year. This event was considered a warning about problems that Korea could confront if unification is achieved between North and South Korea. The South Korean media's routine coverage of the Irish story may be explained by the fact that its attention was focused on the diplomatic moves last week that could determine the fate of the Korean peninsula. The US had agreed to a meeting in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang to discuss the establishment of diplomatic relations and China gave its support to a North Korean proposal for a peace treaty with the US that could eventually lead to the removal of US troops from South Korea. Irish-Americans divided between those who foresaw the almost immediate unification of northern and southern Ireland - in five or perhaps ten years  -and those who believed the British government would merely seek to exploit the IRA ceasefire for tactical advantage. Many third and fourth generation Irish-Americans are shaky on the details of the Irish conflict. A good proportion believe that Catholics make up the majority in the north, but they are unwavering in their determination that the British must go. But one general assumption, expressed by commentators on radio and television shows last week, is that the British people are tired enough of haemorrhaging cash and casualties in Northern Ireland that they are only too eager to withdraw. And leaders of one Irish-American lobby group after another hurried to give the credit to President Bill Clinton for encouraging the peace process along by his decision to grant a visa earlier this year to Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein leader. Newspaper editorialists were more enthusiastic in their response to the news of the IRA ceasefire, though careful to warn that it was only a first step. The New York Times, under the headline 'Hope Reborn in Northern Ireland', hailed the move as 'a breakthrough - and things ought to go very badly for any faction that shatters this yearned-for ceasefire'. The paper concluded: 'In short, the permafrost seems finally to be heaving.' The Washington Post, while sharing the view that Mr Clinton deserved much of the credit, was more cautious on the future prospects. 'The ceasefire, a culmination of years of effort, is only a beginning. But if it holds it will be seen as the breakthrough concession that made real peace possible,' the Post said.</p>

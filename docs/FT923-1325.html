			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Mr Kohl's task GIVEN THE turmoil in the currency markets, Mr Helmut Kohl's meeting with Mr Francois Mitterrand to discuss the fate of the Maastricht treaty for a European union looks like a case of rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic. But there is a difference: Mr Kohl is at least nominally in charge of the iceberg. Is he able to change the course set by Bonn? Yesterday's announcement that German broad money - the figure targeted by the Bundesbank - grew at an annual rate of 9 per cent between the last quarter of 1991 and August 1992 was a shock. The figure, up sharply from July's 8.5 per cent, was both well above average expectations for an increase of 8.1 per cent and still further above the target growth of 5.5 per cent for the year. With annual inflation widely forecast to be 3.4 per cent in September, little suggests the Bundesbank will be easing again in the near, or even the more distant, future. The D-Mark has gained an effective trade-weighted appreciation of 2.3 per cent since the beginning of last week, which will please the Bundesbank. It has seen the ERM tree shaken and the Italian lira and sterling fall off. The Spanish peseta has fallen onto a lower branch, while other currencies are little more secure. The ERM is, in effect, a casualty of the Bundesbank's war against what it sees as a profligate German government. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, has made supportive remarks about the French franc. But these do not ensure a change in the Bundesbank's behaviour, since it regards the immediate monetary consequences of the DM 60bn (Pounds 24bn) in foreign exchange intervention mounted this month with great distaste. France may yet be driven to raise interest rates in a bid to defend the franc. Is the Bundesbank satisfied? Probably not. The German central bank is determined to prevent a German credit explosion. It knows that many criticise its targeting of broad money. But the Bundesbank has good reason to trust its judgment over that of its critics and will continue with its policies so long as credit grows so quickly. In the longer term, credit growth will slow. American experience in the 1980s with a not dissimilar combination of loose fiscal and tight monetary policies suggests that the German exchange rate will ultimately depreciate. A real depreciation of the D-Mark may also be required if east German labour is to be re-employed. But considerable discomfort is bound to remain in the short to medium term. Responsibility for the discomfort lies mainly with Bonn's fiscal policies. The rhetoric of the German government in favour of European political and economic union has been matched by its indifference to the consequences for Europe of its policies to deal with German unification. Until the German government closes this gap, the project for European union will continue to drift towards the iceberg, whatever initiatives Mr Kohl may devise with Mr Mitterrand.</p>

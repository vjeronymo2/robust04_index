			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Inci Tanriover video report from New York] </F>   [Text] In New York, Murat Karayalcin, state minister and  deputy prime minister, issued the message that the struggle  against terrorism will continue. Karayalcin explained that  terrorism cannot be surmounted solely through measures to be  adopted within Turkey and that certain measures must also be  introduced outside the country.    In a news conference at the end of his contacts in New York,  Karayalcin replied to questions, explaining that there is no  water problem between Turkey and Syria. This issue is being  exaggerated by foreign sources, he said.    [Begin Karayalcin recording] It is not appropriate to weigh  the water and terrorism issues together. This is not compatible  with goodneighborly relations. Turkey has never considered  depriving its neighboring countries of water. If, however,  someone tries to link water with terrorism, then we will give  them the necessary response. [end recording]    Karayalcin noted that it cannot be said that Turkey has  brought its relations with all its neighbors to the necessary  level on the subject of fighting terrorism. He expressed the  hope, nevertheless, that the decisions adopted by certain  countries against the terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan]  organization will yield fruit.    In reply to a question, Karayalcin expressed the view that  the local elections to be held on 27 March are historically  important. The developments concerning the candidates clearly  demonstrate this, Karayalcin declared, adding that deputies are  submitted as mayoral candidates for the first time in Turkey's  political history.    Karayalcin also attended the dinner hosted by the Federation  of Turkish-U.S. Associations, where he delivered a speech. In  his speech, the deputy prime minister recounted that Turkey and  the United States fought shoulder to shoulder during the Korean  War, the Cold War, and the Gulf war and established a strong  relationship. Karayalcin said that today, too, the two countries  are determined to pursue a close partnership in the defense and  security, economic and commercial, as well as cultural and  social fields.    Karayalcin will proceed to Washington today. He will hold a  meeting with U.S. Vice President Al Gore later in the evening.</p>

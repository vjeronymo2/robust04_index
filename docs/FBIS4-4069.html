			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, April 27 (CNS)--The Guangdong provincial  government has decided to make 50 million kilograms of reserved  grain available in the market in order to keep the price under  control and to make room for storage of summer grain crop.    The Guangdong government has since late last year  implemented  the instruction given by the state to stabilize grain and oil  prices to guarantee supply which was generally in a stablestate  across the province. The grain stock was so abundant that the  price was kept at about RMB [renminbi] 100 for every 50  kilograms of rice. As now is a time when the rural grain supply  is temporarily in short supply and the summer grain crop is  about to be put into storage, the provincial government decided  to fill the market with 50 million kilograms of reserved grain  to ensure an adequate food supply while 250 million kilograms of  grain allocated by the state to the province isalso in place in  the market.</p>

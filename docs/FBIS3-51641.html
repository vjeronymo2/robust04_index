Congress participants want to meet with the president of  the National Assembly so he can formally record this  three-member government. Jean Luckenson's report follows.    [Begin recording] [Luckenson] A government of public  security was established on 20 January at 1600 by resolution of  the the Congress for National Salvation held at the National  Theater by the Group of the Great North 18 to 20 January. The  three named to lead this government were Raoul Kenol, a lawyer  representing Artibonite Department; Charles Plaisimond, an  industrialist representing the Department of the West; and Louis  Toussaint, judge at the Court of Appeals in Cap-Haitien. The  congressmen spoke on behalf of the deputies and senators of the  45th Legislature. [passage omitted]    Before the members of the government of public security  went to the parliament to meet with Chamber of Deputies  President Frantz Robert Monde, congress Secretary General Herve  Leveille stated that they are strong; they will block the  country and prevent everybody from working if the parliament  disagrees.    [Leveille] If [the parliamentarians] do not accept [the  two resolutions we adopted], we will block the country. We are  now going to the parliament so it can adopt them.    [Unidentified journalist] Mr. Leveille, what will you do in  the event the parliament refuses?    [Leveille] We will know what to do. We will know what to do.  [repeats]    [Journalist] Is it a revolutionary solution?    [Leveille] [words indistinct] to handle certain things  carefully.    [Journalist] Do you have the support of the Army? Do  you have the support of the Army?    [Leveille] The Army is an institution in the service of the  people. The Army is not an institution....    [Luckenson] You say you will block the country if the  parliament does not agree [with your resolutions]. Will you tell  us how?    [Leveille] With force. We can block the country.    [Luckenson] What strategic means will you use?    [Leveille] We will block the roads.    [Luckenson] A few minutes later, the members of the new  government of public security, made up of political  personalities hostile to President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's  return to power in Haiti, accompanied by the forces of order,  went to the parliament while over a dozen men and women  demonstrated their opposition to President Aristide and the  international community. Upon their arrival at the parliament,  the members of the government of public security were received  at the diplomatic lounge of the Legislative Palace while the  secretary general of the Chamber of Deputies [as heard] was  taking steps to get in touch with the president, Frantz Robert  Monde, who said that they will look into this issue in the next  few days, [especially] at the reopening session of the Chamber  of Deputies if a quorum is reached on 25 January:    [Monde] Only the unity of the sons of the homeland can save  this country, which is in an acute and very delicate crisis. We  said and we repeat: Your file will be read and entrusted to a  special committee; the parliament will give its verdict with  confidence and as soon as possible. [passage omitted]    [Luckenson] We should tell you that two resolutions  have been adopted. The first contains three [number as heard]  points: safeguarding national sovereignty, condemning the  embargo, reinforcing the public institutions, and restoring the  authority of the state. The second resolution establishes the  government of public security. Several political personalities,  including Professor Hubert De Ronceray [leader of Mobilization  for National Development], Montalvo Despeignes [former minister  without portfolio under the Nerette-Honorat government], the  Reverend Richard Vladimir Jeanty [leader of the Haitian Party of  God], Jean-Claude Roy [leader of the Union of Haitian  Constitutionalists], former Agriculture Minister Jacques Baker,  and Carl Denis [of the National Coalition] were present.

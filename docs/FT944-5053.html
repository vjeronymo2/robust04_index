			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Bail for three in fraud hearing A senior Barclays Bank official and two other men, all accused of attempting a multi-million pound bank fraud, were remanded on bail at City of London magistrates court yesterday. Mr Guy Wheeler, of Gonalston, Nottinghamshire, who supervises seven Barclays Bank branches, was remanded on bail of Pounds 25,000 until May 19 next year. He appeared alongside property developer Mr John Doherty, of Morpeth Terrace, Victoria, London, and Mr Maurice O'Leary, of Bexleyheath, south London. All three are charged with conspiring together on or before December 2 1994 to defraud financial institutions by inducing them to believe that a forged bank guarantee supposedly issued by a Barclays branch in Derby, was genuine. The magistrates also ordered Mr Wheeler to live at his recorded address, surrender his passport, not apply for any travel documents and not contact witnesses or either of his co-defendants. Mr Doherty was remanded on Pounds 50,000 bail and Mr O'Leary on Pounds 10,000 bail on the same conditions, as well as having to report twice weekly to police.</p>

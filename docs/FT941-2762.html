			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Survey of Poland (19): Doubling connections - Telecommunications Successive Polish governments since 1989 have recognised that improving the country's telecommunications system is central to the chances of attracting foreign investment and economic growth. To pay for a better service in future telephone charges have been forced upwards, giving Telekomunikacja Polska (TP SA), the state-owned operator, a 70 per cent profit margin from which to finance development and supplement World Bank loans and supplier credits. The present centre-left government appears set on continuing this policy with Mr Andrzej Zielinski, the new telecommunications minister, confirming his predecessor's aim to have 10m lines installed by the end of the century, double the present lineage. Mr Jerzy Stopczyk, TP SA's investment manager, recognises that even if his company were to slow its investment efforts private operators would step in to fill the gap. 'The rapid growth of the past few years has got people used to the idea that telephones are accessible and they will go elsewhere if we don't provide them,' he says. Already some 70 licences have been issued to mainly small local private projects which have yet to become operational. But RP Telekom, a company working with Sprint of the US, is forging ahead on plans to provide a private service in Pila and in Katowice in the first significant challenge to the state-owned operator. Meanwhile, TP SA plans to invest Dollars 600m this year on the installation of 680,000 lines and around the same number is planned for 1995. Recent capital investment has already improved international connections significantly and by the end of this year the inter-city network, the country's present communications nightmare, should be two-thirds complete. Previous governments consciously chose a policy of restricting the number of equipment suppliers to three - AT&amp;T from the US and Alcatel and Siemens from Europe. These were then forced not only to buy ailing Polish telecommunications equipment plants but also to produce half of the equipment to be supplied to TP SA locally. Mr Stanislaw Szuder, the head of AT&amp;T Telfa which has an agreement to supply the Gdansk district with 230,000 lines, says he is happy with the arrangement and confident the deal will go ahead. Private financing from abroad for the project worth Dollars 150m still has to be agreed with TP SA however in a deal which is expected to be closed in the autumn. For the rest, TP SA is preparing a three-year plan to run till 1997 giving suppliers an idea of what its short-term needs are. Meanwhile, Centertel, a mobile phone operator jointly owned by TP SA, Ameritech of the US and France Telekom, is pressing ahead with installing its NMT phone system and already has around 11,000 subscribers. It will face a formidable challenge, though, when the government decides to go ahead with a tender for a more modern GSM network which in contrast to Centertel which operates on 450 mhz, will be compatible with other European networks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Fomicheva] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg, 1 Mar -- St. Petersburg Mayor  Anatoliy Sobchak called the amnesty a human act, commenting at  the request of an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the amnesty for the  Lefortovo detainees declared by the State Duma. But he said  that "this decision is an act of political struggle and a  challenge to the president and to the policy he is conducting.  It cannot fail to act as a means of political destabilization."    In Sobchak's view, "the point is not that people should be  in  prison; the main thing is that the actual crime should be  condemned.    "There is no doubt that a crime was committed on 3-4 October  last year against the individual and the state, an armed  rebellion that led to numerous fatalities. That fact cannot be  erased by any amnesties at all."    Anatoliy Sobchak recalled that the first draft constitution  stated that an amnesty could be declared by the Federal  Assembly, i.e. the State Duma and the Federation Council.  Unfortunately, he said, in the final version of the  Constitution, that stipulation fell by the wayside, and only the  State Duma retained the right, which the opposition took  advantage of.    Nevertheless, St. Petersburg's mayor stressed, the State  Duma  had the right to declare an amnesty, and there are only a number  of questions connected with the wording of the amnesty  declaration. "It's one thing when it covers people who are  involved in mass disorders; it's quite another thing when they  are involved in violence and murder. That is precisely the  charge brought against a whole string of participants in the  events of October."    According to Sobchak, an actual amnesty can be applied only  to persons who are guilty of committing crimes. "But if they do  not acknowledge their guilt, an amnesty cannot apply to them."  This legal problem should have been resolved by the  Procurator-General's office before the organizers of the October  rebellion were released."</p>

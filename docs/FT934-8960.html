			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Business Post margins decline SHARES IN Business Post Group, the parcel and express mail company which came to the market in June, fell sharply yesterday after its first results showed a drop in profit margins. Shares in Business Post were placed with institutions at 120p, valuing the group at Pounds 60m, but they yesterday shed 22p to 113p. Pre-tax profits increased by 15 per cent to Pounds 2.2m in the six months to September 30, while sales rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 19.1m. Gross profit margins fell in the first half from 14.3 to 11.7 per cent. Mr Torquil Montague-Johnstone, finance director, said the group had succeeded in broadening its customer base by attracting larger customers, but this work yielded lower profit margins. However, he hoped the group would be able to maintain profit margins at their existing levels through managing the business mix. Mr Peter Kane, chairman, said: 'The flotation is enabling the group to widen its customer base, attracting larger customers whilst increasing the level of traditional business and thereby improving the overall quality of the group's earnings.' Despite the slower than expected recovery from recession, the number of consignments by Business Post Ltd had increased by 35 per cent. The two smaller subsidiaries, UK Mail and Business Post International, had increased the number of consignments handed by 86 per cent and 71 per cent respectively. Mr Kane said the group was now in a strong financial position to extend its regional hub network. New hubs were being built in Manchester, Bristol and Leeds and all would start operating in the new year. He said: 'These developments will greatly enhance capacity and operational efficiency and are expected to generate incremental profits.' Mr Kane said the second half had started well: 'October and November are typically two of the best trading months and October revenues were comfortably ahead of last year, with Business Post Ltd achieving record consignment volumes in recent weeks.' Earnings per share rose to 3.3p (3.2p) and the interim dividend was 1.2p, compared with a notional 0.97p before.</p>

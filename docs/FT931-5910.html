			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Call for intervention in Yugoslavia MR Hans Van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for external relations, yesterday raised the prospect of the European Community, the US and Russia using joint military force to bring an end to the conflict in former Yugoslavia. In a speech in Antwerp, Mr van den Broek, formerly Dutch foreign minister, said the Yugoslav crisis had entered a crucial phase. Military intervention might be necessary to uphold a political settlement based on the UN-EC Vance-Owen plan, or to impose a solution from the outside. 'In both scenarios, Europe will face painful choices as to its military intervention,' said Mr van den Broek, 'I believe that only a united front by the US, the European Community and Russia offers a chance of forcing the warring parties to make peace.' In Brussels yesterday, EC diplomats reacted cautiously to Mr van den Broek's threat to use force, pointing out that such decisions lay with member states, rather than the European Commission. Both the UK and France, who have several thousand troops supporting humanitarian missions in former Yugoslavia, have voiced reservations about an open-ended commitment to use force. A UK diplomat said Mr van den Broek, a long-time hawk on Yugoslavia, was on 'dangerous ground' if he was threatening to impose an outside settlement. More than 50,000 troops might be needed to broker and enforce a truce. 'He needs to explain where he is going to get the men and the money.' The European Commission announced yesterday that the EC was accelerating disbursement of Ecu60m (Pounds 50m) to help the victims of the war, the first tranche of an Ecu325m aid package. But Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner responsible for development aid, said he could not guarantee that the medicine and food would reach those in need. The EC remained dependent on the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, he said. Mr Marin said 'all appropriate means' should be used to deliver the aid, including 'active and hard-hitting measures.' But he recognised that the ultimate decisions lay with western governments. 'I would not hide that the war in Yugoslavia has not been the most brilliant page in the history of the European Community.'</p>

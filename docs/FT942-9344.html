			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Brussels chief draws a line in the sand / Assessing the reasons for yesterday's outburst by Jacques Delors For most of this year, Mr Jacques Delors has been as quiet as a church mouse. But yesterday he confounded those who hoped he might be ready to leave Brussels quietly after 10 years as head of the European Commission. Mr Delors' outburst against Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economics minister and champion of deregulation, signals he is prepared to fight to the last minute over how to strengthen Europe's competitiveness without destroying the European social market model. But the Delors-Rexrodt clash is also about power, about how far the Commission should hold sway over European industrial and social policies. Mr Rexrodt, a Free Democrat who has one eye on the coming German general election, believes his campaign for a European deregulation initiative has strong support among German business. He wants to create a group of independent experts to root out Euro-legislation which could harm employment and growth. The German initiative, which has enthusiastic British support, drew a withering response from Mr Delors at yesterday's sessions of European foreign and finance ministers. He wondered aloud whether Mr Rexrodt's real goal was to gut the Maastricht treaty's social chapter; or whether he was aware that ministers - not the Commission - were responsible for passing onerous legislation in areas such as the environment. Mr Kenneth Clarke, UK chancellor of the exchequer, retorted that Mr Delors was acting like any good bureaucrat in defending his territory. But that is not the whole story. In the past year or so, mainly as a result of the debilitating struggle to ratify the Maastricht treaty, the power of the Commission has diminished visibly. So, too, has its role as power-broker and umpire inside the EU, to the point where member states are increasingly challenging its authority. Last week, France declared it was not willing to carry out a Commission ruling in favour of opening up Orly airport to competition. The issue was defused at the weekend, but only after bilateral UK-French negotiations in which Brussels played no role. Germany declared it was ready to take unilateral action against imports of British beef because of suspected mad cow disease. The threat remains on hold. This year, Greece ignored Commission warnings (and the Treaty of Rome) in slapping a trade embargo against the former republic of Macedonia. France is leading a bloc of EU member states questioning the Commission's 'community competence' to negotiate trade agreements on the part of the Twelve. 'Suspicion after the Gatt trade agreement is at an all-time high,' says one senior Commission official. Some observers view these challenges as part of a trend of 'creeping unilateralism' in which member states are pursuing their national interests aggressively at the expense of the common good which the Commission is supposed to define and represent. Mr Delors is clearly worried that Germany, the most powerful and populous country in Europe, may be tempted to stir up greater mistrust of the centre  -either under the guise of the Rexrodt initiative, or through the concept of 'subsidiarity', the code-word for devolving decision to the lowest national, regional or municipal level. Germany takes over the rotating presidency from Greece on July 1. Chancellor Helmut Kohl has already declared his determination to 'free ourselves from the notion that everything that has a European dimension automatically falls under the jurisdiction of Brussels' and make this a presidency priority. Mr Delors' aides say they are worried about Mr Rexrodt more than Mr Kohl; but Mr Delors' intervention yesterday still looks very much like a pre-emptive strike against the incoming German presidency ahead of the European summit in Corfu next month.</p>

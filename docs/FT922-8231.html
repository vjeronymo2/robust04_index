			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BP share registration unit moved in Pounds 25m deal BRITISH PETROLEUM is transferring responsibility for its share register to Computer Management Group, the information technology consultants, in a deal worth Pounds 25m over the next five years. The contract is the first to be signed since BP announced last month that it was cutting its corporate staff by 700 as part of a plan to save Pounds 415m a year. The package involved 250 redundancies, but BP said it hoped that 400 other employees would find jobs in companies to whom work was contracted out. All 62 staff in the share registration unit will transfer to CMG, although remaining in BP's Harlow office. BP said the move ensured that costs could be cut while maintaining standards of service. Its share register is one of the largest and most diverse in the UK, with 550,000 shareholders, quarterly dividends, and 12 employee share schemes worldwide. CMG has provided a supporting service to BP for more than 25 years. It handles share registration for other companies, including Legal &amp; General and British Airways. Mr Ron White, UK chairman of CMG said the advent of Taurus, the automated share dealing system being introduced next year in London would increase the need for companies to have efficient and cost-effective share registration services.</p>

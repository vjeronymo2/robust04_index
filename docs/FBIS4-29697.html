			<p>CSO     [Text] Kyocera is expanding its liquid crystal display  (LCD) business. By March 1995, it will increase production  capability for STN (super-twisted nematic) method color LCD to  50,000 a month (9.4 inch conversion), over three times the  present. Color filters, which are a major product, previously  have also only been produced for in-house use, but production  will be increased because the supply shortage in the industry  has become conspicuous, and it will embark on external sales.  The total amount of facilities investment is about 3 billion yen  for LCD and filters. Kyocera judges that high growth in the LCD  market will continue in the future centering on personal  computers and industrial machinery, and it will launch an  offensive with the STN method, which is considered the company's  forte.    The company currently produces 15,000 STN method color LCD's  (9.4 inch conversion) a month and 10,000 monochrome LCD's (9.4  inch conversion) a month at the Hayato plant (Hayato-cho,  Kagoshima Prefecture). It will again introduce the newest  production facilities, make an effort to improve yield, and  increase color LCD's to 50,000 a month. Since it will maintain  the current scale for the monochrome type, LCD's overall will  expand from a monthly production of 25,000 to 60,000. The goal  of sales in fiscal 1994 is 13 billion yen, 3.25 times the  previous fiscal year.    The TFT (thin film transistor) method, which has the special  features of fast response and wide visual angle, has been noted  for color LCD. However, Kyocera judges the demand for the STN  method to be strongly rooted and niche segregation by use is  proceeding, and they aim for a share expansion in the method.  They also are studying enlargement of the production line next  fiscal year if this production increase is on track. The amount  of facilities investment in that case is estimated to be on a  scale of 10 billion yen.    Color filters are produced at the Sendai plant (Sendai,  Kagoshima Prefecture). Currently, it supplies the total amount  to its own company's LCD use. Beginning in March next year when  the production increase is completed, the plan is to sell them  outside at a pace of 15,000 a month (portion for 3,000 LCD). The  chronic supply shortage in color filters is continuing and it  judges that a steady demand can be anticipated.</p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Survey of Greater Philadelphia (8): US Healthcare cuts costs, retains quality A pleasant but innocuous office complex, 20 miles north-west of Philadelphia, has become a focal point in the great debate over the future of the American healthcare system. The headquarters of US Healthcare, located in the leafy suburb of Blue Bell, has been the incubator for many of the ideas which are likely to form the basis for healthcare reform, the hottest issue on the national political agenda. As one of the country's first health maintenance organisations, set up in the late 1970s with a small government grant, the company has developed many of the practices which have come to be known as 'managed care'. Building on early success, the company has become the one of Philadelphia area's biggest businesses, with annual revenues of Dollars 2.65bn. It operates in eight states in the north-east, but Pennsylvania remains its largest market by far. What is managed care? Under its system, explains Mr Costas Nicolaides, chief financial officer, 'the financing and delivery of care is integrated'; as opposed to the traditional indemnity systems, in which the insurer 'simply pays bills'. A plethora of proposals to reform the inefficient US healthcare system is now under consideration by Congress. President Clinton, in presenting his benchmark plan, made reform his administration's top priority. The final form of the legislative package is far from certain. But it is becoming apparent in Washington that many aspects of the model championed by US Healthcare will feature prominently in the bill that finally emerges this autumn. 'Most federal healthcare reform proposals emphasise going more toward managed care, in order to build savings into the system more constitutionally than at present,' says Mr David Simon, senior vice-president. As the largest and most innovative company in its field, US Healthcare has convinced many sceptics that soaring US medical costs can be effectively contained without undermining the quality and availability of services. In fact, it has shown that low costs and high-quality care are mutually-supporting goals when the traditional hands-off relationship between insurers and medical providers is abandoned. 'Quality care in the end costs less for us and the customer,' says Mr Simon. Prevention, it appears, is worth much more than an ounce of cure. By placing emphasis on primary and pre-emptive care, US Healthcare has found ways of cutting hospital stays and expensive medical procedures. It has pioneered programmes aimed at promoting 'wellness' - how to help people stay healthy - as well as schemes for the early detection of illness. Its high-risk maternity programme is a good example. By offering pregnant women in certain categories early access to specialists, US Healthcare achieved a 50 per cent reduction in the use of neo-natal intensive-care services. By contrast, most traditional health plans neither pay for preventive care, even in high-risk cases, nor control access to specialists. Patients are left to their own devices. The result is often unnecessary visits, which drive up premiums, or more expensive treatment after serious symptoms develop. That's bad medicine as well as bad business. By making preventive and medical-management programmes its hallmark, US Healthcare held growth in its costs per member to 4 per cent last year, a full point lower than the rate at which the medical consumer price index increased. The company's operating economies are reflected in its price tag. A recent independent analysis showed that the company's coverage costs a family about half the amount charged by typical indemnity plans, when differences in benefits and total out-of-pocket expenditures are taken into account. Even when such factors are not considered, US Healthcare says its premiums are 20 to 30 per cent less. As with most HMOs, a fixed monthly payment entitles subscribers to unlimited treatment by a network of providers, with only nominal charges for each office visit. General practitioners are the gate-keepers to a team of specialists, all of whom work under contract with the company. By contrast, most traditional indemnity plans require customers to pay 'deductibles', or excess payments. Premiums are assessed on the basis of the individual's risk of falling ill, and sometimes coverage is denied. This practice is known as 'experience rating'. Instead, HMOs use 'community' rating, which combines the risk of all subscribers and divides it equally among them. 'It's a much more egalitarian system. But most importantly it prevents situations in which people who are sicker, or who get sick, have to pay more,' Mr Simon says. But low premiums are only part of the equation. The company's medical costs as a percentage of income dropped to 68 per cent last year, from 75.1 per cent in 1992. Membership, meanwhile, jumped nearly 12 per cent to 1.67m, continuing a long string of double-digit increases from internal growth, rather than acquisitions. Total premium revenue was up 21 per cent. Not surprisingly, higher gross income and lower cost added up to a 50 per cent surge in 1993 net earnings to Dollars 300m last year. 'One of the reasons US Healthcare has been so profitable is they have such good control over the product and pricing,' says Mr David Lothson, an analyst at Paine Webber in New York. Senior US Healthcare executives are clearly feeling a quiet satisfaction over the growing appeal of their approach. Since the national debate over healthcare started in earnest last year, 'there has been a greater awareness of the kind of things that count: quality, cost-containment and accountability. These are things that US Healthcare began to recognise long ago,' says Mr Nicolaides.</p>

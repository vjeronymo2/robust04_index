			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Slow start, but ready to roll - A lack of enthusiasm has greeted the UK's Enterprise Investment Scheme Britain's Enterprise Investment Scheme, which replaces the Business Expansion Scheme, has got off to a decidedly slow start. Launched to attract equity investment into private trading companies, barely a handful of companies have tried to raise capital since the scheme began in January. Of the few issues that have seen the light of day, one - a scheme to finance the purchase of second-hand bulk cargo ships - was left substantially with underwriters after the public almost totally ignored the offer. A second scheme for The Unchained Growth Pub Companies, which was launched last week, seems a far cry from what the government intended when it offered investors tax breaks to back trading companies constrained by lack of equity. The scheme involves three EIS companies buying pubs in the London area which will be managed by Regent Inns, a publicly quoted company. One reason for this shaky start was a desire by most EIS scheme sponsors to see the detail of the finance bill. Now that the bill is published, the Department of Trade and Industry has produced a comprehensive 20-page guide* that should remove much uncertainty. But many sponsors will remain unexcited by the new scheme. The EIS rules have reduced the maximum a company can raise to Pounds 1m (Pounds 5m for shipping companies). At this lower limit, the cost of sponsoring a public issue could be as much as 10 per cent of the amount raised. Given that up-front tax on an EIS investment is only 20 per cent, instead of a top rate of 40 per cent under the BES scheme, investors would not receive much of a break after deducting the costs of sponsorship. Robert Lowe, director at Johnson Fry, one of the largest BES sponsors, believes entrepreneurs should nevertheless have plenty of scope to raise capital through private EIS schemes. While resigned to the fact that there is little scope for Johnson Fry to act as sponsors on Pounds 1m EIS schemes, he says private deals should be possible through local networks of investors with local accountants acting as clearing houses. Ross Macdonald, chief executive of Neill Clerk Capital which sponsored the Unchained Growth Pub Companies scheme and issued the shipping company prospectus, agrees there will be fewer sponsored EIS schemes. But groups like Neill Clerk will help businesses with their documentation when trying to raise capital through private schemes. Macdonald says his company expects to be doing about a tenth of last year's number of sponsored deals. Instead he will be focusing on private deals such as one he is appraising now for a business that is trying to raise Pounds 500,000 for equipment to make a product it currently imports. The most significant variation on the BES scheme that will attract investors and help entrepreneurs is the tax break now available on any EIS losses, according to Chilton Taylor of accountants Baker Tilly, which helped write the DTI brochure. These losses can now be offset against income or capital gains tax. An investor with a top tax rate of 40 per cent who backs a scheme that goes bust can only lose 48 per cent of his initial investment after taking into account the 20 per cent up-front relief he will already have received. In spite of this break, the reduced front-end tax relief means fewer investors will be attracted to EIS schemes purely for tax reasons. Because there are, so far, fewer loopholes to be exploited by sponsors pushing tax-driven schemes, quality proposals should have a better chance of raising finance. At the very least, genuine trading companies are less likely to see their proposals swept aside by artificial financial products such as the assured property schemes that so discredited BES. *A guide to the Enterprise Investment Scheme - available from the DTI (081 896 2116) or Baker Tilly (071 413 5100).

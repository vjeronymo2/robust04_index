			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Washington, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Secretary of  Defense William Perry said today that the United States should  have a "hedge strategy" against a scenario when Russia turns  militaristic and hostile to the West.    During a speech at the George Washington University, Perry  said U.S. policy toward Moscow should be based on the principles  of realism and pragmatism.    Terming U.S.-Russian ties as a "pragmatic partnership,"  Perry  said there is "a great variety of morbid symptoms" in Russia  when the country is trying to dismantle the controls of the  previous system.    He listed the "morbid symptoms" as a deeply divided  political  system with profoundly disaffected elites; economic uncertainty  and social dislocation.    These facts, in the worst circumstances, would lead Russia  to  "emerge from her turbulence as an authoritarian, militaristic,  imperialistic nation, hostile to the west."    "In such a situation, we could indeed see a renewal of some  new version of the old Cold War, Russia without the Warsaw pact  but still with a formidable nuclear arsenal," Perry said.    In light of the "stark realities," the defense chief said,  Washington should try to influence events in Russia to a  positive outcome while being prepared to deal with a negative  outcome.    He described some of the elements in U.S. defense planning  that are not justified by current threats but needed as a "hedge  against the possibility of a negative outcome" in Russia:    -- While implementing the provisions of the First Strategic  Arms Reduction Treaty (START), the United States would hold off  reductions stipulated under the second start treaty until "we  see comparable reductions being made in Russia."    -- The Pentagon would maintain a "minimum essential defense  industrial infrastructure" so that it could have the capability  to reconstruct "key elements."    -- It would maintain a "minimal" production and research and  development capability for nuclear weapons, while the Pentagon  is reducing the nuclear stockpile.    -- The Pentagon would continue building nuclear submarines  even though current threat and replacement needs don't justify  building new submarines until the year 2000.    On Wednesday, Perry will start a week-long trip to Russia,  Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus.    While in Russia, he plans to meet with government as well as  leaders of the parliament's military and foreign affairs  committees.</p>

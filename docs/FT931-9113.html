			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: The Middle East prize IT IS a sad reflection on the Middle East peace process that 16 months after it was launched the first task for Mr Warren Christopher, the new US secretary of state, should be to prod the participants back to the negotiating table. His trip to the region later this week will be deemed a success if Israel, the Palestinians, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon agree to resume talks, despite Israel's refusal to implement fully UN Security Council resolution 799, which demands the immediate return of the 400 men deported from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon. But it will have been achieved at political cost to all parties, especially to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, who was forced to bow to US pressure and offer to readmit 100 men in order to stave off the threat of UN sanctions, and to the Palestinian delegation which is daily losing ground to more radical factions in the occupied territories. The room for manoeuvre by both sides has been reduced by Mr Rabin's ill-considered response to increased violence in the West Bank and Gaza, and it is going to take a bold negotiating initiative to restore optimism to the peace process. No one doubts Mr Rabin's credentials as a man committed to the security of Israel. What is now required is greater evidence of his powers of conciliation, through relaxing the often harsh regulations affecting the lives of the 1.6m Palestinians, and by offering a greater degree of self-rule during an agreed transition period leading to the final determination of the status of the occupied territories. Israel's government has already sensed the size of the prize on offer. Syria, for so long its most unflinching enemy, looks ready to sign a peace treaty if a deal can be struck over the Golan Heights. It is eager to get back to the negotiations in Washington, but does not wish to be seen to be abandoning the Palestinians. Lebanon's relations with Israel depend on the outcome of the Syrian talks, while Jordan can only begin to resolve its bilateral issues once there is progress between Israel and the Palestinians. It has become increasingly apparent that the Israelis and their Arab negotiating partners cannot achieve this on their own. All sides claim that there will never be a better chance of making peace than with their present interlocutor. Yet substantive issues have scarcely been touched since the talks opened in October 1991. Supported by the lessons learned from previous Egypt-Israeli negotiations, this must lead to the conclusion that without more forceful US involvement the peace process stands little chance of progress.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Tallinn, Mar 01, BNS -- Alexandr Udaltsov, a  senior official at the Russian Foreign Ministry in charge of  Baltic affairs, today voiced his surprise at Estonian Foreign  Ministry statement.    Udaltsov told BNS Estonia "is long since familiar with  Russia's official position" on troop withdrawal, which does not  accept Aug. 31 as the final, mutually agreed upon deadline for  the pullout of its armed forces from Estonia.    "It is unclear why (Estonia) attempts to build this position  up as a news item," the Russian diplomat said. "If the Estonian  side is seeking a pretext to break off the talks, Estonians  should admit they see no point in continuing the negotiations."  [passage omitted]    Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar said at a press conference  today that, if Russia officially announces it will change the  troop withdrawal deadline, Estonia will break off the talks.    "The pullout of Russian troops from Estonia has slowed down  since the beginning of the year," the premier noted. "If Russia  had continued the withdrawal at the same pace as in past years,  the troops would have left Estonia in the first months of this  year."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments argued that the proposed rule is invalid under the Supreme Court's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Georgetown University Hospital, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  488 U.S. 204 (1988), which held that retroactive rulemaking is improper under the APA absent express statutory authority, because Congress has not given the Attorney General retroactive rulemaking authority through the Immigration and Nationality Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one comment argued that applying the proposed rule to ``all adjudications'' creates conflicts with judicial decisions and settlement agreements in litigation concerning asylum procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response and Disposition: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These comments were carefully considered, but it was concluded that the effective date provision does not run afoul of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  Georgetown University Hospital. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The rule is not ``retroactive'' within the meaning of that case because it does not alter the past legal consequences of past actions; rather, it affects only procedures that are to be followed in cases that are yet to be adjudicated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effective date provision applies only to adjudications of applications for asylum or withholding of deportation under 8 CFR Part 208. The rule therefore will not apply to the amended provisions of 8 CFR 242.17(e) regarding the use of information provided on an asylum application as the basis for establishing the alienage or deportability of an asylum applicant, or to the related provision at 8 CFR 208.3(c)(2). These amended provisions will apply only to applications received by the INS after the effective date of the final rule. Similarly, the effective date provisions do not affect 8 CFR 274a.12(c)(8). Thus, asylum applicants who have filed their applications prior to the effective date of the final rule will not be subject to the final rule's provisions governing initial applications for employment authorization. Sections 208.7(a) and 242.17(e) of the final rule will be amended to clarify this point. However, the rule governing extensions of employment authorization in &sect;208.7(d) shall apply to all asylum applicants upon the effective date of this rule. Furthermore, the final rule cannot and does not intend to alter any obligations imposed on the INS or asylum applicants by judicial decisions or settlement agreements in cases such as  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ABC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mendez. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Finally, the rule will not apply to cases pending in district courts, courts of appeals, or the Supreme Court.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The other aspects of the rule, while they would affect pending applications, do not affect the past legal consequences of past actions, but merely affect procedures to be applied in the future. The main procedural differences under this rule are elimination of the NOID and written denial decisions by asylum officers. These changes, however, do not alter the legal circumstances or rights of any person with a pending application. No person eligible for asylum under existing regulations will be rendered ineligible due to any change made by this rule. Asylum claims will continue to be adjudicated under the same legal standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limiting application of the final rule to applications filed after the effective date would severely impair efforts at asylum reform because it would require two parallel systems of adjudication: one for cases filed before the effective date, one for cases filed afterwards. Neither the Supreme Court's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  nor any section of the APA requires such a result. The rule achieves the goal of streamlining the asylum process while maintaining the same legal standards used to adjudicate each asylum application in a timely manner. This provision of the proposed rule will be adopted in the final rule with amendments for clarity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elena Barrios on an interview with </F> Panamanian President Guillermo Endara by an unidentified  reporter on the 27 March OAS secretary general elections; in  Panama City on 27 March; from the "RPC News" newscast]    [Text] With 20 votes in his favor, Colombian President  Cesar Gaviria today was elected to replace Brazilian Joao  Clemente Baena Soares as OAS secretary general. Despite  diplomatic efforts by Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus  to secure the post for Central America, Niehaus obtained only 14  votes, including one from Panama. For our country, however,  this was a very difficult decision, because both candidates  hailed from neighboring countries with which we maintain good  relations -- Colombia and Costa Rica.    In statements to RPC Radio, Panamanian President Guillermo  Endara voiced his belief that Gaviria will do a good job and  that the OAS will assume a new role under his leadership.    [Begin recording] [Endara] Although we were committed to  Costa Rica, I am certain President Gaviria will prove to be a  historic OAS secretary general. I think the time during which  the OAS was a dormant, inactive organization has ended. We will  now see a new OAS with Gaviria as secretary general. We will  see a dynamic OAS -- an OAS that will promote democracy in the  hemisphere, one that will promote liberty.    [Reporter] Mr. President, as for Panama, what expectations  does the Panamanian Government have in the wake of the Colombian  President's election?    [Endara] President Gaviria reiterated to me -- in fact, he  has told me repeatedly since he began his bid for the post of  secretary general -- that regardless of how Panama voted, he  wanted to have Panama's support, much like Panama would want to  have his support. I told him that if he was indeed elected,  Panama would support him not only during my presidency, but that  I am certain any and all of the seven presidential candidates  will also support him. I told him I could guarantee this  support, because we will have a four-month transition period  during which I hope to maintain good relations with the winner  of the Panamanian elections. I also told him I am sure we will  agree that the new president should support Gaviria at the OAS.    [Reporter] Mr. President, do you think the support the  United  States gave the Colombian president's candidacy was the decisive  factor in today's vote?    [Endara] No, no, no. I honestly do not think so. Our vote  is an example. Although the United States lobbied strongly  through diplomatic channels, I think President Gaviria has  merits of his own and qualities that make him an excellent  candidate. Gaviria, in my opinion, would have won even without  U.S. backing. [end recording]    Colombian President Cesar Gaviria, 47, will probably assume  the post of OAS secretary general in August.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Renny Jokelin: "Germany Expects Finland To Be an </F> Ally in Union; German Ambassador Would Reduce Number of  Commissioners"]    [Text] Germany regards Finland, the other Nordic countries,  and Austria as natural allies in developing the European Union  [EU] once these countries have become members of the EU.  Germany's ambassador to the EU serving in Brussels, Dietrich von  Kyaw, believes that Finland and Germany will find that they have  common interests particularly as the EU develops its relations  with East Europe, the Baltic countries, and Russia.    Speaking at a German-Finnish Chamber of Commerce gathering,  von Kyaw outlined, among other things, the goal of turning the  Baltic into a real Union inland waterway surrounded by EU  members in the Baltic countries, Poland, and Germany. Russia  would not be a member, but it would be bound to the Union by  many political and economic ties.    Von Kyaw reminded his listeners that Germany had recently  helped Finland to get into the Union. The Finns had declared in  Brussels that they would walk out of the membership negotiations  unless the Nordic agricultural model was accepted as part of the  membership agreement. The Germans intervened at the time and  talked the EU into approving the agreement.    Von Kyaw said that he views EU membership as being of both  economic and political benefit to Finns. According to him, it is  very hard in present-day Europe to solve problems any more at  the national level.    "If anyone thinks that Finland's membership in the EU will  resolve all of Finland's problems quickly, he is mistaken," von  Kyaw, however, noted.    Von Kyaw said that he believes the EU is progressing toward  a  monetary union, a common currency, and a central bank, among  other things, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, his own  countrymen's doubts notwithstanding.    According to the German ambassador, "in the long run," the  Union may also move toward a common defense policy. Finland can  stick to its own security policy line "under the present  circumstances."    The EU will decide on its new defense policy approaches in  1996 and Finland, in von Kyaw's opinion, can at that time  "present its own view of defense and get the Union to move in a  favorable direction."  <H5>  Finland May Lose Commissioner's Seat </H5>   Germany wants to intensively tighten up the Union. Von Kyaw  said that the administrative organs in Brussels must be made  more effective at that time. This, among other things, means  that the present number of EU Commission members will be  reduced. The ambassador to the EU did not specify the number of  commissioners Germany is aiming for.    The chief German Government parties have earlier talked of  10  commissioners, in which event Finland, among others, would lose  its commissioner.    Germany would also like to endow majority decisions at  ministerial meetings with more authority and increase the EU  Parliament's legislative powers.</p>

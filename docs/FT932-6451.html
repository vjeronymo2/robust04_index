			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / BBC to sample viewer opinions THE BBC will send out more than 2m questionnaires each year to viewers in a 'rolling referendum' on its polices, programmes and performance. The unprecedented sampling of the views of licence-payers is part of a move towards greater openness and accountability at the corporation. The BBC said the plan to seek the views of 10 per cent of the 20m-plus licence-paying homes a year would be cost-effective because questionnaires would be sent with licence-fee reminders. Publishing its response to the government green paper on its future, the BBC said panels of viewers would be convened to advise on policy and programme strategy. Mr John Birt, the BBC director-general, said yesterday: 'We are not talking about being enslaved by this process (of seeking viewers' opinions). It is meant to inform our judgments and make better decisions.' In its 154-page response to the government the BBC promised enhanced accountability, including a clear definition of the role of the BBC governors and the board of management, an improved complaints procedure and a new commercial policy framework. Mr Birt said 57 meetings with licence-payers throughout the UK had 'demonstrated substantial support for and satisfaction with our existing output'. He described the BBC as 'one of the most successful institutions created in any country in the twentieth century'. The BBC says the government should allow it to continue offering all the services it does now under a new Royal Charter, but provided more efficiently with greater openness and accountability. A study by consultants McKinsey of 11 public-service broadcasters around the world, published with the main BBC response, found that the licence fee was potentially the most attractive method of funding to meet public-service objectives. Independent market research found 63 per cent in favour and only 14 per cent against the BBC's preferred programme strategy - concentrating on a broad range of quality programmes. Only 24 per cent preferred a more narrow public-service option and 42 per cent opposed the BBC competing with commercial broadcasters. Sixty four per cent said the BBC licence fee at Pounds 80 a year was very good or fairly good value for money, and 72 per cent were against reducing the range or quality of programmes to cut the licence. Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, said this week that he hoped to produce a white paper on the future of the BBC 'at the turn of the year'.</p>

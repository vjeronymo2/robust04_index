			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A provincial economic meeting, aimed primarily  at studying and solving the problem of state-owned enterprises  turning deficits into profits, opened in Zhengzhou this morning.  Provincial party Secretary Li Changchun and Governor Ma  Zhongchen made important speeches at the meeting.    While analyzing the economic situation in our province, Ma  Zhongchen said: At present, economic operations in our province  are normal, and the situation is stable as a whole. Various  kinds of reforms are progressing smoothly. In particular,  although we have encountered enormous difficulties in  implementing a new tax system and a reform plan for the  purchasing and selling prices of grain, sharp fluctuations have  been avoided. The masses have made a good response to this.  Judging from our economic operations, our rural economy has  been developing in a all-round way. There is a fairly good  harvest of summer grain. Our industrial production has been  developing in a sustained and rapid manner. From January to May  this year, industrial production output value at and above the  township level was 21 percent higher than in the same period  last year. This margin of increase was 1.97 percentage points  higher than the average national level. Sales value increased  by 21 percent, and the production and marketing rate was 24  percent. At the end of last May, various kinds of deposit  amounts in various financial organs throughout the province were  15.7 billion yuan more than in same period last year. Local  financial revenues of the whole province were 25.5 percent  higher than in the same period last year. Urban and rural  retail markets throughout the province were prosperous and  brisk, and supplies of consumer goods were ample. There was  brisk buying and selling. From January to May, incomes in  foreign exchange through foreign trade reached $80 million, an  increase of 28.5 percent over the same period last year.    Ma Zhongchen pointed out: In the course of reform and  opening up, we also have faced new situations and new problems,  which have been reflected mainly in tight finances. Many  localities are unable to pay wages to cadres and workers on  schedule. The margin of price increases on the markets is too  high. The number of liquidated enterprises, and enterprises  that suspended production, or are operating below capacity has  increased. At the end of last May, the accumulated profits of  industrial enterprise covered by budgets were 26.5 percent lower  than in the same period last year. Forty key enterprises --  including Angang, Xinfei, Pinglian, Luoguo and others -- have  still increased their profits. However, the majority of  industrial enterprises have made deficits. Of the six major  industries -- including metallurgy, machinery, the chemical and  textile industries, building materials, and light industry --  the profits of five industries have dropped, with the exception  of metallurgy. Of the 17 cities and prefectures, only the city  of Pingdingshan and Zhoukou Prefecture have increased their  profits.    Ma Zhongchen stressed: The losses of industrial enterprises  covered by budgets have increased. The key reason for this is  that our enterprises have been slow in transforming their  operational mechanisms, that their capability in conforming with  the market demand is weak, and that their product mix has not  yet been adjusted properly. They have lacked the capability to  conform with market demand. Another important reason for this  is that leading bodies in enterprises have failed to work in a  coordinated way, and their internal management has been chaotic.  If we fail to solve these problems, the general situation of  reform, development and stability will be directly affected. We  must on no account treat them lightly.    Ma Zhongchen added: The present focus of our work should be  on further deepening enterprise reform, transforming enterprise  operational mechanisms, and firmly grasping deficit-ridden  enterprises' work to turn from deficits to profits. We must  vigorously promote preproduction structural reform. In the  future, we must take the shareholding system and the  shareholding cooperative system as an emphasis of preproduction  structural reform. We must take active measures to conduct  experimental work and speed up development. In the meantime, in  the course of development, we must not forget standardization  and improvement. We must fully vest our enterprises with  decisionmaking powers. Various cities, prefectures, and  departments must delegate their power on hand as early as  possible. [words indistinct] Various enterprises must  vigorously carry out the activities of grasping the changes in  their operational mechanisms, improving management, and  enhancing their capability and efficiency. They must devote  their main efforts to improving their product quality and  upgrading their products. Relevant departments must actively  guide deficit-making enterprises to adjust their product mix  according to market demand so as to actively manufacture new  products, products in short supply, and marketable products.  They also must manufacture products that require high  technology, as well as new, profit-making products that require  low investment. We must support them in terms of funds,  techniques, and management. [passage omitted including  indistinct portion]    In conclusion, Ma Zhongchen emphasized: Various departments  and units must further change their administrative functions,  energetically encourage the practice of conducting  investigations and studies, and help enterprises and grass-roots  levels truly solve practical difficulties and problems through  investigation and study. He hoped that they would unite as one  to struggle hard to fight the battle of turning from deficits to  profits.    At the meeting, (Cui Chenggong), deputy secretary general of  the provincial party committee and director of the policy study  institute, read several opinions of the provincial party  committee and government on turning enterprises' deficits to  profits.    Leading comrades who attended the meeting included Ren Keli,  Zheng Zengmao, Zhang Deguang, (Ma Jianzhang), Zhong Lisheng,  Zhang Shiying, Zhang Honghua, Yu Jiahua, Zhu Shuquan, and others.</p>

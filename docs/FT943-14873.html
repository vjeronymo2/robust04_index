			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of World Automotive Components (10): Tide begins to turn - Ian Robertson looks at Japanese trade with the US What political pressure has so far failed to achieve, in reducing Japan's annual Dollars 10bn surplus in auto parts trade with the US, may yet be resolved by market pressures. Confronted by the twin problems of a relentlessly high yen and the consequent drop in domestic production of more than 2m vehicles since 1991, Japan's component producers reported a decline in profits of around 25 per cent a year. The profit/sales ratio for the country's 20,000 suppliers slipped to 0.6 per cent for 1993/4 and a significant rationalisation of the sector is forecast over the next five to 10 years with an increasing number of mergers, acquisitions and alliances. A wave of cost-reduction programmes by suppliers began in 1993. Their effects will be seen on new models produced from 1997 when the supply sector anticipates the beginnings of a recovery for the country's components producers. Parts sharing is on the rise by the vehicle manufacturers, breaking down the old keiretsu system of exclusive supplier networks. Product life cycles are being extended and the number of model variants is being reduced, all of which will assist economies of scale by component suppliers. Despite US pressures, however, imported components accounted for only 3 per cent of completed vehicles in Japan in 1993. The latest round of June trade negotiations in Tokyo failed to achieve any formal breakthrough in the US campaign to raise this imported percentage. The industry, however, is already moving towards an informal resolution by stepping up its plans for overseas procurement. In an interview with The Economist Intelligence Unit last month, the chairman of the Japan Auto Part Industries Association (JAPIA) declared that 'regardless of the outcome of the talks between the two governments, Japanese auto parts companies are going to transfer more of their production capacity to the US, and increasingly vehicle manufacturers are seeking to source more of their components from the US. As for Japanese auto transplants in the US, in the future they will buy almost all their components from North American suppliers rather than importing them from Japan.' The driver is the need to cut costs and remain competitive - with the added threat of low-cost emergent producers in the neighbouring Pacific Rim. Already this has triggered some US/Japanese agreements to co-operate in their approaches to third countries, such as China. Overall, Japan is committed to the purchase of Dollars 19bn of US auto parts by fiscal 1994 (ending March 1995). The Clinton administration, taking a 'results-oriented' approach, wants Japan to guarantee numerical targets comprising Dollars 1.5bn for US purchases and Dollars 4bn for imports - as was agreed during President Bush's January 1992 visit to Tokyo. It also wants a more detailed breakdown of planned purchases charging that, last year, one-sixth of US components sold in Japan were tyres, many of these sourced from the US subsidiaries of Japan's largest tyre producers, Bridgestone, Sumitomo Rubber and Yokohama Rubber. Japan, however, insists the agreement related to enhanced opportunities to sell US parts, with no guarantees on net sales levels. Moreover, with the interim slump in vehicle output, the Dollars 4bn import target is considered, by the industry, to be out of reach. Although the US trade deficit in auto parts has climbed from Dollars 1bn in 1981 to more than Dollars 10bn, it is argued that in yen terms, the increase was less than half the dollar amount and since 1990 there has actually been a decrease. With the dollar holding at near record highs, US components producers are stepping up their efforts. GM's Automotive Components Group (ACG) Asia is to increase its staff of engineers by 30 per cent to 130 before the end of the year. It plans to raise fiscal 1994 sales in Japan to Y13 billion - an increase of 20 per cent over fiscal 1993. The increase in the number of engineers will allow ACG to work together with Japanese auto makers from the design stage. TRW sold an estimated Dollars 700m of components to the Japanese last year - up from Dollars 60m in 1985 - and it has set a target of Dollars 1.5bn by 1997. Ford opened a Dollars 4.5m technical centre in East Hiroshima last October and hopes to double its sales in Japan in three years' time. Other companies in the process of upgrading their Japanese operations include Rockwell International, Garrett Turbo, Intel and Motorola. Compared with fewer than 10 a decade ago, there are now an estimated 80 US component manufacturers with representation in Japan aimed at accessing Japan's Dollars 140bn auto parts market. Among the transplants in North America, the US content of Accords built by Honda of America Manufacturing now stands at 82 per cent; Honda of America produces all its engines in-house, one of the reasons for the high local content rate. (Chrysler Corporation, which imports Mitsubishi V6 engines for several models including the Dodge Acclaim, is believed to have a domestic content of about 70 per cent). Companies participating in Honda of America's continuous improvement programme have seen an average 48 per cent jump in productivity, Toyota also claims that, through quality control systems introduced at its US suppliers, defect rates have been lowered to a negligible 0.2 per cent compared with 2.5 per cent for the same suppliers in their dealings with the US Big Three. Sales to the US transplants are viewed as the first step in selling directly to the factories in Japan. The Japan Automobile Manufacturing Association (JAMA) insists that the purchase of US auto parts is increasing. Over the past five years the number of contracts has more than doubled and the number of suppliers tripled. Nissan claims that the Dollars 3bn of local parts it procured in the US last year already exceeded its voluntary plan of Dollars 2.9bn for 1994. It plans to increase local procurement of US-made parts by 75 per cent to Dollars 3.4bn in fiscal 1997 and to increase parts imports by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.7bn in fiscal 1988, up from an estimated Dollars 980m. Toyota reports that it raised its purchases of US-made car parts by 5 per cent last year to Dollars 4.7bn or more than four times the Dollars 1.1bn it spent five years ago. Toyota expects to lift its procurement of US-made car parts to Dollars 5.3bn in the year to March 1995. The company holds annual meetings with US component suppliers with the aim of fostering long-term business relations and promoting purchases of North American products. It now imports into Japan parts from 131 North American suppliers and purchases auto parts from 301 suppliers in North America for its transplant operations - up from 70 and 130 firms respectively in 1990 - and its Camry model is to go to 80 per cent local content in 1995. Mitsubishi Motors, which has also been looking at buying in lower-cost steel from South Korea, is investigating opportunities to source components from US suppliers to its Diamond-Star transplant operation for its Japanese-made cars. Local procurement in the US is expected to rise to between Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 1.6bn in fiscal 1996 from Dollars 650m in fiscal 1993. Exports of components and materials to Japan will rise from Dollars 260m in fiscal 1993 to Dollars 350-Dollars 440m in fiscal 1994. Mazda has announced a new international co-operation programme in which it forecasts that by fiscal 1997 its parts imports will rise 55 per cent from the Dollars 870m recorded in fiscal 1993. As well as encouraging foreign suppliers to participate in its design activities the programme also calls for the provision of support to second-tier suppliers in the US.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter responded that EPA's objection to ORS 161.170 was inappropriate because EPA should not interfere with State criminal law and that EPA already has sufficient authority to bring its own criminal actions. Another commenter stated, without further elaboration, that the burden of proof for criminal violations in Oregon is the same as for federal crimes because, in both jurisdictions, the prosecution must prove the existence of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained above, EPA disagrees that the Clean Air Act does not authorize EPA to require States to change their criminal laws to meet the requirements for an approvable title V program and that Federal criminal authority is sufficient in and of itself. Title V prohibits EPA from approving a State title V program if the State does not have appropriate criminal authority, so Congress obviously contemplated that States with insufficient criminal authority would need to amend their statutes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 502(b)(5)(E). Moreover, as discussed above, if Congress thought that Federal criminal enforcement authorities provided sufficient deterrence, Congress would not have required that States have appropriate criminal authorities in order to obtain title V approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third comment was submitted by the State, which included an opinion letter from the Oregon Attorney General's office stating that the Oregon standard under ORS 161.170(1)(a) is equivalent to the Federal standard articulated by EPA in its September 14, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. The Attorney General opined that ORS 161.170(1)(a), like Federal law, adopts the principle of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> respondeat superior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with the additional requirement that the employee's conduct occur on behalf of the corporation. In light of the most recent opinion letter submitted by the Oregon Attorney General's office, EPA concludes that Oregon law does not impose a different burden of proof or degree of knowledge or intent for corporations than does Federal law. In its September 14, 1994, proposal, EPA had assumed that knowing violations of permits and applicable requirements would fall under ORS 161.170(1)(c), which requires proof that the employee's conduct was authorized or otherwise condoned by the board of directors or a high managerial agent. The Attorney General pointed out, however, that ORS 468.936, which satisfies the general criminal authority required by 40 CFR 70.11(a)(3)(ii), is not defined as a felony under Oregon law, and is therefore a ``violation.'' Accordingly, a corporation which violated ORS 468.936 could be prosecuted under ORS 161.170(1)(a), which requires only that the illegal conduct was engaged in by an agent of the corporation acting within the scope of employment and on behalf of the corporation. As noted by the Attorney General and by EPA in its September 14, 1994  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, this is equivalent to the Federal standard. In short, based on the opinion letter of the Attorney General, EPA has determined that ORS 161.170 does not pose a bar to full approval of Oregon's program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

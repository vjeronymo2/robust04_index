			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Gardening: So how does a beginner learn to begin? - Tamara Hedge-Bonus starts by ignoring the advice of the new radio experts The narcissi have never looked better; we can be busy this weekend with everything which the gales stopped us doing over Easter. Spare a thought, however, for the new recruits to the real business of life, those for whom 1994 may be the start of a lifetime of gardening until arthritis stops them in the 2030s. In fact, 2030 is way beyond the time scale of the new horticultural intake who have been kind enough to share their progress with me. They sold it short six months ago - one reason why gardening is now within their reach. With the passing of April 5, a green glimmer on the horizon has fallen on the plate glass headquarters of the City stronghold of Goldmine Fax. Like players on the old Monopoly board, the teams on the 13th and 14th floors have just passed 'Go' and collected the fruits of their year's derivative efforts. Only one colleague has collected more than Tamara Hedge-Bonus. Aged 32, she has hedged and re-hedged round the clock. She battered the franc in August; she put Italian bonds back to back with Norman Lamont's least wanted bits of farewell paper. By the terms of her clients' Special Reserve, she is now entitled to a personal incentive payment of Pounds 600,000 to meet the rigours of the new tax year. A man on the 14th floor is entitled to Pounds 820,000 and, in February, it did look as if Tamara was going to beat him. But the US Treasury caught her off-balance on the very Friday evening when she had left early to spend quality time with Chris. Chris and she are not married because Tamara always fights shy of open-ended contracts. On the company paperwork, he is ranked as her spouse alternative and there are times, to be honest, when Tamara wonders if other alternatives might be better value. Cool, pure nerve is the hallmark of the Hedge-Bonus style in action, inferring fair value from conventional things like maths. Chris, by contrast, works for World Wildlife and moves at an altogether more suggestible pace. To her annoyance (and sub-conscious pleasure), she can boss him mercilessly; her friends know, as she half-knows, that he represents her conscience. One more year, Tamara tells herself, and then she will be out of it. Banking a second bonus will see her through life, with some gentle dealing from home. Being out of it means being partly in the country, where Tamara and her generation have talked often of applying their new finances to attaining the standards of a past age. Tamara has secured her property already: a dower house with a wing for future small Hedge-Bonuses and stabling which could accommodate a 'phone, fax and serious PC. The ground slopes bumpily to a superlative view from a Cotswolds escarpment, and down further to a chain of neglected lakes (Chris's present paradise but one, she tells herself privately, which will still stack up even if he does not). Tamara is a gardener with a vision. In her past, she looks back to idyllic years by Surrey's Bluebell Railway before her parents quarrelled, split up, and she developed that ruthless calculation which has paid off so handsomely in her present career. In those early days, there were buttercups; the woods were alive with white anemones; and roses tumbled in clouds from old stone walls. Tamara learnt so much from her mother before her mother became embittered: she grew up knowing that red salvia was only for vulgar Italians and that high-class gardens had atmosphere and form. How, though, does a beginner know how to begin? High-flying friends on the 14th floor have been telling Tamara for years that she will end up restoring furniture and listening to Gardeners' Question Time. When the BBC's entire team decamped to the opposition, Tamara found herself sympathising with a tactic much discussed in her department. She found herself feeling even more sympathetic when the new team was presented as the BBC's bid for a younger audience. Feeling biddable, Tamara set the recorder on last week's midday episode and used the Easter markets' closure to discover what beginners should do when they begin. Hedge-Bonuses are not unadaptable, and she quite understood that the BBC had chosen to broadcast its programme from a building site in Manchester owned by a northern housing association. Gardening, her father had always told her, is gardening wherever you do it, and the same advice applies whoever you are. It did cross her mind that this particular community centre was rather too close for comfort to the Enterprise Zone where the 1990 bonus had been invested rashly in an over-valued white elephant of an office project. Nonetheless, she and the Manchester young would have to start somewhere. She had not expected them to start with quite so many condescending references to their listeners' enthusiasm, or so many nervous giggles to show that the questions were appealing to the young. The new panel almost persuaded her that all you have to do when a sub-contractor leaves you with rubble in the garden is to ask him to bring in top-soil and break up whatever is underneath. She then remembered her formative years as a construction sector analyst and wondered if Ann on the BBC panel understood why every builder prefers to take a short cut. She wondered even more when the panel told a young enthusiast to plant Jerusalem artichokes as a boundary round their allotment and use quinces as a screen to filter out cats. Hedge-Bonuses know about hedges: why land these beginners with artichokes which run everywhere and look absolutely miserable in winter on her uncle's farm? Why suggest quinces which would not even keep out her mother in shorts, let alone a cat on the run from the nearby motorway? The panel had much to say about assembling old drink cartons and cutting out their bottoms to make cheap seed boxes: Tamara remembered the young man at Goldmines who grew lillies in the office champagne crates back in the bubbly summer of 1987. When the panel moved on to trees, she wondered whether it ever had managed them? How could it recommend birches for 'youngsters to climb in?' When the young saplings would snap at the touch? When Ann proposed elder bushes so that the community could make elder champagne, Tamara wondered if she had ever seen the scores of unwanted elders which had seeded themselves so annoyingly on the embankment and in the back gardens along Tamara's morning journey to work on the London Tube. The more they talked, the more she saw through it. Why did these enthusiastic northern house-persons have to be told to grow a patch of brambles, break up their drink cartons, plant elder bushes and berberis and experiment with a turf roof? Tamara remembered Chris's photographs from Greenland on his last expedition to Save the Seal. He had photographed the turf igloos of Eskimo Greenland, maintained as mementos of a past. Were they really wanted in the Manchester area? Why did nobody mention roses and lilacs, daffodils, orange blossom and everything else which gardeners want to know how to grow elsewhere? Why would the younger generation be attracted by ideas which ignored beauty, quality and form: an aromatherapy garden, pitcher plants to catch the occasional wasp, and herb beds with quotations from outdated Herbals, inscribed on plaques? When it came to wild life, Tamara lost her remaining faith. The entire panel seemed to want to patronise the under-40s and make them attract wildlife, whereas sensible gardeners want to keep it out. The members even expanded on the belief that 'native trees attract native wild life.' Had they never seen butterflies on Chinese buddleias, or bullfinches playing merry hell on Japanese cherries? What are these 'natives,' anyway: is the BBC so horticulturally incorrect? At every turn, the willing Hedge-Bonus sensed condescension and mock 'enthusiasm' which was being fobbed off with gimmicky ideas that nobody had tried in life. The one thing she knows is what her father told her: beginners are beginners, on Manchester rubbish or among Cotswold ivy, and neither wants elder bushes or rabbits burrowing into a turf roof. This weekend, Tamara and her consort will not be listening to programmes which try to patronise questioners. It will take time, but she has decided to go for a track record, stick with it, and ignore the new siren voices mounted on a bandwagon for the sake of the change of image. Admittedly, Chris rather liked the idea of turfing the roof of the dower house outbuildings - until she pointed out that he would have to mow it, and that the last thing they wanted was worms above gutter level. In search of a mentor, she has turned instead to the senior head of her department and received the right advice for any new beginner: go out and buy proven titles by the late Arthur Hellyer, former FT gardening writer, and count yourself lucky that you can rely on a lifetime which made the mistakes before you. This week, Chris has found The Amateur Gardener in a Cheltenham bookshop and he and Tamara will be starting from the beginning with their radios firmly switched off.</p>

			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'CNN NEWSROOM,' 'CHANNEL ONE' STRIVE TO MAKE THE GRADE  </P> <P> Television news in the classroom?  </P> <P> It's a fine idea if made relevant and executed with care and vision.  </P> <P> Cable News Network appears to have done just that with "CNN Newsroom," its  weekday newscast for schoolkids that premiered in this morning's wee hours,  available for window-shopping by teachers who may want to regularly tape it and  show it to their students when school resumes next month.  </P> <P> Based on a preview tape, the decidedly unflashy "CNN Newsroom" is vastly  worthier than "Channel One," the controversial Whittle Communications newscast  that played like an extended music video when introduced in a five-week trial  in selected schools last spring. Tennesee-based Whittle says the same format  will apply for a full-blown national launching scheduled for March.  </P> <P> In September, CNN hopes to have its newscast in 1,000 schools, the same number  targeted by Whittle for next year.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, cable's TV-in-the-classroom landscape will expand even further with  the Aug. 21 start of "Short Subjects," 10-minute C-SPAN vignettes on the  government and topical issues, airing at 10 p.m. Mondays and designed for use  by high schools and colleges. And coming Sept. 18 is the Discovery Channel's  "Assignment: Discovery," weekday curriculum supplements of 20-25 minutes in  science, social studies and so on.  </P> <P> The C-SPAN and Discovery offerings bear monitoring. However, the battle to  watch is between the 15-minute, commercial-free "CNN Newsroom," which must be  taped off the air by schools or teachers at 12:45 a.m., and the 12-minute,  commercial-fraught "Channel One," which will be beamed by satellite directly  into classrooms.  </P> <P> Under Whittle's original plan, schools would receive $50,000 in electronic gear  only if they agreed to show "Channel One" to all their students, thereby  exposing an entire student body to the commercials. However, that requirement  has since been dropped by Whittle.  </P> <P> Far more than "Channel One," "CNN Newsroom" appears to be an excellent  opportunity to make education more meaningful by turning on junior and senior  high school kids to current affairs related to their school work. With this  newscast, CNN has an opportunity to provide a sterling public service and, as a  bonus, invest in its own future by accustoming young viewers to watch CNN.  </P> <P> Although the program is offered free, CNN says there is a charge of as much as  $1 a day for a daily curriculum guide for teachers that will be furnished  schools electronically upon request.  </P> <P> CNN has added "CNN Newsroom" to the duties of Jay Suber, executive producer of  the network's "This Week in Review." Fronted by fresh young co-anchors Brian  Todd and Cassandra Henderson, the new program seems understaffed with only two  reporters of its own. Their stories will air with pieces from CNN's regular  newscasts.  </P> <P> The 13 stories on the preview tape (which, CNN emphasized, was no more than a  "rehearsal") ranged from brief headlines to three minutes on the impact of AIDS  on teen-agers. Three other stories ran two to three minutes -- pretty hefty for  TV.  </P> <P> "CNN Newsroom" is at once professional and, unlike "Channel One," appealingly  unglossy and free of celebrity narrators, thumping music, blinding graphics and  blazing neon brightness. And, of course, there are no commercials.  </P> <P> The inclusion of four 30-second commercials per newscast is what has made  "Channel One" controversial and led to its condemnation by Bill Honig,  superintendent of public instruction in California, where Gahr High School in  Cerritos was one of six schools nationwide that participated in the "Channel  One" pilot project.  </P> <P> Echoing others objecting to commercials beamed into classrooms, Honig dismissed  "Channel One" as "forced commercialization in school" and vowed that any  California schools airing "Channel One" in the future would be docked state  funding in accordance with the time students spent viewing the newscast.  </P> <P> Right decision, wrong reason.  </P> <P> The commercials aren't what's wrong with "Channel One." On the contrary,  they're valuable. They should be studied in class, with students encouraged to  dissect and analyze them to better understand the sophisticated selling  techniques they employ.  </P> <P> What's wrong with "Channel One" is not commercials, only that it resembles the  commercials.  </P> <P> The most depressing element of the "Channel One" controversy is that so many  teachers publicly have expressed their support of the newscast. They've been  watching too much TV.  </P> <P> Apparently what we are seeing is the impact of one TV generation educating  another, one set of fried minds imposing their own TV-distorted perceptions on  a younger set of minds, teachers feeling it is fine for their students to watch  news that you can dance to.  </P> <P> The differences between "CNN Newsroom" and "Channel One" amount to more than  just a few jeans and candy commercials. The differences amount to an entire  philosophy of journalism.  </P> <P> The commercials are longer than most of the stories on "Channel One," which  teaches students that news is indigestible unless accompanied by such TVisms as  "exclusive" and a fast track of grinding music, horns, flashes and catchy  titles from "Flash Back" to "Fast Fact" to "Pop Quiz."  </P> <P> Anchor Lynn Blades: "OK, pop quiz: What major feature did Henry Ford leave out  of his first automobile?"  </P> <P> The answer: reverse gear.  </P> <P> OK, pop quiz: What major feature did Whittle leave out of "Channel One"?  </P> <P> The answer: intelligence.  </P> <P> "CNN Newsroom" promises a better future.  </P></p>

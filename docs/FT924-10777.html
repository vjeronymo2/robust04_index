			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Company News: UAP profits slide to FFr948m UNION des Assurances de Paris (UAP), France's largest insurance group, yesterday announced an unexpectedly steep 59 per cent fall in interim profits and a FFr1bn recapitalisation of Banque Worms, its troubled banking subsidiary. The combination of the sharp fall in profits - from FFr2.34bn in the first six months of 1991 to FFr948m (Dollars 184.07m) in the same period this year  -and the announcement of the terms of Banque Worms' recapitalisation depressed UAP's shares. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman, added to the gloom by saying that he did not anticipate an improvement for the second half. The announcement comes only a few weeks after Assurances Generales de France, another large insurer, announced that its profits had fallen in the first half. French insurers have been affected by intense competition and the impact of the economic slowdown on industrial investments and property holdings. UAP was also hit by the performance of Banque Worms, which posted an interim loss of FFr350m. The group announced in July that it planned to recapitalise Banque Worms, which has suffered from a fall in the value of its property portfolio and investments, but analysts had anticipated a smaller injection of perhaps FFr600m to FFr700m. Mr Peyrelevade said UAP was cutting overheads and broadening its business base in an attempt to return to profits growth. The group increased turnover by 22 per cent from FFr53.8bn to FFr65.6bn in the first half, but this was largely due to the contribution from Sun Life in the UK.</p>

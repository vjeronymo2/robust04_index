It circulated a statement saying that "as the two parties  have agreed upon the date of the complete withdrawal in  principle (August 31, 1994), Estonia hopes that Russia would  take urgent steps to implement this agreement.    During a press conference summing up the results of the  talks, head of the Russian delegation Vassily Svirin stated that  Russia had drafted a schedule, but did not pass it to Estonia  "because Estonia's irreconcilable position hampered the  coordination of documents on the protection of the retired  Russian servicemen and their families living in Estonia.    The statement also says that the Estonian government  "demonstrated good will and approved the decree defining the  procedure for obtaining residence permits by retired foreign  servicemen and their families."    The Estonian Foreign Ministry emphasized that the government  was motivated by a humane attitude to the individuals who find  it difficult to return to their homeland because Russia did not  create proper conditions for this, despite its moral and  juridical obligations.    The Estonian Foreign Ministry qualified the actions of its  government as a "brave step," because "the Russian troops are  still located in Estonia, while their strength, including the  number of retired servicemen, far exceeds the strength of the  Estonian defence forces."    As many as 2,500 Russian servicemen still stay in Estonia.  The Estonian Defense Forces have about the same number of  personnel, plus about 2,000 border guards. Estonia's voluntary  defense organization "Kaitseliit" has about 6,000 men.    There are about 11,000 retired Russian servicemen living in  Estonia.</p>

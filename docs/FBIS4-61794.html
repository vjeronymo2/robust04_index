			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received a statement made by the Lithuanian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning Russia's threats.    It indicates that a statement made by Pavel Grachev and  Russia's policy in general on the negotiations with Estonia show  disrespect toward the partner in negotiations and for  international law as well as for the processes and documents of  all Europe's members and participants, of which Russia itself is  one [sentence as heard].    Such statements made by high-ranking Russian officials  increase tension in the region and threaten the security of the  Baltic countries, the statement by the Lithuanian Ministry of  Foreign Affairs reads.</p>

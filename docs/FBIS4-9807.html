			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Elsa Suarez from the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] The government has held a nine-hour meeting to  discuss the significance of the signing of the ESAF [Enhanced  Structural Adjustment Facility] Agreement with the IMF. This  meeting was attended by 58 delegations from across the nation  and included representatives from unions, Army, police,  political parties, producers, businessmen, mayors, and media  directors.    At the beginning of the meeting, President Chamorro called  for a moment of silence for the recent assassinations of Javier  Barahona in Wiwili and Donaldo Colosio in Mexico. Chamorro later  asserted that stability will lead to the country's growth. She  also welcomed the recent visit by the IMF director and the  International Development Bank president, who granted additional  resources to support production. In addition to this, she  underscored the importance of signing the ESAF Agreement.    [Begin Chamorro recording] This agreement will enable us to  obtain additional resources that are unavailable to other  countries that have not complied with the economic plans and  commitments assumed with the international financial  institutions [IFI's]. Today, I have asked cabinet members to  brief you on the progress made in our negotiations with the  IFI's so that we can have your valuable contributions and  recommendations. [end recording]    During this meeting, all sectors presented their positions  regarding the ESAF accord. The president of the Central Bank  and the minister of finance presented a detailed report on the  current situation and ESAF conditions.    [Begin Central Bank President Jose Taboada recording] The  reforms now being negotiated with the IFI's have been discussed  extensively, and, as a result of successive negotiations, some  conditions or aspects that were considered vital during the  initial negotiations have been overcome.

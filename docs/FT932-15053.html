			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels falls 35% INCREASED administrative costs and interest charges resulted in a 35 per cent downturn in annual profits at Friendly Hotels. On turnover of Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 28.7m), the pre-tax line for the 12 months to December 27 amounted to Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.89m), struck after administrative costs of Pounds 14.5m (Pounds 12.7m) and interest payable of Pounds 1.55m (Pounds 1.19m). Nevertheless, Mr Henry Edwards, chairman of the hotel, catering and serviced offices group, said the outcome was a 'creditable performance' given the difficult trading conditions during the year. He said, however, that trading had improved in the early part of the current year. The level of advance bookings had shown an 'encouraging' increase recently. The 17 serviced office complexes achieved 'satisfactory' profits but margins remained under pressure. A provision of Pounds 2.16m (Pounds 2.44m) was taken below the line in respect of further disposals of quick service restaurants and Care Homes; one of each remain to be sold and no further provisions are anticipated. The recommended final dividend is raised to 3.5p bringing the total for the year to 5.7p (5.5p), covered twice by fully diluted earnings of 11.4p (15.5p) per share.</p>

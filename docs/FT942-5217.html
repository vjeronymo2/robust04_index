			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Arts: Today's Television Reporters on local newspapers spend their lives doodling in their notebooks while waiting for the bench to return in magistrates' courts; doodling in their notebooks while waiting for parish councillors to come out of closed session; and urging the secretary of the WI to remember who won the 'Most objects in a matchbox' competition this week. And yet - surprise, surprise - when Michael Palin finally fulfils a boyhood ambition and joins the staff of the Isle of Wight County Press, what is his first assignment? Occult rituals, of course. Still, Palin is an engaging presenter and director Roger Mills has a good track record, so Palin's Column should be entertaining (8.00 C4). BBC1 fights D-Day all over again, with a two-hour slab in the morning and four hours in the afternoon. The evening session begins at 7.00 with a 60-minute 'nostalgic tribute' of words and music called We'll Meet Again. From 9.40 there is commemorative material, beginning with News 44 in which Sue Lawley presents the news of 50 years ago today as though it were happening now.</p>

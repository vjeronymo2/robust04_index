			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Technology: Spinning a web - A Silicon Glen venture with big ambitions / British entrepreneurs 'NOT EVERY world leader is American.' This slogan on the cover of Spider Systems' marketing brochure sets the tone. The eight-year-old Edinburgh-based computer networking company thinks big and faces competition head on. 'All our competition is American,' explains Martin Ritchie, managing director and co-founder. 'We compare ourselves with them quite a lot. There are no role models for a company like Spider in Scotland, so we are forced to model ourselves on American companies.' Indeed, within the Scottish high-technology industry Spider Systems has become a corporate celebrity, a frequently cited if somewhat lonely example of an indigenous electronics start-up company. With 1992 revenues of almost Pounds 15m and 260 employees, Spider is now the largest and best-known entrepreneurial venture in Silicon Glen. Ritchie puts the lack of entrepreneurial activity in Britain down to cultural factors. 'In the UK we are a nation of employees rather than employers. As you grow up you don't think of becoming an employer.' Yet whatever the cultural barriers may be, Spider Systems has hurdled them. At the company's stylish Edinburgh headquarters there is an air of confidence rare in a company of its size. 'Image is important,' Ritchie maintains. The company logo, promotional materials and offices all reflect its ambitions. Spider's 'World Leaders' brochure is a bold example. Illustrated with the satirical Spitting Image puppets of such figures as John Major, George Bush, Margaret Thatcher and other political leaders, its message is clear; Spider Systems is, or at least aspires to be, a world leader in its field. However, the company's origins were pragmatic, rather than ambitious. When ICL closed down its software development facility at Dalkeith, near Edinburgh, in 1983, engineers were offered jobs in England. The five founders of Spider Systems chose instead to stay in their native Edinburgh. 'We didn't want to move so we decided to set up a company to do interesting and challenging work in what we believed was a growing field - computer networking.' Spider started with no external financing and picked up software development contracts from former ICL customers. 'We were selective about the work we did. It had to be interesting,' Ritchie recalls, 'otherwise there was no point.' In retrospect, Ritchie suggests, the founders' determination to find satisfaction in their work served the business well. 'We stuck close to what we were good at and specialised in networking.' If Spider had taken on a broader spectrum of work it might have become another of the many product development consultants that populate the Scottish high-tech industry, he believes. Spider made a 'conscious decision' not to set firm plans for the future. 'There was no four-year plan,' says Ritchie, 'the only thing a long-term plan tells you is what won't happen.' From its start in systems software, Spider moved into hardware development, taking on a development contract from a US computer company, now defunct. Gradually expanding its areas of operation, Spider launched the first product sold under its own name in 1985 - a device for monitoring personal computer networks that has formed the basis of subsequent products. 'The business plan was that if we could sell 23 units we would break even. We hoped to sell 50 and turn a profit.' In the event, Spider sold more than 1,000 of its SpiderMonitors, and the product became a key element of the company's business. Still, Spider maintained what Ritchie calls a 'low-risk approach' to expansion. Not until 1989 did the company draw on outside financing, receiving Pounds 3m in two rounds from UK venture capital groups. By British standards, Spider has set a record growth pace with annual revenues increasing by an average of 60 per cent per annum until last year. However, Ritchie points out that the company's growth has been slow compared with that of American competitors. 'Our rate of growth has been restricted by the pace of growth that our management could take.' When the company started, only two of the founders had any management experience and none had run a business, he notes. 'In British companies very few people had profit/loss and cash responsibilities at that time,' he adds. The Scottish Development Authority (since renamed Scottish Enterprise) provided Spider Systems with advice and assistance, putting the company in touch with a small business counsellor who became a non-executive director. SDA also helped Spider Systems to acquire its headquarters building by providing financing for the purchase of land and construction. While acknowledging the assistance of SDA, Ritchie makes clear that 'you don't build a company on the back of government support. It is good to feel that there is somebody behind you, but at the end of the day you do it by yourself'. Competition from richly financed US companies is the biggest challenge facing Spider Systems. David Simpson, chairman, has just returned from the US where he has been investigating sources of additional financing: a private placement or a public stock offering. Lack of funding proved a serious problem for Spider when it attempted to enter the US network equipment market. 'It was a case of not enough money spent, but too much money lost,' says Simpson. Spider withdrew from the US hardware market last year and sold US marketing rights to some of its products. However, Spider remains a strong competitor in the US networking software market, selling to many of the largest computer and computer software groups. Staying in touch with the US market is vital for Spider because new technology is adopted faster in the US than in Europe. 'By the time products are adopted in Europe, our US competitors already have 18 months' experience,' says Ritchie. After a rough year, in which the company recorded an Pounds 830,000 loss as a result of its US retrenchment, Spider is getting back into its stride. Although the recession has slowed growth, 'we are expecting 30 per cent growth this year, and are currently on plan,' says Ritchie. 'We have sorted ourselves out and we can get on with building the company. Simpson is determined that Spider will one day become a Pounds 100m business. 'We must not shy away from ambition. We cannot be defeatist,' he says. The series will continue next week.</p>

A unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate (which are the most recent, actual rates prior to the enactment of title IV) will be treated as representative of its emissions rate in Phase I in the absence of a substitution plan. This provides some flexibility to avoid using a single and perhaps unrepresentative year. All voluntary emissions rate reductions made after 1990 will be treated as reductions that would not otherwise have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters opposed the use of any post-1985 actual emissions rate in limiting allowance allocations to substitution units. Commenters argued the use of the 1990 actual emissions rate is arbitrary. Allegedly, this approach is arbitrary because it assumes that emissions-reducing actions that were taken before 1991 for economic reasons will not necessarily continue to be taken after passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, which changed the economics of such actions. Commenters stated that utilities might redirect low sulfur coal from the potential substitution unit to another unit and burn higher sulfur coal at the former unit. They also suggested that when the lower sulfur coal contract expires, the utility might contract for higher sulfur coal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are several problems with these commenters' arguments. A reduction in a unit's 1989 or 1990 emissions rate from 1985 could be the result of several types of actions, including the addition of pollution control equipment or the use of low sulfur coal. To the extent that the reduction reflects a capital investment in pollution control equipment, it is reasonable to assume that the equipment will probably remain in place and continue to be used. Even where the reductions were achieved through the use of low sulfur coal, the use of such coal or switching to high sulfur coal requires, in many cases, capital investment in new equipment. This reduces the likelihood that emissions reductions made before enactment of title IV would be reversed after passage of title IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, in section 404(b)(5), Congress required EPA to ensure that the reductions achieved under each substitution plan be ``the same or greater than'' the reductions that would otherwise be achieved without the substitution plan. 42 U.S.C. 7651c. Because of the paramount importance apparently placed on the goal of achieving intended emissions reductions, Congress required the Agency to adopt an approach that would ensure no fewer reductions with substitution plans than without such plans but that could result in more reductions with than without the plans. In light of this statutory requirement and the difficulty of determining what reductions would have been made without substitution plans, the Agency concludes that the 1989 or 1990 actual emissions rate is a reasonable proxy for a unit's Phase I emissions rate without the substitution plan. To the extent that the Agency's approach of using 1989 or 1990 emissions rate overstates the reductions that would be achieved without the plan, the approach errs in a direction that ensures achievement of the paramount statutory objective and is consistent with section 404(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In contrast, commenters' preferred alternative_using only 1985 actual or allowable emissions rates_would guarantee, in some cases, violation of the statutory objective of no fewer reductions with, than without, the plan. One particularly graphic example of that result is where a Phase II unit is voluntarily and permanently shutdown between 1985 and 1991 and is brought into Phase I as a substitution unit. Without a substitution plan, the unit would emit no sulfur dioxide and receive no allowances in Phase I. With the plan, the unit would still have no emissions but would be allocated a significant number of new allowances reflecting its 1985 emissions and other units could use the newly created allowances to authorize emissions that would not otherwise have been allowed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 38375 (noticing permit application with plan designating, as substitution units, Poston units 1, 2, and 3, which were permanently shut down in 1987). The Agency's use of the most recent actual emissions rates prior to passage of title IV is a reasonable approach to achieving the purposes of section 404(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters also argued that the Agency's approach penalizes those utilities that were ``environmentally *&blank;*&blank;* progressive'' and will discourage voluntary emissions reductions in the future. Comments of the Class of '85 Regulatory Response Group at 8 (submitted Feb. 10, 1994). However, each utility that made emissions reductions at Phase II units after 1985 and before the date (January 1, 2000) such reductions are required under title IV already benefits in Phase II of the Acid Rain Program, during which the units are allocated allowances reflecting in part the 1985 emissions rate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments of Northern States Power Company at 3 (noting that allocations to most of the utility's units in Phase I and Phase II exceed 1990 emissions levels). The issue here is whether, if such a utility elects to bring selected Phase II units into Phase I, the utility should receive additional benefit (in the form of extra allowances for pre-title IV reductions) that violates section 404(b)(5) of the Act. The Agency believes that the approach in the final rule is a reasonable implementation of section 404(b)(5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

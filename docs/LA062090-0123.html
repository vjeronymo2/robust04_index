			<p><P> June 20, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Occidental Is Disappointed: Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it was  "disappointed" that Standard &amp; Poor's had downgraded its credit rating the  day before, and reaffirmed its intention to maintain a $2.50-a-share annual  dividend. "Our financial position is strong, and our cash flow will continue to  support our longstanding dividend policy," the company said. "The lower debt  rating will have very little impact on Oxy as our debt maturity schedule has no  more debt coming due this year and only $52 million coming due next year," the  company added.  </P></p>

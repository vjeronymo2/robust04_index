			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Confidence 'falls through floor' in north BUSINESS confidence has plunged in the Yorkshire area and Humberside, according to preliminary figures collated by Leeds Chamber of Commerce. They show rapid deterioration in home markets and reversal of rising trends in exports. The data were collected before September 16, when sterling left the exchange rate mechanism. Mr Ian Kelly, assistant director of the chamber, said yesterday: 'We can assume from anecdotal evidence that the state of trade is now much worse. We have been bouncing along the bottom for months. We have now fallen through the floor.' The indicators, drawn from regular quarterly surveys of business carried out by all chambers in the region, come a day after 10 chambers of commerce in north-west England warned that serious losses of industrial capacity were likely if demand continued to fall. The regions jointly account for up to 18 per cent of UK gross domestic product and contain the bulk of northern England's manufacturing industry. Leeds chamber yesterday released the trend indicators from the combined results of the surveys in the form of balance figures - the difference between companies reporting increases in any factor and those reporting falls. Among manufacturers, the balance figure fell by 20 percentage points for home orders, 16 points for home deliveries, 22 points for export deliveries and 18 points for export orders from the previous quarter. All the figures are now negative - more companies reporting falls than increases - ranging from - 3 percentage points for export deliveries to - 17 points for home orders. In June, all four figures were positive and recovering strongly. Combined with the results from chambers in north-west England, the statistics point to a marked double dip to recession throughout the M62 motorway corridor - the main wealth-producing band of northern England. The Yorkshire and Humberside survey covered 529 manufacturers employing 70,616 people and 886 service companies with 91,554 employees. Service companies reported similar, but less severe, trends to manufacturers. Home sales fell 17 points to a balance of - 10 points, while home orders also fell 17 points, this time to - 12 points. The balance of export sales by service companies remained positive at 6 points, down from 16 points in June and 13 in March. Export orders fared worse - down to 3 percentage points from 17 points in June and 11 points in the first quarter. In all sectors, labour-shedding intensified, with yet more job losses forecast for the present quarter, particularly in manufacturing.</p>

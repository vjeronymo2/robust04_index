			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gevorg Gazaryan on news conference held by Vice </F> President Gagik Arutyunyan in Yerevan on 5 May -- recorded]    [Text] [Gazaryan] An Armenian delegation headed by the  Republic's Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan paid a two-day visit  to Iran. The delegation returned last night, and today the head  of the delegation briefed reporters on the high-level contacts  during which matters pertaining to the activation of  Armenian-Iranian ties were discussed.    Mr. Arutyunyan said that the construction of the bridge  [over  the Araks River] will also start on the Iranian bank of the  river. A new highway to Tehran is being planned, in which the  Armenian workers will participate. Agreements were concluded on  expanding the volume of future work. The  Turkmenistan-Iran-Armenia power line was also discussed. The  sides considered it necessary to activate the border trade.  However, at present, the most important issue is regulating the  border crossing for civilians. The Iranian side was also  interested in Armenia's information on the Iranian plane crash.  Taking this opportunity, Mr. Arutyunyan also briefed us on the  information available to him.    [Arutyunyan] In order to assess and arrive at conclusions at  least the following six questions must be answered:    1. What should the relevant Moscow services have done but  failed to do? As already documented, 50 minutes into the flight  from Moscow airport, the plane sharply lost altitude by 400  meters because of [words indistinct] near [name indistinct]  settlement. It refused to return to Moscow airport and continued  its flight. It must be clearly determined what the technical  condition of the plane was before departing Moscow [words  indistinct].    2. What should the relevant services in Georgia have done  but failed to do, or did them incorrectly? This too must be  determined, because according to records, the air traffic  controllers contacted the plane and gave it instructions and  fixed its coordinates. There are points here that need to be  further clarified. There is a need for a specialized  investigation of these records.    3. What should the relevant Armenian services have done but  failed to do, or did them incorrectly? According to our  information, the Armenian services were in constant contact with  the Georgian services and with the plane through a Russian plane  [words indistinct]. We must find definitive answers to all  these questions.    4. What could the relevant Karabakh services have done but  failed to do?    5. What should the relevant Azerbaijani services have done  but failed to do [words indistinct]?    6. And finally, what should have been done but was not done  properly or was done incorrectly by the plane's crew [words  indistinct]?    A final conclusion can be reached only after finding answers  to these six questions.    Having familiarized itself with our position and [words  indistinct], the Iranian side concluded that the investigative  work should continue to find answers to all these questions, and  based on these answers, to arrive at a conclusion without any  intention of using this accident for political purposes or for  [words indistinct].    [Gazaryan] At the end of the news conference, the Armenian  Vice President Gagik Arutyunyan replied to reporters' questions.</p>

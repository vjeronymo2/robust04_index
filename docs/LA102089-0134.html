			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CENTRAL;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY BALKS AT COUNCIL DIRECTIVE  </P> <P> Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, ordered by the City Council to take a  60-day leave of absence effective today, said he will defy the order and arrive  at work as he has every morning for the past nine years.  </P> <P> "I will continue to do my job, and I will continue to not allow violations of  law by council members," Cooper said. "They have no authority, no power to  place me on a leave with a four-person vote, and I am not going to accept that  vote."  </P> <P> Four council members voted Tuesday for the forced administrative leave. Two  other council members, both opposed to the action, walked out before the vote.  </P> <P> Councilman Ron May, who voted in favor, said his colleagues will "proceed to  take the legal and appropriate action necessary to ensure that our orders are  enforced."  </P> <P> The two council members who disagreed, Patricia A. McGuigan and Mayor Daniel H.  Young, said such an action is not legally binding because it requires five  council votes. And Cooper said the city charter does not give the council  authority to place the city attorney on forced leave.  </P> <P> "I don't see any legal possibility for them. They can hire a legal attorney if  they wish, if they want to waste their money," Cooper said. "But no court would  ever issue me an order to leave my office based on the charter as it currently  stands."  </P> <P> Cooper and others said the vote stems from the fact that three of the four  council members who voted for the leave -- John Acosta, Richards L. Norton and  Miguel A. Pulido Jr. -- have been in lawsuits involving the city. Norton  remains involved in suits over two swap meets he operates, for which the city  is seeking about $140,000 in fines, Cooper said. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

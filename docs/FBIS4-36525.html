			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abd-al-Jabbar al-Barghuthi from Tunis] </F>   [Text] Palestinian Leader Yasir 'Arafat has affirmed that  he will not deceive his people regarding the deteriorating  financial situation that the PLO is experiencing. In an  interview with AL-QUDS, he asked: How could I enter my country  with this deadly financial crisis? I must have something in my  hand with which I will be able to ease the suffering of my  struggling people. Nevertheless, the date of my return and the  return of the Palestinian leadership will be determined shortly,  God willing. We will announce this to all in due time.    'Arafat said: The donor states will meet tomorrow. I will  attend the meeting to secure approval for the aid that the donor  nations will provide when they set a definite date, despite  their several considerations and their relatively harsh  bureaucracy, which requires that they must await the result of  their study of our projects and our return to the homeland.    He added: We will remind the donor states that they must  keep their promises. We must not let them promise us and then  not keep their promises. They have promised us funds to help us  build our future state. It is the future and the obligations it  incurs. We must continue our efforts with these states to  persuade them of our projects, our country's infrastructure, and  the state it has reached.    On his view of the Palestinians' future and what the masses  should do to contribute to this future, Abu-'Ammar ['Arafat]  said: Our future is proceeding, God willing, in steady steps  toward better times. Having set foot on our chaste land, we  will achieve what we have all aspired to in terms of  establishing a state, stability, freedom, and democracy.  Naturally, this will be achieved through the cohesion and  solidarity of all the sons of our people, the ending of hatred,  and the unification of efforts to build with strong fists, which  will continue to work day and night. We will not look backward  but always forward, leaving behind us the false slogans and the  subversive and tendentious rumors.    Regarding the Israelis' attempts to impose a fait accompli  that Jerusalem is their capital, he said that holy Jerusalem is  in his conscience, mind, and heart. He said that as long as  there is a Declaration of Principles and an agreement to discuss  the issue of Jerusalem, whatever the Israelis say is for local  consumption and to satisfy the motives of various sectors of the  Jewish people.    He said: They use the Torah as a reference. We use what is  much more recent, the "Umari Covenant" [Pledge by Caliph 'Umar  Ibn-al- Khattab who opened Jerusalem in 637 A.D.]. Holy  Jerusalem is occupied and is an indivisible part of the  territories occupied in 1967. All the states of the world  approve this principle. They also approve the principle of  withdrawal from the occupied territories in return for peace.    He said that regardless of the passage of time, there will  be  no abandonment of our holy Jerusalem, the capital of our  independent state. There is no need for anyone to reassure us.  With our own efforts, no matter how tiring they may be, our  Jerusalem will remain for us.    On the rumors circulating regarding his health, the  Palestinian leader said that he is well and in good health. It  was a passing illness. He said: We will not pay attention to  the hostile rumors. We must always try with all our efforts and  with our people's very high ethics to turn the foes into  helpers. We are a people with high ideals and we love everyone.  Our honorable motives are to build our country. We extend our  hand in peace to the whole world without exception.    Concluding, he said: How great are our Palestinian people  with their ethics, morals, and struggle. How can I not be in  good health when the people are with me and I am with them? I  sincerely pray to God to enable me to do my best to serve this  magnanimous people.</p>

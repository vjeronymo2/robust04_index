			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Athens, Feb 19 (AFP)--Greece on Saturday [19  February] tightened its economic blockade against neighbouring  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]  despite bitter criticism over the shock move from its European  Community partners.    [Deputy] Finance Minister Alexandros Papadhopoulos said  Saturday that additional measures ordered Friday forbidding the  importation of all Macedonian products had been applied "in a  very satisfactory manner" and would "prevent any fraud."    Papadhopoulos also ordered Friday all Greek border customs  points to bar the passage of oil products destined for Macedonia.    The moves strengthened the trade embargo imposed Wednesday,  when Greece barred Macedonia access to the Greek port of  Thessaloniki, halting its oil imports, thereby drawing a volley  of criticism.    Greece's European Community partners sharply criticised the  embargo Friday, as Turkey, Bulgaria, Albania and Italy agreed to  set up a road and rail supply corridor to the country to be  coordinated in the Bulgarian capital.    Athens, which currently holds the revolving EC presidency,  is  due to explain its action Monday at a meeting of the community's  12 foreign ministers in Brussels, while the European Commission  is to examine its legality.    Papadhopoulos on Saturday reiterated earlier Greek claims  that the embargo was "legally founded with regard to national,  European and international rights," while the Greek Orthodox  church assured the government of its "total support."    The church's metropolitan, Monsignor Seraphim, said the move  was "approved by the overwhelming majority of the Greek  population" and showed the determination of the government to  "defend its just cause and its rights."    The action also drew media backing, with the influential  liberal daily I Kathimerini stressing in a front-page editorial  that Athens's would not bow to international pressure and that  it was now up to other EC countries to resolve the crisis by  putting pressure on Macedonia to cede to Greece's demands.    The move was designed to force Macedonia to change its name,  which Athens says is solely part of Greek heritage and implies  expansionist ambitions over the northern Greek province of  Macedonia, and to stop spreading "anti-Greek propaganda."    Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes, had said Friday while  attending a meeting in Athens of the EC "troika" of past,  present and future EC presidents -- Belgium, Greece and Germany  -- that the blockade was "naturally in contradiction" with the  Maastricht Treaty on European union.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, also attending the  troika meeting, demanded Greece immediately lift the embargo of  its land-locked neighbour in a sharp attack on Athens'  "extraordinary" unilateral action.    Most of Greece's EC partners recognised Macedonia shortly  before Athens took over the EC presidency in January, while the  United States recognised the country earlier this month.</p>

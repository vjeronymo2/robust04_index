			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure increases on ICI THERE was no let-up for ICI as the shares fell a further 24 to 1003p, weighed down by a large line of stock said to be overhanging the market. The latest slide comes in the wake of sharp profit forecast cuts last week. Traders said one securities house had taken on a block of around 2.5m shares at 995p and was unable to place the majority - although closing turnover of 4.2m suggested some had been offloaded. It is believed that US investment house Goldman Sachs had bought the shares from one institution. The house tends to be linked with any large ICI dealings because it had the misfortune of taking on Hanson's 2.8 per cent stake in ICI at 1,400p earlier this year and is believed to have some of those 20m shares still on its books. Powers volatile Electricity generators were volatile opening with worries over the impact of the coal dispute and closing firmly with the climbdown by the government. At the opening of trading, nervousness had been prompted by suggestions that the government's minority stakes in the generating companies could be used to fund additional payments for the miners. With no shortage of stock around, traders suggested such a move would undermine the shares. That speculation was ended by the government's afternoon decision to postpone mining closures, providing a boost to the generators' shares in busy, late trading. PowerGen, which opened at 261, fell 10 by mid-day, but rallied to close steady. National Power tumbled to 241 at one stage before recovering to 254p, a net gain of 3 on the day. Nervousness among generators prompted some brokers to reiterate their support for the Recs (regional electricity companies), among which, Eastern put on 7 to 387p, Manweb 7 to 456p and South West 10 to 431p. Steel active British Steel stood out as the day's most actively traded stock after turnover soared to more than 40m shares following a placing by James Capel. The shares eased  1/2 p to 60p. The agency broker was reported to have bought a block of around 17m shares just before lunchtime. But with James Capel refusing to make any comment on the deal, the seller remained a mystery, although the timing of the deal led to speculation about a US seller. The broker managed to place the stock during the afternoon at 60p, although initially with some difficulty, according to one analyst. Further selling from UK and other international holders of British Steel yesterday helped boost the day's hefty turnover. With the continued weakness in European steel prices, many UK investors remain sellers of the stock. S. G. Warburg was reported to have turned seller of the stock, having only just switched to a buy recommendation last week. Oil major BP saw a much-needed bounce on a recommendation from County NatWest, which was advising clients to switch out of Shell Transport. After speaking to the company County feels BP's cost-cutting and disposals programme is pointing to a faster debt reduction than most analysts had predicted. Meanwhile, County argues that sterling's weakness has pushed Shell up to a price/earnings ratio of more than 18 times, a level that cannot be justified by the oil group's recovery potential. BP lifted 7 1/2 to 230p on turnover of 7.2m shares and Shell, still benefiting from currency problems, rose 7 to 539p. Exploration group Enterprise firmed 2 to 410p after announcing that the US Securities and Exchange Commission had declared effective its previously announced offering of 6.75m American depositary shares at Dollars 20 each. The offering, which should be completed by October 23, was underwritten by a syndicate led by Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Warburg Securities, the company said. Reuters Holdings was one of the few dollar-influenced stocks that failed to benefit from the growing strength in the US currency. Investors are still worried that the stock is overvalued despite recent falls. Also, there is some concern ahead of an international conference call on Thursday. The shares drifted 7 to 1,227p. Elsewhere in international stocks, Glaxo was off 7 at 779p with hints of good news on a rival product. SmithKline Beecham is to announce third-quarter figures today and there were suggestions that the results would contain good news on SmithKline's anti-emetic drug Kytril. That would impact on Glaxo's Zofran. SmithKline 'A' shares rose 4 to 512p. Wellcome improved 12 to 961p on dollar considerations following recent upgrades. BAT Industries gained 14 to 852p. More analysts moved in on Barclays and the shares, which had tumbled at the end of last week, slipped a further 16 to 301p. Agency broker James Capel was said to have produced the most gloomy estimate of forthcoming profits, shifting to a Pounds 150m loss for 1992 from a previous estimate of Pounds 300m profits. Meanwhile, HSBC remained strong and improved 16 to 475p. The far eastern bank is always a beneficiary of a stronger dollar as the Hong Kong currency is directly linked to the US currency. The beginning of a series of institutional presentations from Guinness brought little cheer to the drinks group, the shares retreating 10 to 517p. Scottish and Newcastle recovered from recent price war worries to add 6 to 396p. Bass continued under a cloud, the shares slipping 8 to 510p. A quiet food manufacturers' sector was enlivened by buyers in Unilever, up 12 at 1065p, and Tate and Lyle, ahead 5 at 347p. In telephone networks, Vodafone, responding to its recent 'Low-Call' sales push, added 2 to 341p. Cable and Wireless jumped 9 to 598p, the strong dollar attracting investors as well as a recommendation from Hoare Govett that the group would be a major beneficiary from the improving political and economic situation in China. First day's trading in Vardon saw the leisure attractions group close at a 2p premium above the 45p placement price, although thin trading volume was reported. Low-level hints that Forte was discussing the sale of its Gardner Merchant subsidiary to the catering group's management failed to hit a chord in the market, although the shares later rallied to close 4 ahead at 152p. Negative comment continued to eat into Rank Organisation, the shares off 6 at 508p. Courtaulds Textiles lifted 13 to 464p following a successful visit to the company by analysts last week and talk that a large buyer was in the background. However, volume was slim. British Airways fell 4 to 294p, on reports of a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew profits downgrading. The securities house was said to have trimmed the current year figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds 370m. Conglomerate Williams Holdings, eased 2 to 257p, after the company's broker S. G. Warburg was reported to have trimmed forecasts. Among aerospace stocks, British Aerospace was hit early by press reports that the Pounds 40bn oil-for-arms Al-Yamamah defence contract on which it is the lead contractor, would not proceed. They ended 6 lower at 132p, on turnover of 4.8m. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (122).

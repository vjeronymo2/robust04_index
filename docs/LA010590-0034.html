			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> COFFEY STICKS AROUND TO SCORE WINNING GOAL  </P> <P> Paul Coffey escaped a high-sticking call and scored the game-winning goal  Thursday night at Pittsburgh, giving the Penguins a 4-3 victory over the  Vancouver Canucks.  </P> <P> Coffey's teammate, Mario Lemieux, broke his team record by extending his  point-scoring streak to 29 games, longest in the NHL this season, with two  assists.  </P> <P> Coffey slapped in Mark Recchi's pass from the top of the left faceoff circle  for his 15th goal. The shot went in off a goal post to give Pittsburgh its  third win in four games and drop Vancouver's road record to 4-14-2.  </P> <P> The Canucks argued that Coffey never should have been around to score the  winning goal. Rob Brown got a major penalty and a game misconduct for  high-sticking Canuck captain Paul Reinhart.  </P> <P> The Canucks contended it was Coffey's stick, not Brown's, that caught Reinhart  in the chin, opening a cut that required nine stitches to close.  </P> <P> Coffey pleaded not guilty, although he acknowledged the contact with Reinhart.  </P> <P> "It wasn't even that much of a hit," Coffey said. "It was just a collision. I  didn't put anything into it. I hit him with my shoulder and his own stick came  up and caught him."  </P> <P> Detroit 4, Quebec 1 -- Gerard Gallant's power-play goal 59 seconds into the  third period snapped a tie and sparked a three-goal spurt for the Red Wings at  Detroit. Shawn Burr increased the lead to 3-1 and Jimmy Carson added a  power-play goal with 5:28 remaining.  </P> <P> Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Ray Bourque's 45-foot goal with 1:41 remaining helped  the Bruins to victory at Boston. Bob Gould, Craig Janney and Bob Sweeney had  the other goals for the Bruins.  </P> <P> St. Louis 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Gino Cavallini scored with 2:16 left in overtime  to give the Blues the victory. Cavallini converted from the right faceoff  circle off a three-on-two break, off a pass by Paul MacLean. St. Louis scored  all its previous goals in the third period after Philadelphia took a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Minnesota 8, New York Rangers 2 -- Brian Bellows scored three goals and Dave  Gagner added two as the North Stars handed the Rangers their fifth consecutive  road defeat.  </P></p>

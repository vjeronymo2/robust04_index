			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. GANG EPIDEMIC  </P> <P> The numbers say it all. More than 2,700 people have been killed by gang members  in the 1980s in L.A. County and 15,000 more have been seriously injured. It  seems that no matter what we do to prevent gang violence, the number of  killings per year continues to increase. So many innocent people are needlessly  killed or seriously injured because of gang violence, because they happen to be  at "the wrong place at the wrong time."  </P> <P> What, then, is the right place at the right time? I'm often afraid to walk down  a busy street, or anywhere else for that matter, for fear of being shot in the  cross fire of two rival gangs. Nowadays, you never really know what might  happen and when. I feel for those who live their lives in fear because I can  empathize, but we shouldn't be made to live that way.  </P> <P> I'm happy to know that several new programs have been created to protect  "at-risk" children, strengthen gang-prevention programs, etc., but I also  realize that these programs cost a lot of money, which we don't have a lot of.  </P> <P> GINA NAPENAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

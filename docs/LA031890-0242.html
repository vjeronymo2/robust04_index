			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ART NOTEBOOK: ANCIENT, ARCHITECTURAL, CONTEMPORARY TRIO  </P> <P> The triptych, it seems, is ubiquitous in art these days, so it's about time  someone staged an art exhibition that is itself a kind of triptych. The trio of  exhibitions currently on view at the art galleries of Cal State Northridge is  such an event. It juxtaposes a show of some 60 ancient Greek vases from the  local collection of Hanita and Aaron Decter with an utterly contemporary neon  and adobe rumination on Ulysses by the Pasadena artist Jan Sanchez. "Odyssey"  travels by way of earthen constellations lit with electric stars, past a temple  of Zeus with crumbling adobe columns and a neon core -- and through a colorful,  pulsating Hades, as gaily surreal as a miniature golf course. At one point in  the journey, a doorway opens to the third element in the triple-header: Steven  Appleton's provocatively hung architectural fragments from demolished Los  Angeles industrial buildings, which take on an almost archeological antiquity  next to the other two shows.  </P> <P>  Three exhibitions at CSUN Art Galleries, 18111 Nordhoff St., Northridge. (818)  885-2226. Through March 30. Open noon to 4 p.m. Monday; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Tuesday through Friday; special Saturday hours March 24, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.  </P> <P>  MULTIPLE MOSES: Welcoming accident, chance and "magic" in his work, Ed Moses  has long been an artist whose hallmark is experimentation. An intimate glimpse  into that process, in all its revealing trial and error, is provided by a show  of some 30 artist's proofs and trial prints by Moses at the Santa Monica  Heritage Museum -- which alternates exhibitions of contemporary art with more  historical themes. Honored as the museum's artist of the year, Moses opened his  personal archives to the institution. Moses, who does not routinely venture  into printmaking, calls the work -- which spans the 1980s -- the "fall-out"  from his experiments with that medium; but with a few exceptions, it's hard to  peg any of these as mistakes. Explorations is more like it.  </P> <P>  "Ed Moses: Works on Paper" through April 1 at Santa Monica Heritage Museum,  2612 Main St., Santa Monica. (213)392-8537. Open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Thursday  through Saturday, noon to 4 p.m. Sundays.  </P> <P>  SPANISH EYE: A show of work by the Catalan artist Perejaume at the  Meyers/Bloom Gallery has turned into a preview glimpse of the 1990 Venice  Biennale, which takes place in Italy this June. At the gallery opening of the  Perejaume show, the artist had just learned he has been selected as one of  Spain's three representatives to the "Aperto," the prestigious invitational  division of the summer-long international contemporary art fair.  </P> <P> A poetic foreigner whose work looks refreshingly different from that at the  forefront of current U.S. art dialogues, Perejaume produces clean-cut,  mixed-media paintings, photographs and installations that often draw on  classical artists' frames to literally explore the "framing" of perceptions and  experience.  </P> <P>  Perejaume, through March 31 at the Meyers/Bloom Gallery, 2112 Broadway, Santa  Monica. (213) 829-0062. Open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday.  </P> <P>  ARTIST BOOKWORMS: Ever since the 1970s, when artists including Ed Ruscha and  Claes Oldenburg seized upon the handmade book as a fresh way to produce  accessible art that was literally off the wall, artist's books have been a  sideline interest of many art aficionados. Now UCLA is showing a traveling  retrospective of the Southern California bookmaking arts of the 1980s,  sponsored by the Los Angeles-based Alliance for Contemporary Book Arts. The  show includes both artists' books and books made according to vanishing -- or  emerging -- bookbinding and papermaking arts, with a generous emphasis on  student work.  </P> <P>  "A Southern California Decade: An Exhibition of Contemporary Books" through  March 31 in the lobby and special collections department of the University  Research Library at UCLA. 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Saturday.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Cambodian King Norodom Sihanouk by Nayan </F> Chanda in Phnom Penh; date not given: "The Centre Cannot Hold"]    [Text] How do you see the Khmer Rouge strategy?    The Khmer Rouge have taken Treng, which was the logistical  base of the royal army. It is a threat to [the provincial  capital] Battambang. It is difficult to foresee what the Khmer  Rouge will do. Will they try to take Battambang? Or would they  rather set up a state adjacent to Thailand stretching from the  Preah Vihear temple through Oddar Meanchey to Bantey Meanchey  and the northern shores of the Tonle Sap lake? That way they  will have [an area rich in] timber, gemstones, rice and fish.  The advantage is that they are very friendly with the Thais,  especially the military. Once that is consolidated they will  try to capture Battambang and Angkor Wat [temples]. Angkor is  more than Preah Vihear. Angkor is a symbol of the country, its  national grandeur. It will have an extraordinary psychological  impact. It is like having control of 15 provinces.    What made you propose a roundtable with the Khmer  Rouge?    When I saw that things were going badly in Pailin, I quickly  proposed a new peace plan, I invited Khieu Samphan to come stay  in the palace. But he said that the palace now has ceased to be  neutral. Now I propose a cease-fire with the Khmer Rouge. But  I wonder whether it is not a bit too late because the Khmer  Rouge must be saying `we must take advantage of the  demoralisation of the [government] soldiers.' I know that they  wanted to join our government in order to sabotage our work and  to try to destroy our fortress from inside. But, faced with a  fast moving war, the monarchy is crumbling. At least we will  have a chance to delay a total defeat and loss of Cambodia for  some years if we let them share power.    How strong is the Khmer Rouge?    A leader of the government here, I won't name him, says the  Khmer Rouge numbers 3,000-4,000 maximum and the Khmer Rouge  problem is a minor problem. But the presence of Khmer Rouge in  the country is like a leopard's spots. They are in Kompong  Cham, Kompong Speu, Kampot and even in Sihanoukville--they are  everywhere. Even near Phnom Penh they have sanctuaries. I  think the Khmer Rouge has at least 20,000 men.    And what is the state of the royal army?    I know that the Cambodian army is very large. There are  months when they are not paid. The soldiers have nothing to eat,  they suffer from malaria, they have poor supply lines. We have  a military organisation that is totally unique. In other  countries there is a pyramid organisation of armies. At the  bottom in large numbers are soldiers, and above them in  decreasing numbers are corporals, sergeants, lieutenants,  captains, majors, and colonels. At the top are generals--only a  few in number. Here in Cambodia we have an inverse pyramid. The  other day I saw Michael Costello, Australian deputy foreign  minister. He told me that Second Prime Minister Hun Sen  admitted to him it was difficult to find soldiers. When he goes  to inspect the army he only finds officers.    What can the West do?    Costello told me, `If the situation is desperate, instead of  letting your royal regime crumble we will consider the  possibility of giving something in terms of weaponry.' But he  did not promise anything. He spoke in his personal capacity and  asked for my reaction. I would appreciate very much [the  West's] military aid, but we should set up elite units to fight  the Khmer Rouge, because weapons--like bread--distributed to old  units will disappear. It is better to create new units rather  than select soldiers from the existing units. But that too is  difficult. When one creates an elite unit it has to be with  volunteers. The volunteers will ask: fight the Khmer Rouge for  what? To maintain a corrupt regime? To widen the gap between  the privileged and the poor?    How are relations with Vietnam?    The Vietnamese move border markers deeper into our  territory,  dig canals inside our territory, creating a new border line.  Digging canals has been an old tactic, but now the border  markers are walking, they are walking towards the west ... they  know we cannot take care of two fronts simultaneously. It is  terrible.    What role would you like to play?    More and more people are asking me, even from the  parliament,  to rebuild the Sangkum Reastre Niyum [an all-party platform  Sihanouk had built in the 1960's]. But it is too late.  Ranariddh told me yesterday Funcinpec [National United Front  for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia]  is ready to follow you, if you rebuild the Sangkum. But I am 72  and sick. If I were 40 or even 50 years of age, I could have  taken in hand all these things. I could have carried out reforms  and even brought the Khmer Rouge in. What I can do now is  prevent the Khmer Rouge from being branded outlaws.    [We will have problems] if the Khmer Rouge creates a stretch  of territory in the north that will be open to free movement by  the Thais. Thus, the Thais and the Khmer Rouge will gain, but  it is Cambodia which will die. On the east the border posts are  walking. It's like in Macbeth, it's the forest that walks trying  to fell us, bring death to the Kingdom of Cambodia. Whether it  is kingdom or republic does not matter. I assure you. You can  write I am ready to have a republic as long as Cambodia is  saved. For me it is Cambodia and not the monarchy.</p>

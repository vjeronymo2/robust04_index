			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Bankruptcy threat to Tiphook's Montague A bankruptcy petition has been issued against Mr Robert Montague, founder and chief executive of Tiphook, less than a month after it was revealed he would get total payments of Pounds 1.34m for a year when Tiphook lost Pounds 331.1m. It is understood the petition concerns a Pounds 2.2m loan facility from a leading UK bank. The news emerged during a raucous annual general meeting, at which shareholders complained bitterly about the Pounds 6.4m of payments to directors of the troubled transport leasing group. The Lord Chancellor's office confirmed that a bankruptcy petition was issued yesterday by Oxford County Court to Alsop Wilkinson, the legal representatives of the petitioner, after consideration by a district judge. The petition has not yet been served on Mr Montague, but it is listed for a court hearing on October 28. Tiphook said: 'it is a matter entirely for Mr Montague'. Alsop Wilkinson would not comment. Mr Montague denied that he faced any financial difficulties. During the AGM, shareholders in Tiphook focused on their own financial problems, as their company retains more than Pounds 1bn of debt after selling its container business, and it retains two loss-making businesses. Mr Rupert Hambro, the outgoing chairman, admitted that the Pounds 6.4m of directors' payments for last year was wrong. 'There is no justification for this', he said. But he claimed that Tiphook was striving to redress its notorious cost base, which included a 139ft yacht. Shareholders, including proxy votes, supported him by approving all the AGM resolutions on a poll, although a potentially embarrassing show of hands was avoided. Mr Montague evaded the press by arriving early at the Royal Automobile Club, but shareholders caught up with him with a vengeance. One said: 'Kingsley Amis coined the great British phrase 'Sod the general public', but this company seems to be following the phrase 'Sod the shareholder''. The directors were congratulated for a report described as 'a detailed record of their incompetence'. Mr Montague was questioned about his financial health by Mr Paul Snook, of accountants Buchler Phillips, representing a Lehman Brothers' shareholding. Mr Snook described the bankruptcy petition as a serious issue for a company which has said Mr Montague was vital to its future.</p>

			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: AEG expects to break even next year AEG, the troubled Daimler-Benz subsidiary, will break even in 1993 at the latest, according to Mr Ernst Georg Stockl. Although group turnover will fall this year as a result of withdrawing from cable and office equipment manufacturing, sales had already risen 6 per cent in the first four months of 1992. Mr Stockl said he expected a 10 per cent overall increase to DM12bn (Dollars 3.54bn) for the full year, compared with DM14bn for 1991. Confirming losses of DM624m in 1991, he said the only divisions to make any profits were the core electrical components and transmission business and the domestic appliance subsidiary. Responding to persistent rumours that AEG appliances is to be sold, Mr Stockl said it was working at full capacity and would remain part of the group.</p>

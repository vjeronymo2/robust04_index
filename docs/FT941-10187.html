			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / International Company News: CBS ends record year on a strong note CBS yesterday announced a 39 per cent increase in fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 46.4m as the top-rated US broadcast network completed a record-breaking financial year on a strong note. Full-year profits ended at Dollars 326.2m, up from Dollars 81m in 1992 and the best result in the company's history. While the latest three-month earnings failed to match CBS's accomplishments in the third quarter, when the company earned Dollars 118.3m, profits in that period were boosted by several one-off factors. Once again the best performance within the group came from the CBS Television Network, which has consistently led the other three networks  - ABC, NBC and Fox - in recent viewing figures. Mr Laurence Tisch, chairman, said CBS was now close to being the most watched network in prime-time, daytime and late night television, a feat achieved only once before by a US network. Higher ratings usually lead to bigger profits because they allow networks to charge higher rates for television advertisements. CBS has been particularly successful in late night programming since September's debut on the network of an 11.30pm weekly talk show featuring Mr David Letterman, currently the most popular of the many talk show hosts on US television. The one cloud on CBS's horizon is its sports programming. Although the company should draw big audiences for its broadcast of this month's Winter Olympics from Lillehammer, Norway, last year CBS lost the rights to televise both professional baseball and American football. The loss of the contract to televise one of the two American football leagues, which was awarded to Fox Television for Dollars 1.5bn, was a particularly grievous blow. The 1994-95 season, which starts in September, will be the first time CBS has not shown American football since the 1950s when the network pioneered television coverage of the sport.</p>

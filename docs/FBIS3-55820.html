			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Polyakov] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 12 TASS -- As Clinton moves from  Western to Eastern Europe, the leaders of former Soviet  republics - Russia, Ukraine and Belarus - are preparing for his  visit by comparing noted and making last-minute moves ahead of  the arrival of the American President on the former Soviet  territory.    Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk is the first to meet the  U.S. President during a brief stop-over in Kiev's Borispol  airport on Wednesday.    The brief exchange between the U.S. and Ukrainian presidents  in Kiev is expected to set the tone for the tripartite summit in  Moscow on January 14, in which Clinton, Yeltsin and Kravchuk  hope to discuss and sign documents which will ease relations  between these three countries complicated by Ukraine's stance on  the nuclear weapons deployed on its territory. Incidentally,  Yeltsin had to issue a formal invitation to Kravchuk to arrive  in the Russian capital, whereas a short time ago a telephone  message was sufficient to bring former leaders of any of the  Soviet republic to the USSR capital.    Meanwhile, Belarusian Leader Stanislav Shushkevich has  already arrived in Moscow for talks with President Yeltsin.  Although a report from Minsk says the visit is mainly due to  concentrate on bilateral relations between Russia and Belarus,  the two leaders will pay no less attention to comparing their  strategic notes and coordinating positions with a view to the  U.S. President's visit to Moscow which is due to begin later on  Wednesday.    Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were the first to sign an  agreement in December 1990 which put an effective end to the  Soviet Union and initiated the creation of the Commonwealth of  Independent States, which most of the other former Soviet  republics, except for the Baltic countries, joined thereafter.  However, frictions continued to exist between the three Slav  countries, the former Soviet nuclear weapons being one of the  points of contention.    Another debatable point is these countries' differing  attitudes to NATO's proposed extension to the east.    It can be surmised with a considerable degree of certainty  that these issues will feature prominently both in bilateral  talks between Yeltsin and Clinton and particularly in the  tripartite summit in which Yeltsin, Clinton and Kravchuk will  seek to come to terms on these pressing questions.</p>

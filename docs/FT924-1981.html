			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Italy (2): No hurry to re-enter the ERM - Why the lira has been kept in free float since September BRITAIN AND Italy are both in the same boat with their currencies floating outside the European Community's exchange rate mechanisms. Yet in public their respective positions on re-entry are diametrically opposite. The British, consistently reluctant to surrender the ultimate initiative on monetary policy, insisted at the outset that they were in no hurry to return to the ERM. In contrast, the Amato government immediately said it would seek re-entry as soon as possible. The Italian view was not surprising. Being inside the ERM has always been seen, at least by the Bank of Italy, both as a necessary discipline and an essential element in the battle against inflation. The politicians for their part never seriously worried about surrendering sovereignty to Brussels because Italy had always been a committed European and federalist in outlook. With the financial markets remaining unsettled, the positions of the two countries in practice have become much closer. It suits neither to re-enter the ERM in a hurry - at least in its present form. Both the Bank of Italy and the Italian treasury have said as much in recent weeks. Indeed, it has been advantageous for the Italian authorities to keep the lira in free float since September, benefiting from what one newspaper called the 'serenity of the excluded'. The Bank of Italy has not had to intervene to support the lira which has been allowed to seek its own level without a formal fixing and, as in Britain, interest rates have begun to come down. It is now known that the defence of the lira cost the Bank of Italy L30,000bn in reserves and that support from the Bundesbank and Belgian central bank was to the tune of L27,330bn - the bulk coming from the Germans. At the end of September net reserves had fallen to their lowest since 1978, standing at L32,917bn against L108,581bn 12 months before. By the end of October they had climbed back to L44,157bn. For almost three weeks after the lira was devalued by 7 per cent against the D-mark, the currency appeared to be in free fall. At one stage the lira was being quoted close to 1,000 against the D-mark. However, the Bank of Italy proved right in its judgment that was an offshoot which would be corrected and by late October the parity had fallen back. In recent weeks it has been oscillating between L850-880 - equivalent to a 15 per cent devaluation against the D-mark. The Italian authorities remain bitter about the way that the lira was forced to devalue alone on the weekend of September 12-13, convinced that a major opportunity was lost for a more general realignment of the ERM (and a consequently more responsive drop in German interest rates). The Bank of Italy in particular had linked the credibility of its policies to defence of the lira within the ERM. Although obliged by circumstances to reverse this position, the Italians have good justification to say they were given insufficient support from its EC partners and the subsequent turmoil was the price paid by everyone. At the time of being forced out of the ERM, the government insisted this would be a temporary status and that Italy would return as soon as possible. Their commitment to the ERM was undoubtedly genuine, but the authorities also emphasised it for the very practical reason that they needed to sustain international credibility amid fears that fiscal policy might be relaxed and inflation return as a result of devaluation. The same thinking lay behind the subsequent request for an Ecu8bn stand-by facility from the EC. No timetable was formulated in public; but unofficially, the government believed it would be able to seek re-entry once the 1993 budget had been approved, the EC loan had been negotiated and the currency markets had settled to give a stable judgment of the lira's parity. Initially, this pointed to somewhere between mid-December and early January. The 1993 budget, raising an extra L93,000bn in fresh taxes and revenues, will have gone through parliament by the time this survey appears. Although the 1993 public sector deficit will only be held down to this year's levels, equivalent to over 10.5 per cent of GDP, for the first time structural changes have been introduced to curb spending. These will affect four key areas which have traditionally drained the treasury - public health, pensions, the civil service and local administration. The reforms will also have a cumulative effect in ensuing years. Clear evidence of tackling the budget deficit has been, and will continue to be, a pre-condition for Italy's credibility in the markets. Indeed, one of the main factors behind the weakness of the lira was the markets' view that not enough was being done to tackle Italy's deteriorating public finances. The Bank of Italy has been able to cut the discount rate twice since the high defence rate of 15 per cent introduced in September. At 13 per cent, rates are still high and must come down further. Nevertheless, each percentage point reduction reduces by nearly L15,000bn the annual cost of debt service - a cost which next year will account for the entire public sector deficit. But the other conditions for re-entry have yet to be satisfied. Negotiations on the EC loan have been slow and the currency markets have far from settled. Added to this, the very nature and stability of the ERM have come into question, and the lira's re-entry is an integral part of this issue. Italy, after all, has been able to devalue by a far greater percentage than would have been permitted by its partners back in September as part of a broad EC currency realignment. France, for instance, is concerned that with Italy accounting for almost 14 per cent of its total imports, the lira enjoys too great a competitive edge on its current devaluation. On the other hand, the lira cannot re-enter at a parity which the markets would deem as too high. This would merely prompt speculation - and perhaps force the Italian currency once again out of the ERM, and so further damage the credibility of the system as a whole. This suggests that without a change in the ERM rules, Italy may find it more convenient to keep the lira floating while stating it wishes to join the system 'as soon as possible'.</p>

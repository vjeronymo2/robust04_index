			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Posco opened to foreign stakes SHAREHOLDERS of Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the South Korean steelmaker, yesterday approved a proposal to allow foreigners to acquire up to 8 per cent of the state-affiliated company. Individual foreign investors will not be allowed to have a shareholding of more than 1 per cent under the amended by-law, which becomes effective today. The Korean government, which controls 35 per cent of Posco, opened the company to foreign investment to try to revive the country's sluggish stock market by attracting more capital from abroad. The extraordinary shareholders' meeting also approved the appointment of Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, the vice-chairman, as the Posco chairman. He replaces Mr Park Tae-joon, who resigned last week for political reasons and becomes honorary chairman. Mr Chung Myung-sik, Posco president, was promoted to vice-chairman, while Mr Park Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic planning, will become president. Mr Hwang said his goal was to make Posco the world's biggest steelmaker by 1996 by increasing exports, which now account for 30 per cent of the company's production. Export growth will focus on south-east Asia, already Posco's second-largest foreign market after Japan, and China. Posco will also build a steel plate mill in Shanghai and steel service centre in Dalian. Analysts predict that Posco's sales and earnings will remain flat this year, but profits could grow by 40 per cent next year to Won210bn as financial costs decrease due to the completion of the company's production facilities.</p>

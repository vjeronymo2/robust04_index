"On the morning of January 10, 1994 armed groups of  Zemessargs (Latvian paramilitary units) seized several  facilities on the outskirts of Riga. Major-General Nikolay  Taylakov, deputy commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops,  and Major-General Anatoliy Vodopyanov, assistant to the  commander of the Northwestern Group of Troops for work with  personnel, arrived at the scene of the incident. In return to  their demand to leave the seized facilities, the chairman of the  Vidzeme district gave on order to arrest the generals. The  Russian generals were handcuffed and put into a car which drove  towards the Russian border. Commander of the Northwestern Group  of Troops Colonel-General Leonid Mayorov informed the Russian  defence minister about the incident. Defence Minister Army  General Pavel Grachev issued an order to put Russian troops  stationed in Latvia on alert and tighten security at the  facilities and premises belonging to the Northwestern Group of  Troops. On alert were also placed air-borne troops and military  cargo aviation. The commander of the Northwestern Group of  Troops informed Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis about the  incident. The president expressed bewilderment over the  incident, gave orders to free the detained generals and offered  his apologies. By 17:00 the Russian generals and all seized  facilities were freed.    The Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation demands an  immediate investigation and punishment of those guilty. Any  violent or unlawful acts against the Russian servicemen,  military units and facilities of the Russian Army will be  checked in the most decisive manner. Responsibility for all  possible consequences in this case will rest with the local  authorities who must ensure a normal situation around the  Russian military units," the statement said.    The generals were freed only after the intervention of the  Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities sent their apologies  for the incident and assured the Russian Embassy that the  facilities were being unlocked.    Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car  of  the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the  ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed  the car to pass but waived their guns at it.    The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign  Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous  provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian  authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such  incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an  attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.</p>

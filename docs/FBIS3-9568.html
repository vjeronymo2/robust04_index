			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Lubor Kohout: "From Baudys's Realm of Fantasy </F> II"]    [Text] We recently reported that a bank of viral strains  was destroyed on 25 February under extraordinary security  measures on the order of Defense Minister Antonin Baudys. It  had been stored in a building leased by the Army to the Klinlab  limited company. Then, at the beginning of March, under similar  conditions, Army experts destroyed yet another "common" batch of  viral strains stored in the Military Research Institute in  Techonin. The defense minister, Chief of the General Staff  Nekvasil, and other military top brass have described the two  banks as common batches that had nothing to do with the  development of biological weapons. Although, according to the  claims made by the gentlemen from the Defense Ministry and the  General Staff, the two viral banks were stored safely and there  was no risk of a leak or a potential threat to the population  from the stored viruses, the subsequent conduct by the  ministerial and military top brass is tantamount to the contrary.    The Stresovice bank of viruses was stored in a so-called  nitrogen chamber. It is located in the second basement of the  building belonging to the Klinlab company. A bank of tissue  cultures was also deposited there alongside the "harmless and  safely stored" viral bank. Tissue cultures are cellular lines  intended for the reproduction of viruses in a living organism.  The location in question was locked, and only a limited number  of staff from the Central Military Health Institute had access  to the keys. The viruses and the tissue cultures were stored in  containers full of liquid nitrogen, which has to be topped up  once a week. Last August, one of the containers--by  coincidence, the one with the bank of tissue cultures--was left  open. All of the nitrogen had evaporated and so the tissue  cultures were destroyed. Of course, it takes more than a few  minutes or hours for nitrogen to evaporate. According to the  experts, it takes five to seven days for this. Throughout this  entire period, however, no one went into the nitrogen chamber,  or, if someone did, he did not secure the container, despite the  fact that it would have been impossible to overlook the  unfastened lid and the escaping vapors. So, the batches of  tissue cultures were destroyed. By the way, they were the  largest in the Czech Republic, and their procreation took 30  years, which is another matter.    An investigation was initiated and conducted by the police  in  Prague 6. The culprit was not found. There are more  variations. These include an accident or oversight--relatively  unlikely--and sabotage, which is more likely. In this event,  another two possibilities can be taken into consideration:  first, that the culprit or culprits intended to destroy what  was actually destroyed--that is, the bank of tissue cultures.  But why? Simply to make sure they do not exist? The second  possibility is that this was a mistake and the other container  with the viral bank should have been left open. In this case,  dangerous viruses would have escaped into the surrounding  environment, and not only the patients and staff in the Central  Military Hospital would have been placed at direct risk. This  could have been called, without exaggeration, a catastrophe.  Understandably, there is also the possibility that someone  wanted to remove, and perhaps even did remove, something from  either of the banks. It is not difficult to guess for what  purpose. One can only speculate about which country is  supposed, for example, to have its source of drinking water  infected. It just remains for me to add that, if the lid had  stayed shut, it goes without saying that no one would have had  any idea that some unknown person had been in the nitrogen  chamber. It is impossible to say whether he had visited it for  the first time. So, this was the situation with the, according  to the defense minister, "safely stored harmless and common  viruses that were not intended for use as biological weapons."  During their news conference, the defense minister and his  retinue declared that nothing had in fact happened and that  biological weapons have never been developed or stored in our  country. The two rapidly, and under extraordinary security  measures, destroyed viral banks were, according to them, common  batches. Of course, they did not say a word about what happened  in Stresovice last August. It would probably be difficult for  them to say that there is no risk and that there was not a risk.  It would also be difficult for them to say that everything is in  order in the Army and that biological weapons were never  developed in it. It would be difficult for Deputy Minister  Kalousek to talk nonsense and claim that the Army will save 50  million by transferring some of the activity carried out  hitherto by the Central Military Health Institute to the Klinlab  limited company. And so on and so on.</p>

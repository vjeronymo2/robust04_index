			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Goldsborough expansion GOLDSBOROUGH, the nursing home subsidiary of Kunick, the fruit machine group, has paid Pounds 9.1m for Mariamark, which owns seven care homes with a total of 300 beds. The acquisition makes Goldsborough the fifth largest care homes operator in the UK, with 26 homes and 1,200 beds. Kunick sold a 50 per cent stake in Goldsborough to County Natwest Ventures for Pounds 12.5m in October 1992, to reduce borrowings and raise money to fund Goldsborough's expansion. Goldsborough is hoping to achieve a Stock Exchange flotation in the next 12 months.</p>

			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Names see hope in 'damning' report LLOYD'S NAMES who have suffered multi-million pound losses from catastrophe reinsurance believe evidence from a Lloyd's investigation will help them win compensation. The interim report into the losses of Devonshire syndicates 216 and 833/834, prepared by a a committee headed by Mr Anthony Blake of Neville Russell, the accountancy firm, is one of several being prepared by Lloyd's to examine the losses of syndicates which participated in spiral reinsurance in which syndicates and companies reinsured each other's catastrophe losses. Mr Christopher Stockwell, a Devonshire Name and leader of the Lloyd's Names Association Working Party, which links action groups of lossmaking Names, described it as 'utterly damning'. Names, the individuals whose capital supports the Lloyd's insurance market, have suffered heavy losses from spiral reinsurance business. Lloyd's expects to disclose three reports - into the Feltrim, Gooda Walker and Rose Thomson Young syndicates - over the next four months. The Devonshire report alleges that underwriters bought inadequate reinsurance and that the former board of the Devonshire agency failed 'to properly discharge its responsibilities'. During 1989 and 1990 losses by Devonshire syndicate 216 amounted to Pounds 338m compared with a stamp capacity (or capital base) of Pounds 43.4m, while the losses of syndicate 833/834 amount to Pounds 151m, compared with a stamp of Pounds 43m. The report says that both syndicates have had difficulty in making recoveries from reinsurers. Both syndicates place substantial reinsurance with the Korea Foreign Insurance Company, a North Korean company, and have experienced a 'considerable delay in the payment of certain claims'. The report alleges that syndicate managers breached Lloyd's regulations by failing to disclose details of the syndicates' business to Names. Mr Stockwell, who is calling for talks to resolve Names' heavy losses, said the report 'contained clear evidence that supports the Names for litigation'. But he is also pressing Lloyd's to revive negotiations for an out-of-court settlement.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Police asked to quiz former trade minister: Probe sought over Clark evidence in arms to Iraq affair POLICE have been asked to interview Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, about his evidence in the Matrix Churchill affair. The move came as the prime minister vigorously dismissed charges that he and cabinet colleagues repeatedly misled parliament over arms-related sales to Iraq. In his angriest outburst over the issue Mr John Major told MPs any suggestion that ministers misled the House of Commons over the export of defence-related goods to Iraq 'has no basis whatsoever in fact'. The Crown Prosecution Service said the Metropolitan Police had been asked to carry out inquiries relating to inconsistencies in the evidence given by Mr Clark to Customs and Excise investigators and later at the trial of three businessmen accused of breaching arms embargoes on Iraq. Mr Clark's testimony at the Old Bailey 10 days ago that the government had approved the sale of sophisticated machinery which could be used to make weapons, along with evidence in 500 pages of government documents released to the court, led to the acquittal of the three former Matrix Churchill directors. A Customs official said last night: 'Mr Clark's statement sank our case.' The official said Mr Clark gave two witness statements during the investigation. Customs say both were at variance with what he had said in court. Customs passed papers about Mr Clark's evidence to the CPS last week. The collapse of the case against the directors of the Iraqi-owned machine tools manufacturer has raised a storm of controversy. Mr Clark, who retired from politics at the last election, yesterday refused to comment on the CPS's decision. Customs have refused to release transcripts of Mr Clark's witness statements. However, they are understood to repeat his earlier insistence that he did not encourage companies to breach export controls to Iraq. This stance was apparently largely contradicted by Mr Clark under cross-examination. During the trial he agreed he had indicated that companies applying to the Department of Trade and Industry for export licences could stress the peaceful applications of so-called 'dual use' machine tools. The advice not to mention the potential military use from applications was 'our old friend economical . . . with the actualite,' Mr Clark told the court, paraphrasing an expression 'economical with the truth' made famous by Sir Robert (now Lord) Armstrong, former cabinet secretary, during the Spycatcher case in the mid-1980s. Mr Clark also told the court he found the government guidelines on arms exports 'tiresome and intrusive'. The tools involved were of little concern as they were 'pedestrian technology'. The decision to call in the police will focus attention further on the role played by Mr Clark personally in the affair rather than that of other ministers. Mr Major has already distanced himself from Mr Clark. In the Commons last week he said Mr Clark had assured him in 1990 that correct government procedures had not been breached. However, yesterday's move is likely to provoke concern among defence lawyers who have warned that Mr Clark could be made the scapegoat for the government over the affair. In the Commons yesterday Mr Major stressed that the terms of the inquiry under Lord Justice Scott, who began work yesterday, were 'so wide-ranging that they cover so many aspects that there will be nothing that will not be fully examined'.

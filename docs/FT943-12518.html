			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Media Futures: Post haste for barcoded mail The Royal Mail is planning to extend to the whole of the UK a scheme - at present on trial among a number of its larger customers - which promises dramatically to simplify mail addressing and sorting. The scheme initially involves adding extra characters to existing postcodes so that each code will identify a single, unique address. The nub of the Royal Mail development, however, is the transformation of the extended postcode into a new kind of barcode which can be read by special electronic scanners at rates of up to 30,000 items an hour. It is thought the target for completing the conversion is the early part of next year. The barcodes will be chiefly of benefit to high volume, bulk mail customers. Mailsort customers who presort their post already qualify for a 2 per cent discount for barcoding 30,000 items or more. Conventional barcodes, widely used on products and packaging in industry and commerce, comprise printed columns of bars of varying width. These can be read optically to yield information about the product or contents. The Royal Mail barcodes are different in form, consisting of patterns of lines of varying length which can be printed under control from a personal computer. One advantage is that the barcode reading machines are able to recognise the pattern despite the presence of, say, advertising materials on the packaging. Barry Jeeves, customer barcoding consultant to the Royal Mail, quoted in the current issue of the magazine PC Week, says the Mail has essentially developed its own barcode based on an existing US standard. Conventional barcodes, he says, were not quick enough. There were problems with low quality printers and materials. There are some 25m domestic and business addresses in the UK. Existing postcodes identify a group of about 15 addresses and are adequate for existing sorting systems, which are based on machine recognition of phosphorescent dots printed on the packaging. Customer should benefit greatly from keying in a nine character barcode instead of several lines of address.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Volkov: "June `Weather': From the Cabinet </F> of Ministers to Zhayrem--Fog Everywhere"]    [Text] Looking at the past week one would be hard  pressed to decide which was "The Event." Everything seems to  point in the direction of the country's president speech in the  Supreme Council being the "No. 1 news item" not only of the past  seven days but of all of June. However, Nursultan Nazarbayev's  speech in the parliament is only the tip of the iceberg called  the economic life of Kazakhstan.    A number of events, which also happened lately, point in  this  direction. While the head of the state was unfolding before the  deputies a broad picture of the republic's coming  market-democratic prosperity, Deputy Prime Minister Akezhan  Kazhegeldin consulted on the subject of the much-suffering  anticrisis program with a group of economic managers and  businessmen especially close to the government and formalized as  the Union of Industrialists and the Congress of Entrepreneurs of  Kazakhstan. True, neither side heard anything special at this  conference. But the intensity of consultations on this issue, so  characteristic of late, suggests that the Cabinet of Ministers,  if not in June then at the beginning of July, will finally be  able to say something concrete on the subject of its program. It  remains to be seen, though, whether an agreement on it will be  reached in the parliament and among economic managers.    During this time the government also managed to set up a  commission on operational production and financial matters  headed by Mssrs. Zhabagin, Urkumbayev, and Makiyevskiy. Its  tasks, as indicated by the name, practically fully coincide with  those guiding the similar Russian commission headed by Oleg  Soskovets, who is well known in our republic. Whether he was the  one to suggest the idea of such a structure to our authorities,  or they came to it on their own, is no longer important. The  interesting part in this case is that having handed to the  "operational commission" (which has practically unlimited  powers) the reins of decisions on urgent questions of economic  life of the country, the government once again tried to keep a  good face while playing not so nice a game. That is, no matter  what the president may say about his designs, the current  Cabinet of Ministers team will persist in looking for a solution  to the global issues of economic reform in overcoming momentary  problems and mini-problems, in the sacred belief that this is  what strategy of state administration really is.    Meanwhile, unpleasant incidents are occurring one after  another in the "hope and pride" of the head of state's market  transformations--privatization. One day it comes out that State  Privatization Fund Chairman Mr. Baishev, together with Mr.  Orynbasarov, director of the Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee  for the Administration of State Property] Information and  Records Center, permitted a transfer of coupons of some  investment funds to the accounts of other funds. And the  bureaucrats, caught redhanded, had no choice but to correct the  "mistake," along with a disciplinary thrashing.    Or suddenly employees of the Zhayremskiy Mining and  Enrichment Combine (GOK) learn to their surprise that their  enterprise, already converted to joint-stock ownership (and  also, as an entity of strategic importance for the republic, due  to be privatized through a custom-designed arrangement), had  been for all practical purposes sold at the second coupon  auction as a simple and very small plant of local significance.  To all the puzzled questions of the producers of polymetal and  iron-manganese ore, Goskomimushchestvo responds with a solid  wall of silence. As for Kazpotrebsoyuz [Kazakh Consumers Union],  which became the owner (it was its five funds that very  fortuitously and "accidentally" purchased 46 percent of GOK's  shares), it is now trying to prove the unprovable, namely, that  there was not, and is not, any collusion (bureaucratic and  commercial) in this respect. When one learns, however, that  precise lists of enterprises going to be offered at coupon  auctions are given to investment funds only one hour before the  auction opens, one unwittingly starts wondering about the  vicissitudes of behind-the-scenes games in the current  privatization. Especially considering that the example of the  active "creativity" of Mssrs. Baishev and Orynbasarov is still  fresh on one's mind. The most interesting part, however, is that  an enterprise, which by all laws and state programs is not  subject to privatization for at least the next couple of years,  belongs (or, to be more precise, belonged) to the state holding  company Ak-Sunkar and, correspondingly, to the republic's  Ministry of Industry. Now, having lost its potentially mighty  piece, the ministry's brass only shrug their shoulders and  express extreme unhappiness with the events. Naturally, one  could go on fantasizing on this subject, keeping in mind that  the former head of Zhayremskiy GOK, who left it not in the  nicest way, became the deputy chairman of Goskomimushchestvo.  But let other organs do this. Let us rather think: How can it  happen that one organization (Kazpotrebsoyuz) could have five  (!) investment funds at the same time, which theoretically  allows it to buy today any enterprise put up at auction as part  of mass privatization. Why then, one wants to ask, did we  introduce restrictions on the number of shares of economic  entities that can be purchased by one investment fund? In short,  there obviously is something to look at both for the Antitrust  Committee and other oversight bodies in the republic.</p>

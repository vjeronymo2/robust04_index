			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> MOBILE HOME RENT PROPOSAL TO BE REVIEWED  </P> <P> The city has hired a private law firm to review the legality of a mobile home  rent control proposal that still must be approved by the City Council or set  for a special election, officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rochelle Brown, with the Los Angeles law firm of Richards, Watson &amp;  Gershon, will be paid $175 an hour for the review, although the amount of work  to be done remains under negotiation, a city spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> City Atty. Jack White asked for the review by an outside attorney to avoid any  conflict of interest in reviewing the proposed ordinance. It has qualified for  a vote of the City Council or electorate after being signed by 16,935  registered voters in the city. The ordinance would require the city attorney to  advise a proposed rent control board on legal questions and to defend board  actions. The county registrar of voters certified the initiative signatures  last month.  </P> <P> White said that could require him to defend an action he earlier had advised  the board was not enforceable.  </P> <P> If approved, the initiative would roll back mobile home space rental rates to  adjusted 1984 levels and limit future increases.  </P> <P> A fiscal impact report on the proposed ordinance is due before the City Council  by Jan. 14.  </P></p>

			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Brazilian state adapts to centre stage - Christina Lamb looks at Rio Grande do Sul's hopes and fears from Mercosur pact ONE of the first callers to the Dial Mercosur service set up last year by the state government of Rio Grande do Sul was a lady asking where she could find her local Mercosul, mistakenly believing it to be a new chain of supermarkets. Today most of the state's 9.2m inhabitants are better informed, but hold mixed opinions about the nascent free trade arrangement between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay which will affect them more than any other community in the southern cone. Not only is Brazil's southernmost state right in the centre of Mercosur, but its largely agricultural production comprises the same crops as neighbouring Uruguay and Argentina and is less competitive due to poorer soil conditions and heavier local taxes. Agriculture makes up 53 per cent of the state's Dollars 35.7bn GDP and much of the 15m tonnes of foodstuff produced yearly sells within Brazil. Although currently benefiting from Argentina's overvalued currency which make Brazilian products cheap in comparison, Rio Grande's wheat, rice, poultry, dairy, beef and wine producers all expect to suffer once Mercosur comes fully into operation in 1995 with zero tariffs between the four neighbours. Mr Hugo Paz, the president of the state's Farmers Association, complains: 'Mercosur is moving so fast that it's heading for self-destruction. It is destroying Brazil's agroeconomy, particularly that of Rio Grande.' He describes Brazil's integration with its neighbours formalised by the Treaty of Asuncion of March 1991, as 'like marrying a girl you have just met in the street.' He says: 'No compensating mechanisms have been created for the dead and injured and the lack of macroeconomic stability or policy coordination means it's impossible to decide whether to abandon products. Unless something drastic is done what we'll have is not integration but wars over food mountains.' Yet in many ways for Rio Grande, Mercosur makes far more sense than for Brazil's north-eastern states. It shares a 1,000km border with Uruguay and a 700km border with Argentina and its culture is closer to these southern neighbours than to that of Brazil. Trade with Mercosur partners, though still relatively unimportant for the state, is rising. Last year its exports to Mercosur increased to Dollars 221.9m from Dollars 137.6m in 1990, though still less than 7 per cent of the total Dollars 3.5bn. This year it should top Dollars 300m. Another benefit is an increased tourism. A record 500,000 tourists visited the state last year, mostly from Mercosur countries. In the last two decades, rapid industrialisation has transformed Rio Grande which now has a gross domestic product greater than that of Hungary, and Mercosur should benefit sectors such as car parts, bus manufacturers and petrochemicals. Some local companies are already taking advantage. Brahma, Brazil's leading beer company, recently invested Dollars 40m in joint ventures in Argentina and Uruguay. Fonte Ijui is selling mineral water to Argentina, Agrale is exporting trucks across the border, and Balancas Uranos is selling electronic scales to Paraguay. The state authorities hope to use its strategic position, cheap power, deepwater port, and high quality of life to attract in foreign companies aiming at the 200m strong Mercosur. A department for international affairs has been created with an impressive datasystem listing companies seeking partners. State missions have visited the US, Hong Kong and Japan and Europe is next on the list. The Federation of Industries of Rio Grande has set up a Mercosur division and in a specially commissioned study on 20 sectors found 16 saw it as an opportunity and only four as a threat - wheat, wine, dairy products and canned fruits. Mr Luiz Mandelli, president of the federation, says 'we're entirely in favour of Mercosur. For decades we've complained that we're in bad competitive shape because we were so far from the main consumer markets of Sao Paulo and Rio. Now we're right in the middle. If you draw a 600 mile circle round Porto Alegre you have two thirds of the GDP of South America.' But Mr Alceu Collares, the state Governor, warns against complacency: 'Our proximity to all four Mercosul countries means we could be the biggest beneficiary. However, we could just become a corridor between the big producers of Buenos Aires and Sao Paulo unless we are competitive in price and quality.' The government has set up a Dollars 390m industrial development programme and recruited Japanese and German advisers. Recently for example, Aurora, Brazil's largest wine co-operative, invested Dollars 16m in reconversion to produce fruit juice and jams to protect itself against a possible influx of Argentine wine. 'It's adapt or die,' says Mr Adao Eliseu de Carvalho, secretary for international affairs.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Royal Mail plans to consult unions ROYAL MAIL, the letters arm of the Post Office, is to give union representatives a say in a wide range of business issues, including prices, standards of service and new technology. The move is the first by a large UK employer to set up a formal national worker participation scheme since experiments in industrial democracy in the late 1970s. Employee consultation has been out of fashion for over a decade. Employers have generally sought to restrict union influence to pay and conditions. Royal Mail's unusual step is part of an industrial relations shake-up affecting about 180,000 employees. The agreement has been hailed by union leaders and management as a blueprint for other parts of industry. A new national joint committee will be attended each month by senior Royal Mail managers and national union officials. It is expected that Mr Bill Cockburn, Royal Mail managing director, and Mr Alan Tuffin, general secretary of the Union of Communication Workers, will regularly take part. Mr Jerry Cope, Royal Mail's director of personnel, said the framework provided a 'third model' for industry in the UK. Old-fashioned public sector organisations had been stuck with excessive levels of consultation and very slow rates of change. Other employers went to the opposite extreme and attempted to exclude unions altogether, he said. Royal Mail did not believe either model was appropriate for the 21st century, said Mr Cope. If unions were pushed into the corner, 'every so often they come out and bite you'. The Post Office has suffered from poor industrial relations in the past, though the number of unofficial disputes has declined. Both sides stressed that involvement of unions in business issues was not a return to the short-lived experiments in industrial democracy in the Post Office and British Steel Corporation in the late 1970s. There would be no question of 'co-management', said Mr Cope.</p>

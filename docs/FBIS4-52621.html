			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Dentsu Inc. said Thursday  [12 May] it will establish an advertisement company in China  jointly with two local firms.    The new firm, called Beijing Dentsu Advertising Co., will be  capitalized at 2 million dollars.    Dentsu will hold a 51 percent equity share, while the rest  will be held by China International Advertising Corp. and Da  Cheng Advertising Ltd.    The Chinese advertising market reached roughly 200 billion  yen in 1993 in turnover. Dentsu estimates the market will grow  10 to 20 percent annually.    The Japanese advertising agency entered China in 1986 under  a  joint venture arrangement with Young and Rubicam Inc. of the  United States. Dentsu also has branch offices in Beijing and  Shanghai.</p>

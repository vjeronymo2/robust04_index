			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL RIGHTS UNIT REJECTS COMPLAINT OVER HANDICAPPED BUSING SHORTAGE  </P> <P> After a 3-month investigation, the federal Office of Civil Rights has  determined that the Orange County Department of Education responded adequately  last fall to a bus shortage for handicapped students and did not violate their  civil rights.  </P> <P> The federal agency said the county department "is currently in compliance" with  a U.S. law requiring free transportation of the handicapped, and the agency  dismissed a civil rights complaint against the department.  </P> <P> The Orange County Board of Education, which governs the $50-million budget for  the County Department of Eduction, learned of the action at its regular  Thursday meeting.  </P> <P> John E. Palomino, regional civil rights director for the U.S. Office of Civil  Rights in San Francisco, notified the department that "based upon the action  taken by the Orange County Department of Education to provide emergency  transportation to improve the service already provided and to provide  supplemental instruction to compensate for instructional time lost, the Office  of Civil Rights finds the (county department) is currently in compliance."  </P> <P> But Rhys Burchill, executive director of Developmental Disabilities Area Board  XI, the panel that filed the civil rights complaint, said Thursday that her  group is still checking on how the Orange County Department of Education  provides transportation for the handicapped.  </P> <P> "Definitely the crisis is over, but there still seem to be sporadic problems,  and when these problems surface, we inform the County Department of Education  of our concern," Burchill said.  </P> <P> Her group is a watchdog agency for the handicapped.  </P> <P> Last September, many buses taking handicapped students to special schools in  the county stopped regular service, at one point stranding up to half the 800  handicapped students served by the County Department of Education.  </P> <P> The bus service bogged down because of a dispute between the contractor, Durham  Transportation Inc. of Rosemead, and the department. Durham officials claimed  that the department was not paying enough. The department claimed that it was  paying what the contract called for and that Durham was deliberately refusing  to fulfill its contract for buses.  </P> <P> During the dispute, scores of parents complained that they had no regular  transportation for their handicapped children. As a result, Developmental  Disabilities Area Board XI on Sept. 20 filed a civil rights complaint against  the County Department of Education.  </P> <P> A federal law, which is enforced through the Office of Civil Rights, requires  public school districts to provide free bus service to handicapped students.  </P> <P> On Oct. 7, Robert Peterson, Orange County superintendent of schools, announced  that he was canceling Durham's contract, effective June 30, and that a new bus  contractor will be sought. In the meantime, Peterson said, other buses and  taxis will supplement Durham in providing service through June 30.  </P> <P> Peterson also said the department will provide makeup schooling for students  who missed classes because of bus shortages.  </P></p>

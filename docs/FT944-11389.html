			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / World Bank urges urban clean-up The World Bank has urged China to impose user fees to improve urban environmental services and to hit industrial polluters with much tougher penalties or risk a crisis in towns and cities. A bank study also reported alarming negligence in the handling of hazardous waste, saying there was no adequate monitoring of the storage of 50m tonnes of waste a year. In Urban Environmental Pollution*, the bank said that China 'has an urgent need to reorient the provision of urban environmental services toward the market economy'. The release of the study coincides with growing alarm internationally over the environmental costs of China's explosive economic growth. Real gross domestic product growth for the past two years exceeded 13 per cent. The bank identified pollution caused by emerging rural manufacturers - the fastest growing sector of the economy - as a significant threat to China's already overburdened environment. It noted that in 1980, when the environmental regulatory system was imposed, these rural enterprises accounted for less than 10 per cent of industrial ouput, but that had jumped by 1992 to 36.8 per cent and was still growing. The study said it was especially worrying these often small-to-medium sized enterprises had avoided many of the regulatory restraints that applied to state-owned-enterprises, and the 'regulation problem can no longer be ignored'. Among other recommendations were that China: Increase the financial and social cost of violating environmental standards. Enact and enforce hazardous waste legislation. Charge tariffs for water supply, waste water treatment and solid waste disposal that encourage careful use. The World Bank, in its plea for stiffer penalties to deter widespread flouting of environmental standards, said Chinese companies would have 'no economic incentive to improve pollution control efficiency unless the expected cost of violations is raised through substantially higher fines and more frequent monitoring'. The bank urged that draft legislation which gives environmental protection bureaux regulatory authority over hazardous wastes should be implemented immediately. 'No agency is responsible for hazardous waste monitoring and, as a result, violations become known only after an accident results in injury or immediate economic loss,' the study said. 'In 1991, 2,800 recorded pollution accidents resulted in nearly 1,900 injuries. But these numbers pale in comparison to the potential damage that could be done to the ambient environment and human health by hazardous waste pollution.' The study identified sewerage and waste water treatment as another huge burden on the state, resulting in contaminated groundwater and polluted urban surface water across the country. 'Nearly 40 per cent of urban China is unserved by sewers, with waste water going directly into lakes and rivers . . . only 4.5 per cent of municipal waste water flows receive treatment of any kind.' The study, in its conclusion, argued strongly that increasingly affluent urban consumers were 'well positioned to absorb both the indirect and direct costs of an improved environment'. 'While the imposition of user fees may be politically difficult, city leaders must recognise that the . . . current choice to rely on indirect payments leads to excess demand, on the one hand, and an inability to meet needs, on the other.' *Urban Environmental Pollution: World Bank, August, 1994.</p>

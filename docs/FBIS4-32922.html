			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 29 May (EFE) -- The Chilean Social  Democratic Party's general council today approved the party  merge with the Radical Party to form what will be called the  Social Democratic Radical Party [Partido Radical Social  Democrata--PRSD].    The Radicals yesterday ratified a declaration to this same  effect.    The next step is the official registration of this new party  with the Electoral Service. The statutes were drafted by a mixed  commission.    The decision to merge the two parties was made due to the  fact that they are both centrist parties and that the two member  parties of the governing Coalition of Parties for Democracy  obtained very few votes during the December 1993 presidential  elections.    It was announced that Radical Senator Anselmo Sule will be  president of the PRSD and Ernesto Velasco, also a Radical,  secretary general, while Social Democrats will occupy the vice  presidencies.    Senator Sule today said that the merging of the two parties  is "a historical event" and will mark "a new phase" of the  social democratic currents.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> CONCERTS BY 2 LIVE CREW, BASIA, SOUL II SOUL CANCELED  </P> <P> Next Sunday's scheduled appearance by 2 Live Crew at Iguana's in Tijuana has  been canceled.  </P> <P> No, it's not because the promoter suddenly got cold feet about booking the  controversial rappers, who have become something of a scapegoat for Moral  Majority angst ever since a federal judge in Florida on June 6 declared their  most recent album obscene.  </P> <P> The group's leader, Luther Campbell (a.k.a. Luke Skyywalker), is ill, forcing  the cancellation of 2 Live Crew's entire West Coast tour.  </P> <P> Two other highly publicized local pop shows were also canceled last week.  </P> <P> The second of Basia's two sold-out concerts at the Civic Theatre downtown was  canceled at the last minute when her celebrated pipes failed. When the pop  singer arrived in town Thursday afternoon, promoter Bill Silva said, "she  already wasn't feeling well, but that night's show went off without a hitch."  </P> <P> Friday night's show didn't. Ottmar Liebert had just finished his opening set  when Silva was told by Basia's stage manager that the singer's condition had  suddenly worsened and she wouldn't be able to perform.  </P> <P> "She was trying to do her vocal warm-ups and couldn't get any sound at all,"  Silva said.  </P> <P> The concert has been rescheduled for Nov. 16. Refunds are available at the site  of purchase; tickets may also be exchanged for the same seat on the new date.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, earlier Friday, the folks at Avalon Attractions decided to call off  Soul II Soul's Sunday night appearance at San Diego State University's Open Air  Theatre because of poor ticket sales.  </P> <P> "There was definitely a great lack of support by San Diegans," said Avalon's  David Swift. "I wish I knew why; I guess if we knew why it didn't work, we  wouldn't have booked it in the first place. It's just one of those things that  happens."  </P> <P> Understandably, the Soul II Soul concert will not be rescheduled.  </P> <P> Noted Los Angeles record producer Michael Lloyd was in San Diego last Thursday  for a series of meetings with Children's Hospital and Health Center executives  about the upcoming benefit album of Christmas tunes by big-name pop stars he  has volunteered to produce.  </P> <P> The press was invited, and, although Lloyd had previously said he wouldn't  announce contributors until October, speculation that the project might be in  trouble prompted him to break the news a little early.  </P> <P> Already, Lloyd said, he has firm commitments from eight of the 20 acts he's  hoping to include on "The Christmas Album . . . A Gift of Love." Among them are  Fleetwood Mac ("The First Noel"), Barry Manilow ("Ave Maria") and Fifth  Dimension alumnus Marilyn McCoo (a new song, "Every Day Is Christmas").  America, Belinda Carlisle, Wayne Newton, Andy Williams and Christian  heavy-metal band Stryper have also agreed to contribute a song each, either a  traditional Christmas carol or a newly penned original.  </P> <P> Throughout the summer and early fall, Lloyd said, he'll take these eight acts  -- and at least four more -- into the studio to record their respective  contributions. The remaining cuts on the album will be previously released  Christmas tunes other pop heavyweights have put out in the past. The more  obscure the better, Lloyd said.  </P> <P> "The list I have available is endless," he said. "I'm looking at several  different versions of 'Winter Wonderland,' 'The Christmas Song' and 'Little  Drummer Boy,' trying to find the ones that have long been out of print, that  you rarely, if ever, hear on the radio."  </P> <P> Coincidentally, that same day, expatriate San Diego singer- songwriter Stephen  Bishop was at The Studio in Kearny Mesa, recording his version of "The  Christmas Song" for another upcoming benefit album of Christmas tunes by  big-name pop stars, "The Stars Come Out for Christmas 1990." Helping out on the  sessions was Little River Band bassist-singer, and fellow local, Wayne Nelson.  </P> <P> Last year's inaugural "Stars" album raised more than $160,000 for Children's  Hospital. Producer Steve Vaus was subsequently asked to do a second benefit  Christmas album for the hospital, but when he requested a production fee, he  was given the boot in favor of Lloyd, who offered to donate his services.  </P> <P> Vaus decided to do a follow-up anyway. He selected a new beneficiary, the local  chapter of the American Cancer Society, and promptly began working on "The  Stars Come Out for Christmas 1990," which, unlike Lloyd's project, is already  nearing completion.  </P> <P> The album's big-name contributors, aside from Bishop, include the Commodores,  Ray Charles, Johnny Cash, Randy Travis, Don McLean, Barbara Mandrell, Kim  Carnes and Kenny Rankin.  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Five local bands will be doing their bit for the homeless at  Sunday's "Rockin' for Comic Relief" benefit concert at the Time Machine in  Escondido. Proceeds go to the San Diego Health Care for the Homeless Program.  Appearing will be Dr. Feelgood and the Interns of Love, Roughneck Posse,  Nemesis, the Barking Spyders and Shondra and the Source. The music starts at 5  p.m.; tickets are $10 and are available at the Time Machine, the Logan Heights  Family Health Center in Barrio Logan and Dimension Cable outlets in Escondido,  Vista and Oceanside. . . .  </P> <P> The ad in last Thursday's Reader for Depeche Mode's third show (July 31) at the  San Diego Sports Arena proudly announces, "Making History in San Diego.  Unprecedented 3 Night Stand!" Promoter Bill Silva must have a short memory:  Just three years ago, Neil Diamond also made an "unprecedented" three-night  stand at the arena -- only then, it really was. . . .  </P> <P> More than a dozen local rock 'n' roll and heavy-metal bands will perform at  this weekend's "Summer Jam '90," a two- night music festival at the La Paloma  Theater in Encinitas. Appearing Friday night will be Cyclone Sound, Dirty  Blonde, Wildside, X-Factor, Secret Society, Rampage, Gun Shy and Mae Dae. On  tap for Saturday night: Young Gunns, Bad Blood, Hung Jury, Toxic Bunnies,  Pystol Whip, Morley Grey and Snake Eyes. . . .  </P> <P> Johnny Mathis, who was in town last Monday and Tuesday for a two-night stand at  Humphrey's on Shelter Island, was so impressed with his hotel-suite dressing  room that he spent the night there -- while a considerably more posh suite that  had already been reserved for him sat empty. "He especially liked the kitchen,  where he prepared all his meals after stocking up on groceries at the local  Von's," said promoter Kenny Weissberg. . . .  </P> <P> Tickets go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. for Public Enemy's Aug. 26 concert at the  San Diego Sports Arena. Also on the bill: Heavy D and the Boyz, Digital  Underground and Kid 'n' Play. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: "World Beat Tour '90," featuring Jimmy  Cliff, Fela Anikulapo Kuti and Egypt 80 with Imo and Lucky Dube, Thursday at  the Open Air Theatre at SDSU; Stan Ridgeway, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern in  Solana Beach; the Judds with Lionel Cartwright and McBride and the Ride, Friday  at the Sports Arena; Commander Cody, Friday at the Belly Up Tavern; Rosie  Flores, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; Buck Owens, Sunday at Leo's Little  Bit O' Country in San Marcos, and the Georgia Satellites, Sunday at the Belly  Up.  </P></p>

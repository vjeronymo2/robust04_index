			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Arts: International flavour to Booker shortlist This year's Booker Prize Short List has a truly international flavour. From Ireland there is Roddy Doyle's Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (Secker &amp; Warburg), by a young novelist who is a master of comic dialogue. From Canada comes late-show presenter Michael Ignatieff's Scar Tissue (Chatto &amp; Windus) and also Carole Shields The Stone Diaries (Fourth Estate). Then the Australian David Malouf's many-layered Remembering Babylon (Chatto) while from the West Indies via Bradford and Oxford is the writer Caryl Phillips's Crossing The River (Bloomsbury), and finally Tibor Fischer's Under the Frog (Polygon and Penguin), a British novelist born to Hungarian parents. Vikram Seth's Indian blockbuster A Suitable Boy is conspicuous by its absence. The judges, chaired by Lord Gowrie, are Gillian Beer, Anne Chisholm, Nicholas Clee and Olivier Todd. The Prize, now in its 25th year, (Pounds 20,000 to the winner) will be awarded at the Guildhall on October 26, televised on BBC-2's Late Show.</p>

			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Doubt cast on potential rail operators FOR MONTHS the government has maintained that at least 50 companies are interested in bidding for the franchises to operate British Rail's passenger services. Yet inquiries among airline and shipping groups, bus companies and other transport-related businesses in the UK and overseas give a different impression - barely a third of the government's number are looking at just a handful of local services. Bus companies emerge as the groups most interested in railway privatisation, having only recently emerged from their own privatisation and deregulation outside London in the late 1980s. The three biggest bus companies - Badgerline, British Bus and Stagecoach - are considering bids for franchises which fall broadly into their areas of operations. Many smaller bus companies are looking at the possibility of bids for individual lines or groups of services in their areas. The logic behind these bids is that bus companies believe they can increase revenues from the railways by integrating train services with their operations through common ticketing and co-ordinated timetabling. Yet this would invite intervention by the Office of Fair Trading on the grounds of local monopoly. The monopoly issue would matter less if the bus companies bid for operations outside their areas. But most of them will not - least of all for the InterCity and Network SouthEast franchises, which would dwarf their existing operations. Mr Harry Blundred, chairman of Exeter-based Transit Holdings and one of the most entrepreneurial of the new breed of bus operators, said: 'It seems to us that if you make one tiny mistake in a business you don't know, you could be in all kinds of trouble. We have looked at it and backed off.' Few other companies seem ready to take the bus companies' place as bidders for the large franchises. British Airways has said it is only interested in running airport expresses. Mr Richard Branson's Virgin Group has lost interest in the Gatwick Express and only wants to run the East Coast main line as part of a consortium. National Express has said the bids it wants to make would probably break the government's rules, though it has declined to elaborate. So would those being contemplated by Sea Containers, which wants the government to let it run the tracks as well as the trains. As for overseas interest, Canadian Pacific is interested in the Heathrow Express, and only Burlington Northern of the large US railroads is interested in franchising. Contrary to popular myth, SNCF, the French national railway, says it has too many financial problems at home to consider a foreign venture. The government has refused to identify the 50 companies on its list. But some in the private sector say the reason for the discrepancy between that figure and reality rests with the list, which includes interested parties that want to keep in touch with what is going on.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WHO WANTS TO PLAY TRAINS AFTER RAILWAY PRIVATISATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company            Present business        Interested in  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Badger Rail        Rail subsidiary of      South Wales and West region;                    Badgerline bus group    Great Western main line  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Airways    Airline                 Gatwick Express; Heathrow                                            Express; other airport                                            services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- British Bus        Sailsbury-based bus     London, Tilbury &amp; Southend                    formerly known as       line; North West region;                    Drawerlane              possibly Gatwick Express  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Burlington         US railroad             Unspecified  Northern  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canadian Pacific   Canadian railroad       Heathrow Express  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EYMS Group         Bus company trading     Hull-Bridlington-Filey-                    as East Yorkshire       Scarborough line                    Motor Services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Go-Ahead Northern  Gateshead-based bus     Local services in Tyneside                    company                 area  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grampian Regional  Aberdeen-based bus      Local services in Aberdeen  Transport         company                 are  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MTL Trust          Holding company of      Merseyrail electric services  Holdings          Merseybus  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- National Express   Express coach           Unspecified, but three                    operator                possible bids could include                                            Gatwick Express  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rider Group        Operator of Yorkshire   Local services radiating out                    Rider bus services      of Leeds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sea Containers     Bermuda-based           South Western division of                    shipping group          Network SouthEast; Great                                            Western Main Line  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Southern Vectis    Isle of Wight bus       Isle of Wight railway, in                    company                 consortium with Wightlink                                            and Hovertravel  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Stagecoach Rail    Rail subsidiary of      ScotRail; South Western                                            division of Network SouthEast                                            stagecoach bus group  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- West Midlands      Principal bus           Local services in West                    operator in West        Midlands                    Midlands  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Virgin Group       Airline, records and    East Coast main line, but                    radio group             only as part of consortium  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

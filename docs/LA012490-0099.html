			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AN EARLY LOOK AT THE ALL-STARS;  </P> <P> PRO BASKETBALL: RODMAN AND PARISH HAVE TALENTS THAT MAKE THEM WORTHY  CANDIDATES.  </P> <P> It's almost all-star time again, so, based on sketchy information, speculation  and, in some cases, outright opinion, the following constitute a few humble  choices as to who should take the floor in Miami Feb. 11.  </P> <P> Eastern Conference: Forwards: Charles Barkley, Philadelphia; Larry Bird,  Boston; Chuck Person, Indiana; Scottie Pippen, Chicago; Dennis Rodman, Detroit.  </P> <P> That's right, Rodman. Of course Dominique Wilkins averages more points than  Rodman. So do Bill Cartwright, Fred Roberts and Jerry Reynolds. So what? Rodman  changes the momentum of a game without taking a shot. We're already going to  see the game's best offensive talent. Why not showcase its best defensive  player?  </P> <P> Told to lose weight and be a model citizen, Person has lost weight and been a  model citizen for Indiana -- and still scored 20 a night. Pippen has been  all-around outstanding for the Bulls, finally providing Chicago with someone to  take the pressure off Michael Jordan. Well, a little.  </P> <P> Terry Catledge (Orlando) has had a fine first half at 20.6 points and 8.7  rebounds per game, but first-year expansion numbers always tend to be a little  skewed. We don't want to be cynical, but Catledge was in a contract year before  signing a six-year pact with the Magic last week. Centers: Pat Ewing, New York;  Robert Parish, Boston.  </P> <P> Parish gets in for no other reason than he got robbed of an appearance last  season, but his numbers (16.8 points per game, 10.5 rebounds per game, .589  field-goal percentage) more than back up an invitation this year too. Ewing?  MVP. Enough said. Moses Malone's numbers are solid as always, but the Hawks are  treading water and his play is doing nothing to improve the team.  </P> <P> Apologies to Rik Smits (Indiana), Rony Seikaly (Miami) and Sam Bowie (New  Jersey), playing well, but just a cut below. Guards: Jordan, Chicago; Joe  Dumars, Isiah Thomas, Detroit; Reggie Miller, Indiana; Jeff Malone, Washington.  </P> <P> Dumars has been the better guard in Detroit and Thomas makes it only because  Mark Price (Cleveland) missed too many games with injuries early on. Miller has  been the centerpiece of Indiana's emergence and may be the best three-point  shooter in the league.  </P> <P> Malone? The conference's third-best scoring guard (23.2 points a game) is  having a career-best shooting year from the floor. He deserves it, finishing a  few strides ahead of Ricky Pierce (Milwaukee).  </P> <P> Western Conference: Forwards: Karl Malone, Utah; Terry Cummings, San Antonio;  Buck Williams, Portland; James Worthy, Los Angeles; Chris Mullin, Golden State.  </P> <P> Last year, the Trail Blazers were the league's worst underachievers. With the  same group of players, Williams's professionalism has rubbed off (as well as a  few crunching picks and 9.7 rebounds) and the Trail Blazers are chasing the  Lakers in the Pacific Division.  </P> <P> And for those who would make David Robinson the sole reason for San Antonio's  turnaround, please note Cummings's 21.9 points and 8.3 rebounds per game.  </P> <P> Both the Warriors and Suns have come on of late, but Phoenix's rise seems more  directly related to Kevin Johnson's return. By this slim margin (and logic),  Mullin gets the nod over Tom Chambers (25.2 points per game). Centers: Akeem  Olajuwon, Houston; Robinson, San Antonio.  </P> <P> Head and shoulders above the competition, Olajuwon has kept a struggling  Rockets team near the .500 mark. Robinson has launched himself onto the list of  the top five centers in the game with half a year's work. Guards: Magic  Johnson, Lakers; John Stockton, Utah; Clyde Drexler, Portland; Gary Grant,  Clippers; Mitch Richmond, Golden State.  </P> <P> Drexler has been brilliant for Portland, keeping quiet and letting his play  speak for him. Grant is one of three players in the league in the top 10 in  assists and steals; Richmond (22.2 points a game) came on after a slow start.  The most competitive of spots. Ron Harper (Clippers) would have made it but for  his knee injury.  </P> <P> Lo and behold, the former Mr. Fragile, Sam Bowie, is on the verge of becoming a  down-and-dirty tough guy inside for Bill Fitch and the New Jersey Nets.  </P> <P> "His low-post game a year from now will be tremendous," Fitch said. "Instead of  spending an hour and a half each day during the summer working on his strength  and trying to rehabilitate one of his legs, he can ... work on his low-post  moves."  </P> <P> Bowie said others always have been in the way to his being the go-to guy.  </P> <P> "When I was at (Kentucky), Melvin (Turpin) played the low post, and I played  the perimeter," he said. "I go out to Portland and (Kevin) Duckworth's progress  comes around the way he did. ... Here I'm the (center) and I need to develop  some low-post moves that come crunch time, regardless of how the defense plays,  I'll be able to get the shot off."  </P> <P> That's assuming Bowie doesn't break in two by year's end; he's missed the last  two Nets games with back spasms.  </P> <P> Mavericks forward Roy Tarpley, who was suspended Nov. 16 for violating his  substance-abuse aftercare program, was reinstated by the ASAP Family Treatment  Program Monday.  </P> <P> He is scheduled to play Friday night against the Sacramento Kings.  </P> <P> Tarpley missed 34 games and lost more than $240,000 for failure to adhere to  his NBA-mandated program. ...  </P> <P> Larry Bird tells the Orlando Sentinel that he was asked to be one of the  participants in the now-unlikely Magic Johnson-Michael Jordan one-on-one game,  but said no because he thought there would be betting on the event.  </P></p>

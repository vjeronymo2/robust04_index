			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / People: Full diary at Letts for Alan Mills, new chairman Charles Letts, one of the UK's leading diary publishers, has for the first time in its 198-year history moved outside the Letts family to find a new chairman. Alan Mills, 61, who started his working life in 1949 with the English Electric Light Company, has become the new (non-executive) chairman. Mills has a long track record in a variety of electrical companies, including most recently the chairman and chief executive roles of GEC, Canada (between 1988-89) and managing director at Osram (between 1989-1993). He also has overseas experience, from time spent in Qatar, India and Hong Kong. Mills joined the board of Letts in 1993, along with Bill Gore, its chief executive. Mills takes over from Anthony Letts, who remains a non-executive director. In its first results since being the subject of a management buy-in last December, Letts reported a loss of Pounds 785,000 in May this year, for the year ending January 1994. The company reckons to have some 25 per cent of the UK diary market, worth about Pounds 70m annually.</p>

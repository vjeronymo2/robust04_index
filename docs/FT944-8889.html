			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Small' reforms planned for EU sugar regime The European Union's sugar marketing regime is working well and needs only minor changes to conform with the Uruguay Round accord in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, agriculture commissioner Rene Steichen said yesterday, reports Reuters from Strasbourg. 'It's a reform, perhaps a small one, because at the moment we have no problem with this market,' he explained after the commission adopted a proposal to modify the regime. Beet sugar production quotas would be maintained at existing levels for the next six marketing years until the end of the Gatt accord in 2001. But quotas, or guaranteed prices, could be changed in view of market developments, Mr Steichen added. The EU sugar regime provided a stable price, in contrast to the world market, and the only budget expenditure was for imports of cane sugar, the commissioner stated. The EU imports 1.3m tonnes of raw cane sugar at preferential rates from members' former colonies in the African, Caribbean and Pacific regions. The regime is 'self-financed' through production levies paid by farmers and processors.</p>

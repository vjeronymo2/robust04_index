			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Summit to tackle joblessness urged by Clinton PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday proposed a global ministerial unemployment summit in the US in the next few months. The advance text of Mr Clinton's speech offered the use of his presidential retreat at Camp David as a possible venue. But the president did not mention this as he spoke and a senior official said later only that it should be held in the US. Mr Clinton said he had directed his senior economics and labour advisers to invite their counterparts among the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to a meeting 'in the coming months to search for the causes and possible remedies for this structural unemployment'. In a speech to an educational conference before leaving for the G7 summit in Tokyo, the president described 'stubbornly' high rates of unemployment as one of the 'most troubling' problems which is confronting the global economy. US unemployment, he said, remained at 7 per cent, the private sector in Europe had generated 'no new net jobs' in the past 20 years, while even Japan, hitherto immune, was 'finally having problems'. 'This meeting can be a first step to getting all our job generators running at full speed again,' he said. Mr Clinton's initiative reflects his own well-known interest in practical policies to solve practical problems. In an interview with foreign correspondents last Friday, he had speculated on the causes of rising unemployment in France and Japan, two radically different labour markets. The second main string to his pre-summit bow here was to advance the cause of greater US-Asian co-operation. He promised that speeches in Tokyo and Seoul later this week would 'lay out a vision of our engagement in that region for the coming decades'. This would include not only a 'stronger and more balanced' economic relationship with Japan, but the enlistment of the support of both Japan and Korea behind the successful conclusion of a more open trade agreement by the end of the year. Speaking in one of the most Asian cities in the US, Mr Clinton maintained that trade friction with Japan could not disguise the reality that 'our relations across the Pacific are, for the most part, of great mutual benefit'. More than 40 per cent of US trade was with Asia, with US exports worth over Dollars 120bn (Pounds 80bn) and accounting for 2.3m jobs at home. He re-emphasised a favourite theme - that 'we have entered an era in which the line between our domestic and foreign policy has evaporated'. G7 summit, Page 4</p>

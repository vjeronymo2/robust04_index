			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Barlows reduces loss BARLOWS, the Chester-based property investment and development group, reported a reduced deficit of Pounds 202,000 before tax for the six months to June 30. The outcome, compiled under FRS 3, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 368,000 and came on rental income of Pounds 768,000 (Pounds 819,000). Mr Nicholas Berry, chairman, said the group should return to the black next year. This would follow measures to minimise letting voids and to reduce overheads coupled with benefits of rental reversions. Losses per share narrowed to 1p (1.78p). The interim dividend is omitted (0.825p)</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second amendment to the existing regulations related to the annual reporting function is a new &sect;658.7(d). This new paragraph (d) will require each federal agency to report to the Chief of SCS the agency's progress during the prior fiscal year in reviewing its authorities, internal rules, policies and procedures, and the agency's development of proposals to bring its programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA, pursuant to section 1542 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4203. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This second amendment drew a pattern of comments similar to those offered for amendment one. The organizations and individuals who generally supported the amendments in the proposed rule were in support of this subsection. However, three of the federal agencies that would be required to make these yearly reports to SCS were critical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposed that once an agency has demonstrated that its programs, authorities, and administrative activities are in compliance with the FPPA, it should not be required to make an annual report. Rather, The FmHA asserted, such an agency should be requested to report only in a year in which it either plans to change its FPPA compliance process or undertakes a new program that may be subject to the FPPA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FHWA commented that a single report from an agency should be sufficient until any future revisions to the FPPA or the SCS regulations are made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) asked for additional guidance concerning the type of information in the report, and recommended that the annual report be an assessment of the progress made in implementing the FPPA, without excessive and burdensome documentation of specific farmland conversion or protection activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has incorporated the suggestion offered by the FmHA in the final rule. Although the request for an annual report will remain, once the agency has completed the review of its policies and procedures and revised them as needed to comply with the Act, no additional reports are requested. In years in which the agency has changed its FPPA compliance process, a report is requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the concern expressed by the TVA, the scope of the agencies' reports to SCS under the new &sect;658.7(d) is that which is established in section 1542 of the FPPA and which is set forth in the unchanged sections of the existing regulations, 7 CFR 658.7(a) and (b). In other words, the annual reports the agencies are to submit to SCS are to be limited to the reviews of laws, regulations, policies, and procedures that the agencies have conducted under section 1542(a) of the FPPA and the proposals for action, if any, that the agency has developed pursuant to section 1542(b). In addition, SCS will be receiving data from the agencies on their individual project decisions involving farmland, but this data will come from the various AD&hyph;1006 forms that the agencies are to return to SCS after making their action decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Amendment to Recognize Change in Limitation on Litigation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1255(b) of the Food Security Act of 1985, 99 Stat. 1518, amended section 1548 of the FPPA, 7 U.S.C. 4209, which originally prohibited states, local governments, and private parties using the FPPA as a basis to bring actions challenging Federal activities. Prior to the amendment, the language of section 1548 was as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> This subtitle shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or equitable, by any State, local unit of government, or any persons challenging a Federal project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland. 95 Stat. 1344. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> As amended, section 1548 (7 U.S.C. 4209) now reads as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> This subtitle shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or equitable, by any state, local unit of government, or any persons challenging a Federal project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland. 95 Stat. 1344. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> This subtitle shall not be deemed to provide a basis for any action, either legal or equitable, by any person or class of persons challenging a Federal project, program, or other activity that may affect farmland: Provided, that the Governor of an affected State where a State policy or program exists to protect farmland may bring an action in the Federal district court of the district where a Federal program is proposed to enforce the requirements of section 1541 of this subtitle and regulations issued pursuant thereto. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, &sect;658.3(d) of the existing regulation, which is simply a restatement of section 1548 in its original form, needs to be amended to conform with section 1548, as amended. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition to the proposal for this change in the regulation, and it is incorporated in this rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Amendment to restore &sect;658.7(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When 7 CFR part 658 was published as a final rule in 1984, it was intended to include &sect;658.7(b), which simply incorporates the provision of section 1542(b) of the Act requiring the federal agencies to develop proposals for action to bring their programs, authorities, and administrative activities into conformity with the FPPA. However, in the draft of the rule submitted to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , paragraph (b) was inadvertently omitted, leaving a gap between &sect;658.7(a) and &sect;658.7(c) as they appeared in the published rule at 49 FR 27727. The proposed rule of January 14, 1987 included an amendment to restore this missing paragraph. None of the commenting parties expressed opposition to this correction, and it is incorporated in the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / International Company News: APN posts 31% increase Australian Provincial Newspapers (APN), Mr Tony O'Reilly's Australian newspaper group, yesterday reported after-tax profits of ADollars 16.3m (USDollars 11.7m) in the year to end-December, up from ADollars 12.4m in the previous 12 months. Revenues increased from ADollars 143.3m to ADollars 134.3m. Mr O'Reilly, chief executive of US food group Heinz, is chairman of the Dublin-based Independent Newspapers of Ireland, which this week moved to raise its stake in Newspaper Publishing to nearly 30 per cent. Newspaper Publishing owns Britain's Independent and Independent on Sunday titles. In part, the improvement in Australia was due to lower finance charges. Interest paid and borrowing costs were ADollars 6.32m, compared with just over ADollars 12m the previous year, although interest received also dipped from ADollars 1.06m to ADollars 496,000. 'APN did not float until May 1992, and consequently the group had a substantially higher average debt level in the first half of 1992,' said the company. However, operating earnings before interest also rose, from ADollars 31.2m to ADollars 34m. During the year, APN acquired the Peter Isaacson publishing house in Melbourne, and expanded its titles. The company, whose regional publications are principally in Queensland and New South Wales, described the performance as 'creditable'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Lithuanian-Russian dialogue has come to a halt,  but Lithuania is striving for it -- and above all the contacts  between the presidents of the two countries -- to be normal.  This was stated by Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius at a news  conference today.    The prime minister announced that President Algirdas  Brazauskas yesterday signed a letter to Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, describing all problems of cooperation.  Lithuanian-Russian relations have been also discussed at a  meeting of the foreign policy coordination council chaired by  the president.    Slezevicius also said that his letters and attempts to talk  to Russian Prime minister Chernomyrdin remain without response.  As is known, Lithuania is inviting Russia to confirm the note  on the coming into force of the treaty on the most favorable  trade regime. The treaty was signed last November in Vilnius,  but Russia has so far not ratified it.    The head of the Lithuanian Government also told the news  conference that Russia is conducting an aggressive policy toward  the Baltic states. It was also said at the news conference that  if Russia does not change its attitude, Lithuania will take the  same measures as regards the Kaliningrad region.</p>

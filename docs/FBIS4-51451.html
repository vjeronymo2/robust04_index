			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhu Yucheng, Deputy Director of XINHUA Hong Kong </F> Branch, Says the Establishment of a Human Rights Commission Will  Hinder Smooth Transition"]    [Text] Yesterday (25 May), Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of  XINHUA Hong Kong Branch, said that the Basic Law provides  sufficient guarantees for the human rights of Hong Kong  residents, so the establishment of a human rights commission in  Hong Kong is, first of all, a violation of the Basic Law, and is  also a major hindrance to Hong Kong's smooth transition. This  is unacceptable to the Chinese side, and the operation of a  human rights commission will certainly be terminated after 1997.    Zhu Yucheng said this yesterday afternoon when questioned by  reporters while he was attending the news conference on the sale  of Beijing's Fenglian Square.    When answering reporters' questions about a human rights  commission, Zhu said: "As far as Hong Kong residents' human  rights are concerned, their duties and rights are all fully  guaranteed by the Basic Law. Therefore, we hold that the  establishment of a human rights commission in Hong Kong is,  first of all, a violation of the Basic Law; and that will also  create many hindrances to a smooth transition. That is  unfavorable to Hong Kong's smooth transition."    He added that although Hong Kong Governor Patten repeatedly  talks about the necessity of cooperation between Britain and  China, the issue of a human rights commission shows that he is  in fact setting up new obstacles to Sino-British cooperation.  This is unacceptable to the Chinese side.    Zhu Yucheng pointed out that if the British Hong Kong  authorities really set up a human rights commission in Hong  Kong, the Chinese side will never recognize it, and the human  rights commission will certainly be unable to continue operation  after 1997. In addition, when asked about whether Hong Kong  civil servants of foreign origin may achieve Chinese  citizenship, Zhu Yucheng said that the Preliminary Working  Committee is now considering this issue, and it is believed that  a solution acceptable to all parties concerned will be worked  out.    When attending another public occasion earlier yesterday,  Zhu  Yucheng was asked about the issue of the new airport. He said  that the Chinese side has never changed its attitude, and always  hopes that an agreement between the Chinese side and the British  side may be reached at an earlier date.    He pointed out that as Director Lu Ping of the State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office had said, the  problem that the Chinese side and the British side are now  trying to solve remains the financial arrangements for the new  airport project.</p>

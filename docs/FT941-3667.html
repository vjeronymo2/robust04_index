			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: GKN gets go-ahead for Westland bid GKN, the engineering group, has won shareholders' approval to go ahead with its bid for Westland, the helicopter group of which it already controls 44.8 per cent of the equity. GKN's 290p a share bid is handled by SG Warburg and values Westland at Pounds 497m. Sir David Lees, GKN chairman, told an extraordinary general meeting in Birmingham that proxy returns showed a majority of shareholders were in favour of the bid. The meeting, attended by about 40 people, voted unanimously for the bid, for the increase in the authorised capital necessary to accommodate the proposed takeover, and for the rights issue which will help to finance it. The rights issue would raise Pounds 248m in two instalments through the issue of con-vertible unsecured loan stock. The offer, GKN executives believe, has now come down to a straight issue of price.</p>

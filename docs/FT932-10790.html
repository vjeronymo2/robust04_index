			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Algeria reforms run out of steam: State of emergency has retarded economy programme MR ALI Kafi, the Algerian head of state, is due to address the nation tomorrow to outline a strategy for coming out of a 15-month state of emergency. But as political pressures, fuelled by Islamic fundamentalism, show no signs of abating, the economic reform programme is losing momentum. Mr Belaid Abdessalam, when appointed prime minister last July in the wake of the murder of Mr Mohamed Boudiaf, Mr Kafi's predecessor, decreed a 'war economy', a campaign to clear up corruption and stamp out the black market. He also promised ordinary Algerians their standard of living would not suffer from economic reforms. Many Algerians, however, were mindful of Mr Abdessalam's past. He was Algeria's economic overlord from 1965 to 1978 when a policy of massive industrialisation was launched and tight state control imposed on foreign trade. They share the view of many foreign observers that their country has, ever since, been paying a heavy price for this attempt to turn Algeria into 'the Japan of Africa by the year 2000'. The prime minister has so far been unable to deliver. There has been no campaign against corruption, the black market flourishes, and wages in the state sector were frozen last winter. Loosening the noose of Algeria's Dollars 26bn (Pounds 16.8bn) foreign debt, the servicing of which still absorbs three quarters of export earnings, has proved impossible. The prime minister has reinstated government control on imports of all foreign goods worth more than Dollars 100,000 and refused to allow the dinar, which lost half its real value between 1989 and 1991, to continue depreciating. These two decisions have prevented any new agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The one-year standby agreement reached with the IMF in June 1991 was in effect scuppered when that December the then prime minister, Mr Sid Ahmed Ghozali, granted a 40 per cent wage increase to workers in the state sector in an attempt to buy the elections. The attempt failed and the now banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) went on to win elections which were subsequently annulled. The government has stuck to one key element of the reforms, the freeing of all prices, bar those of basic foodstuffs such as flour and dairy products. But it says it is putting off other measures because it is unwilling to risk unleashing a social explosion at a time when it is engaged in an ever bloodier confrontation with radical Moslem groups. Under the new import system a committee of senior officials chaired by the minister of commerce must pronounce on roughly 1,000 import requests at its weekly Sunday meetings. One senior minister confesses that 'the system is a nightmare and quite unmanageable'. It also favours the large state corporations whose mismanagement and overstaffing are at the root of Algeria's economic woes and corrupt ways. It does nothing to rationalise the state sector as it allows entities which are de facto bankrupt access to the same foreign credit facilities as others whose health is far better. It also crowds out well-run private companies. The prime minister then suspended some articles of the Law on Credit and Money which in April 1990 had opened Algeria to foreign investment by granting the same conditions for all investors, be they domestic or foreign, state or private. By December 1991, 131 foreign companies had signed joint ventures to produce or distribute goods in Algeria, with planned investments of Dollars 2bn. Names such as Peugeot, Fiat, Daewoo, Pfizer and Rhone-Poulenc bear witness to the fact that many large western companies were interested in investing in Algeria. Another cause for concern is the budget deficit, which is set to double this year, reaching 14.2 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1991 the budget surplus amounted to 2.4 per cent of GDP. This mushrooming deficit is the result of the wage increases granted 18 months ago and of the growth in credit to state enterprises. Inflation is an estimated 30 per cent a year. Pressure on Algeria's external finances meanwhile remain considerable, despite the recent granting of a Dollars 900m package of Japanese Exim Bank loans to finance developments in the energy sector, the only one which is attracting a steady flow of foreign investment. Lack of agreement with the IMF has led Algeria into an impasse. Failure to pursue economic reforms is explained in government circles by the priority given to fighting 'terrorism'. Yet the real economy continues to decline. The prime minister is the only man with the ability to break the impasse. Many Algerians doubt however that Mr Abdessalam really believes in the reforms.</p>

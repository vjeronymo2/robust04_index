			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Delors hints at two-speed union: France and Germany could lead other EC states to quicker integration FRANCE and Germany could proceed to economic and monetary union with a few European Community partners if other countries held up the Maastricht treaty, Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, suggested last night. Mr Delors, in a thinly veiled reference to growing UK opposition to to Maastricht, said: 'If some countries are looking for alibis for delaying the treaty, it may well be that others take the lead . . . This cannot be ruled out.' Mr Delors was careful not name the countries which could proceed to speedier integration. But his remarks were the most concrete indications to date that France and Germany may be considering forging closer links based on an 'inner core' of EC states. Speculation about a 'two-speed' split in the EC - under which a Franco-German 'core', supplemented by the Benelux countries, would press ahead with political and monetary union - has been fuelled by this month's financial turbulence. By throwing its weight behind support for the French franc, the Bundesbank has underlined the strength of German political commitment to monetary ties with France. This contrasts with Germany's less enthusiastic support for maintaining parities with the lira and sterling, the two currencies which have withdrawn from the exchange rate mechanism. Pointing to the success of this week's Franco-German co-operation in defending the franc, Mr Delors said: 'The actions of every day bring us new lessons on how to proceed'. Officials in Bonn and Paris meanwhile denied a German newspaper report that the two countries had agreed to press ahead with 'high-speed' union. Mr Dieter Vogel, the Bonn government spokesman, said: 'These claims are invented and have no basis in fact.' An official at the Elysee palace dismissed the story as 'a flight of fancy'. However, this month's split between 'hard' and 'soft' European currencies has intensified the belief that a 'two-speed' Europe is inevitable. Mr Delors was reticent on specific proposals to restore order to the ERM. 'I have to be cautious,' he said. 'To have a stable market we need to fulfil certain requirements. But it's not really the moment to put forward proposals. It will be necessary to think either about the ERM or about accelerating the process of economic and monetary union,' he added. In an unscripted and impassioned attack on Maastricht's opponents, which came perilously close to identifying UK Euro-sceptics, Mr Delors asked: 'What do the partisans (of rejecting the treaty) propose instead? The short-term satisfaction of their public opinion and personal vanity. This is leading to decline and ridicule.' EC finance ministers will discuss possible reforms of the ERM at their regular meeting on Monday. UK officials said the 'shortcomings' of the ERM, outlined by Mr John Major, the prime minister, would be discussed, in preparation for the special EC summit in Birmingham on October 16.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Turchenko: "I Did Not Betray My Oath"] </F>   [Text] On the day the trial began, Senior Lieutenant Igor  Menshikov turned 25 years old. But how much more mature were his  position and his judgement than those of the commanders and  leaders who testified as witnesses at the proceedings!    "For what purpose did you go to the 'White House' on 26  September 1993?", the military judge, justice Major S. Nechayev,  asked the young officer.    "I was defending the constitution and carrying out the order  of the lawful authorities there," was the answer.    There are not many officers and generals in the Russian  Armed  Forces today who have the right and honor to say such words,  which are so simple and natural for a defender of the Homeland.  Today, some even express condemnation addressed at those who did  not betray their oath.    "I warned Menshikov that to go there was an expression of  lack of discipline," the temporary acting commander of the  sub-unit, Lieutenant-Colonel Medvedev, complained to the court.    The unit's assistant personnel commander, Lieutenant-Colonel  Gerasimov, was no less "principled" in his court appraisal of  Igor Menshikov's actions.    "What kind of evaluation can there be," mused the trainer of  the military servicemen, "if Menshikov had to be on duty during  one of the days when he was at the House of Soviets? Another  officer had to take his place. Yet this officer had some  personal plans, family responsibilities..."    Who is this Igor Menshikov, and what has he done?    We spoke with him at length during the recess between court  sessions and, honestly speaking, I was filled with pride at the  fact that there are such young officers in the army, who could  set an example of civic courage and high moral character for  many of their senior comrades.    By birth, Igor is from the Kazakh city of Aksay. His father  is a senior lieutenant in the militia. His mother is a building  engineer. In the summer of 1991, Menshikov graduated from the  Leningrad Higher Military Engineering School of Communications  and was assigned to the position of communications center  engineer with the General Staff. Such an appointment without  patronage means only one thing: Igor had distinguished himself  as a model student. And the young officer had managed to show  his best side also in his new assignment. In two years, there  were four recommendations for exemplary fulfillment of his  service responsibilities entered in his service record.    Despite Igor's youth, he had a large and strong family, by  today's standards: His wife Olga, a real friend in combat, and  his two daughters, whom their father doted upon. Perhaps his  love for them and his concern for their future largely  facilitated the fact that, in spite of the hypocritical appeals  by Grachev to the officers to stay out of politics, Senior  Lieutenant Menshikov could not be satisfied with the "kitchen"  struggle against the destruction of the state and the pilferage  of the country.    "For a long time, I sought my place in the ranks of the  defenders of the Homeland," said Igor in his conversation with  me. "I read about the Union of Officers in SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA  and DEN. I went to the headquarters of this organization,  familiarized myself with its program documents, and understood:  This is for me, both in spirit and from a professional point of  view."    "In September of 1993 you went to the House of Soviets as a  member of this organization?"    "Yes. But not only that. Even if I had not been a member of  it, I would have done the same thing. After all, only someone  who really did not want to know could fail to realize that the  fate of the constitution, the fate of Soviet statehood, and the  future of the simple people were being decided there."    The unit in which Igor served was stationed in Podmoskovye.  From an informational point of view it, as perhaps all the  military sub-units, were blocked. Therefore, at first it was  difficult to understand what was really going on in Moscow. On  26 September, after being relieved from his watch, Igor left for  the White House. He thought it would be for a day or two, but as  it turned out, everything was immeasurably more complicated.  Together with the members of the Union of Officers, he kept  watch inside the House of Soviets and outside.    ...The officer was detained by a group of OMON [special  purpose militia detachment] militiamen and, without presentation  of any accusations, taken to the 11th Militia Section.    Then there were lengthy investigations. Finally, they came  for Menshikov from his unit and took him back there. The  leadership reported "to the top" about what happened and filed  formal proceedings "for unwarranted absence from the garrison."  Everything would have ended there, had it not been for the  post-October purge in the Armed Forces. Menshikov, like the  other officers who remained true to their oath, was dismissed  from the Armed Forces by the Arbat generals.    The formulation of the order, signed by the chief of the  General Headquarters, sounds cynically frank: "Dismissed... for  incompatibility of moral-psychological qualities." Yeltsin's  "striped uniforms" went and decided for the people that they do  not need defenders of the Homeland who are faithful to their  oath.    It is true that at the judicial proceedings on Igor  Menshikov's claim against the Ministry of Defense for unlawful  dismissal, the representatives of the defendant are trying to  turn everything upside down. They are trying to present the  young officer as a violator of discipline, and those who hid  behind women's skirts in September-October of last year--as  defenders of the Homeland who are true to their oath.    Without mentioning the moral aspect of the question, which  is  ultimately clear, the juridical aspect is also synonymous. The  oath obligates the military serviceman to defend the  constitution and the constitutional organs of power. Article  121-6 of the Constitution in the edition adopted on 12 December  1992 reads: "The powers and authorities of the President of the  Russian Federation may not be used for changing the  national-state arrangement of the Russian Federation, for  disbanding or stopping the activity of any lawfully elected  organs of state power of the Russian Federation, otherwise they  are terminated immediately."    Senior Lieutenant Menshikov was able to understand all this  back in September of last year. The representatives of the  defendant pretend that they still do not understand this to the  present day. The judicial process is not yet concluded. We hope  that the court does not slip from the letter of the law onto the  curve of anti-popular policy.</p>

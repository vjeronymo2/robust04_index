			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Irish Company News: Bank of Ireland jumps 69% as US and UK losses are reduced BANK OF Ireland, the Republic's second largest clearing bank, yesterday reported a 69 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to IPounds 65.8m (Pounds 72.4m) in the half year to September 30, up from IPounds 38.6m at the interim stage last time. Mr Paul D'Alton, group financial officer, said 80 per cent of the improvement had come through loss reductions in the bank's US and UK divisions, while the 20 per cent growth in income to IPounds 409m was largely a result of the incorporation of last year's acquisitions of Amoskeag and BankEast banks in the US, into its First New Hampshire subsidiary. Retail profits in Ireland advanced 15 per cent to IPounds 70.6m, while those from corporate and treasury operations rose 18 per cent to IPounds 35.2m. UK losses were reduced by 48 per cent to IPounds 5.3m, while losses at FHN were cut back by 22 per cent to IPounds 27.3m. Mr Pat Molloy, group chief executive, said: 'We have had solid performance in our Irish-based business, and given the prevailing market conditions we believe we have done very well.' He said business prospects in the UK 'were, and still are very bleak", while any improvements in the US market 'will be very gradual and are not very perceptible'. The bank has writen down 'to a realistic value' its 940,000 shares in GPA Group, the aircraft lessor in talks with its bankers. Mr D'Alton declined to give the new value of its 0.41 per cent stake but said 'Any further write-down will not have a material impact on our results'. Loan loss provisions have been held at IPounds 72m (IPounds 70.4m), of which IPounds 42.6m relates to the New Hampshire market and collapse in property values there. Mr D'Alton said the bank had decided 'to grasp the nettle' in making, from the IPounds 42.6m, a IPounds 21.6m provision for market decline there. Hilco, an FNH subsidiary to which its problem property debts have been transferred, has had the carrying value of its repossessed properties reduced from Dollars 100m (Pounds 66.2m) to Dollars 21m by sales and write-downs, and which includes an additional Dollars 50m in transfers over the past year from FNH's books. Mr Molloy said he was not 'particularly pessimistic' about current high interest rates in Ireland. 'If these persist, however, then that has to be worrying.' An unchanged interim dividend of 3.33p is declared out of earnings per share up 34 per cent at 7.1p. COMMENT Bank of Ireland's ill-timed foray into the New Hampshire banking market in 1988 has cost it well over Dollars 500m in losses and write-offs, but there are hopeful signs that the corner has been turned. The millstone of FNH's failed property loans is being lightened, while rationalisation and acquisition of new plug-on retail banking assets in the New Hampshire market gives FNH a commanding 25 per cent market share with a wholly renovated loan portfolio. Good domestic retail performance and well-run treasury operations during the September currency crisis have made a strong contribution this time round. The only real worry is whether high interest rates will push the Irish economy into recession next year.</p>

			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / FT Law Report: French judgment can be enforced in the UK INTERDESCO SA v NULLIFIRE LTD Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Phillips: May 1 1991 A FOREIGN judgment given in a country which is party to the 1968 Jurisdiction and Judgments Convention can be registered in the UK despite defence allegations that it was obtained by fraud, because the English court will not re-investigate facts decided by the foreign court and, although it can hear fresh evidence as to fraud, it will not do so if the foreign jurisdiction has an appropriate remedy. Mr Justice Phillips so held when dismissing an appeal by the defendants, Nullifire Ltd, from Master Miller's order that a judgment obtained against it by the plaintiffs, Interdesco SA, in the Cour d'Appel, Paris, on September 27 1990, be registered in the High Court. HIS LORDSHIP said that Interdesco were manufacturers of paint with special fire protection properties. Their best-selling product was marketed as S60, indicating that it gave protection for at least 60 minutes. On January 13 1982, by a five-year agreement, Interdesco gave Nullifire exclusive distribution rights in the UK and Ireland. In mid-1985 Nullifire terminated the agreement. It claimed that S60 failed to satisfy the UK standard for 60 minute paint and was therefore unmarketable. Interdesco denied this. They contended that Nullifire was acting pursuant to a carefully-prepared plot to replace them and steal their market. Before the Tribunal de Commerce de Paris Interdesco claimed damages for wrongful termination. A crucial question was whether S60 satisfied the contractual standard. Interdesco relied on tests by the Centre Scientifique et Technique du Batiment (CSTE), the testing institution agreed under the distribution agreement. Those tests supported Interdesco's case that the paint was up to standard. Nullifire relied on earlier tests by the Warrington Research Centre and the Fire Insurers' Research and Testing Organisation (Firto), to prove the paint was sub-standard. The Tribunal attached little weight to the English tests. It gave judgment for Interdesco on January 21 1987. On June 15 1988 the Cour d'Appel de Paris rejected an appeal by Nullifire and appointed an expert to assess damages. The expert assessed damages at Ff7.4m, (Pounds .04) on the premise that but for Nullifire's breach of contract, Interdesco would have been able to continue to sell in the UK. Under the relevant French appellate procedure, each party filed with the Cour d'Appel a document described as 'conclusions', which was not evidence but was a statement of the party's case similar to a pleading in English law. Nullifire's conclusions averred that, after the breach of contract, Interdesco had attempted in vain to obtain certified approval of S60 in the UK. Interdesco filed conclusions confirming that it had not attempted to obtain certified approval in the UK. On September 27 1990 the Cour d'Appel substantially upheld the Ff7.4m assessment of damages. On December 4 1990 Master Miller ordered that the September 27 judgment be registered in the High Court pursuant to the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982. On March 26 1991 Nullifire instituted before the Cour d'Appel a form of appellate procedure known as 'recours en revision', to set aside the September 27 judgment on the ground that it was procured by fraud. The procedure could be constituted any time after judgment, provided it was initiated within two months of the appellant becoming aware of the facts giving rise to his ground of appeal. If the recours en revision succeeded the Cour would rehear the case on its merits. Nullifire now appealed against Master Miller's registration order of December 4. Section 2 of the Act provided that the 1986 Convention on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters was to have force of law in the UK. Article 27 of the Convention provided that a foreign judgment should not be recognised 'if such recognition is contrary to public policy in the state in which recognition is sought'. Nullifire contended that recognition of the judgment was contrary to English public policy because it was procured by fraud. On recently obtained evidence it made out a prima facie case that Interdesco's averments in their conclusions were calculated to mislead, even if not literally untrue. In Owens Bank v Bracco, FT April 12 1991 Lord Justice Parker said that where an English judgment was attacked on grounds of fraud the court would not permit the new action to proceed unless the plaintiff could put forward fresh evidence discovered since the first trial, which could not have been produced then with reasonable diligence, and which, had it been put forward, would probably have resulted in a different conclusion. In the case of a foreign judgment, he said, the judgment debtor could defend himself by showing fraud even though the plea would involve retrial in the UK of matters adjudicated by the foreign court. He held that was clearly established in Abouloff (1882)10 QBD 259 and Vadala (1890) 25 QBD 310. In Owens Bank the court was concerned with proceedings under section 9 of the Administration of Justice Act 1920, where the same principles applied as in an action on a foreign judgment at Common Law. The issue here was whether Abouloff applied in a Convention case. Article 29 of the Convention, under the heading 'Recognition', and article 34, under the heading 'enforcement', each provided 'Under no circumstances may a foreign judgment be reviewed as to its substance'. Where the foreign court had ruled on precisely the matters that a defendant sought to raise when challenging its judgment on grounds of fraud, the Convention precluded the court from reviewing the conclusion of the foreign court. Thus the rule in Abouloff could not, at least in its most extreme formulation, be applied in a Convention case. The question was what course should the court adopt where the defendant sought to raise a fresh case or to rely on fresh evidence. In the official reports on the Convention, Jenard commented that the public policy ground for refusal of recognition in article 27(1) 'ought to operate only in exceptional circumstances'. Schlosser commented that to obtain a judgment by fraud could constitute an offence against public policy. But, he said, the legal systems of all member states provided redress for a judgment obtained by fraud, and the court in the state addressed must therefore always ask itself whether breach of its public policy still existed in view of the fact that proceedings for redress could be lodged in the foreign court. The English court should first consider whether a remedy lay in the foreign jurisdiction. If so it would normally be appropriate to leave the defendant to pursue his remedy in that jurisdiction. It was not an area where rigid rules should be formulated. Estoppel principles should be applied with care and a degree of flexibility to ensure they accorded with rather than defeated the ends of justice - see Arnold v National Westminster Bank, FT, April 30 1991. Subject to that, the English court should not normally entertain a challenge to a Convention judgment in circumstances where it would not permit a challenge to an English judgment. It was hard to see how the English court could reliably determine that Interdesco's averment was instrumental in procuring the French judgment, without re-trying the entire issue of measure of damages. The proper course was to leave Nullifire to seek its remedy in the recours en revision. The French court was plainly the best place to decide whether there had been fraud. Mr Hirst submitted the court had power under article 30 of the Convention, to stay the proceedings until the result of the recours en revision was known. Article 30 provided that a court might stay recognition proceedings 'if an ordinary appeal against the judgment has been lodged'. In Industrial Diamond Supplies (1977) ECR 2175 the European Court ruled that 'ordinary appeal' within article 30 was an appeal 'the lodging of which is bound . . . to a period which . . . starts to run by virtue of' the judgment. The recours en revision could be instituted any time after judgment. It was not 'an ordinary appeal'. The court had no power to stay the proceedings. The appeal was dismissed. For Interdesco: Mark Cran QC (DJ Freeman &amp; Co). For Nullifire: Jonathan Hirst QC, Michael Brooke and Susan Carr (Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb).</p>

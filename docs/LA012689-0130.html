			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> JAIL INFORMANT TO BE SEGREGATED  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge on Wednesday ordered informant Leslie White,  who sparked an unprecedented review of jailhouse "snitches," segregated from  other County Jail inmates for his own safety.  </P> <P> "Because of the information he has divulged, he could be in jeopardy from other  inmates," Deputy Dist. Atty. Larry Longo said in asking Judge Ernest Hiroshige  for the "keep-away" order.  </P> <P> White, who failed to appear in Hiroshige's court last week for sentencing in a  purse-snatching case, told his attorney that he had been beaten up while on the  street by unidentified gang members who had marked him a "snitch."  </P> <P> White was arrested during a drug raid at a downtown motel over the weekend and  was brought before Hiroshige for the sentencing Wednesday, but the proceeding  was postponed until Feb. 23.  </P> <P> White last year demonstrated for authorities how, while in jail, he could  concoct a murder confession from a defendant he had never met by gathering  information over the telephone.  </P></p>

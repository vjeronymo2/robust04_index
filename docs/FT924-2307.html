			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Major confident treaty has been salvaged BRITAIN yesterday voiced growing confidence that the successful outcome of the Edinburgh summit had salvaged the Maastricht treaty. But Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted that British ratification of the accord was contingent on a Yes vote in the second Danish referendum. As he won praise from colleagues over his handling of the summit, he said the crucial third reading of the Maastricht bill in the Commons would be held after the Danish vote in late April or early May. Senior aides said he was confident the Danish electorate would support the accord agreed by its government in Edinburgh, thus rescuing the treaty. But Mr Major, who successfully resisted pressure at the summit to set a rigid timetable for ratification, signalled that if Denmark again voted No, Britain would also abandon ratification. British ministers said the agreements struck on Denmark's exemptions, on enlargement and subsidiarity, would prove a turning point in efforts to isolate Tory Euro-sceptics opposed to the treaty. In a statement to MPs today, the prime minister is expected to characterise the summit as a decisive turning point in Europe's fortunes - ending recent paralysis and setting the stage for an outward-looking and decentralised Community. For their part, Tory Euro-sceptics said last night that they would step up their efforts to wreck the legislation with lengthy Commons debate of the hundreds of amendments already tabled. The government also faced a warning from the opposition parties. The Liberal Democrats, firm supporters of Maastricht, said their backing for the government would depend on a 'speedy' third reading. Labour indicated that it intended to keep Mr Major guessing on whether it would again oppose the bill. Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, described summit proposals for European economic recovery as 'woefully inadequate', and said a deal had only been struck at the expense of increased UK contributions to the EC. The direct link between Danish and British ratification - set out in detail by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - added a note of uncertainty to what was widely judged to have been a considerable diplomatic success for the prime minister. Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC television, acknowledged that, if Denmark and Britain rejected the treaty, some or all of the remaining 10 governments might sign a new agreement. Britain would not leave Denmark isolated by joining them, he said. Mr Hurd acknowledged the risks by warning of the danger of Britain being left outside any grouping which could take decisions affecting UK 'jobs, prosperity and security'. Downing Street said the comments underlined its commitment that the Community's 12 nations should move forward together.</p>

			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / King denies Virgin row led to early departure LORD KING leaves his last British Airways board meeting to dismiss suggestions he stepped down early as chairman because of the airline's involvement in a 'dirty tricks' campaign against Virgin Atlantic. Lord King, who is 75 and was yesterday elected BA president for an initial three-year term, told waiting journalists: 'I have not resigned. If you want to make what is a very happy and proper occasion for our board into something different, go ahead.' He said running BA had been the 'crowning achievement' of his working life but that he was going in order to end uncertainty and speculation over BA's future leadership. He said BA had 'a great team, a united and strong board. We've got a proud company'. Further details, Page 8 Man in the News, Page 6 Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Act Is Challenge to International Law and Usage and </F> World Peace " -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA)--Delegates of  international organizations and political parties and  organizations of different countries criticised the United  States and its followers for aggravating the situation in the  Korean peninsula.    Sam Marcy, chairman of the Workers World Party of the United  States, in an article contributed to the newspaper workers world  on March 31 said the United States now is in a desperate bid to  make it appear that the DPRK "is promoting a criminal program  overtly and covertly to become a nuclear power."    He said it is entirely a matter of sovereignty for the  Korean  Government to decide on who should come and what he should  inspect, whether it be nuclear facilities or any other things.  The progressive people and working class in the United States  should support the DPRK's cause of justice, he added.    The Jordanian Islamic and Christian United Action Front in a  statement dated March 30 denounced what the United States has  been doing on the Korean peninsula as a total challenge to  international law, international usage, human rights and to the  interests of the people in the DPRK and the rest of Asia and to  world peace.    A Cuban delegate and 18 resident representatives of  Dominican, Palestinian, Salvadoran and other national political  parties and organizations and international organizations  including the Tri-Continental People's Solidarity organization  in Cuba held a joint conference in Havana on March 30 and  published a joint statement, in which they called attention to  the fact that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  authorities are now driving the situation of the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war on the pretext of the fictitious  "nuclear issue of the North". The actual nuclear threat on the  Korean peninsula comes from South Korea where U.S. forces are  stationed, said the statement.    It strongly urged the United States and the South Korean  authorities to unconditionally and immediately give up the  deployment of Patriot missiles in South Korea and the resumption  of the "Team Spirit" joint military exercises.    The Peruvian group for the study of works of Comrade Kim  Il-song and the Portuguese Committee for Supporting the  Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, too, published  statements urging the United States to renounce its position of  "strength" and solve the issue through dialogue and negotiation.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Country note: Woodland ways WOODS are as much a part of Britain's history as village churches and castles. But they are less respected, and often much more vulnerable. Kenneth Watkins realised this from his early 20s as a farm boy in Somerset. However it was not until 40 years later, as a wealthy retired agricultural engineer, that he was able to put his lifetime's vision into practice by forming The Woodland Trust. Now aged 82, from his retirement home in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, he still takes a regular walk in the nearby 100-acre Avon Valley Woods, the trust's first acquisition, that he negotiated 21 years ago. He is still chairman of the trust, which owns some 594 woods and manages more than 20,000 acres of woodland, stretching from Uig on the Isle of Skye to St Ives in Cornwall. It has a staff of 80 at its headquarters in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and another 46 staff, including 30 woodland officers, around the UK, and an annual income of Pounds 6m. Next week, National Tree Week, November 25 to December 5, the trust is celebrating its coming-of-age with a series of activities. There are celebratory tree plantings, demonstrations, open days, guided walks and woodland management courses, all aimed at reinforcing the prime message of the trust - that woods, particularly those threatened by clearance, large-scale conifer planting or neglect, need safeguarding. A typical Woodland Trust wood is Lineover Wood, 100 acres of mixed ancient woodland near Cheltenham. The trust purchased it from the Severn Trent Water Authority in 1986 with the help of grants from The Countryside Commission, the Nature Conservancy Council, Cheltenham council, the World Wildlife Fund, trust members and local people. Today it is presided over by 72-year-old retired nurseryman Ron Coates. Over the past six years Coates has spent an estimated 10 hours a week acting as voluntary warden. With the help of his son, John, and volunteers he has been clearing scrub, improving the access and encouraging the regeneration of natural species. 'I couldn't think of a more satisfying way of spending my old age,' said Coates, who used to tramp the wood as a boy. Woods owned by the trust are mainly used for leisure pursuits, such as walking and riding. In addition there are the many people - the trust has 150,000 supporters that it contacts by post - who like nothing more than a few hours enjoying woodland peace. The trust has a 'Country Seats' programme in 13 of its woods which was started in 1988 in response to an Pounds 80,000 legacy left by a long-standing member. It also has a woodland creation scheme, launched in Suffolk in 1991, and expanded to include another five sites. Although the trust does not fell wood specifically for sale, selling timber felled for management purposes forms a significant proportion of the trust's income. John James, director of the trust since 1980, says it is, on average, acquiring woods at the rate of one a week. He believes that sympathetic land ownership is the best way for the trust to offer the long-term protection that woodlands need. The Woodland Trust, Autumn Park, Grantham, Lincolnshire NG31 6LL.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 27 (AFP) -- Talks to bring Sweden and  Finland into the European Union (EU) made progress Sunday [27  February] but negotiations with Austria and Norway were still  stalled, European Commission officials said Sunday.    European Affairs ministers of the 12 EU [European Union]  member countries and representatives of the four candidates have  been engaged in talks on the countries' applications since  Friday.    The negotiators are facing a March 1 deadline to conclude  the  talks so that the European Parliament can approve the result and  the applicants can hold referendums in time to enter the EU  formally next January 1.    "We are making very good progress with Sweden, the situation  is good with Finland, but its a little more complicated with  Norway and Austria," a Commission source said.    French European Affairs Minister Alain Lamassoure late  Saturday warned that brinkmanship would not help the applicants  wrest concessions ahead of Monday night's deadline.    Representatives from the four candidate countries had  separate meetings with the EU negotiators early Sunday, with EU  ministers meeting later for lunch to discuss the state of the  talks.    Sources close to the negotiations said that Norway was still  refusing to allow EU countries greater access to its fish-rich  waters, or to accept limitations on its fish exports to the  Union if it became a member.    Norwegian Fisheries Minister Jan Henry Olsen said Saturday  that Norway could not give up "responsible management" of its  fish resources by allowing EU fishing fleets increased access to  its waters as the price of EU membership. Norway has ruled out  demands by Spain, Portugal and Ireland for new catch quotas in  Norwegian waters.    Austria also had refused to cut short a 12-year accord to  limit polluting truck traffic across the Austrian Alps, which  the EU maintains would contravene its basic principal of free  movement. Viennese officials, facing a vocal environmentalist  lobby in regional elections next month, refused an EU compromise  offer to let the trans-Alpine transport agreement run to  end-1999.    Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said it was  "inconceivable" that the accord could be cut short before its  scheduled end date of end-2004.    Finland was less hardline in its opposition to the  membership  terms offered by the EU, but expressed concern that farmers in  the southern part of the country would not qualify for special  subsidies.    EU officials were confident meanwhile that Sweden would sign  up to EU rules although Brussels has rejected Sweden's plea for  more time to pay its high membership dues. The talks with  Sweden centred Sunday on technical matters including the  country's strict anti-salmonella regulations and EU regulations  over banana imports, EU sources said.    The EU was unable meanwhile to overcome an internal squabble  over the balance of power between its richer and poorer  countries.    Spain was pushing, against the combined weight of its EU  partners and the four applicants, for rules to ensure that  enlargement would not reinforce the influence of the richer  northern countries at the expense of the poorer south.</p>

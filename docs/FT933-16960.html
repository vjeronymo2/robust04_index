			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (2): Team strategy unchanged - Christopher Parkes notes a friction-free transition at the Bundesbank THE substitutes are warming up and will be on the field soon. One thing is certain: when they take over this autumn, team strategy will remain unchanged. As for tactics - that depends on the pressure from the opponents. The recent confirmation of Mr Hans Tietmeyer as the next president of the Bundesbank and the nomination of Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum as his number two ensures a friction-free transition at the top of Europe's most influential central bank and a seamless continuation of the central bank's rigorous policy. Mr Tietmeyer, it is said, differs only from his predecessor Mr Helmut Schlesinger in that he prefers to take the lift rather than walk up the 12 floors to his Frankfurt office. On the issues that matter - the stability of the D-Mark and the credibility of the Bundesbank - he could be a Schlesinger clone. Mr Gaddum, his dry, low-profile vice-president, is more of an unknown. But in his current job in the Bundesbank directorate, in charge of money and credit, he has proved himself a skilled monetary manager - equally dedicated to the issues that matter. Mr Gaddum's department has been mainly responsible over past months for engineering the application of the Bundesbank's interest rates policy, comprising a series of sporadic small steps downwards (what Mr Otmar Issing, Mr Gaddum,'s directorate colleague, recently called 'dribbling'). Mr Gaddum was also the prime mover behind the bank's decision to reduce minimum reserve requirements under which banks were obliged to deposit up to 12 per cent of their customer deposits, interest-free, with the central bank. He himself said the move would help German banks' competitiveness. Others described the changes as a 'tremendous' boost. Outsiders are somewhat more reserved about his management of interest rates. In most of the moves this year so far, Mr Gaddum's team has first steered down long-term money market rates, by meticulous fine-tuning of the rates at which the Bundesbank supplies funds to commercial banks. This has opened up scope for the bank to execute judicious reductions in the internationally-important short-term discount and lombard rates. The process has been vociferously supported by his colleagues, who continually point out that 80 per cent of German borrowings are tied to the long-term rates. Unconvinced foreign politicians and industrialists have pleaded in vain for bigger, more frequent cuts on the basis that a German lead will allow reductions elsewhere which in turn will help fuel recovery from recession. Appeals from within Germany, where the Bundesbank is viewed as the country's most trustworthy institution, have been relatively few. Taken to task on its 'international obligations' the bank presented a united, stubborn front. Lower interest rates were not the only or the most effective way to help recovery, it said. For lasting growth and lasting stability, each country had first to put its own house in order  - Germany in particular. In paraphrase: instead of concentrating on rising insolvencies and unemployment and falling company profits, politicians should consider the deeper symptoms of malaise. Most of all the bank denounces runaway public sector deficits which 'crowd out' potential private sector investors from capital markets. The Bundesbank was particularly angered by the German government's first attempt at producing a so-called solidarity pact. From a design draft for a package of spending cuts which was intended to help Germany fund recovery in the east, the Bonn government, in cahoots with the opposition, employers and unions, concocted a range of new taxes and levies which will cost individuals and companies the equivalent of 2 per cent of gross domestic product a year. The bank, acknowledging the political will which had gone into generating the agreement, reacted with admirable restraint. Chancellor Helmut Kohl had made important political gains, but he had ignored Frankfurt's persistent warnings that spending cuts had to come before tax rises. When it became clear, in late spring, that the holes in the federal budgets were too big to be filled by the proposed tax increases (an estimated DM100bn of savings was required until the end of 1996), the bank had had enough. It stopped 'dribbling' with interest rates and resumed vigorous campaigning for real cuts. Ostensibly addressing the world at large, but clearly berating the Bonn government, Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues pulled no punches. They proposed that unemployment pay should be reduced and suggested that countries building up their social welfare systems should slow the process and consider whether they were on the right track. In response to calls for public spending programmes to promote growth, Mr Issing suggested the proponents should stop trying to fool themselves into believing that such projects created anything more than a flash in the pan. All that was left after the flash, he said, was a residue of debt which had to be serviced. It would be far better to stop subsidising 'dying' industries: steel, shipbuilding and agriculture for a start. The Bundesbank seldom uses such direct language, but its temper has been tested by critics at home in Germany who seem to suggest that it should abandon, temporarily at least, the policies which, for 30 years and more, have helped keep German inflation and unemployment lower than almost anywhere else in the industrialised world.</p>

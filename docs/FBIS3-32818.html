			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National" newscast] </F>   [Text] The magazine SEMANA reported today that Prosecutor  General Gustavo de Greiff, acting on his own and without  consulting anyone, has been negotiating for more than a month  with the Cali Cartel. According to the publication, the document  signed by De Greiff reportedly gave a kind of safe-conduct pass  to alleged Cali and Tulua drug traffickers to keep them from  being arrested. The names of these drug traffickers are  well-known figure Pacho Herrera, Jose Olmedo Campo, and a man  named Renteria. According to the magazine, the passes would  clearly show Prosecutor De Greiff has been in direct contact  with Cali Cartel leaders for more than a month, without  previously consulting the government or informing the security  corps or the Attorney General's Office. SEMANA said a top  government source expressed the government's surprise about the  actions taken individually and privately by the prosecutor,  because late last year the government and this office agreed to  keep each other informed of any developments.    According to SEMANA, the serious thing about the case is not  the fact that the prosecutor is acting like a loose cannon, but  that from the moment when the drug traffickers first came to his  office -- on 14 January -- it marked the beginning of the  preliminary investigations. In other words, this marked the  beginning of the search for evidence that must be provided by  the DAS [Administrative Department of Security], the Dijin  [Judicial Police and Investigations Directorate] in Colombia,  and Interpol. The odd thing is that the Prosecutor General's  Office did not officially inform any of these organizations.</p>

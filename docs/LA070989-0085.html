			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> IN THE GARDEN;  </P> <P> VEGETABLE GARDENERS: RELAX, BUT NOT TOO MUCH;  </P> <P> DURING SUMMER, KEEP UP WITH WATERING, HARVESTING AND WORM-CONTROL CHORES.  </P> <P> Summer presents a time to relax and enjoy your vegetable garden, especially the  summer harvest. Red, sun-ripened tomatoes, garden-fresh green beans, shiny  green, yellow and red peppers, tender young squash, luscious melons with their  marvelous aroma, succulent sweet corn, crisp cucumbers and glossy purple  eggplant form a colorful cornucopia of good eating.  </P> <P> But don't relax too much. Hot weather makes heavy demands on vegetables; they  need extra care this time of the year. And if you are going on vacation, it is  absolutely essential to have someone take care of your garden while you're  away. Here are some suggestions to help you maintain a healthy garden and a  prolonged harvest.  </P> <P> Watering: You must never neglect irrigation chores during the summer months.  Vegetables generally have higher water requirements than ornamentals, and you  can easily lose vegetable plants that are water-stressed.  </P> <P> It is best to water early in the morning. Overhead watering is to be  discouraged as it promotes mildew on many vegetable plants. How much water  should you apply? Irrigate your plants deeply at least once a week. The  moisture should penetrate at least 6 inches into the soil; tomatoes require  much deeper watering.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Frequent Harvesting  </P> <P> Keep in mind that vegetables grown in containers require far more frequent  irrigation. Never let the soil dry out completely as you can lose  container-grown vegetable plants in a matter of hours if they become  water-stressed.  </P> <P> Harvest frequently: Warm-season vegetables mature at an incredibly rapid pace  during periods of hot weather and require frequent harvesting. Check summer  squash and cucumbers daily, as oversized fruit will limit new production and  affect quality.  </P> <P> Beans, in particular, will produce over longer periods if picked often. Don't  allow melons to spoil because they are hiding under foliage -- search the  plants thoroughly.  </P> <P> Control weeds: Weeds compete with vegetables for moisture and sunshine. The  expression "grows like a weed" is doubly true during hot weather. Weeding is a  dull, tedious task, but you must force yourself to keep at it on a weekly  basis.  </P> <P> You can help lessen drudgery by using mulches around your vegetable plants.  Black plastic mulch is especially effective in controlling weed growth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worm Control Needed  </P> <P> Control worms: Now is the peak season for tomato and cabbage worms. Everyone  who has grown tomatoes knows what the big ugly tomato hornworm looks like and  the destruction it can do in a short period of time. Although cabbage and other  cool-season crops are not in production now, cabbage worms can cause a lot of  damage to other vegetables, particularly beans.  </P> <P> You can easily control both tomato and cabbage worms by spraying every 10 days  with a product containing the biological control Bacillus thuringiensis. The  products include Dipel, Attack and Thuricide.  </P> <P> These products will not harm warm-blooded animals, birds, bees or other  beneficial insects, but are highly effective in destroying harmful  caterpillars. Don't wait until the insects appear -- spray routinely every 10  days during the growing season.  </P></p>

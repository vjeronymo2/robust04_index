			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Armed forces' discontent worries Peruvian leaders RUMBLINGS in Peru's armed forces have prompted coup rumours twice in little over two weeks, again calling into question the political stability of President Alberto Fujimori's administration. Army discontent is not directed at the president. On the contrary, apart from the usual complaints about pay levels, the military, like most Peruvians, broadly support the government's economic and counter-subversion strategy. But sectors of the military have grown increasingly hostile to two of Mr Fujimori's closest collaborators: armed forces chief General Nicolas Hermoza, and Mr Vladimiro Montesinos, the president's intelligence adviser and confidant, who control internal armed forces promotions. General Rodolfo Robles, who until recently ranked number three in the army hierarchy, has alleged the two men were implicated in a paramilitary death squad. He claims that they were directly responsible for several recent disappearances and extra-judicial killings. Before making his allegations late last week, Gen Robles took refuge in the US embassy in Lima with his family, claiming their lives had been threatened. He has since been flown to Argentina where he is continuing to call for the removal of both Gen Hermoza and Mr Montesinos 'for the health of the nation'. Gen Robles, who this week was stripped of his rank, is widely respected for his defence of human rights. The accusations were immediately denied by the government. Mr Fujimori, in a series of television appearances at the weekend, did his best to limit the damage and pledged support for both aides. He said that recent successes against guerrilla organisations proved the 'efficiency' with which Peru's armed forces and the national intelligence service were operating. However, the accusations are likely further to arouse international alarm. The Clinton administration has made it clear that human rights will be the cornerstone of future policy in Latin America.</p>

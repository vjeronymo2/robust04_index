			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Windsor joins Premier League WINDSOR has won a contract to provide insurance for professional football's newly-formed Premier League, positioning it to take advantage of an expected influx of capital into the sport. Windsor, which has acted as brokers to professional football's associations and clubs since 1972, is already the dominant force in a market which generated over Pounds 5m in premiums last year. Under the terms of the deal, which is understood to be worth about Pounds 100,000, Windsor will supply personal accident and sickness covers and liability insurances for professional footballers. It has also been reappointed by the Football League, which will now organise all English and Welsh clubs outside the Premier League. The contracts will put Windsor in a prime position to win business to place insurances to cover stadia and extra personal accident insurance purchased by the clubs themselves. The league's personal accident policies provide coverage of some Pounds 30,000 - for a premium of about Pounds 450 - while transfer fees for top players in the UK frequently exceed Pounds 1m.</p>

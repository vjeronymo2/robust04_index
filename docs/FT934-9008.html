			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Observer: The AA banquet International accountancy firm Arthur Andersen has been belly-aching vociferously about the need to protect auditors against unjust and 'crippling' lawsuits from investors and disgruntled customers. But its case might get a more sympathetic reception if it did not waste so much of its hard-earned reserves on jetting into London this week 4,000 of its firm's partners and hangers-on. Twenty London hotels have been needed to accommodate them all. The official reason is AA's annual meeting. But judging by the banquet for the entire group on Tuesday night at Alexandra Palace, complete with string orchestra, jazz ensemble and a room kitted up as an English pub, there is still plenty of money left to keep the lawyers happy.</p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: McCaw Cellular cuts loss and boosts subscriber base MCCAW Cellular, the largest cellular telephone company in the US, yesterday reported a substantially lower first-quarter loss, improved cash flow and a 41 per cent year-on-year increase in cellular subscribers. McCaw, which has incurred a heavy debt burden to build up a national cellular network, is not expected by Wall Street to become profitable for a considerable time. It reported losses of Dollars 118.9m, or 67 cents a share, compared with a loss of Dollars 169.1m, or 97 cents, a year ago. However, revenues grew 32 per cent, from Dollars 209.6m to Dollars 276.6m, and cash flow was up 41 per cent at Dollars 113m, against Dollars 80m. Its interest expense dropped from Dollars 152m to Dollars 129.3m. The number of subscribers in markets where McCaw owns a controlling interest  -plus those of its subsidiary LIN Broadcasting and the jointly owned San Francisco system - rose to 1.77m at end-March, compared with 1.26m a year earlier.</p>

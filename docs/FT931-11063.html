			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / World Trade News: WWF worried on trade rules DRAFT rules designed to reduce technical barriers to international trade will block and even reverse government efforts to raise environmental standards, the World Wide Fund for Nature said yesterday. A WWF report on the proposed new Technical Barriers to Trade agreement, negotiated in the 112-nation Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, says that the accord would prohibit some environmental regulations and open others to challenge as being trade-restricting. Mr Charles Arden-Clarke, WWF policy analyst, said yesterday the draft TBT agreement would 'cripple national environmental policies and counter efforts to conserve the Global Commons.' Regulations on the use and transport of toxic chemicals, factory pollution and vehicle emissions could be weakened by the new rules. The WWF report underscores reservations already expressed by the US and some other countries about the draft TBT text, which aims to ensure that technical regulations and standards do not create unnecessary barriers to trade. The draft already recognises that countries should not be prevented from taking measures to protect consumers or the environment. But the draft also requires countries to use international standards, where they exist, unless they can show that these are inappropriate or are ineffective. The US wants revised wording that would stipulate countries' rights to set environment, consumer and safety standards above international norms. The US and environmental groups have similar concerns over a draft Uruguay Round agreement dealing with measures to protect plant and animal health. Mr Arden-Clarke said yesterday that the US change would be an improvement but it did not tackle the fundamental problem in that the TBT accord gave precedence to free trade over environmental protection. The TBT agreement, which would apply to most if not all of the 105 members of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), would replace the present voluntary code, which has 37 signatories.</p>

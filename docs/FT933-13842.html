			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (10): Volkswagen works wonders while the D-Mark loses its magic THE SECOND quarter of 1993 shook the foundations of European equity market sentiment. Little was lost in aggregate share price terms; much was threatened. Prospects for fiscal easing, and eventual economic recovery in Germany had been at the core of investors' calculations. But the prospect retreated as the Deutschmark lost its magic, falling by 5.1 per cent in trade-weighted terms over the quarter. Smith New Court, the London stockbrokers, reckoned that the closest parallel was with 1981/82 when serious D-Mark weakness versus the dollar held up a major decline in German short interest rates for roughly six months. Recession, massive job losses, poverty and social unrest weighed on Frankfurt equities. By June 30, they had not seen a key interest rate cut since April 22 (although the Bundesbank finally cut both discount and Lombard rates on July 1) NB there's some text missing in this para, I was using insert function inancial stocks, popular in the first quarter, had diminished. Elsewhere, bourses moved, or seemed to move on their home currency's ability to decouple from the D-Mark. Fiscal rectitude was not rewarded; as measured by the FT-Actuaries World Indices, the Belgian, French and German equity markets showed falls on the quarter, in sterling terms, of 3.1, 6.4 and 4.6 per cent respectively. The best gains of the three-month period were produced by post-devaluation countries like Finland and Italy, up by 20.3 and 23.1 per cent, with Italy torn also between speculation in privatisation prospects, and depression over individual corporate disasters. The international dichotomy was something new. Bourses had done well in the winter quarters of 1992/93, Europe excluding the UK gaining 9.5 per cent in the first three months of 1993 after a 9.3 per cent rise in October/December of last year. But the healthier impetus for these gains - arising from the economic recovery in the US, and from the slow relaxation of Bundesbank policy - had run out of steam. April/June provided more opportunities in Europe for the trader than for the investor, and fleetness of foot was at a premium. However, the phenomenon of the quarter and, indeed, of the first six months of 1993 was the rise and rise of Volkswagen, climbing from sorry status as a cyclical stock entering a severe economic depression to a pedestal position as a 'concept' stock. Volkswagen gained 21 per cent in local terms in the second quarter of 1993, and 52 per cent in the first six months, on the promise of draconian cost saving measures. Its experience was mirrored, less starkly, by other cyclicals and, in domestic currency terms, Germany's decline was mitigated by a recovery in June: this lifted the market by 3.2 per cent in local currency terms, as it fell by 5.3 per cent in terms of the dollar. France eventually decoupled from the D-Mark. Smith New Court said in London recently that French interest rates had fallen sharply, and would continue to fall: 'French short term rates are already. . . .below German rates,' they said in June, 'and this phenomenon will extend to long term rates as long as the D-Mark remains under pressure against the US dollar.' The 'strength' of the dollar, rarely expressed in equity markets as the weakness of the D-Mark, brought both domestic and foreign investors into cyclical stocks in Europe, particularly those in the embattled automotive industry. This left some analysts shaking their heads, and saying that there had been an element of window-dressing about the 'recovery'. Among the devaluation beneficiaries, there is more than a measure of support for Finland analysts saying that the scale of devaluation and its effect on depressed company operating profits should bring high rewards. Italy, says Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is 'an A1 mess'. It boasts the top five performers in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index in April/June, and the resounding bottom performer in the month in the debt-laden Montedison, down 30.75 per cent in sterling terms, and representing its similarly afflicted parent, Ferruzzi group.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Survey of Privatisation in Eastern Europe (6): From infancy to mid-life crisis - Hungary Just three short years ago Hungarian companies were in the vanguard of eastern Europe's leap into the brave new world of private ownership. Since then, Hungary has undertaken a rapid privatisation Hungary's privatisation has passed straight from troubled infancy to mid-life crisis. Just three short years ago Hungarian companies were in the vanguard of eastern Europe's leap into the brave new world of private ownership. Since then, Hungary has undertaken what officials claim is the fastest privatisation in the history of the world. The region's pioneer privatiser is facing the aches and pains of maturity. So soon after starting the disposal of state-owned assets, Hungary is fast running out of companies to sell. Significant industrial sectors, including cigarettes and tobacco, distilling, brewing, vegetable oil, sugar, confectionary, bread, newspapers, paper, refrigerators, cement and glass are largely in the hands of western multinationals. Recent events have shown there are are built-in limits to western cherry picking of prime national assets. First, Hungarians are no longer quite so convinced that they want western investors to dominate privatisation to the extent that they have. With nine out of the top 10 privatisations last year trade sales to western multinationals and 85 per cent of proceeds from foreign investors, some political backlash was virtually inevitable. A poll by the Szonda-Ipsos public opinion pollsters showed only a small margin of 7 per cent between those who favoured privatisation of industry and those opposed. A nervous government is responding with a subtle move away from reliance on foreign investors. The lopsided foreign focus on consumer goods industries is also unsustainable. A host of companies is still available forprivatisation, but the best of the state's portfolio is exhausted. 'The major eye-catching areas, they are done, they are gone; there are still some gems out there but you have to look hard for them,' says Mr Christopher Perrin, an investment banker at GZIZ, the central European investment banking subsidiary of Austria's Girozentrale. Consumer goods companies have been the first to be privatised for three main reasons. First, they were the natural target for multinationals searching for market share, the main attraction which drew western multinationals to eastern Europe in the first place. Second, many had close trading and licensing relationships with western companies which thus became natural privatisation partners. And lastly, title to property is clearer than in the case of, say, hotels. The flipside is that the most difficult privatisation prospects have been left till last. 'Some of the early ones went pretty easily, what is left will be more difficult,' says Mr Perrin. What remains in state hands, tends to remain there for good reason. Hungary is coming up against political and economic constraints on privatisation, which implies a likely hiatus in the process. Hotels, banks and utilities are next in line for privatisation and each sector is potentially attractive to investors. But privatisation in each sector is proving fiendishly complicated. Their common feature is that the government impinges far more than in the trade sale of a manufacturing company. In any country that is a recipe for delay and disruption. In a country such as Hungary, where democratic and efficient administration is developing painfully and falteringly after four decades of communist dictatorship, this creates bureaucratic impasse. There is little doubt that the hotels, banks and utilities will survive to be privatised and the government will eventually get around to creating the necessary legal and administrative framework. The real problem lies with a third category of companies so financially unattractive that western investors will never bid for them on any conceivable terms. Western advisers say part of the fault lies with the government's inflexible negotiating practice and inattention to its own ultra-liberal privatisation rhetoric. The SPA says that it accepts whatever price the market determines for a company - with the proviso that there be competitive bidding. However, the agency, sensitive to attacks from the political right for selling out the country, has never explicitly declared that it would accept a zero purchase price if the market dictated that and has never announced any such deals. In practice, western companies say, the SPA pays too much attention to meaningless asset valuations rather than market worth which drives investors' calculations. That is not so much of a problem when the subject is a profitable consumer goods company. But, for many industrial companies which remain and languish in the SPA's portfolio, asset valuations are a poor guide to what an investor would buy. This often makes for a gap between the two sides' negotiating positions. Most Hungarian companies are not interesting to western investors in their present form, whatever the price and however flexible the authorities. The challenge in these cases is to find owners for the parts of the Hungarian economy that western investors cannot reach. Recently Hungary has responded to this imperative with a highly empirical cocktail of privatisation measures. These include: A commitment that domestic investors will be preferred over foreign companies in the case of similiar bids for a company. Further help for domestic investors who cannot afford to buy a state company outright through concessional leasing, payment by instalment or option arrangements. The government has also said that it would make more of an effort to divide up state companies before sale, partly to stimulate competition but also to make them more digestible for local entrepreneurs lacking the financial clout of western investors. In recent weeks Hungary has given a nod to Czechoslovak schemes to spur domestic ownership by distributing rather than selling state property. The government is to hand over state assets to institutions such as universities. But wholesale distribution to the public through a voucher scheme is not on the agenda. Alongside the new initiative, the government is expanding a decentralised privatisation scheme for companies which are too small to have attracted interest from western investors and have generally lagged behind in privatisation. The decentralised scheme basically allows the management of the state company to privatise itself, with the help of a consultant. One other route for state companies into the private sector of increasing importance is through liquidation, which is growing as Hungary's bankruptcy law bites. Western advisers such as Price Waterhouse are particularly enthusiastic about the possibilities. Liquidation allows an investor to reduce the acquisition's debt burden, to pick and choose which part of the state company to buy, and to bypass the authorities and deal with the creditor banks which are the effective owners. There is a limit to what privatisation policy can do. Economic upturn matters far more. If interest rates continue downwards and profits recover, investors are expected to put their money in privatisation issues rather than in bonds or bank deposits. The ultimate accolade for privatisation is that the companies in private hands are those most strongly tipped to lead that recovery.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Roxburghe loses fight to save banking licence THE BANK of England has won its fight to revoke the licence of Roxburghe Bank, the Asian bank that went into administration in April. The decision follows an appeal against the Bank's petition brought by the shareholders of Roxburghe, who initially demanded that the case be reviewed by the banking appeals tribunal. After initial discussions they agreed in the last few weeks not to proceed with the appeal, the costs of which might have been charged to Roxburghe if they had lost. The details are revealed in a letter to be sent to the bank's 1,300 creditors early next week by Mr Tony Lomas and Mr Colin Bird, the joint administrators from accountants Price Waterhouse. Removing Roxburghe's authorisation to operate as a bank means that it has no prospect of emerging from administration procedure to trade as a bank in the future. It also means that if the company is to continue to trade in some other form, it will have to change its name in the next few months to remove the word 'bank' from the title. Mr J H Shah and Mr R H Shah, two directors, are believed to be considering continuing their fight against aspects of the Bank of England's petition. The Bank petitioned for Roxburghe's administration after monitoring its position for some months. The administrators said much of Roxburghe's business was with relatively high-risk borrowers. Most of the depositors were from overseas, predominantly based in India and Kenya, and many held deposits for relatively small amounts. They estimate that Roxburghe has assets of about Pounds 34m and liabilities of Pounds 32m after provisions. Further provisions may give it negative net worth of up to Pounds 5m, reducing the dividend to creditors below 100 per cent. Roxburghe is the fourth bank serving the Asian community in the UK to have been affected since the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International in 1991. Mount Banking, which recently made a voluntary arrangement with its creditors, is currently appealing against the Bank of England's petition for withdrawal of its banking licence.</p>

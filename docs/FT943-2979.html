			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Sizewell B gains loading approval Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, was yesterday given approval by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to load uranium fuel into Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised-water reactor nuclear power station. Permission was granted by the inspectorate after safety checks. Loading of fuel into the plant, which was built within its Pounds 2.03bn budget, is expected to start today and be completed by the end of next week. Start-up of the reactor is unlikely before December, however, because of delay in obtaining an authorisation to discharge radioactivity into the environment from the Inspectorate of Pollution.</p>

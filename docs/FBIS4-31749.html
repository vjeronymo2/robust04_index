			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by MM: "Government; Poland Under `Open Sky'; Budget </F> Revenue and Expenditures Line Up Very Nicely"]    [Text] The Council of Ministers yesterday approved a  report by the Finance Ministry concerning the implementation of  the budget for January to May 1994, and it also approved a draft  law to ratify the "Open Sky" treaty.    The report on budget implementation presented by the Finance  Ministry states that after five months, 38.3 percent of planned  revenue expenditures has been implemented, which is more than  last year (37.5 percent). Budget expenditures are also higher  than last year -- 36.2 and 35.6 percent, respectively. The  ministry reports that there were no problems in financing the  budget deficit.    The "Open Sky" treaty was signed by the foreign ministers of  25 countries as early as March 1992. It pertains to the issue  of permission for mutual observation of terrain by aircraft of  countries which are parties to the treaty. The convention will  take effect after it is ratified by 20 countries. Up to now,  only 16 countries have done so. At the beginning of each year,  countries which want to conduct aerial observations, present the  numbers of their planned flights. Countries over which the  observations will be conducted (these are military and economic  observations), will be notified 24 hours before the set date.  The authorities of the countries, however, will not know the  exact route of the flight until the very last moment.</p>

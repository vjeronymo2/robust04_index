			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: N Ireland Electricity subscribed 3.9 times THE SHARE offer for Northern Ireland Electricity, the last of the regional electricity companies to be privatised, has been subscribed 3.9 times. Following a clawback of shares from institutions, the public offer was still subscribed 2.7 times. All registered customers have been allocated some shares, and those applying for up to 300 shares received a full allocation. Customers who applied for 15,000 shares and above have been allocated 10 per cent of their application if they applied through a share shop, and 8 per cent if they applied elsewhere. Non-customers who applied for 1,500 or more have not been allocated shares. Dealings should start on Monday. Interim certificates are due to be despatched next Thursday.</p>

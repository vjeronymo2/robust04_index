			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Cash in on mortgages - Lenders are putting out some tasty bait People often move house in spring, but recent building society lending figures showed even fewer did so this year than last. As a result, societies are waving wads of cash in front of potential customers. Depending on your circumstances, these could make it worth switching to another lender - even if you do not intend to move house. Fixed rates The table shows a selection by mortgage broker John Charcol of the better deals on the market. Try to avoid compulsory buildings or contents insurance unless you cannot get a better deal elsewhere. All fixed rates carry a fee along with early redemption penalties; the latter make the cost of switching to another lender very high and deter early capital repayments. Against these disadvantages, you can balance the security of knowing how much payments will be over a given period. Variable rate: discount The lender gives you a fixed discount on its standard variable rate for a limited period. The largest discounts are for shorter periods. Discounts are very attractive, so what is the catch? Most lenders will charge early redemption penalties which exceed the discount period, so make sure that their standard variable rate is competitive. Charcol has just launched a mortgage combining fixed and discount rates. Interest is fixed at 6.75 per cent until January 1 1996, followed by a one percentage point discount on Britannia's variable rate until January 1 2000. The fee is Pounds 299. Variable: cash-back If you need cash, lenders are offering it. But the Inland Revenue is still deciding whether to tax such payments. In general, you should be able to save more with a discounted rate than a cash-back but it depends on the amount being borrowed and the cash-back limits. Both discounts and cash-backs are so attractive that it is worth considering re-mortgaging to get one or the other. Ask the lender how much it would charge you to re-mortgage to see if the savings are significant. If you have a fixed rate, though, the early redemption penalties make any savings unlikely. Pep mortgages One of the most flexible and tax-efficient ways of saving to repay the capital on an interest-only mortgage is through a personal equity plan, which is free of income and capital gains tax. Some lenders are reluctant to grant a Pep mortgage, but another way into one is through a Pep provider. Some unit trust groups, including Fidelity and Prolific, have made arrangements with lenders so that funds are available if you select one of their Peps. Consider investment performance and charges when you make your choice. Large borrowers High earners may want more flexible borrowing facilities than available on the high street. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson has a mortgage management account which offers a draw-down facility charged at the mortgage rate, and a cheque book for minimum withdrawals of Pounds 1,000. Interest on money withdrawn by cheque is charged at 1 percentage point above the bank's variable mortgage rate of 7.25 per cent. The cash borrowed, together with the mortgage amount, must not exceed 80 per cent of the value of the home and the minimum salary requirement is Pounds 35,000.  ----------------------------------------- Best cashback buys  -----------------------------------------                      Amount        Max Lender                   %      (Pounds) Bank of Ireland        3.5        7,350 Halifax               3.75        6,000 Chelt &amp; Gloucs         3.0        6,000 Newcastle              5.0        5,000 Natnl &amp; Prov           2.0        5,000  ----------------------------------------- Source: John Charcol  -----------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Best Mortgage Buys  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Interest                      Max Lender                       rate/(APR)        Until     advance  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATES Yorkshire bs               1.90% (2.1%)       1/5/95         95% Hinckley &amp; Rugby           4.74% (4.9%)       1/5/96         70% Northern Rock              4.99% (5.2%)       1/3/96         95% Alliance &amp; Leicester       6.99% (7.9%)      3 years         80% Alliance &amp; Leicester       8.49% (8.5%)      5 years         80% TSB                        8.89% (9.5%)    31/3/2004         75% Capital Home Loans         8.49% (8.2%)       1/3/99         95%  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Minimum         Redem        Comp.

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Arts: A powerful, primitive vision - William Packer admires the work of Alfred Wallis Fifty years ago the Cornish painter Alfred Wallis died a pauper forgotten by the community of artists which had patronised him and neglected as a serious painter. Now his work is much in demand, and the anniversary of his death is being celebrated by exhibitions in St Ives, Exeter and London and by a revised edition of the biography by Sven Berlin, long out of print, Alfred Wallis: Primitive (Redcliffe Press: paperback: Pounds 9.99). It is a sad story which Berlin told with passion and anger shortly after his hero's death. Berlin had worked in Cornwall as a young man before the second world war and made use of his intimate acquaintance with the farming and fishing communities of West Penwith to gather up the stories and circumstances of Wallis's long, cantankerous and difficult life. In the preface to the first edition in 1943, he wrote: 'Some will say, why trouble? The paintings speak for themselves. True: they do. There is already too much rubbish written on art. That is why I wish to talk mainly about the man.' His memoir is thus an invaluable, irreplaceable account. Now, almost half a century later, Berlin's anger has faded. However, in the preface to his new edition, he says: 'To think back is often painful. A friend told me he recently went into a gallery in Mayfair and asked the price of the Alfred Wallis painting in the window. Pounds 8,900, was the reply: we have had several. They sell as soon as they come in] He's very popular . . .' This simply confirms Wallis's reputation as an artist and the underlying seriousness of his work. However, the difficulty in assessing Wallis now relates not to price or value but to critical status. Berlin's own epithet, Primitive, is the real problem, for it suggests an otherness of culture which now seems more and more unsustainable. Wallis was untutored, natural perhaps, but not primitive. Yet it was clearly a sense of otherness that set Wallis apart even from his own community in his lonely old age as a widower. Then it was, at the age of about 70 in the mid-1920s, that he began to paint, using whatever materials came to hand. He painted images of what he knew and remembered of his days at sea, indeed still saw with his inner eye. Those paintings of his last 20 years captivate us still, with theirpowerful, authentic vision of a vanished world. The strength derives not only from the charmingly odd and natural images but very much from the conviction and authority with which they are done. These things are true paintings, properly realised in the paint itself, the colour wonderfully controlled, the composition quite as secure and strong as it is original and unexpected. His paintings work to their own pictorial logic and such is his belief in his world that we too entirely share it. Natural painter, maybe, but a painter nevertheless, and few have ever painted ships and the sea so lovingly, so knowingly and so well. These strange and beautiful things, set out to dry at his door, soon caught the eye of more conventionally sophisticated artists who came to St Ives and found themselves in Back Road West from time to time. We must remember that the primitive, the art of the native peoples of Africa, the New World and the South Seas, was very much the currency of the avant-garde in those days, legitimised by Picasso and Matisse and their confreres in Paris well before the First World War. The young Ben Nicholson and Christopher Wood were most certainly alive to such things, and we can readily understand their interest and excitement at coming upon Wallis and his work for the first time. Whether his was to be an influence actually exerted upon them, or was rather an example they deliberately chose to draw upon, the effects were manifest soon enough in their own work. But they by no means treated him as an equal and fellow artist. To Nicholson and Wood and their friends, Wallis may as well have come from another, lesser order of creation, to be treated kindly of course, indulged and even flattered, but not taken too seriously. Primitive, in short, got in the way, and the line between patronage and exploitation becomes hard to draw. Take for, example, this letter from Ben Nicholson, early in 1929. 'Dear Mr Wallis, Many thanks for the new paintings. There are some lovely ones among them, and we like them very much. Mr Wood and Mrs Nicholson both liked one of them as much as any you have done . . . I am sending back four and have kept nine as follows - one 3s, two 2s, six 1s: 13s, Post 1s. 6d: 14s. 6d, and enclose cheque for 14s. 6d &amp; hope this is correct?' Berlin goes on to say that collectors worked out a scale of charges, 'going up to 8s for the larger ones.' Of course 1s was worth more in those days (about the equivalent of Pounds 1 today). But even so, 8 shillings] However, these patrons thought they were helping, for Wallis as often as not would give his work away to the sympathetic visitor. He died in the workhouse, unsupported by his artist friends, and was only saved from the pauper's grave he dreaded by the painter-critic, Adrian Stokes, who gave Pounds 4.10s for a proper plot. The Salvation Army did at least give him a decent funeral. Bernard Leach, the potter, made the golden lighthouse that marks the grave, but 'got only about Pounds 19 to cover his costs. Few subscribed and none were very generous . . .' Alfred Wallis - Mercury Gallery, 26 Cork Street W1, until November 21: Wills Lane Gallery, St Ives, until October 31: Gordon Hepworth Gallery, Exeter, until November 25.</p>

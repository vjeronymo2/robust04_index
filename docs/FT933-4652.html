			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Management: Give yourself a pat on the head - Lucy Kellaway examines ways to overcome stress at work 'I WANT you to relax. Rest both your feet firmly on the ground. Shake your hands like this, and place them in your lap. Now shut your eyes, gently close your lids and concentrate on doing that. Breathe in through your nose and then out through your mouth. Slowly, slowly, take your time.' It could have been a relaxation class for expectant mothers. In fact it was a seminar for stressed-out executives, given in London this week by a woman who fights stress on the front line in New York. Silvea Thomas has taught the New York police force and fire service how to overcome the pressures of their work, and argues the same methods of coping apply to anyone in any job. Dealing with stress while making a violent drug bust in Harlem or fighting a towering inferno is no different from managing the pressures of nine-to-five office life in the suburbs. 'The way in which the body responds to stress is common to everyone,' she says. 'The issue is not the level of stress but how you deal with it.' The trick, she argues, is to recognise at the outset when we are getting into a stressful situation, and learn how to talk ourselves out of it. So whenever an underling is obstructive, or the boss shouts, the pulse begins to race and the adrenalin flows, we must stop for a minute. 'Say to yourself: 'What's the rush? slow down', or count to 10, or do anything to give yourself time for a change of focus.' This she says sends the body a physical message which helps switch off its alarm signals. You should 'give yourself a positive to take place of the negative'. This means that when challenged you should act as your own cheerleader, telling yourself that you can do it. In extremis you should not only urge yourself on, but should pat yourself on the head. She recommends that you give yourself a series of little strokes all over your head starting from the top. If you are embarrassed to do this in the middle of a meeting you could go to the lavatory and do it there, she suggests. People should also take their lunch breaks, no matter how busy they are, and go for a brisk walk. They should make an effort to snatch moments during the day to clear their minds and relax. Firefighters in New York - which may be the stress capital of the world - may have long since realised the importance of stroking their hair and inhaling deeply. But according to Thomas people in the UK are still not aware of the extent of the damage done by stress nor the need to address the problem. On returning to the UK after an absence of nine years, she finds stress everywhere. People are frightened of losing their jobs, and those who still work are having to work harder. Meanwhile improvements in technology have meant that everybody is on call 24 hours a day. 'You can be caught anywhere, everywhere,' she says. She believes figures from the UK Health and Safety Executive for the amount lost each year through occupational stress sickness are too low because they only look at absenteeism. More realistic are official US figures which estimate that the overall effect of stress, taking into account the inefficiency it causes, will cut gross national product by 10 per cent. So if the person opposite you on the train starts giving their head little pats, look on them with respect: they may indirectly be increasing the country's GNP.</p>

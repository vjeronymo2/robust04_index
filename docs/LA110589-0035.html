			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPBELL SETS OFF SCRAMBLE WITH PLAN TO QUIT SENATE  </P> <P> Sen. William Campbell's surprise decision to step down from office is enticing  San Gabriel Valley-area politicians to study voter registration figures and  consult strategists to decide whether they should attempt a scramble up the  political ladder.  </P> <P> Within hours of the Oct. 26 announcement by the Hacienda Heights Republican,  Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier) jumped into the Senate race, prompting at  least seven would-be candidates, including former Assemblyman Wayne Grisham, to  consider whether to seek his Assembly job.  </P> <P> Last Wednesday, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), who is serving his  third term in the lower house, announced he too would be a candidate for  Republican Campbell's 31st Senate District seat. The sprawling district  straddles parts of Southeast Los Angeles County, the San Gabriel Valley and  stretches south to El Toro in Orange County. Among the district's registered  voters, the GOP holds a 54% to 36% lead over the Democrats.  </P> <P> In a prepared statement, Ferguson said that, in part, he was prompted to run  because "Los Angeles-area lawmakers now dominate the Legislature" and that "no  one from Orange County has ever represented the district," even though more  than half the voters live there.  </P> <P> At least two other Republicans are considering the race. One is Brea City  Councilman Ron Isles, who last Monday said he is "95% certain" he will run for  the Senate. The other is Diamond Bar City Councilman Gary Miller, who said he  might enter the contest for the seat, which will become vacant in January.  </P> <P> Campbell said he has not made up his mind whether he would endorse a candidate  to succeed him.  </P> <P> Isles, 51, said he is willing to spend $500,000 of his own money on the  campaign. In a statement, he indicated ethics could be an issue, warning that  "the candidates who decide to enter this contest better not be carrying any  political baggage." In an interview, Isles said the statement was not aimed at  Ferguson or Hill.  </P> <P> In 1987, Ferguson, 66, failed to properly report some of his personal income  and amended his economic disclosure statement after newspaper stories revealed  the discrepancy. The Fair Political Practices Commission is investigating the  matter.  </P> <P> Hill, 35, is one of the five elected state officials who are targets of an  ongoing FBI investigation into political corruption in the Capitol.  </P> <P> Hill, who previously had been advised not to make statements to the media about  the investigation, said last Tuesday: "I know as much about it as I read in the  newspapers. I haven't done anything wrong, and I'm running."  </P> <P> The four-term lawmaker said he has no idea whether the FBI probe will be a  campaign issue. "I get the sense that it's something in the past," he said.  </P> <P> But Democrat Janice Lynn Graham, 53, who last year ran for Campbell's seat,  maintained that Hill "has a cloud over his head with the FBI . . . that might  create a problem for him." Graham, a retired businesswoman and teacher from  Laguna Hills, said she is exploring whether to seek the office, despite losing  to Campbell by a wide margin.  </P> <P> Campbell's Senate seat and Hill's Assembly seat are regarded by campaign  consultants as relatively safe for the GOP because registered Republicans  outnumber Democrats in both districts.  </P> <P> Democrats acknowledge that capturing either district would be a long shot. But  privately, several Democratic legislative staffers say the party might be  willing to pump money into a campaign if Assemblywoman Lucy Killea (D-San  Diego) wins a December special election in what is also regarded as a safe  Republican Senate district in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Campbell officially steps down in January and the secretary of state's office  said Gov. George Deukmejian could call the primary in March or April with a  runoff, if necessary, in May or June.  </P> <P> The secretary of state's office said Hill or Ferguson could file for reelection  to the Assembly while campaigning for the Senate seat.  </P> <P> Hill, who estimates that he has $260,000 in his Assembly war chest, said he is  undecided whether he will seek both seats at the same time. If he ran for  reelection to the Assembly and won, a special election for his seat might not  be held for another year, according to state election officials.  </P> <P> The impact of campaign contribution limits approved last year by voters on the  special election is also unclear.  </P> <P> In Hill's district, registered Republicans outnumber Democrats 48% to 43%. The  district includes Walnut, La Habra Heights, La Mirada, a large part of  Whittier, Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights, Rowland Heights and parts of Industry,  West Covina and South Whittier.  </P> <P> Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) said Democrats in the past have "busted our  pick" trying to get a Democrat elected in the district. "It still seems pretty  much like a safe Republican district."  </P> <P> Among the Republicans lining up for Hill's seat, Grisham, 66, is the most well  known. A former La Mirada city councilman, Grisham represented part of the  district during two terms in Congress from 1978-82. After losing his  congressional seat and serving as a Peace Corps official, Grisham established a  voting residence in Norwalk. He won two elections to the 63rd Assembly  District, but last year narrowly lost a reelection bid.  </P> <P> Hill, a former Grisham aide, maintained that his one-time boss must "be  considered the front-runner. He's going to raise some money and he's got a base  of support. He's never had a negative campaign in this district."  </P> <P> Grisham, who has been serving as a broker in his son's real estate office,  confirmed he is "seriously considering" making another political comeback.  Grisham pointed out that Hill's Assembly district encompasses half of his old  congressional district.  </P> <P> Also considering the race is Walnut Mayor Drexel Smith, a 43-year-old  Republican. Smith, who is running for reelection to the City Council, said:  "I'm looking at it as an option and an opportunity that needs to be evaluated."  </P> <P> If Hill does not seek reelection, Diamond Bar City Councilman Paul Horcher, 38,  said he will definitely be a candidate for the Assembly. Ken Manning, 38, a  member of the Hacienda-La Puente Unified School District, said there is a  strong possibility he, too, will be a candidate for the lower house.  </P> <P> Another Republican regarded as a potential candidate is Barbara Shell Stone of  Whittier. But last Wednesday, Stone, who finished second to Hill in the 1982  GOP primary, said: "There's no opening so I'm not going to deal with it. . . .  That's not appropriate."  </P> <P> Other Republicans who say they might be interested in seeking Hill's seat  include Dan Pellissier, 29, of Whittier, a former aide to Grisham and to Sen.  Minority Leader Ken Maddy (R-Fresno), who is now a public affairs analyst with  Southern California Gas Co.; Tony Russo, 26, a former aide to Hill and Grisham  now serving as chief of staff to Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), and  Ray Andersen, 33, of Diamond Bar, a former deputy to County Supervisor Pete  Schabarum.  </P> <P> Also mentioned as a possible candidate is Democrat Terry Lee Perkins of Walnut,  who lost to Hill in 1988.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Dave Lesher in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA feels that more diligent efforts could be expended by applicants in locating more viable sites. Sites which have sections unsuitable for building should be avoided. However, if a situation exists where the only available site is of a size, shape, or condition which makes a portion unsuitable for building and the only alternative is to not provide units, then a request to the State Office for an exception to this density requirement may be considered. Such language has been added to the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 25. Section 1944.215(a)(6)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several respondents expressed the opinion that hiring construction inspectors is unrealistic at a time when FmHA staff is being reduced. They also pointed out that delay in obtaining timely construction inspections by FmHA has been a problem and suggested including language in the regulation that would require necessary inspections within a reasonable timeframe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The hiring of construction inspectors is a suggestion which may or may not be possible to follow. If not, it may be possible for States to contract for these services. The comment about not having timely construction inspections by FmHA provides an appropriate case-in-point for adequate inspection coverages. This subject will be discussed at future training meetings with the field staff. FmHA feels that the proposed language is appropriate as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 26. Section 1944.215(a)(7)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were several comments that the restriction of building design will result in all buildings being shaped like a box.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA feels this is an overreaction and that this section will not lead to the construction of boxes. We have observed, in many States, how a simple yet attractive design is an asset to the community. These types of simple designs do not deter potential tenants from seeking residency. The Agency feels that the design of some of the housing units now in existence have gone beyond what is necessary to provide decent, safe, and sanitary living units. The Housing Act of 1949, as amended, specifies that ``no loan shall be made or insured *&blank;*&blank;* unless the Secretary finds that the construction involved will be undertaken in an economical manner and will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or materials.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 27. Section 1944.215(a)(8)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two respondents recommended against setting the building roof slope limits proposed in this section, one because of the snow loads in the northern States and the other because they could result in a building which lacks interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA agrees with the argument against setting the lower slopes in cases where there are heavy snow loads. The wording has been changed to allow the State Director to authorize a higher slope if needed to accommodate severe weather conditions. The Agency disagrees with the opinion that these slopes will result in a lack of building interest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 28. Section 1944.215(a)(9)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several respondents expressed agreement with this section. Several others felt that the use of repetitive designs would result in ``cloned'' projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> FmHA response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  FmHA does not feel that the use of repeat designs will have any detrimental effect on the aesthetic value of FmHA-financed units. In fact, several States now require the use of repeat designs without detrimental effects. The National Office assesses the 515 program in multiple States each year, which includes a visual inspection of the rental stock. We have not found the use of repeat designs to be offensive or boring in any State. FmHA feels that the submission of new designs for all projects needlessly increases the amount of Government funds needed since the amount of architectural fees is based on the level of services provided. Repeat designs will decrease the amount being paid for architectural fees since the use of ``shelf'' plans will reduce the detailed architectural services needed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Section 1944.215(a)(10)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several respondents stated that community room furniture should be included as an eligible loan expense; one respondent supported the inclusion of dining room furniture in congregate housing. Another respondent supported the inclusion of community rooms in family projects and garbage disposals. A few respondents suggested allowing sliding glass doors where patios/balconies are permitted. One respondent suggested adding whirlpools to developmentally disabled housing. Two respondents supported the inclusion of bay/box/picture windows. One respondent voiced support for prohibiting fire places, garages and covered parking. Two respondents supported this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

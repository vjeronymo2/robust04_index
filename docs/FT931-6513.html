			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Institutions back Trafalgar cash call - Board braced for criticism from small shareholders TRAFALGAR HOUSE'S institutional shareholders have backed the group's controversial Pounds 204.5m rights issue in advance of an extraordinary general meeting today to approve the transaction. Proxy votes received by Trafalgar are understood to show a clear majority in favour of a cash call at 60p a share. Nevertheless, the board is bracing itself for criticism from small shareholders at today's meeting. News that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is investigating the group following its decision to restate its 1991 accounts has cast a shadow over the egm. The Institute said it had not launched any formal investigation against the accountants associated with Trafalgar House. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary of the Institute, said the inquiry followed automatically after the Financial Reporting Review Panel forced the group to bring a Pounds 138m write-down on property assets into its profit and loss account. This turned a reported Pounds 122.5m profit into a Pounds 30m loss. Mr Colquhoun said it was too early to say whether any accountants on Trafalgar's board would be reported to the Institute's disciplinary committee. There are four accountants on Trafalgar's board - Mr John Ansdell, financial director, Mr David Calverly, property division chairman, Mr Ian Fowler, company secretary, and Sir Eric Parker, deputy chairman. The inquiry comes as a number of Trafalgar's executives believe Hongkong Land, which is expected to shortly take its stake up to 29.9 per cent, is preparing to push through a series of management changes as well as bringing in new financial advisers. Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, said there were no planned changes to the group's advisers, which include Kleinwort Benson and UBS Phillips and Drew, or to the board other than those already announced. He condemned the 'speculation' surrounding people's future and described Trafalgar's relationship with Hongkong Land as very good. However, the company believes that it would not be surprising if over a period of time a number of changes were made at the behest of Hongkong Land.</p>

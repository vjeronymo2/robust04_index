			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Oil Hedge funds are rapidly gaining the reputation and popularity of medieval witches. As a consequence, they are ritually burnt at the stake every time some ill befalls the global capital markets. The latest incarnation is the unexpected rise in the oil price in recent days. Crudely put, since other commodity prices have risen and oil has lagged badly, it is seen as an obvious target for speculative funds. The interesting question, however, is whether the hedge funds are being smarter or slower than conventional oil market traders. The second quarter often sees softening oil prices as demand slips back after the winter. Opec's failure to rein back production - partly at Saudi Arabia's behest - shows the cartel's weakness and inability to police quotas. Indeed, the Saudis seem determined to expand their market share at the expense of price. There are also the medium-term fears of the return of Iraq to the market and the rejuvenation of Russian oil fields with western technology. The rapid expansion of natural gas threatens some of oil's traditional markets. Yet the slip in the oil price in the last few months happened despite a near-balance between supply and demand. Stocks were drawn down heavily in the first quarter to meet cold weather demands in the US. Outside Saudi Arabia, Opec has little slack to expand production in the short term. There may thus be some fundamental support for oil prices later, but doubtless the hedge funds will not hang around to wait for it.</p>

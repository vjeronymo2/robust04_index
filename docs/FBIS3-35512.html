			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by </F> correspondent Paulo Dentinho; place and date not given--recorded  in English with superimposed Portuguese translation]    [Text] The Israeli prime minister has granted an exclusive  interview to RTP. Yitzhaq Rabin believes that the agreement  with the PLO will be concluded within two months at most. He  was speaking to Paulo Dentinho:    [Dentinho] Now that 'Arafat seems to be losing power to the  radicals, are you not afraid that the future Palestinian police  force might become a threat to Israel?    [Rabin] I was aware of that before. When we reach an  agreement on implementing the first phase, starting with Gaza  and Jericho, it will be a detailed agreement in which the two  sides, Israel and the PLO, will set down their undertakings. I  believe that it can be put into practice now, or within two  months at most.    [Dentinho] One question about Jerusalem. The Palestinians,  too, want the city for themselves. Do you believe Jerusalem  will have a special status? Would you approve of two mayors for  the city?    [Rabin] By no means. This matter will have to be negotiated,  at most [as heard] two years after the implementation of the  first phase of the agreement on Gaza and Jericho. So, instead  of occupying myself with matters that are irrelevant at the  moment -- because it is the first steps that will decide the  fate of the ultimate goal -- we will instead focus on what must  be done immediately and on what is laid down in the Gaza-Jericho  agreement.    [Dentinho] Let us imagine that total peace has been  achieved.  How long do you think it will take for Palestinians and Israelis  to forget 50 years of conflict?    [Rabin] The time has come to bring it to an end, to say  enough is enough to the bloodshed, and to concentrate on  changing the reality. I believe that the Israelis are willing  to do so and to implement the agreement. I hope the  Palestinians will honor their undertakings and do likewise.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (9): Toyota plant a springboard to Europe Toyota's gleaming Dollars 400m new car plant outside Istanbul (pictured above), opened in mid-October, is much more than a prestige private investment project. It will radically reshape the country's car industry. As well as raising Turkey's car production capacity by one-third, the new plant will boost its technological base and, some time in the future, become an export platform to the surrounding region and Europe. Closer to home, the new facility will break the virtual duopoly that the Tofas Fiat-Koc joint venture and Renault have enjoyed for 20 years. Toyota's timing is unfortunate. Passenger car sales this year will fall by a third to 234,000, according to DRI World Car Industry Forecast, which does not expect output to recover to 1993 levels until 1997. Nonetheless, Toyota's decision to invest in Turkey is an indication of the market's present and future importance. It is also a sign of confidence in local suppliers' ability to meet stringent quality standards. Work on the factory began in 1992 as a joint venture between Toyota and the Sabanci group. Toyota holds 40 per cent of the company, Mitsui 10 per cent and Sabanci, together with its Akbank affiliate, the remaining 50 per cent. Half the investment was funded with equity and the rest with long-term debt. Toyota's arrival has shaken Tofas out of its complacency. Tofas claims 45 per cent of the local market, but is frequently criticised for its reliance on old Fiat models. It has hit back with the launch of new Fiat Tipo and Tempra models only months after their launch in Italy. But Koc is right to worry about Toyota. According to its annual report, the car business represents half Koc's group annual turnover and pre-tax profit. The challenge from Toyota is only the beginning. In 1996, customs union with the European Union is meant to come into force, exposing Tofas to more competition.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (3): Speeding into a pile-up - Europe expands at the worst possible time WEST EUROPE'S big six volume car makers are facing a rough ride as competition intensifies and new car sales weaken. A wave of additional capacity is being built across Europe in an industry that is already suffering from shrinking margins. The new plants from Portugal to east Germany and from the UK to Italy were planned as west European car producers were still basking in an unprecedented succession of annual sales records. They are about to hit the market, however, as the European appetite for buying new cars is succumbing to retrenchment. The leading volume car producers in Europe are enjoying widely differing fortunes, while the specialist car makers have been hit hard in their main markets on both sides of the Atlantic. A new group of executives must lead the European motor industry through the 1990s with changes announced at the top of four leading producers - Volkswagen, Ford of Europe, GM Europe and Renault. In the last two years the Volkswagen group of Germany has established a clear lead ahead the west European new car market, but its profitability is under heavy pressure both from the dash for growth and from its failure to get to grips with its expensive German cost base. VW's domestic cost problems have been exacerbated by the recent currency turmoil and the big devaluations of the lira and the pound. While its profits sag the group, which includes Audi, SEAT and Skoda, has boosted its share of west European new car sales to a record 17.3 per cent in the first eight months of the year from 16.5 per cent in the same period a year ago. In a market which has declined by an estimated 2.2 per cent the VW group has increased its sales by 2.8 per cent in the first eight months to around 1.66m. To confront the serious cost-cutting challenge in Germany the top management of VW is being overhauled with the retirement of Mr Carl Hahn, who has led the group's increasingly hectic expansion since 1982. He will be succeeded as group chairman by Mr Ferdinand Piech, the tough Austrian-born chief executive of Audi, VW's executive and luxury car subsidiary. Mr Piech's closest rival for the top job, the Frenchman Mr Daniel Goeudevert, a former manager with Citroen, Renault and Ford, will become group deputy chairman in addition to remaining chairman of the Volkswagen brand organisation. Ford is shaking up the management of its loss-making European operations with the appointment of Mr Jacques Nasser, the 44-year-old Lebanese Australian, as chairman of Ford of Europe from the end of December, when Mr Lindsey Halstead retires. At Renault Mr Louis Schweitzer, a former top French civil servant, has succeeded Mr Raymond Levy as chairman, while Mr Louis Hughes, 43, moved from Opel to become president of GM Europe, following the surprise departure of Mr Robert Eaton to Chrysler in the US. Mr Nasser faces a formidable challenge at Ford of Europe, which suffered record losses last year and which is forecast to make another loss in 1992. He inherits a daunting agenda for restructuring what was earlier regarded as a model of efficiency in the European auto industry and a vital contributor to Ford group profits. Ford, which was narrowly the leader of the west European new car market in 1984, has now slipped to fifth place among the big six volume car makers in Europe, where its financial woes in the last two years have been in stark contrast to the record profits achieved by General Motors Europe. GM was the most profitable of the big six volume car makers in Europe last year with a 7 per cent net profit margin. The net profits of its core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicles rose to a record Dollars 1.96bn in 1991 compared with the net loss of Dollars 961m suffered by Ford of Europe. While GM's European profits have totalled more than Dollars 1.75bn in each of the last four years, Ford has suffered a steep decline from a net profit of Dollars 1.56bn in 1988 to a net loss of Dollars 961m last year. Ford's European automotive operations accumulated a net loss of Dollars 1.079bn in 1991, but this was partially offset by the net profit of Dollars 118m at its financial services in Europe. The profits of GM's European operations provided at least a partial cushion against the record losses suffered by the group in the US last year which totalled Dollars 7.087bn including a Dollars 1.8bn special restructuring provision. The European profits could not prevent the world's biggest vehicle maker suffering an overall loss of Dollars 4.5bn, however, the largest annual loss recorded by a US company. In spite of lower sales this year GM Europe, which includes Saab Automobile, moved into second place in the west European new car market after the first eight months of this year, helped by the waning fortunes of the Fiat group. Fiat, which only three years ago was still challenging the Volkswagen group for market leadership, has suffered the sharpest slide by a leading European producer. By sharp contrast Renault, the French state-owned car maker which is developing a far-reaching alliance with Volvo of Sweden, has staged a dramatic recovery in the last two years. Long regarded as one of the weakest of the European producers, Renault has emerged this year as the fastest-growing volume car maker in Europe. It increased its sales volume by around 5 per cent in the first 8 months to boost its market share to 10.5 per cent from 9.8 per cent a year earlier. Its pre-tax profits jumped fivefold in the first half of the year to FFr5.44bn from FFr962m in the same period a year ago. It has drastically cut its debt burden and Mr Schweitzer, the new Renault chairman, has forecast this month 'satisfactory profits for the full year' even taking into consideration a 'considerably more difficult second half'. Among Europe's specialist car makers Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of the UK are mired in deep and continuing losses as are Saab and Volvo of Sweden. Porsche of Germany is cutting its workforce by a third over three years. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, also remains in loss in the face of the steepest slide into recession suffered by the motor industry in Britain in the post-war period. UK new car sales have dropped by a third in the last three years.</p>

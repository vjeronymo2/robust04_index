To this  end, the strains HB101 and S17.1 of Escherichia coli  and the CXM 1 strain of Rhizobium meliloti as well as  the pRK2013, pSUP2021, and pLAFR5 plasmids are used in the  experiment. A leucine-auxotrophic mutant strain CXM1 which has  lost its ability to form nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa  is produced by nonspecific transposonic mutagenesis using the  pSUP2021 plasmid (Tn5) as the donor. The study shows that the  addition of leucine directly to the plants inoculated with the  auxotrophic mutant does not restore its ability to develop  normal symbiosis. Large-scale screening of four types of alfalfa  under sterile microvegetation conditions reveals the absence of  interstrain variability and the existence of individual  variability based on the behavior of host plant response to  leucine auxotrophic inoculation. A bank of CXM1 strains is  constructed on the basis of the cosmid pLAFR5 vector and used in  conjugation cross-breeding for the purpose of complementing  leucine auxotrophe. The findings also indicate that the leucine  biosynthesis genes are involved in regulating the development of  nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with alfalfa. The results lay the  groundwork for a more detailed study of the relationship between  the leucine biosynthesis and the expression of symbiotic  properties in these bacteria. The authors are grateful to T.V.  Ivashina and N.A. Provorov for assisting with the gene bank and  making valuable remarks. Figures 5; tables 2; references 21: 3  Russian, 18 Western.</p>

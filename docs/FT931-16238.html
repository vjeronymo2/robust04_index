			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Milosevic seen as key to peace talks MR Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen have called for Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to attend 'last chance' peace talks on Bosnia-Hercegovina due to resume in Geneva on Sunday. The two international mediators wrote yesterday to Mr Dobrica Cosic, president of the rump Yugoslavia, suggesting he 'consider' including Mr Milosevic in his delegation to the talks, seen as a last chance to avoid international military intervention in Bosnia. The Serbian president, a hardline nationalist, is widely blamed for helping to foment the civil war in Bosnia but has not thus far had any formal role in the peace negotiations. The mediators' move follows Mr Milosevic's apparently positive response in talks in Belgrade on Wednesday to their proposals for a constitutional settlement for Bosnia based on a decentralised state with 10 autonomous provinces. Mr Vance and Lord Owen, who co-chair the international conference on ex-Yugoslavia, are hoping he can persuade the Bosnian Serbs to drop their demand for a 'state-within-a-state'. The first session of peace negotiations bringing together for the first time the leaders of the three warring factions adjourned on Monday after the Bosnian Serb leader, Mr Radovan Karadzic, said he needed to consult Belgrade. The Moslem-led Bosnian government also refused to sign the three documents prepared by the mediators, mainly because it disputes some provincial boundaries, but it is under intense international pressure to settle. The Bosnian Croats have already signed. At the UN in New York President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia evoked memories of the appeasement of Hitler and compared himself to Czechoslovak president Eduard Benes, whose country was gobbled up by Nazi Germany. In Zagreb, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister of Denmark, which holds the EC presidency, ruled out full military intervention in Bosnia but said more force could be used under UN mandate to protect aid missions and uphold UN resolutions. Reuter adds from Sarajevo: Bosnian Serbs and Moslems resumed fighting in earnest in central Sarajevo after a lull earlier yesterday. The area around the parliament building and the border river of Miljacka dividing the Serb and Moslem lines rang with artillery shots and small arms fire.</p>

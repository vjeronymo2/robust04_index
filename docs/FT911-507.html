			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' transactions Directors made more share sales than purchases in April, with the ratio of sales to buys reaching 1.6 to 1, writes Angus MacDonald, of Directus Ltd. There has been more buying interest in smaller company shares in the last couple of weeks, and the launch of two new smaller company investment trusts by Aberforth and Moorgate should help to rekindle demand in this area of the market. A series of hefty rights issues by building and construction companies has helped to halt this sectors's considerable underperformance since the turn of the year. The building, timber and roads sector was particularly heavily bought by directors last autumn, but the situation has now changed and directors' share sales outweigh buys by 7 to 1 in this area. Beazer share sales illustrate the point. Seven directors bought Beazer shares in the autumn at around 95p. The share price has almost doubled subsequently, and two directors have reduced their holdings in recent weeks. Several directors of Usher Walker, the printing ink business, have bought large amounts of shares as can be seen from the list. At the same time, it was announced that David Williams, who recently resigned from Mosaic Investment, has purchased 10.2 per cent from Southern Newspapers. Sir David Alliance, chairman of N Brown, the home shopping concern, followed the announcement of a placing and open offer with the purchase of over 1m shares in the company. His family trusts also intend to take up their entitlement in full.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  No of Company                      Shares     Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Alexon Group               60,000       337       2   Assoc.

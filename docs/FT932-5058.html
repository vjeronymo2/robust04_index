			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: Ulster power sell-off - a bright long term prospect AS INVESTORS contemplate buying into Northern Ireland Electricity, the utility company which goes on sale later this month, they can take heart from the knowledge that the government likes to be generous when selling off state assets. By far the majority of privatised government stocks have outperformed the market - that is, fared better than the average share - both immediately after flotation and in subsequent years. Investing in former public sector companies does not guarantee success, as buyers of shares in British Steel and British Aerospace can testify. Both have underperformed the FTSE-100 index by 50 per cent since their privatisations in 1988 and 1981 respectively, although in BAe's case the underperformance has occurred mainly in the last two years. However, BAe and British Steel are the exceptions rather than the rule. More typical - and more relevant to NIE - is the performance of the electricity companies since privatisation of the sector began three years ago. Scottish Power and Hydro-Electric, considered to be the tightest priced of all electricity stocks in the electricity privatisation process, have seen their share rise from 240p in June 1991 to 323p and 342p respectively. If they had merely kept pace with the market, their prices would be 279p. NIE's flotation benefits from the more generous approach which the government displayed in privatising the England and Wales electricity companies. One view is that this is because the NIE flotation will face competition for funds from the sale of the third tranche of BT shares. Northern Ireland Electricity procures electricity from the province's four generators, privatised separately last year, and transmits and supplies it to the whole of the province. The company is being offered at Pounds 362m, consisting of 164.6m shares of 220p each. For utility investors, the most important consideration is the dividend yield, and for NIE this is high. The average historic yield for the regional electricity companies in the England and Wales is about 5.3 per cent; for NIE it is 5.8 per cent. This, together with the City's positive view of NIE's management and prospects, means that, barring unexpected changes in the market, shares in the company are likely to rise on the first day of trading on June 21. Some analysts believe 10 per cent is possible. That does not necessarily mean that everyone should apply for shares. Investors hoping for large, quick profits will probably be disappointed. More than 800,000 people have registered an interest in the shares, and that means that some may get less than 100 shares, the minimum application. Profits, after dealing costs, of such a small amount of shares would be virtually negligible. Investors should therefore consider the long term. Among concerns about tying up capital for long periods will be the unpredicatibility of Northern Ireland politics. Government practice is to replace assets which have been damaged through terrorism but there are no cast iron guarantees. Even if all costs of a terrorist attack were recovered, there could be long term effects on staff morale and productivity. Analysts believe such considerations are outweighed by the positive elements offered by NIE. Chief among these is that the regulatory regime covering the province is settled until at least 1997. In England and Wales, the regulator has said that he may refer the generators to the Mergers and Monopolies Commission, and the 12 regional electricity companies (Recs) face regulatory reviews over the next year which could limit their ability to increase profits and increase dividends. Northern Ireland has no such uncertainty and its innovatory regulatory regime means that most of the prospective income in transmission and distribution is guaranteed, regardless of whether sales go up and down. If unit sales fall, NIE is allowed to raise its prices. This is a double edged sword. It increases potential for slack marketing in the lead-up to the competitive threat posed by British Gas which may start selling gas to households from the middle of the decade. However, it also provides the company with an even greater incentive for cutting costs. The scope is considerable given that there are six employees per thousand customers compared with the Recs' 3.6. All this means that NIE should be able to increase dividends by about 12 per cent a year for the next four years and most analysts are advising clients to apply for shares. Some, including John Wilson, of UBS, believe it may even be worth buying shares in the market early on the first day of trading, before prices rise significantly. 'The company makes an excellent long term investment and provides a good hedge against the regulatory risk of the electricity companies in England and Wales,' he says.

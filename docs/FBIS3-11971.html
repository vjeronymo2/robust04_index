The  election of Colombian President Cesar Gaviria as OAS secretary  general took place after reports that there was friction between  the countries that supported the candidacy of Costa Rican  Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and those who supported the South  American president. "Although Nicaragua maintained its support  for the Costa Rican foreign minister, Gaviria's election will  not alter relations," said a spokesman for the Nicaraguan  Foreign Ministry.    North and South American countries supported the candidacy  of  the Colombian president, while Niehaus had the support of  Central America and the Caribbean countries. According to the  Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gaviria "is a very skillful and  capable person because of his position." Gaviria will be leaving  his post on 7 August when he turns it over to the president  elected on 29 May in Colombia.    Today, the Nicaraguan press, on its front pages, emphasized  the election of Gaviria as well as the frustration of Niehaus,  who harshly criticized the United States for exerting pressure  on countries that had committed their votes. Analysts had  forecast that the battle over the secretary generalship of the  hemispheric organization was a battle between the "large and  small countries" of the Americas, and that no representative of  Central America had ever occupied the post of OAS secretary  general.</p>

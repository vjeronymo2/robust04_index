			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG ONE;  </P> <P> EARTHQUAKE WHAT-TO-DOS  </P> <P> If an earthquake strikes and you are . . .  </P> <P> In your home: Do not run outside (most earthquake-related injuries happen  outdoors). Get away from windows, mirrors and light fixtures. Watch out for  tall bookcases or china cases that might topple. Climb under a table or desk or  stand in a doorway if possible. If this isn't possible, crouch against a solid  wall. Get into a duck-and-cover position, using sofa cushions or pillows to  protect your head.  </P> <P> In a car: Pull to the side of the road (if possible) and stop the car. Do not  attempt to continue driving. Do not park under trees, light posts or signs. Do  not park on or under a bridge. Stay inside your car and get down on the floor.  </P> <P> In an office: Get under your desk or in a doorway if possible. If not, crouch  against a solid wall and protect your head with what is available, such as a  book, notebook, large handbag, suit coat or briefcase. Many offices have fake  drop-ceiling tiles that are easily shaken loose by quakes, so protecting your  head with something is a must.  </P> <P> In a mall/store: Get away from glass store fronts. Do not head for the exits,  most of which are glass. Crouch against a solid wall. If you have children, put  them against the wall and drape yourself over them in a crouching position.  Make as small a target as possible. Do not attempt to use escalators or  elevators.  </P> <P> In an elevator: Most elevators will automatically stop moving when the shaking  starts. When the quake stops, stomp on the floor in an attempt to get someone  to hear you. If possible, escape through the trapdoor at the top of the  elevator, since there is a danger of fire.  </P> <P> In a restaurant: The safest place is under the table, since table-tops are made  of sturdy material. Do not attempt to run across the restaurant if you are at a  table or booth near the windows -- climb under the table and protect your head.  Many restaurants have objects on the walls that could fly across the room, so  climbing under your own table is the best bet.  </P> <P> In a high-rise building: Climb under a desk or stand in a doorway. Stay clear  of windows, shelves, cabinets and glass partitions. Most high-rises are built  so they will sway with a quake more than you would think, but it is actually a  protection to keep them from toppling. Do not run for the exit because the  stairways may be broken and/or jammed with people. Do not attempt to use the  elevator since the power may have failed.  </P> <P> In a parking garage: Do not run. Crouch against a pillar or solid wall,  covering your head with your purse, jacket or shopping bags. If in your car, do  not attempt to drive. Stay in the car and get down on the floor.  </P> <P> Source: The Red Cross; Orange County Fire Department -- Emergency Management  Division  </P></p>

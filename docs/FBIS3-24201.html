Among those present  were deputy heads of the kray administration, heads of  administrations and committees, as well as of the fuel and power  generation complex, a large group from the military, and trade  unions.    "Lately we feel acutely that the government has cooled off  quite noticeably toward the Maritime Kray," said the kray  administration head, Yevgeniy Nazdratenko. It is practically  impossible to "wring out" the money due as envisaged by Decree  No. 1001. And the thorniest issue, which practically separates  our kray from Russia's central regions, is high transportation  rates. Instead of somehow helping the Far East in this respect,  the Russian Federation Government just a few days ago made a  decision to raise them again by more than 20 percent.    What the result will be is clear. High costs will force many  enterprises located in West Siberia, in the Urals, and the  European part of Russia to reroute the flow of export cargo. Now  it will go abroad through the ports on the Black or Baltic Sea.  This trend already is detectable. The following data point in  this direction: Freight volume at the Far Eastern segment of the  railroad system fell off by 37 percent. Naturally, the output of  our plants and factories, and most importantly, mining  enterprises, will not be competitive in the regions where  industrial consumers are and which are long distance away from  Maritime Kray.    In this situation, a vitally important question comes up  with  all urgency: How is Maritime Kray to survive? Vladimir  Kolesnichenko, who is considered the most knowledgeable and  competent economist in the kray, predicts this development of  the situation. In May, electric power rates will go up. This  blow will push a considerable number of kray enterprises into  bankruptcy. They are already literally being strangled by hidden  unemployment. It runs by most modest estimates at 25-40 percent  of enterprises' labor force. One can, of course, understand the  directors--they still hope for some mythical subsidies and  preferential credits. But there will be none. Therefore, says V.  Kolesnichenko, we need to take radical steps right now. We have  to immediately set up a commission that will determine the  backbone enterprises in the kray capable of surviving at the  current stage of transition to a market. Those labor collectives  that cannot survive we should declare bankrupt and start finding  jobs for the people.    The first to go bankrupt, in V. Kolesnichenko's opinion, are  enterprises in the cities where mining combines and  machine-building plants are located. It is Dalnegorsk, Arsenyev,  and the settlement Kavalerovo. We can already see the validity  of this forecast--the mining and enrichment combine in  Khrustalnyy is practically dying.    The kray administration presented at the conference its plan  for saving Maritime Kray from the impending destructive  processes; the plan had been drafted by Moscow academics and  executive branch departments. It was decided to "bring it into  proper shape" during March, incorporate proposals of economic  managers and the military, and then send the document for  consideration to the Russian Federation Government.    N. Pimenov, the chief of the kray administration's main  planning and economic administration, related to the conference  participants the gist of this plan. According to the document,  the priority sectors will be defense, foreign economic  relations, and transportation. In order to move it all from the  a centralized-economy state into a market-based one, the  government will have to provide financial support. Otherwise,  nothing will come out of it. Here is why. The government owes 56  billion rubles [R] to our defense plants, even those where it  had placed orders. (For instance, production of the "Black  Shark" helicopter at the Progress plant.) And now they are  literally dying at the root.    Next. One may say that the government forgot about the  existence of its troops and their high concentration in Maritime  Kray. Take the cost of the Pacific Fleet alone! The center  practically keeps them on a financial starvation diet. The kray  is compelled in extreme cases to provide money for the military  from its own budget. And quite substantial sums, sometimes. The  result is that in addition to paying taxes, Maritime Kray  residents carry an additional load, which affects the social  sphere.    Foreign economic relations. Maritime Kray already has in  operation five vehicle crossings and eight ports open for entry  to foreign vessels. What does the territory get from it?  Nothing. Only 10 percent of the customs duty goes into the kray  budget; the rest goes to the center. The document proposes to  leave the entire customs duty collected in the kray for about  two years.    The transportation complex cannot be improved without  targeted federal programs. Ports and port-adjacent rail stations  need to be developed, new branch lines built. All of this  requires government investment money. The program proposed in  the document assumes, of course, subsidies from the federal  budget. And this is not dumping one's problems on the  center--these are precisely the expenditures the state has to  finance: maintenance of the Armed Forces, development of foreign  trade and large transportation systems. As to our own business,  says the kray leadership, it is time to pay very close attention  to the development of the entire spectrum of relations with the  countries of the Southeast Asia and the Pacific region. The  following fact is quoted in support of this argument: In order  to bring grain from Altay Kray, Maritime Kray has to pay  agricultural producers and the railroad R270,000 per tonne.  Transportation of the same tonne from Canada will cost R100,000.  A tangible difference. And it is visible in everything.</p>

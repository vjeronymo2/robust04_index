			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Westpac to trim its operations in Asia WESTPAC, the troubled Australian banking group, said yesterday it planned to dispose of many of its Asian operations in a restructuring of its global activities. Westpac is to sell branch operations in Seoul and Taipei, a joint-venture interest in Jakarta, and finance businesses in Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Its six US offices will be consolidated into the New York office. The group will focus on corporate banking and global financial market operations in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore. It said the remaining Asian businesses would focus on servicing Australian corporations, foreign companies operating in Australia and New Zealand, and participants in financial markets. Westpac has already repositioned its European business to concentrate on similar activities. Mr Robert Joss, the American banker appointed managing director last month, said its Asian banking and finance interests had been profitable, but were no longer central to the bank's objectives. Mr Joss said the bank's global strategy 'should be to concentrate on those businesses in which we have a clear competitive advantage and which offer significant prospects for growth'. The restructuring follows Westpac's abandonment of its 1980s strategy of offering a full range of banking services in the main global markets. Westpac has suffered a series of reverses recently, climaxing in a record loss of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.06bn) for the year to September, after writing off bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn and an unexpected US tax liability of ADollars 106m. Five directors, including the then-chairman, resigned last year.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Money Supply Measures Fall: All three measures of the nation's money supply  dropped in early May, the Federal Reserve reported. The narrowest measure of  the money supply, M1, fell $8.7 billion in the week ended May 8 to a seasonally  adjusted $772.9 billion from $781.6 billion the previous week. The central bank  said a broader measure known as M2 lost $1.9 billion to a seasonally adjusted  $3,069.7 billion from $3,071.6 billion the previous week. An even broader  measure, M3, fell $1.8 billion to a seasonally adjusted $3,953.3 billion from  $3,955.1 billion.

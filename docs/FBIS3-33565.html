			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the National Federation of Public </F> Employees Unions, Fenasep, on the conflict between state workers  and the government in Guatemala City on 23 February, read by  unidentified Fenasep spokesman; from the "Telepress" newscast;  broadcast in progress--recorded]    [Text] ...in keeping with its principles, values, and  vocation of dialogue, as well as the use of reason and  intelligence, and with the solidarity of independent unions  represented by the Union of the Finance Ministry Employees, has  investigated the real possibilities of achieving a decent wage  increase, without affecting the rights and needs of private  sector workers and the public in general.    2. With the investigation and drafted proposal, Fenasep and  Sintrasip [expansion unknown] have initiated an honest, direct,  open dialogue, a dialogue without giving up their principles  with the government's economic cabinet. The results of this  dialogue were reported to the unions' rank and file during  special general assemblies.    3. Fenasep and Sintrasip announce to the country the  government, via the economic cabinet, has not accepted salary  adjustments, arguing it does not have the resources to do so.  It has proposed to the Negotiating Commission an annual bonus  of 360 quetzals, a proposal Fenasep and Sintrasip never accepted.    Consequently, by virtue of the moral authority vested upon  the before mentioned unions, they reject the lies and false  statements of those who have said these organizations are  progovernment and have accepted the bonus.    4. The Fenasep rank and file, in a special general assembly,  agreed to continue the talks to accomplish the following:    4.1. A salary adjustment in accordance with the high cost  of living that will benefit not only state workers but also  private sector workers. We also call for the implementation of  other compensations to social sectors.    4.2. The government must demonstrate its political  willingness and take corrective measures to guarantee a price  reduction to the basic market basket items and must not permit  increases to these products. The Economy, Finance, Energy and  Mines, particularly, Ministries must stop protecting the  interests of the large purse potentates; instead, they must  impose price controls that guarantee the rights and interests of  the poor majorities.    4.3. Fenasep and Sintrasip demand the Fiscal Offense Law  be promulgated to punish those who evade taxes. Such a law must  contemplate prison terms; that is, offenders must pay by  spending time in prison, not with their dirty money, for the  offense of tax evasion and nonpayment.    4.4. Fenasep and Sintrasip make a profound, serious, and  responsible call to reflection and moderation to labor leaders.  We must not play the game of those who want to blackmail us by  privatizing state-owned companies. In addition, we demand the  government rule out its plans to reduce the state via structural  adjustment measures with the sale of assets and privatization of  the basic services of Guatemalans.    4.5. Fenasep and Sintrasip affirm we must not give excuses  to the sectors that are seeking to decree a state of emergency,  which would be a return to the dictatorial-type measures of the  past. We must avoid the working class again paying with its  blood the price of recklessness, intolerance, and passion.    For a decent and fair salary for all and for the defense of  national interests,    [Signed] Fenasep and Sintrasip</p>

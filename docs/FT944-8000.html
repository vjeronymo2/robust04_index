			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Personal View: Importance of Nordic influence in EU Now that Finland and Sweden are firmly set to join the European Union next year, and Norway is more likely than not to follow, the character of European co-operation is bound to change. Assuming Norway votes Yes in the referendum on November 28, one person in four around the EU discussion table will come from a Nordic country. The northern perspective will have an important impact on the future of the Union. This applies not least to efforts to build a common foreign and security policy that can actively contribute to stability in areas that were formerly part of the Soviet bloc. It is often overlooked that Russian power in Europe now directly meets the west and its different institutions only in the areas of the Baltic and Barents Sea. The region around St Petersburg, by far the largest European city north of London, Paris and Moscow, is set to recover its old role as the window to the west of the Russian lands. The city's impressive industrial and scientific talent, derived from the concentration of military-industrial resources in the region, will give it a key role in the transformation of the Russian economy. Yet there will be difficulties as well as opportunities. In coming decades the Nordic countries will be forced to concentrate a large part of their foreign and security policy on present and potential problems in the area stretching from Kaliningrad in the south to the Kola peninsula in the north. These border lands between Russia and the west may become the most impressive growth region in Europe in coming decades. But we cannot ignore risks for the reform process in Russia and for political stability in and around the three Baltic countries. The revanchists of the extreme right and left are far from dominating Russia's political scene. Yet any sign that their influence is growing will send shock waves into the Baltic region and then the entire European system. In their own interests, as well as those of the wider Europe, the Nordic countries will want early progress towards bringing the Baltic states firmly into the structures of European co-operation. With EU agreements on Baltic trade and economic co-operation now in place, the new Nordic members will be pressing for the Baltic countries to take part in the EU's future enlargement towards eastern and central Europe. The Baltic states share in many respects the same reform policies and western orientation as countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic. Along with a desire for further co-operation in the Baltic and Barents Sea regions, the Nordic states will bring to the EU a sharpening of the debate on reforming welfare systems. Although Nordic economic growth in 1995 is likely to be above the OECD average, the structural problems of the welfare state have left Denmark with appalling long-term unemployment and Sweden with a huge public debt. Achieving solutions to these issues will not be easy. The debate on the Swedish EU referendum, and the recent general election, demonstrated the strength of 'welfare isolationism' in Sweden. There is still an unrealistic belief that the now-extinct 'Swedish model' has given us a society generally superior to those in other parts of Europe. Early next year, under procedures laid down by the Maastricht treaty, the new Nordic members will have to present to the EU their economic convergence programmes. Norway will not have any difficulties. But in Sweden the deep split over the EU in the Social Democratic party, combined with the coming elections for the European parliament, may exacerbate political tensions. If Norway rejects the EU on November 28, the effects on Sweden and Finland - and Norway as well - will be limited. Nonetheless a Norwegian No would mark the end of the important work in recent years for the renaissance of Nordic co-operation in a European framework. Perhaps wavering Norwegians in rural and northern areas can be persuaded in time that EU membership is a safer option than a weak link within the European Economic Area. The Nordic countries must make clear the importance of their northern perspective. Perhaps most important of all is the Nordic states' attitude to the larger questions of European co-operation that will be on the agenda at the 1996 intergovernmental conference. In the near term, psychological and political difficulties brought to the surface during the referendum debates might make them appear somewhat reluctant partners. But over the longer term the Nordic states' national interests and natural abilities will drive them in the right direction: to play a full part in the wider process of European integration.

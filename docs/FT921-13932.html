			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK banks Bank shares may have risen sharply this week on the hope that recovery will help their bad debt problem, but the new charges being introduced by both the Halifax and NatWest suggest another side to the story. Loan demand is still flat; base rates are meanwhile 4 1/2 percentage points below their peak, leaving both the banks and building societies with less of a cushion to fund their overheads from cheap retail deposits. So now they are scrabbling for extra income, and the defenceless retail customer is the obvious target. One has to assume that other building societies will latch on to the idea of charging for withdrawals and that other banks will exact payment for refreshing the memory of those who happen to forget their personal card number. As much as anything else, this will be a sign of desperation in a market where there is not much sign of growth in the core business at all.</p>

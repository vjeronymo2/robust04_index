			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Millbank Tower up for sale at Pounds 73m Legal &amp; General, the life assurance company, has put the Millbank Tower, adjacent to London's River Thames, up for sale at a price of Pounds 73m, writes Vanessa Houlder. The building's largest tenant is the government, together with Pearson, British Gas, Vickers, Royal Bank of Scotland and Ferranti. L&amp;G is selling the property to reduce its weighting of property in Victoria, following a decision to invest Pounds 60m in refurbishing a government-let building in Victoria Street. The life assurance companies remain a net investor in property, having exchanged contracts on about Pounds 200m of properties this year.</p>

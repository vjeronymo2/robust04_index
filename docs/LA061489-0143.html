Final  </P> <P> CHANG BEATEN BY KRIEK ON GRASS COURT  </P> <P> Michael Chang suffered his first defeat after his French Open victory when he  was beaten by fellow American Johan Kriek 1-6, 7-6, 6-4 today in the  round-robin Continental Grass Court Championships.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old Chang became the first American to win the French Open since  1955 by defeating Sweden's Stefan Edberg Sunday.  </P> <P> At Edinburgh, Scotland, John McEnroe -- continuing his buildup for Wimbledon --  eased his way to a 6-3, 6-1 first-round victory over unranked qualifier Ross  Matheson today in the Scottish grass-court championships.  </P> <P> "I felt fine, the court was a bit soft but it was just the sort of first-round  match I needed," the American said.  </P> <P> In London, Mats Wilander, trying to gain form for the only Grand Slam  tournament he's never won, squeezed into the third round of the Queens Club  grass-court tennis championships today with a 7-6, 2-6, 6-3 victory over  American David Wheaton.  </P> <P> Fifth-seeded Kevin Curren lost to fellow-American Pete Sampras 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> The tournament favorite and top seed, Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia, took just  73 minutes to get past Australian Mark Kratzmann 6-2, 6-3. Lendl also is  bidding for his first Wimbledon title.  </P></p>

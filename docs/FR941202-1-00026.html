			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> New  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples 5, 6,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> are added to &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ix) to clarify the revised rules on de minimis remuneration. Other clarifying amendments have been made to the outside director rules. New &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(v) clarifies the definition of the term ``entity.'' Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ii)(A) and new Examples 3 and 4 under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ix) make clear that directors are not outside directors if they receive any indirect personal remuneration from the publicly held corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ii)(A) further provides that remuneration described in that section is considered paid when actually paid (and throughout the remainder of that taxable year of the publicly held corporation) and, if earlier, throughout the period when a contract or agreement to pay remuneration is outstanding. New  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  illustrates this rule. By contrast, &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) are amended to provide that remuneration described in those sections is considered paid when it is actually paid or, if earlier, when the publicly held corporation becomes liable to pay it. Thus, for example, if a publicly held corporation becomes liable in 1998 to pay more than de minimis remuneration to an entity, but agrees with the entity to defer payment of that remuneration until 1999, the remuneration would be taken into account for purposes of &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(ii)(B) and (C) only in 1998 when the corporation became liable to pay it. Also, under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(iii), the five percent de minimis rule is amended to focus on the entity's gross revenue instead of its gross income. Finally, in order to clarify the application of the outside director rules to affiliated groups, new &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(3)(viii) provides that the outside directors of the publicly held member of an affiliated group are treated as the outside directors of all members of the affiliated group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ``Key Employees'' as a Description of a Class of Eligible Employees <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.162&hyph;27(e)(4)(ii) provides a nonexclusive list of classes of employees that constitute sufficient disclosure of employees eligible to receive performance-based compensation. The proposed regulations are amended to add ``key employees'' to the list.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Shareholder Approval <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(4)(i), the material terms of the performance goal under which compensation is to be paid must be disclosed to and subsequently approved by shareholders. The proposed amendments make explicit the requirement that disclosure and shareholder approval must occur before the compensation is paid. Of course, disclosure and shareholder approval need not occur during the period within which the compensation committee is required to establish the performance goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(4)(vii), the material terms of a performance goal are considered approved by shareholders if, in a separate vote, affirmative votes are cast by a majority of the voting shares. In order to reflect the fact that certain shares may have more than one vote, and to properly deal with abstentions, that section is amended to provide that the material terms of a performance goal are considered approved by shareholders if, in a separate vote, a majority of the votes cast on the issue (including abstentions to the extent abstentions are counted as voting under applicable state law) are cast in favor of approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in order to clarify the application of the shareholder approval requirements to affiliated groups, new &sect;1.162&hyph;27(e)(4)(viii) provides that the shareholders of the publicly held member of an affiliated group are treated as the shareholders of all members of the affiliated group. For example, if one of the five covered employees of an affiliated group is an employee of a wholly-owned subsidiary of a publicly held parent corporation, the shareholders of the parent would be required to approve the performance-based compensation of that covered employee along with that of the four covered employees who are employees of the publicly held parent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Private to Public Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(f), the $1 million deduction limit does not apply to any compensation plan or agreement that existed during a period in which a corporation was not publicly held, to the extent that the prospectus accompanying the initial public offering disclosed information concerning those plans or agreements that satisfied all applicable securities laws then in effect. Several commentators have asked whether the exemption should apply in perpetuity to plans or agreements that existed before the corporation became public. Other comments have suggested that the exemption be extended to corporations that are spun off from publicly held corporations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

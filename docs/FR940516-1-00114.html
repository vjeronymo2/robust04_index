			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While adequate durability of catalysts is a concern relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to catalytic converters used in on-highway engine applications,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is less concerned with the emission impact of failures of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalytic converters expected to be used for engines regulated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this rule. This is because the conversion efficiency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalysts used in small SI engines would not exceed approximately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 percent for reasons discussed in the previous paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Faced with this constraint, an engine manufacturer would need to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify its base engine to realize substantial emission reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of engine-out emissions even before the exhaust was converted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further by the catalytic converter. Should such a low efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst fail in use, the increase in emissions would not be as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> large as occurs when a high efficiency on-highway vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst fails.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The preceding discussion underscores the need for some means  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to validate the adequacy of catalysts that would be added to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines to provide compliance with the emission standards during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use operation. Various approaches could be used for ensuring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the ``long term'' conversion capabilities of catalysts would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be adequate. For example, certification engines could be tested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with catalysts which had been subjected to some type of ``aging''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to substantiate that the catalysts were adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed and fabricated. Alternatively, certification engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be tested with new catalysts that had been proven to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory by meeting the requirements of a catalyst  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification procedure that would be separate from the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission certification test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The main advantage of a validation approach involving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of ``aged'' catalysts on certification engines would be its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplicity. The aging process would be carried out by either the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine manufacturers or the catalyst vendors. In either case,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there would be no requirements for special catalyst performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and, hence, no need for the establishment of performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that would be needed for evaluating the test results.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The main disadvantage of this approach is the possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative impact on catalyst usage that might result from a Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 certification process which imposed durability testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements on catalysts but not on certification engines or any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other engine components involved in their construction. On one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hand, the dependence of successful certification of engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> families on the performance capabilities of aged catalysts might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in engine manufacturers being reluctant to use catalysts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the applicable emission standards. Also, given that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is limited field data on small engine catalysts, it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be extremely difficult to design a fair aging procedure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be evaluated by the certification engine test and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanying emission standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such possibly adverse results would be avoided by the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's use of a new catalyst that was ``certified'' by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplier or the engine manufacturer as having design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fabrication details that resulted in specific long-term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conversion performance capabilities. This approach would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disadvantage of being more complicated in that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additionally involves the establishment of limits on the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of efficiency loss that would be acceptable and would require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedure for determining compliance with such limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a consequence of concerns regarding possible negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on catalyst development for small engines that might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result from a provision requiring the certification of engines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with aged catalysts, EPA is not proposing such a requirement in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this notice. Instead, EPA is proposing that for systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing catalysts, the certification engine configuration to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested must be equipped with a new catalyst of a design that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been ``certified.'' A ``certified'' catalyst design would be one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which had successfully met the requirements of a separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst durability demonstration procedure which is described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more detail in the following paragraphs. This approach ensures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that durable catalysts are used on small engines while avoiding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive requirements that could discourage the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very promising catalyst technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments regarding this proposal are requested. Also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested are comments regarding the advantages and disadvantages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this requirement, as well as the alternative requirement for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of preconditioned or aged catalysts during engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission certification testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of an oven exposure procedure for evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst resistance to thermal degradation is proposed in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice. This procedure would involve the heating of the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalyst in air to a temperature of 1,000  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C for six hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior to heating the catalyst to 1,000  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C, an optional pre-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heating procedure is proposed to be allowed to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``green'' effect of the catalyst. This optional procedure would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consist of heating the catalyst to no more than 500  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C for no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than two hours.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The oven exposure procedure described above is proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lieu of procedures which involve exposure to synthetic or actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust gas mixtures because EPA believes that the oven aging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedure aggressively and directly stresses the catalyst and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the best method for assessing the most major catalyst durability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern: thermal stability. Another advantage of this method is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is much less complex than the other exposure procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For example, in the case of the procedure which involves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure to synthetic exhaust gas mixtures, information is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lacking regarding the most appropriate test parameters, such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the temperature of the mixtures and the duration of the exposure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, with respect to the procedure which involves exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to actual exhaust gas mixtures, information is needed regarding a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of test variables that are related to the engine that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to generate the exhaust gas mixture, such as its combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cycle and power output, the manner in which it is operated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the operating times that are involved in each phase of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASE COULD OPEN CURTAINS OF HOLLYWOOD AGENCY  </P> <P> A little-noticed court decision has put pressure on a super-secret Hollywood  agency to reveal a broad range of financial information about its big-name  Hollywood clients.  </P> <P> The decision, handed down by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge earlier this  year, ordered Creative Artists Agency to open its books to attorneys and  accountants representing casting director Ellen Meyer in her hotly contested  divorce proceeding against CAA co-founder Ron Meyer. Settlement talks to avoid  a public trial have been held and a formal settlement conference, considered  fragile by both sides, is set for July 27. Individuals close to both sides have  called a settlement likely within two weeks.  </P> <P> Ellen Meyer, whose 11-year marriage to Ron Meyer ended in separation about two  years ago, is demanding a share of her husband's assets, including his agency  stock. CAA represents hundreds of major movie stars and TV producers --  including Dustin Hoffman, Tom Cruise, Aaron Spelling, Sylvester Stallone, Jane  Fonda, and Robert Redford -- and is widely regarded as one of the most powerful  institutions in the entertainment business.  </P> <P> A trial in the divorce case could provide the first public glimpse of the  privately held agency's fees and practices -- though disclosure of star  salaries and agency contracts isn't likely to happen quickly. CAA has promised  to appeal the disclosure order, and any documents delivered would be withheld  from public scrutiny by a protective order. Further, the ongoing settlement  talks between CAA and the Meyers are aimed at staving off a trial, at which  agency secrets might be aired.  </P> <P> In resisting the disclosure order, Meyer -- perhaps Hollywood's most prominent  actors' agent -- at one point told the court that CAA's financial data are so  secret that even he, one of three co-owners, wasn't allowed access.  </P> <P> "Those documents have been maintained exclusively under the direction and  control of (agency president Michael) Ovitz," Meyer said in an affidavit filed  with the court. In a statement that indicated Ovitz's personal control over the  agency, Meyer added in the affidavit:  </P> <P> "I am absolutely certain that if I request Mr. Ovitz to produce that  documentation, he will decline that request, as he has done in the past.  Therefore, if petitioner's requested order (to disclose) is made by the court,  it would require a direct confrontation between me and Mr. Ovitz. I am also  confident that if I were to create a confrontation situation and demand the  production of documents, I run a risk of expulsion from CAA. . . ."  </P> <P> Ovitz and Meyer declined to comment on the case. Attorneys for Oberstein,  Doniger &amp; Fetter, which represents Ellen Meyer, also declined to comment.  </P> <P> Filings in the case, which was initiated on Sept. 21, 1987, provide a look at  the way CAA operates.  </P> <P> According to a filing by Ron Meyer, for instance, CAA president Michael Ovitz  since 1986 has owned 55.556% of the agency, while Meyer and TV agent William  Haber own 22.222% each. The arrangement took effect that summer, when the  agency increased Ovitz's power by buying out shareholders Rowland Perkins and  Martin Baum. Previously, Ovitz owned about 47%, while four partners -- Meyer,  Haber, Perkins, and Baum -- split the rest in equal shares, according to the  filing.  </P> <P> Ellen Meyer's court filings estimate Ron Meyer's stake in the agency to be  worth at least $10 million to $15 million, but they argue his stake may be  worth twice as much -- something her attorneys have claimed they can't  determine without access to an accurate accounting of income from star salaries  and packaging fees.  </P> <P> According to Ellen Meyer's filings Ron Meyer's "admitted income" is not less  than $1.8 million a year. Ron Meyer's court filings claim that Ellen isn't  entitled to any community property stake in the agency, since she married him  three months after it was founded in February of 1975.  </P> <P> CAA has hired its own attorney and has filed documents to protect its business  practices. In its filings CAA has argued that to disclose its records might  expose sensitive areas by indicating, for instance, where more than one client  is up for the same part, and might violate the privacy and competitive position  of Hollywood stars by revealing the terms under which they work.  </P> <P> Agency fees are based on a percentage of income from particular clients or TV  shows. The court order, entered last January, required CAA to reveal "any  analysis of revenues by client" and "all accounting books and records," among  other things.  </P> <P> Feelings have occasionally run high in the case. At one point, for instance,  Ellen Meyer in her affidavit accused her husband of keeping her support  payments low to "teach me a lesson" for demanding a full accounting from the  agency. She added in the document that various partners in the agency had told  her they would fight disclosure with tactics as severe as terminating her  husband's involvement with CAA, or reducing Meyer's fortune by having his stock  "bought out on a forced liquidation at below market value."  </P></p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Patten softens over constitutional plans GOVERNOR Chris Patten of Hong Kong yesterday urged local politicians to approve plans for the colony's political development that were acceptable to both Britain and China. At a special question and answer session of the Legislative Council (LegCo) the governor said the administration would present its proposals for the conduct of elections due next year and in 1995 towards the end of next month. But in a statement which was seen as inviting compromise, Mr Patten said he hoped LegCo would 'agree to proposals which are acceptable to the community and which are acceptable to both the present and future sovereign powers'. The governor's remarks mark a further softening in his stance on Hong Kong's constitutional development. Over the past month Mr Patten has stopped saying that any alternatives to his plans had to be better than his. He has emphasised that what he suggested last October were simply 'proposals' and has encouraged LegCo members and others to come up with alternatives. However, Mr Patten has stood fast in rejecting calls by China to withdraw his proposals unilaterally. China has said it will not talk to Mr Patten until his proposals are withdrawn and it has threatened to repudiate any legislation LegCo enacts if it is not first consulted by Britain. Since New Year, Beijing too has moderated its stance on honouring contracts which span the change in sovereignty in 1997. The governor's Executive Council will study his plans for the next month and it seems unlikely that they will reach LegCo before the end of February. LegCo is not expected to vote until the early summer. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

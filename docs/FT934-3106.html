			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / MPs deplore Pounds 20m waste of NHS cash Grave concern over the waste of at least Pounds 20m on computer projects in Wessex Regional Health Authority was expressed by the Commons public accounts committee yesterday. Its report refers to evidence of conflict of interest, concealment of vital information, and 'grave shortcomings in management and financial control and accountability'. The Wessex authority, the National Health Service management executive and individuals including Mr John Hoare, the authority's former general manager, and Sir Robin Buchanan, until recently its chairman, are all criticised. By the time the region's ambitious computerisation plans were abandoned in 1990, says the committee, at least Pounds 43m had been spent 'with little return' and the authority accepted that Pounds 20m or more had been wasted. The report refers to a 'near obsessional belief' in the information-technology plans. Much of the blame is attached to Mr Hoare, described as 'a man with a strong vision, and such a determination not to be deflected off course, that he presided over a series of actions incompatible with the handling of public money and without regard to clear evidence that the project was going badly wrong'. Mr Hoare later left the authority with a Pounds 111,940 severance payment. The committee notes that he was entitled to this under his terms of employment, but says it is 'astonished that no disciplinary action was taken against him'. The report, coming soon after another from the committee on mismanagement in West Midlands Regional Health Authority, brought opposition calls for government action. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called on Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, to announce disciplinary action. Mr John Denham, Labour MP for Southampton Itchen, called for the removal of Sir Robin from his present position as chairman of the NHS supplies authority. Ministers stress that management controls in the NHS have been tightened since the Wessex and West Midlands cases came to light. A working party is considering ways of strengthening corporate governance and reinforcing public-service values. Wessex Regional Health Authority Regional Information Systems Plan. HMSO.

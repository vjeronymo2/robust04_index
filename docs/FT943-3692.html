			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Technology: The price of freedom - Why research science is different in the private and public sectors Business and academia have drawn closer in recent years in the UK, but cultural differences can still stand in the way of a fruitful relationship. Oxford University's Department of Experimental Psychology, for example, has carpet tiles that need to be stuck back into place whereas research facilities in the private drugs sector are sparkling - Glaxo's new Pounds 670m complex at Stevenage, for instance, gives visitors overshoes to protect the marble floors. Such differences are often more to do with funding than with culture, but represent one facet of a more profound gulf between academic and industrial research. The two communities 'operate in entirely different ways', says Sue Iversen, head of the Oxford department. Iversen knows both disciplines from the inside. She was an academic at Cambridge University until 11 years ago, when she moved to the drug company Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme. At the time, says Iversen, her research was 'on an all-time high', but she was drawn by 'the challenge of having huge resources to design a laboratory from the ground up'. Although 'very satisfied with my time at Merck', Iversen felt ready for a new challenge, and came back to academia after 10 years because 'the only job I had not done was to run a major university department'. Now at Oxford, Iversen carries out research on the brain's chemical messenger systems and their relationship to anxiety, schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease - an area of intense activity in both sectors. Academics want to understand how these fundamental mechanisms of the brain control our behaviour. Drug companies want to develop treatments for the disabling illnesses that result from their malfunction. It is the difference between these two goals, says Iversen, that leads academics and industrialists to operate differently. In the universities, neuroscientists set their own research agendas. Independence and academic freedom are not only fundamental, but are taken for granted. But academics feel they pay dearly for their freedom. They can decide what research they want to do, but there is no guarantee it will be funded. Less than a quarter of the best projects are successful in the national competition for research funds. A consequence of this can be that second-rate academics succeed by being good at marketing their ideas. In drug companies, wasting expensively trained human capital on under-resourced research projects would be unthinkable. Research priorities are set by the company's needs and goals. This trade-off between resources and freedom figured heavily in Iversen's decision to move to industry. The change in emphasis from trying to understand the brain to seeking remedies for its malfunctions also excited her, as she had been working in areas related to mental and neurological illnesses. The most exciting aspect of Iversen's time in industry sprang from the way that drug discovery brings together scientists from different disciplines. The opportunity to collaborate with chemists on drug design, using computers to view the shapes of drug molecules and to investigate how molecular structure could predict biological activity, was something she had never dreamed of. This co-operation with chemists streamlined the hit-and-miss process of selecting chemicals to be tested as potential drugs, says Iversen. Her worries before moving to Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme focused on the management of research. 'I wasn't attracted by going in with a big stick and bossing 20 scientists around, instead of leaving my research students to do brilliant things on their own.' In fact, managing research teams had more to do with distributing carrots than wielding sticks. The most difficult part of the job was to maintain the motivation of team members, 'especially those whose contribution wasn't by being brilliant'. Iversen says one advantage of working in the private sector is the ability to motivate with bonuses. She believes performance-related pay is an important tool for maintaining motivation in the long term. But in the short term, or when all the money available for bonuses has been spent, 'the only way is to give people an appreciation of how much their work contributes to the project'. Iversen says her time in the private sector was invaluable for her Oxford job. Persuading independent-minded academics to adopt a team approach makes administration much easier. But, she says, 'the most important aspect of the head of department's role is in identifying potential high fliers and protecting them from being overburdened by teaching and trivial administrative duties.' Iversen's ability to influence research funding inside her department is minimal. Her staff must compete for outside funds. All she can do is encourage them to write proposals, and try to maintain morale. She has strong views on how meagre funds should be targeted - she sits on two national science funding committees, the council of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Wellcome Trust's Neuroscience Committee. 'Universities must be the place where 'blue-skies' research is done,' she says. 'We must jealously guard resources for long-shots, and to help newcomers get started. 'The most important thing is to make more use of outcome measures in allocating research funds,' she adds. Her other main point is that funds should be concentrated: 'You have to put the money in centres and individuals of excellence.' By concentrating funds in this way the UK can hope to end up with a small number of world-class academic research centres. 'Modern science will make it increasingly difficult for one man and his dog to operate in isolation,' says Iversen.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Offshore Centres (4): Eyeing the mainstream - Luxembourg is seeking to diversify services FOR TWO decades Luxembourg has built up its financial sector by stealing into niche markets ignored or disdained elsewhere. Now the emphasis is on consolidation of a centre offering a broad range of services, one less vulnerable to economic and regulatory developments beyond its control. Although Luxembourg's activities remain heavily geared toward private customer banking and investment funds, the principal engines of growth since the mid-1980s, the authorities are seeking diversity in fields such as life insurance and even financial spin-offs from the creation last year of the landlocked Grand Duchy's commercial shipping register. In spite of occasional denigration, mostly from outside observers, the financial sector appears in healthy enough shape. After a poor year in 1990, the banking sector's profits for last year are expected to show a healthy rebound. The sector now comprises 187 banks, some 70 of which have been established over the past five years. Alongside them have growth up around 900 investment funds, for which the Grand Duchy has now become the leading European centre. 'If you look at the most recent developments, one can only be satisfied,' says Pierre Jaans, director-general of the banking sector's regulatory body, the Luxembourg Monetary Institute (IML). Not least, he says, the 1991 results will show the fruit of cost-cutting policies by many banks, with a brake on the hiring of new employees following several years of breakneck expansion. And as a bonus, Luxembourg's overheated commercial property market has also cooled off, bringing down city centre rents by anything up to a third. Mr Jaans believes that Luxembourg's cost structure now looks much more competitive in international terms than a year or so ago. 'Once you have acquired a reputation for being expensive, it is virtually impossible to get rid of it,' he says. 'It is very important not to cross the threshold.' But he acknowledges that this is no time for the Grand Duchy's financial industry to rest on its laurels. With increased competition from new centres within and outside the European Community and policy change in neighbouring countries, many of the advantages Luxembourg offers, particularly to the private investor, are no longer unique. This reflects to some extent the country's success in staving off pressure from its EC partners for changes to a structure best known abroad for banking secrecy (enforced by penalties for violators of up to two years' imprisonment) and freedom of taxation for non-resident investors. As a result, the private banking business has drawn fire from neighbouring countries, especially France and at times Germany, because it not only attracts savings from those countries but shields them from tax authorities. The point is a very sore one. Insistent if unconfirmed reports say Paris has in the past gone as far as to plant spies inside French-owned banks in the Grand Duchy to report on the dealings of French customers; and that German tax officials noted the numbers of German-registered cars parked near the main cluster of banks in the city centre. In spite of efforts to deflect criticism such as persuading banks to tone down their advertising abroad, at one point in the late 1980s it looked as though Luxembourg might have to accept dilution of its secrecy rules, a paneuropean withholding tax on investment income or both. The heat now seems to be off. The plan for an EC withholding tax died when Germany abandoned its own tax, and Mr Jaans does not believe it will be resuscitated even though the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has ordered the German government to reintroduce a withholding tax. He says: 'Luxembourg has been singled out for its banking secrecy and its tax-exempt status for non-residents. Now German officials are stressing that their withholding tax package includes safeguards for the integrity of banking secrecy in Germany and exempt status for non-residents. I would say we are in good company.' Since the debate was at its height in 1988, he says, other countries have largely given up trying to change Luxembourg's rules in favour of copying them. For instance, two years ago Belgium cut its own withholding tax from 25 to 10 per cent, seeking to persuade investors to keep their money at home rather than make the short journey across the border to Luxembourg. Luxembourg bankers say there has been no real indication that the 'Belgian dentist', the archetypical private investor, is removing his money from the Grand Duchy as a result. But it is a sign that other countries which disdained such business are now doing their best to attract it. And while Luxembourg has kept enemies of banking secrecy at bay with the introduction of tough legislation against money laundering and insider trading, bankers are now wondering whether the result, ironically, has been to weaken secrecy rather than strengthen it. A complaint that various banks had breached the secrecy rules was lodged in January by Franklin Jurado, a Colombian who is on trial in the first prosecution to be launched under the money laundering legislation. His claim that the banks approached police investigators with informatIon about his dealings is supported by evidence given during the trial. Observers believe that bankers, confronted with the secrecy rules and legislation making them criminally liable for 'negligent' involvement in laundering, have concluded it is less risky to err on the side of disclosure. The dilemma will be removed by new legislation being prepared by the government to implement common EC rules; this will free bankers offering information on suspected money laundering from the strictures of the secrecy requirements. What it does leave open to question is the extent to which client confidentiality will still exist - especially once another draft law covering fiscal fraud is brought on to the statute book. The proposals, which distinguish between petty tax evasion and large-scale fraud, were published more than a year ago but enacting them does not appear to be a government priority. Bankers and regulators alike argue that banking secrecy is likely to be eroded with time come what may, and that this will not be a disaster if Luxembourg's financial sector can compensate with an enhanced degree of competitiveness, expertise and customer service. This has prompted the banks' drive for rationalisation and efficiency as well as a new emphasis on training. Through its affiliate, the Luxembourg Institute for Training in Banking, the Luxembourg Bankers' Association aims to develop a cadre of specialist and generalist professionals capable of competing with the best abroad. While Mr Jaans believes that the number of investment funds registered in Luxembourg is likely to stabilise around the 1,000 mark, he sees the sector's growing expertise as a marketable asset, arguing that in the future Luxembourg banks involved in Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (Ucits) administration could offer services such as custodianship to funds incorporated under French, Belgian and other legislations. And the authorities see a third pillar for the financial industry in the increasing use of life insurance in the form of savings. With full cross-border harmonisation still to come, the Luxembourg sector is still at the fledgling stage, with some 10 companies established (although buyers are sought for two of them). All this suggests that Luxembourg may in the future move from the traditional offshore niche role closer toward the mainstream, and that competitiveness will be more than ever the watchword.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LUXEMBOURG'S FINANCIAL SECTOR  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year           Number of        Banks'       Number        Funds'                    banks     aggregate     of funds        global                          balance sheet                 net assets                               (LFrbn)*                   (LFrbn)*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1981               115           5,081         81           168.4 1982               115           5,987         87           189.3 1983               114           6,592         99           303.3 1984               115           7,331        137           398.0 1985               118           7,628        177           632.4 1986               122           8,007        261         1,006.3 1987               127           8,686        405         1,134.5 1988               143           9,938        525         2,138.3 1989               166          11,337        651         2,964.4 1990               177          12,480        805         2,914.3 1991**             187          12,977        892         4,123.4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * USDollars=LFr33.39; ** November  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Luxembourg Monetary Institute  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

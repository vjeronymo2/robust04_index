			<p>BFN     [Text] After his talks with Vitaliy Churkin, Radovan  Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, gave the following  statement to the Serbian Television:    [Begin Karadzic recording] Well, Mr. Churkin has urgently  come because of the new situation and to try to learn about the  Serbian side's position. We did not want to talk much about  Gorazde itself. This is purely a military question, as Gorazde  is not a protected zone nor has it been defined as such.  Regarding its borders or its contents, according to  international war law, this should be a strictly limited zone  without any army apart from the United Nations Protection Forces  [UNPROFOR]. The two commanders should sign an agreement on  this. The Muslims have always refused to do so, hoping to expand  the Gorazde zone right up to the borders of Serbia and Sandzak,  to gain much more after such a military offensive, and to ensure  a green line [zelena transferzala].    We briefed Mr. Churkin on our position, which is either war  or peace. It cannot be a little bit of war and a little bit of  peace. It cannot be war at Kupres, in Teslic, on Mount Ozren, in  Doboj, along the corridor, that is, at Trebava, southward of  Brcko -- everywhere where the Muslim forces are attacking us --  and in Gorazde, all until we set off into a counteroffensive.  And when we set off into a counteroffensive, then (?everyone  wants) to preserve peace and everywhere where Muslims still  [word indistinct] for instance [name indistinct], (?Usora), and  so on, one can calmly wage war there. Our position is that we  want peace. Likewise, we said that our artillery is not  shelling the town. Our aim is not the town's civilian targets.  Our aim is to break up the Muslim offensive, the military  defeat of the Muslim forces in Gorazde.    You shall see; hardly a few days will pass when it will be  clearly told in the West. Democratic forces in the West will  clearly say what interfering in this war on the side of the  Muslims means, what it means responding to calls by UNPROFOR  observers in Gorazde itself who are probably being shelled by  the Muslims and who are probably being threatened by the  Muslims, but they are certainly not threatened by the Serbs. In  any case, this is a very critical moment in our relations with  UNPROFOR. We have suspended all relations with UNPROFOR. We do  not know how we would and whether we would establish any  relations in the future. Since the arrival of General Rose,  these relations are marred all the time because Gen. Rose  sometimes forgets -- as we have informed Mr. Akashi in several  letters -- that he is not in the Malvinas [Falkland Islands] or  in an English colony; he is on Serbian territory and should  behave as someone who is impartial and who must respect this  people and its dignity.

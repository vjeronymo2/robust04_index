			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative C. No Active Natural Resource Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Alternative C, commercial forest management would not be practiced, and natural succession would be allowed to convert approximately 40 to 50 percent of the forest to shade-tolerant hardwoods such as maple and beech. In addition, open land management for the purposes of creating wildlife habitat would cease, and hunting and other consumptive recreation would not be allowed. The biosphere reserve core area would total 161,500 acres, essentially all of LBL except those areas devoted to the interior highway system and facilities. Water level manipulation on interior ponds would benefit waterfowl and shorebirds, but no artificial wetlands would be constructed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative D: No Active Forest Management, Hunting Allowed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Alternative D, commercial forest management would cease as in Alternative C. However, open land management would continue as in the past, and hunting would be allowed. Biosphere reserve core area would total 151,050 acres. Water and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Alternative E (modified): Combination of Even-Aged and Uneven-Aged Forest Management With Expansion of Biosphere Reserve Core Area <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Alternative E, even-aged forest management would be used on moist, lower slopes and bottomland habitats where conversion to shade-tolerant species through natural succession is most likely. Uneven-aged forest management practices would be used on upper slopes and ridges where conversion is less likely to occur. The goal of both management systems would be to maintain a high proportion of healthy, vigorous oak-hickory forest stands. For aesthetic reasons, clearcuts would not be used. To further reduce aesthetic impacts, final shelterwood harvests would be deferred for 20 to 40 years following the initial harvest. The rotation age for forests under even-aged management would be 150 years. Group selection harvests under the uneven-aged system would be limited to about one acre or less in size. Although set rotations would not apply to uneven-aged management, hardwood trees would be allowed to reach an age of 150 to 200 years. Open land management would continue as in the past; however, any open lands within biosphere reserve core areas would be allowed to revert to forest. Biosphere reserve core areas would be increased to a total of 42,500 acres. Water level and wetland management would be the same as under Alternative A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Preferred Alternative <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Final EIS identified Alternative E as TVA's preferred alternative. In TVA's opinion, Alternative E represents an environmentally balanced approach which best provides for the recreational and educational goals of LBL. This approach is largely consistent with and builds upon the management approach currently in use at LBL (Alternative A). It provides for increased outdoor recreation and environmental education opportunities but does so in the context of ecologically sound natural resource management. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Alternative E, active forest and wildlife management would occur at reduced level's compared to the no action alternative (Alternative A). However, the forest should have a more natural appearance compared to alternatives A and B_a difference which TVA's analyses indicate is preferred by the general public. A larger biosphere reserve core area would enhance conditions for those species which benefit from unfragmented forest blocks and closed canopies. This would include forest interior neotropical migratory birds which are of current concern. There are a number of other attributes that make Alternative E preferable: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Scenic beauty would be emphasized_timber harvesting methods would be employed that decrease the visual impact of tree removal. Areas along roadways and adjacent to facilities would be planted to native prairie grasses, native wildflowers and native flowering trees and shrubs; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Timber harvesting would continue but at a level of 5.3 million board feet annually, a 20 percent decrease from prior levels of 6.6 million board feet; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Wildlife management activities would continue to support hunting and wildlife viewing activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;The combination of forest management activities used, in conjunction with a large biosphere reserve area, would enhance site-level, landscape-level, and regional biological diversity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;Hiking, horseback riding, and bicycle riding experiences would be enhanced; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=7 f=2 --> e <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &blank;A slight increase in tourism spending would be expected, while the loss of timber-related jobs would be minimized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As finally formulated, Alternative E reflects modifications which were made to it in response to public comments on the Draft EIS. Specific comments and responses were: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The biosphere reserve core acreage should be increased to address concerns about forest fragmentation, habitat for forest interior neogropical migratory birds, and regional biological diversity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The biosphere reserve core acreage was increased from 20,650 acres to 42,500 acres (approximately 25 percent of LBL). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Silvicultural recommendations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> timber harvesting methods) should be based on specific site conditions; therefore, even-aged management should not be eliminated as a management tool. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even-aged management was added to the alternative as an appropriate practice on moist and bottomland sites. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Management actions should provide for improved forest health and vigor (especially in light of anticipated future gypsy moth infestations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Even-aged and uneven-aged management practices were included with a goal of maintaining a healthy and vigorous forest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aesthetic resources should continue to be protected and improved through resource management activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Silvicultural practices such as shelterwood with a delay in the final shelterwood harvest were included as an alternative to clearcutting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The use of pesticides and other chemicals should be reduced. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alternative was modified to establish as a target a 25 percent reduction in the amount of pesticides used at LBL by the year 2000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

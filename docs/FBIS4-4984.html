			<p>BFN     [Text] It was disclosed on 4 April that one of the members  of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] delegation (led  by SDPJ Vice Chairman Issei Inoue) to China contacted a  high-ranking official at the DPRK (North Korean) Embassy during  their stay in Beijing from 1 to 3 April. An SDPJ source said  that SDPJ upper house member Hajime Fukada met with the North  Korean Embassy official in Beijing and proposed that a  delegation of coalition Diet members visit North Korea. The  North Korean official reportedly demonstrated a positive  reaction to Fukada's proposal.    Inoue said at the 4 April news conference that he told  Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on 2 April that the SDPJ  supports the UN Security Council [UNSC] presidential statement  on the North Korean nuclear development issue and that it  attaches importance to cooperation with the United Nations. He  added he had told Qian that "the SDPJ will abide by the UN  policy as one of the Japanese ruling parties." Inoue then  demonstrated an eagerness to promote diplomatic activities  between ruling party lawmakers to solve the issue at the  interparty "diplomatic forum" to be set up on 5 April.</p>

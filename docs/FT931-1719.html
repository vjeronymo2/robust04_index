			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bluebird in the black with Pounds 1.55m BLUEBIRD Toys yesterday announced a return to profits for the year to December 31 with Pounds 1.55m pre-tax against losses of Pounds 3.55m. The 1991 outcome reflected exceptional costs of Pounds 3.46m incurred as a result of restructuring over 1990 and 1991. Turnover rose to Pounds 46m (Pounds 42.6m) and margins increased to 7.5 per cent (5.3). The group now does more than a third of its business in the US, continental Europe and Japan. Overseas sales have increased every year since 1988. The group manufactures 50 per cent of products sold in the UK in China and also 57 per cent of the products it sells overseas. It had no plans to repatriate production from China to the UK to take advantage of sterling's comparatively low value. It said its Knock Your Block Off, Whack Attack, and Skull Krusher products, sold under the Peter Pan brand, remained popular. It rejected the threat of 'politically correct parents' preferring 'non-violent' or 'unisex' toys. Mr Angus Fisher, operations director, added: 'There is some evidence that boys are playing with the Polly Pocket toys (miniature dolls) - and that's outside the employees of the company.' Stocks had been reduced to about Pounds 2.9m from a peak in 1990 of Pounds 8.8m. The board is proposing to resume dividends with a proposed 4.5p, payable from earnings per share of 16.9p (losses of 35.8p).</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Arts: As You Like It - Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon David Thacker's new RSC production begins in darkness, and ends in light: at least he has got one thing right. Duke Frederick's court is incarcerated in black marble, with the men all in shiny black greatcoats and boots (it looked at first as though the RSC had returned to the black-leather mode of yesteryear), Rosalind and Celia tight-buttoned in dresses of an indeterminate period. From this fairly heavy-handed start, one waited for some definite view of the play to develop and make itself felt. It never did. Once in the Forest of Arden, indeed, we never knew where we were. There was a broad tilted greensward, suitable for displaying market produce, and a huge branching tree whose foliage was inadequately disguised for the winter scenes. What kind of charade was being played out remained utterly unclear; it carried no undertones or overtones, nor the least romantic conviction. A few individually attractive performances floated free, unmoored by any whole dramatic conception. In the opening confrontation Peter de Jersey's Orlando was appealingly desperate, though even in platform heels brother Oliver (Adrian Lukis) looked hopefully menacing rather than truly nasty. (Later, on his reappearance in the forest, he seemed not merely chastened but lobotomised.) In the visual circumstances, Duke Frederick (Andrew Jarvis) could only be a comic-book tyrant. The wrestling match was cautious, as if an Equity safety-officer had laid down firm provisos. Alfred Burke made a plaintively decent old Adam; the girls remained ciphers so far. Nobody except poor Adam was noticeably discommoded by the Arden winter ' the exiled Duke (Jeffrey Dench, unvaryingly placid), might have been taking his regular seasonal break. Gary Yershon has set 'Blow, blow, thou winter wind", like the other songs, as a pop-lusty ballad, academically well-made; he also supplies big-band Hollywood triumphal music for the end. Nor is anybody greatly enlivened by the coming of spring; Yershon's home-from-the-hunt chorus, however, strikes a suddenly fierce, dark note that gets no follow-up. Magic should be easy to come by in Arden, but there was a great dearth of it here. Phyllida Hancock's Celia is always pleasant and upper-middle genteel, without any touch of the astringency that sharpens the best Celias. Orlando remains nervously introspective and well-spoken (the more florid speeches tax his diction a little). Nothing special is done with Touchstone, although Anthony O'Donnell gives him a fine, professionally waspish attack. The shepherds and the rustic sluts are about par for the course. There is a sterling Jaques from Michael Siberry, much the most striking performance of the evening: strong, uncensorious, philosophically detached but eager for discovery ' his connoisseur's delight in Touchstone's fantastications is itself delightful. Almost alone, Siberry exemplifies the thoughtful life that ought to inform any creditable As You Like It. And the all-important Rosalind? Well: bobbed hair does not a 'Ganymede' make. Samantha Bond's boyish disguise consists of a clinging open-necked shirt and trousers cut as if positively to emphasise her femininity. Her voice is husky but high, and its range narrow-gauge. Mostly she flutes brightly, with brief bursts of breathy ecstasy which seem to come from a different character, not from this 'Ganymede's' secret soul. Understandably, Orlando keeps a wary distance; he would have to be mad to be taken in. Miss Bond hops from hillock to hillock, struts, poses, flings her arms wide (eventually this routine begins to infect her fellow players too). It took me some time to place this strangely familiar act, but at last the penny dropped: Peter Pan] - Wrong play. In repertory to September 11.</p>

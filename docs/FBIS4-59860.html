			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 May (MENA)--President Husni Mubarak  received Defense Minister Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn Tantawi  at the Presidential Office this morning. Field Marshal Tantawi  returned to Cairo from Washington yesterday after a visit of  several days to the United States.    Speaking after the meeting, Tantawi said he briefed  President  Mubarak on the results of his visit to the United States and his  meetings with senior military, U.S. Administration, and Congress  officials. He noted that the U.S. officials expressed their  appreciation of Egypt and of President Mubarak's role in its  every aspect, particularly regarding world peace and the  Israeli- Palestinian Agreement recently signed in Cairo.    The defense minister added that his talks in Washington  covered every current world issue, Egypt's role in the region,  Egyptian-U.S. military ties and cooperation in the field of  joint training, and the U.S. military grant to Egypt. He  described the results of these talks as good.    Asked about reports on a reduction in U.S. aid, which will  be  directed to East Europe, and how prepared Egypt is to deal with  such a reduction, the defense minister said the U.S.  Administration has reduced its own military budget. As a  result, he added, there was a tendency to reduce foreign aid.  But considering the role Egypt is playing and in view of its  importance, its status, and its Armed Forces in the region, I  hope Egypt will not be affected by such a reduction.    Asked about the notion of replacing the U.S. aid with  cooperation in the field of technology transfer to compensate  for the loss and whether his talks in Washington dealt with  this, Field Marshal Tantawi said: It is not an issue of  replacement; the two things must go together. He noted that  cooperation exists between Egypt and the United States in every  field. He added: I have sensed an understanding of Egypt's  role and position and our bilateral relations are proceeding in  the right direction, be it in the field of technology transfer,  aid, joint training, or other areas.    Asked if anything new in the field of military cooperation  was agreed upon with the United States, the defense minister  said there are procedures concerning the armament and  modernization of the Armed Forces and U.S. assistance in these  areas, noting that these procedures follow an established plan  and that the plan is continuing.    Asked if new arms deals were concluded as part of this plan,  Field Marshal Tantawi said: We operate according to a five-year  plan, which is proceeding in the right direction.</p>

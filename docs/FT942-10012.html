			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Trizec holders lose argument Junior debt holders of Trizec, the North American property group, have failed to halt the company's refinancing programme, writes Robert Gibbens from Montreal. An Alberta court rejected their argument that they should be given more time to negotiate a better deal as part of the refinancing. Trizec has already settled with the senior debt holders. Trizec is now expected to post to shareholders details of the refinancing, which hinges on a CDollars 600m cash injection by Horsham, a holding company controlled by Mr Peter Munk, the Toronto financier.</p>

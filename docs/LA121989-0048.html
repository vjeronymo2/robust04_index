			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JETS HIRE DICK STEINBERG AS GM; PATRIOTS THREATEN LEGAL ACTION  </P> <P> Dick Steinberg, former director of player personnel for the Rams who later  helped build the New England Patriots into a Super Bowl team, was hired as  general manager of the New York Jets Monday amid threats of legal action by the  Patriots.  </P> <P> Steinberg, 54, accepted a contract estimated at five years for nearly $3.25  million to become the Jets' first general manager in 15 years.  </P> <P> Patriot General Manager Pat Sullivan, interviewed on WBZ-TV in Boston, said  director of college scouting Joe Mendez was appointed to replace Steinberg and  that the team was going to take legal action over the way the Steinberg matter  was conducted.  </P> <P> Sullivan said the Patriots would seek compensation of some kind, maybe in a  trade or monetary form. "We basically felt there are provisions in this  contract . . . that were violated," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> The Jets are 4-11, their worst record in seven seasons under Coach Joe Walton.  </P> <P> Although Steinberg's role with the Patriots had not changed under new owner  Victor Kiam, he did not have the power there he will have with the Jets.  </P> <P> Steinberg, the director of player development for the Patriots, has disagreed  with Kiam, General Manager Patrick Sullivan and Coach Raymond Berry on some  recent personnel moves, including the waiving of quarterback Tony Eason, who  started for the Jets Sunday.  </P></p>

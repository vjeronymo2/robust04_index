			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of China (9): Long march to modernisation - A look at the influence of the armed forces COLONEL Pan Zhenqiang, director of the Institute for Strategic Studies at the People's Liberation Army's National Defence University, has a vision of China's strategic environment that should hearten its neighbours. China, he believes, should press hard for multilateral security arrangements like the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) that would lessen regional tensions, and overcome mistrust that has bedevilled relationships for generations. 'Our priority is to try to change from confrontation which is a zero-sum game in nature to co-operative relationships,' he says. 'We do not advocate a transplanting of the CSCE, but we believe such ideas can be adapted to the Asian environment.' These views may be regarded sceptically by Asian nations which have expressed alarm over what they perceive as China's attempts to extend its military reach with purchases of new weapons systems from the arsenals of the former Soviet Union, and other sources such as Israel. But calls by Chinese officials for closer regional security co-operation appear to reflect a genuine interest in finding ways to deal with potential security problems peacefully. Not least of the factors weighing in China's calculations is the enormous cost of acquiring modern weapons systems that would be required to project its power beyond its own borders. The continuing debate within the military over whether China can afford its first aircraft carrier is just one example of these financial constraints. While China increased the allocation to defence by 12.4 per cent to Yn42.5bn (UDollars 7.4bn) this year, the fourth straight increase in defence expenditure, spending remains low by most standards, even taking account of the fact that the budgeted amount accounts for less than half of the total cost of maintaining the military. Military analysts in Beijing believe that talk of a Chinese regional threat is exaggerated, while they also acknowledge that the sheer weight and size of China's armed forces certainly make them appear threatening in the regional equation - 'I don't 'buy' talk of a China threat,' says one Western official whose role it is to monitor developments in the military. 'Their modernisation programme is simply not enough to make them a regional threat.' Mr Qian Qichen, China's Foreign Minister, seeks fairly regularly to calm regional concerns about his country's military intentions by comparing official expenditures with those of the US and Japan. 'In terms of absolute figures, China's military spending this year will be Dollars 7.4bn, compared with Dollars 274.3bn for the US, Dollars 37.7bn for Japan,'he told a press conference earlier this year. His use of the phrase 'absolute figures' is somewhat ingenuous, however, since, increasingly, China's military has been augmenting its meagre stipend from the state with business activities which have gone far beyond the original intentions of the founders of the PLA who favoured such worthy money-making pursuits as agriculture and roadbuilding. The military has become ever more deeply engaged in bingshang, literally 'soldier's business', through affiliated organisations like China North Industries Corporation (Norinco), and China Poly Group Corporation. Both are heavily involved in the arms trade, and increasingly in other commercial pursuits, as well. A dramatic slump in China's international arms trade from Dollars 4.7bn at the height of the Iran-Iraq war to perhaps as little as Dollars 100m in 1992 is obliging the country's military-industrial complex to seek opportunities away from the arms business. There is scarcely a branch of the Chinese military these days not engaged in some way or other in bingshang. 'Soldier's business,' has come more and more to mean 'big business' for sections of the military whose commercial activities range from real estate speculation to trading in cars and other commodities, and even the management of discotheques and karaoke bars. Unsurprisingly, the expanding business activities of PLA Inc., as China's 3m strong military is referred to in some quarters, has prompted fierce debate within the defence establishment. 'Our main mission should be the defence of the country,' said Colonel Pan from the PLA's National Defence University. 'We have to draw a kind of demarcation line . . . One should not go too far in pursuing business.' Limited financial resources are being devoted to increasing the mobility of the army and building up air defences. The recent purchase of 24 Su27 fighters from Russia is part of the process.</p>

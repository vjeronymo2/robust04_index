			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) A grantee or subgrantee will be exempt from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-award review in paragraph (g)(2) of this section if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding agency determines that its procurement systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comply with the standards of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) A grantee or subgrantee may request that its procurement system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be reviewed by the awarding agency to determine whether its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system meets these standards in order for its system to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified. Generally, these reviews shall occur where there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a continuous high-dollar funding, and third-party contracts are awarded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on a regular basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A grantee or subgrantee may self-certify its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procurement system. Such self-certification shall not limit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the awarding agency's right to survey the system. Under a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-certification procedure, awarding agencies may wish to rely on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written assurances from the grantee or subgrantee that it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complying with these standards. A grantee or subgrantee will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cite specific procedures, regulations, standards, etc., as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being in compliance with these requirements and have its system available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bonding requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For construction or facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement contracts or subcontracts exceeding $100,000, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awarding agency may accept the bonding policy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the grantee or subgrantee provided the awarding agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made a determination that the awarding agency's interest is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately protected. If such a determination has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made, the minimum requirements shall be as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A bid guarantee from each bidder equivalent to five percent of the bid price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``bid guarantee'' shall consist of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check, or other negotiable instrument  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accompanying a bid as assurance that the bidder will, upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the time specified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A performance bond on the part of the contractor for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 percent of the contract price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``performance bond'' is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one executed in connection with a contract to secure fulfillment of all the contractor's obligations under such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> A payment bond on the part of the contractor for 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent of the contract price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A ``payment bond'' is one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> executed in connection with a contract to assure payment as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required by law of all persons supplying labor and material in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> execution of the work provided for in the contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Contract provisions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A grantee's and subgrantee's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contracts must contain provisions in this paragraph of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.

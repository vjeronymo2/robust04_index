			<p><P> February 17, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: COUPLE TO LIVE MODESTLY, BUT GUESTS WILL HAVE LOTS OF ROOM  </P> <P> Now you've heard everything.  </P> <P> Motor-home magnate John Crean and his wife, Donna, are building themselves a  2,000-square-foot home and a 40,000-square-foot guest house.  </P> <P> That's right. The Creans of Corona del Mar are turning the good life upside  down on their rural 3.7-acre Santa Ana Heights property.  </P> <P> Of about 42,000 square feet of under-roof structures, only 1/20th will be used  daily by the couple, said Crean on a recent tour of the monolith-in-progress.  "We like small spaces. We make our own bed. Donna cooks for me. We don't want a  lot of people coming in to mop and vacuum. We have our place in the main house  and the rest of it's for entertaining friends and family."  </P> <P> In fact, the mansion, which friends and family have said should be dubbed  "Crean Acres," got started with some entertaining last year. On a crisp January  afternoon, the duo tossed a demolition bash attended by such diverse  nears-and-dears as actor Buddy Ebsen, Orange County Supervisors Tom Riley and  Don Roth, composer Ray Conniff, Orange County Republican Party Chairman Thomas  Fuentes, Pilar Wayne and Worst Dressed List author Mr. Blackwell. The idea was  to smash to smithereens -- via bricks and sledgehammers -- the house that  existed on the tree-sprinkled grounds to make way for the mansion, due to open  its towering front door this fall.  </P> <P> Now, Crean -- chairman of the board of Fleetwood Enterprises, a Fortune 500  company that manufactures recreational vehicles -- would cringe if he thought  you'd be offended by the following litany of his home's amenities (after all,  they're being created for you, if you're lucky enough to be one of his pals):  </P> <P> There's the gymnasium that will sit over the carriage house where an oak dance  floor will be available for tap dance lessons (with hoofer Ebsen as teacher?  "Could be, could be," Crean said, laughing); the sprawling swimming pool; the  north-south exposure tennis court ("that exposure keeps sun out of the eyes,"  he said); the sprawling, bar-equipped, rooftop verandas; the 10 guest bedrooms,  each with a bath and each independently temperature-controlled; the projection  room with a lobby where hot dogs, popcorn and pop will be featured; the  billiard and video game room; the library with a contiguous reading room, and  the kiddie playground.  </P> <P> As for the "apartment," as Crean calls it: "It's over here," he said, strolling  to the left of the grand staircase into a 12- by 16-foot area he said was his  and Donna's bedroom.  </P> <P> Whaaaaaat? Out of acres of frolic space, a master bedroom no bigger than most  mansions' coat closets? "When we were married 40 years ago, we lived in a  one-bedroom apartment in Compton that only had a Murphy Bed, a bath and a  kitchen," he said. "It was about 10 by 10 feet. This is our life style!"  </P> <P> But this humbly sized boudoir will feature twin television sets and earphones,  Crean said. "So Donna can watch what she wants to watch and so can I." And  nearby: a small living room, kitchen with breakfast bar, two huge closets and  his-and-her baths and studies. "See, instead of a big master bedroom we've got  space we can use."  </P> <P> Crean is keeping his lips sealed about cost. "I don't know what the price is,"  he said. "I just watch the bank account, and if we run out of money, we'll have  to stop."  </P> <P> If the property has any drawbacks, it might be the constant roar from the jets  that leave nearby John Wayne Airport. But the noise doesn't seem to irritate  Crean, who smiles as he watches the third one in a matter of minutes soar into  a bright blue sky. "On a day when the Santa Ana winds are blowing, the landing  planes have to come in this way and they're so low we can see the people in the  windows," he said. And besides, the couple's bedroom doesn't have one outside  wall, he added. "So we won't be able to hear a thing."  </P> <P> Just how often will the mansion be used for entertaining? "Our friends, four  kids and grandchildren will be over a lot. When we lived on our San Juan  Capistrano ranch, we had friends over almost every day. We love having people  around. The reason for the design of this place is we can have friends here  three or four days and not even have to know they're here."  </P> <P> Which brings us to John Crean's philosophy of life: "I think, unless people do  things together, life is just not much. Donna and I just sitting and looking at  each other can get a little dull. We all need to come together to enjoy life."  </P> <P> As for that next Crean bash in Santa Ana Heights, be prepared for an  eye-popper. "When we opened our house in Beverly Hills, we had a 150-piece band  march down Canon Drive, form up on the tennis court and give a concert," Crean  said.  </P></p>

NMFS also published an interim rule governing the taking of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations on May 19, 1989 (54 FR 21910), and a final rule governing reporting of the take of marine mammals incidental to commercial fishing operations on December 15, 1989 (54 FR 51718).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 14, 1993 (58 FR 32905), NMFS published the interim final List of Fisheries for 1993 and requested comments and information on the changes contained therein. All comments received were in support of the changes to the interim final List of Fisheries. A summary of the comments received are provided in the following section. Proposed revised changes for the 1994 List of Fisheries are based on the classification of fisheries as published in the 1993 interim final List of Fisheries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following criteria were used in classifying fisheries in the List of Fisheries:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Category I.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There is documented information indicating a ``frequent'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery. ``Frequent'' means that it is highly likely that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20 day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Category II.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) There is documented information indicating an ``occasional'' incidental taking of marine mammals in the fishery, or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is a likelihood of at least an ``occasional'' incidental taking in the fishery. ``Occasional'' means that there is some likelihood that one marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20 day period, but that there is little likelihood that more than one marine mammal will be incidentally taken.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Category III.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) There is information indicating no more than a ``remote likelihood'' of an incidental taking of a marine mammal in the fishery, or (2) in the absence of information indicating the frequency of incidental taking of marine mammals, other factors such as fishing techniques, gear used, methods used to deter marine mammals, target species, seasons and areas fished, and species and distribution of marine mammals in the area suggest there is no more than a remote likelihood of an incidental take in the fishery. ``Remote likelihood'' means that it is highly unlikely that any marine mammal will be incidentally taken by a randomly selected vessel in the fishery during a 20-day period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 114(b)(1)(C) of the MMPA, requires the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, to annually publish and request comments on proposed revisions to the List of Fisheries to be effective for the next calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

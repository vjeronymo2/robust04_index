			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MONEY FOR CO-OPS  </P> <P> Regarding the Speaking Out "Southland Hot Spot: Converting Co-Ops to Condos"  (by F. Scott Jackson and Steven Solomon, July 22):  </P> <P> There is plenty of money available for stock co-ops if you know where to look  for it. The National Cooperative Bank loans exclusively to co-ops.  </P> <P> And the share loan market is heating up with several other lenders starting to  compete for the business.  </P> <P> Co-ops are increasingly a lifestyle choice as well as a legal and financial  option. People are seeking a sense of community and co-ops will always be more  effective in helping people achieve that. To say that "co-ops are on their way  to extinction" does a real disservice to cooperatively oriented people among  your readers. Co-ops will always be less expensive than condos for the  first-time home buyer and others who choose co-ops for their long-term housing.  </P> <P> LOIS ARKIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P> Arkin is director of Cooperative Resources &amp; Services Project.  </P></p>

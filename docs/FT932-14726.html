			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / EBRD told to provide details of spending THE 56 countries and inter-national agencies which own the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development have asked the bank's executives for a detailed breakdown of how it spent Pounds 55.5m on furnishing and equipping its offices. The 23 directors of the bank, which represent these countries and agencies, have also asked for proof that 'proper procurement policies' were followed and that the bank received the best prices for the construction. One director said yesterday that the bank's board was unhappy about last year's process of fixing the budget which was eventually set at Ecu136m (Pounds 108m) for administrative costs. The board has prepared a working paper to ensure it receives more detailed information from the banks' executives when fixing future budgets. Canada's representative, Mr Don McCutchan, was so concerned he asked Mr Jacques Attali, the bank's president, to record his refusal to approve the 1993 budget when it was passed on December 14. The Australian representative, Mr Jim Humphreys, is also said to have protested to Mr Attali about lax control on spending by the bank, including the cost of its London headquarters, which the Australian government believes was excessive. Mr Humphreys felt so strongly about the allocation of Pounds 52,000 for a staff Christmas party last December that he wrote to Mr Attali refusing to attend. He felt it was an 'inappropriate' way to spend shareholders' funds. Building contractors said yesterday the bank had spent about Pounds 2.5m on joinery for panelling, door frames and doors. It had bought 600 desks, designed by leading architect Norman Foster, for more than Pounds 600 each. Mr Anders Ljungh, the EBRD's vice president in charge of finance, said that the building had been fitted out within budget and that good prices were obtained for all elements. He said it was 'it was not necessarily appropriate' to order more modest furnishings. 'We got beautiful offices for a useful price,' he said. One director said proposals to change the budget-making process would be implemented after the annual meeting beginning next weekend. Several directors, including those from Canada, Australia and the UK, have been concerned that the bank's control of overheads should be tighter. Mr Ljungh said the bank's investments in the money markets had been so successful last year that all its running costs of Ecu92.8m were covered by interest earnings and dealing costs. The bank made a profit of Ecu3.8m before Ecu10m provisions to cover possible losses on investments in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Its net loss for the year of Ecu6m was Ecu40m better than it had been expecting, Mr Ljungh said. City rejects Pounds 1 1/2 m tent, Page 2 Bank at Europe's heart, Page 7</p>

Labor Minister  Walter Barelli announced he was leaving the government once. The  heated discussion calmed down only after Industry and Commerce  Minister Elcio Alvares intervened and talked with Cardoso.    "Elcio put the fire out," a minister said. Cardoso's most  explosive reaction was provoked by Barelli's proposal to give  equal treatment to prices and salaries. This proposal would have  caused the compulsory conversion of prices by the product's  average price in the last four months -- January and February  not counting because of the speculation in those months -- which  would have resulted in a de facto price freeze.    "This is my limit and perhaps if I leave another person can  amend the stabilization program," Cardoso said. There was a  moment of surprise, particularly because shortly before Franco  had made clear that he supported Barelli's proposal. The  president supported the idea of controlling prices, particularly  prices set in areas controlled by oligopolies.    The solution the ministers found was to call on Gustavo  Franco, Central Bank external area director. Participants then  started discussing a new draft to include Barelli's amendment  without implying price controls, but making it clear that the  government was determined not to permit excessive price  increases. The MP [provisional measure] originally said that  price conversions would be free with a generic citation saying  the government would follow and supervise oligopolies.    According to the original text, when the time was ripe for  converting the URV into the new currency, real prices would be  adjusted "according to criteria established by the Finance  Ministry." In order to resolve a disagreement over this text, it  was decided to establish that prices would be adjusted by the  average price in September, October, November, and December,  eliminating January and February from the calculation.    It also was decided to follow up the behavior of price  increases. So-called "abusive increases" will have to be  explained by the entrepreneurs within a maximum five-day period.  Prices higher than average will be considered "abusive." The  draft satisfied Cardoso because it used the word "may." In  other words, the conversion is voluntary, but the entrepreneurs  will have to give an explanation if the average is not used.  <H5>  Barelli </H5>   Still on 26 February, Barelli inaugurated the succession of  resignation proposals. He presented a timetable with three  methods to improve the minimum wage. Barelli said: "I accept  the amount established by the finance minister ($64.79), but I  want the government to commit itself to improving the minimum  wage." One proposal involved increasing the minimum wage to  $100 by the end of this year. The other proposals involved  improving the minimum wage by May or December 1995.    Cardoso and Social Security Minister Sergio Cutolo rejected  these proposals. Barelli exclaimed: "The way the [economic]  program is drawn up, the government does not need a labor  minister." Cardoso rebuffed: "Then I am also leaving, because  the country can have another finance minister." Alvares again  calmed the spirits. When the meeting ended, the president  proposed drawing up a note of solidarity with FHC2 [Fernando  Henrique Cardoso -- second economic program] signed by all the  ministers.    Barelli asked: "Does this solidarity include minimum wages?"  Franco responded: "Yes." Barelli signed. The meeting's delay  was caused by the president. As soon as the meeting began, he  started reading the provisional measure. After reading each  article, Franco asked each minister to voice an opinion, but the  problems started with paragraph 1 of Article 3. The paragraph  established that the BC [Central Bank] would determine the real  currency's initial issuance date. Franco asked: "Isn't this an  issue that must be decided by the president?" The expression  Central Bank was replaced by executive branch. Similar changes  were introduced in various MP passages.</p>

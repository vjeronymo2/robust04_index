			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku, MAY 17 (TURAN)--Russian Deputy Defense  Minister, Colonel General, Georgiy Kondratyev, has been  appointed the Commander of the Russian military contingent in  the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict zone.    Georgiy Kondratyev is one of the Deputy Defense Ministers  who  is close to Pavel Grachev and who can be called a player on his  team. In the Defense Ministry he was called "a hero of the  October events". According to his colleagues, it was he who  headed all arrangements concerning the neutralization of the  Russian Parliament supporters. Earlier Kondratyev was in  command of the Turkestan Military District and in 1991 he  created the first CIS military commercial centre which was  engaged in the sale of military automobiles and tractors.  Kondratyev is fond of sport, film and military music. He is  also a specialist in emergency situations.    According to military sources, Kondratyev sharply differs  from Generals Gromov and Mironov who held in high respect among  the officers and generals of the Russian Army.    A year ago, Kondratyev headed the operation concerning the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Georgia. However, this fact  caused Shevardnadze's dissatisfaction since he was against  Kondratyev's appointment. Later, the Georgian party said that  instead of a withdrawal of troops from Abkhazia, Kondratyev  supplied supporters of Ardzinba with military hardware and  ammunitions. At the same time, Kondratyev acted as coordinator  between the Russian Defense Ministry and Abkhazia's military  commandant.</p>

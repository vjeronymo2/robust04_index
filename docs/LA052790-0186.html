			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10;  </P> <P> "WE HAVE TO REACH FOR THE STARS AND WHEN WE GET THERE, FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND  THEM AND SEE IF WE CAN CARRY IT LIVE." -- CISSY BAKER, CNN VICE PRESIDENT AND  MANAGING EDITOR  </P> <P> Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were  stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather  reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts,  somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news.  </P> <P> A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around  the world.  </P> <P> When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10  years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the  announcement came from a man whose WTB' "superstation" in Atlanta used to  fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who  once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast.  </P> <P> What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle.  Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three  networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here  anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal."  </P> <P> CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National  Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was  located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played  "You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out.  </P> <P> In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan administration and the three  networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's  paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50  million. Its broadcasts would reach-indeed span-the globe to about 90  countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would  become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match.  </P> <P> The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early  experiences.  </P> <P> Ted Turner, president, CNN  </P> <P> "I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when TBS first went up on  satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since they had the new  movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on TBS, I thought the  next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news channel. That's  where I got the idea. . . Even though I did not have the money and did not know  anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept was good  enough to go ahead and give it a shot.  </P> <P> "The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say  that I minded in retrospect."  </P> <P> Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor  </P> <P> "In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new contract I was being offered at ABC  as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was tired of the network pool I had  been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone Arledge spent an hour in his  office warning me it would be very bad for my career to go do something called  CNN. When I left, most people weren't even trying to conceal their derision,  their snickers. My attitude when I walked into CNN was the same attitude I had  at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. "I'm here. Let's get on with it."  </P> <P> "The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's  speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we  were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, "They're  shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio, and you could hear agents  running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't  get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our  coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something.  I wasn't making as much money as Dan, Peter or Tom-I still don't-but I knew I  was in the right place."  </P> <P> Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering  </P> <P> "We started out in half terror and half confidence. We all ran scared. Hell, we  still do. The conventional wisdom was that CNN was not going to make it. They  told us, 'First, there's no way you guys are going to get on the air. Second,  if you get on the air, there's no way you're going to stay there. Third, if by  some remote chance you do stay on the air, you'll bankrupt Ted (Turner).' Other  than that, it was a lot of encouragement."  </P> <P> Lou Dobbs, vice president of business news  </P> <P> "We didn't know what to expect competitively. My principal concern was not that  we couldn't pull it off. But I wanted to know would CBS emulate? Would ABC  duplicate? That was my fear. I knew that after we were on the air for six  months, we would be very vulnerable to the networks. Starting a 24-hour news  network required an investment by Ted Turner that could have bankrupted him,  but to the networks that kind of money is pocket change. The fact that a  successful imitator hasn't arisen astounds me to this day. The networks'  failure to react to the competitive threat of CNN was the answer to my  prayers."  </P> <P> Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent  </P> <P> "When I first walked into the Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at  a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland MGM musical. They were still building the bureau  about three weeks before air time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was  testing a microphone. Producers were literally hammering the sign of the bureau  into place. And Daniel Schorr was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS  was like after World War II.' As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship  was leaving, and I knew I had to be on it or get left behind.  </P> <P> "Ted (Turner's) master stroke was to install a satellite dish and put CNN in  the offices of Congress. The powerful people in the country turned to CNN the  day shots were fired at Reagan to find out what was happening. Bernie (Shaw)  was the hero of that one. He was the only network anchor not to declare Jim  Brady dead, which was extraordinary given the pressure to do so. The three  established networks had declared him dead, and Dan Rather held a moment of  silence for him. That's when I knew we were on our way."  </P> <P> Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst, National Public Radio.  </P> <P> (Schorr was a CBS News correspondent before being hired as CNN's first  employee. He left in 1985 over a dispute for editorial independence.)  </P> <P> "Ted Turner approached me a year before he started CNN. He asked me to join him  at the cable convention in Las Vegas, and then hired me 15 minutes before the  press conference to give legitimacy to what he was going to propose. I didn't  know anything about cable. But as he outlined CNN to me, I saw the vision  there, something inherently viable, a way to give people news 24 hours a day so  that they could turn it on and off like a water tap. I liked the idea of live  coverage as opposed to capsule coverage. I don't know where he got his  conceptions from, because I could tell he didn't know anything about news.  </P> <P> "I knew CNN would be a success. What I didn't anticipate was the extent of  CNN's success today. It would have been like asking me to foresee a revolution  in Eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I didn't foresee that  CNN would be seen in hotel rooms around the world. That CNN would be the pearl  in Ted's crown."  </P> <P> Cissy Baker, vice president and managing editor  </P> <P> "I thought CNN would be successful. I always believed it would be. It was  everybody else I had to convince. That became a second full-time job, really. I  wish I had a tape recorder in the beginning, when I was running the Washington  desk, trying to get an interview with a congressman or official. I would say,  'Hi, this is Cissy Baker. I'm calling from CNN, Cable News Network, Ted  Turner's all-news, 24-hour network, based in Atlanta, Ga., with a bureau here  in Washington. Do you get cable? Let me tell you about cable.' And then after a  while, I would get this, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?' "  </P> <P> Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today."  </P> <P> (Williams left for NBC last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman.)  </P> <P> "It never occurred to us we couldn't make this thing appen. In January of 1981,  when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all along  the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to cut  between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing cold  with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? We  have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some  wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched.  Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work.  </P> <P> "That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were  manipulating wires by hand.  </P> <P> "In the industry, CNN was a quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing  quiet about it. On June 1, 1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time.  Our lead story was live. Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President  Carter walking out of the hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m.  Eastern time, the broadcast networks went on with their evening newscasts, and  their lead story was Carter walking out of the hospital, and the footage said  'Courtesy of CNN' in the corner. That was our first night on the air."  </P> <P> A DECADE OF CNN: 1980-1990  </P> <P> 1979  </P> <P> May: Ted Turner announces in a Las Vegas press conference the formation of  Cable News Network, the world's only 24-hour TV news operation.  </P> <P> December: RCA's Satcom-3 satellite, which was to carry CNN on one of its  transponders, gets lost in space four days after launch.  </P> <P> 1980  </P> <P> January: CNN takes shape in the sprawling basement of an $8-million  antebellum-style country club in Atlanta that will house corporate headquarters  and broadcasting operations.  </P> <P> March: Turner's raid of the Big Three for a top-dollar editorial staff peaks.

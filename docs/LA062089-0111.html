			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGE STRIKES OUT;  </P> <P> OVER-30 BASEBALL LEAGUES PROVIDE 12,000 PLAYERS WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO RELIVE  THE PAST AND HAVE SOME FUN  </P> <P> Many of the baseball trophies and awards are in boxes somewhere now, replaced  on the desktops by pictures of the children, or grandchildren. The scrapbook  pages have yellowed a bit, and maybe some of the memories have, too.  </P> <P> But please don't bother Frank Jelincich with that sort of thing. That's for old  men, and Jelincich doesn't consider himself old.  </P> <P> Almost every Sunday for the last three years, Jelincich has made his way to one  baseball field or another, wearing his uniform proudly. And almost every Sunday  his name has been on the starting lineup card as the designated hitter for the  California All-Stars.  </P> <P> Jelincich is 72.  </P> <P> Welcome to the Mens Senior Baseball League (MSBL), a hardball organization that  provides dreams for children over 30 who firmly believe that baseball diamonds  are forever and softball diamonds are for never.  </P> <P> Jelincich, who plays with men about half his age, is unusual in terms of age.  But the MSBL doesn't really measure age as much as enthusiasm, which is why  Jelincich epitomizes the essence of a league that has only two requirements:  </P> <P>  -- You must be over 30.  </P> <P>  -- You must be under 30, at heart.  </P> <P> The MSBL is the brainchild of Steve Sigler, 39, of Jericho, N.Y., who created  it in 1986 as an alternative to softball. Sigler had not played baseball in  more than 20 years. "Just because a person is 30, 35, 40 or older doesn't mean  he loves playing baseball any less," Sigler says.  </P> <P> The MSBL has blossomed to more than 12,000 players. The first league, made up  of four teams, was on Long Island. Today, Long Island has 46 teams.  </P> <P> By July of 1988, the MSBL had grown to 150 teams in 20 leagues in 20 U.S.  cities. Today, less than a year later, there are 825 teams in 80 leagues in 80  cities, including some in Canada, the Dominican Republic and the Virgin  Islands.  </P> <P> "There are people organizing teams in Japan and Holland, too," said Sigler, a  financial officer for a stationery company.  </P> <P> California, the state with the most MSBL participants, has 86 teams and nine  leagues. The winner of these and other league titles will go to the second  annual MSBL World Series in Phoenix to play six games in four days next fall.  Last year, the Sioux Falls Mount Rushmores, a South Dakota all-star team, won  the over-30 championship and, in the over-40 division, Woodland-Davis defeated  Sacramento in an all-California final.  </P> <P> "The popularity of this is unbelievable," said Val Lewis, president of the  12-team Sacramento League. "The problem isn't getting enough teams, it's  getting enough facilities. We've gotten so many calls that we have to slow down  our promotions."  </P> <P> Lewis, 47, a civil engineer who has a baseball team living in his home -- he  has 11 children -- condemns softball and its acceptance as the sport for  middle-aged men. So do his friends. MSBL's motto is, "Don't go soft; play  hardball," and the players figure that if they didn't play softball when they  were young, why should they play it now?  </P> <P> "We're already looking toward developing a 50-and-over league because it's hard  to imagine our future without baseball," Lewis said. "This is keeping a bunch  of us young. Unless we're dead, I don't see any reason why we can't keep doing  this past 60."  </P> <P> Some players say that over-30 baseball provides an escape from everyday  pressures, and Sigler calls it "very therapeutic."  </P> <P> Most players, however, are playing for a different reason. They are rounding  the bases in pursuit of the past, attempting to rediscover their youth.  </P> <P> "We're living out dreams and fantasies," said California Assemblyman Tom  Hayden, 49, who plays for the Hollywood Stars. "This generation wants to bring  baseball back. The baby boomer generation is holding onto its childhood."  </P> <P> Said Gary Zive, 32, a construction manager in Orange County and president of  the 12-team Los Angeles-Orange County League:  </P> <P> "We're all kids again," Zive said. "There is a special feeling to putting on a  uniform again. We have a new lease on our baseball lives, and I'm reliving a  dream. There's a great element of fantasy here."  </P> <P> Said John Frietas, 44, president of the Northern California Old-Timers' League:  "This is resurrecting our youth. It enhances your whole being to know that you  can still do it again. It's an incredible, wonderful feeling."  </P> <P> The MSBL rosters are sprinkled with names of former major league players,  although no ex-pro can play unless he has been out of baseball for at least  three years.  </P> <P> "This has been a dream come true," said Ron Dunn, a former Chicago Cub who is  president of the 20-team San Jose League.  </P> <P> Other one-time pros include former Cub Jose Cardenal, playing in the 13-team  Chicago League, and former Boston pitcher Bill Lee, playing in the four-team  Vermont League.  </P> <P> Jim Barr, once of the San Francisco Giants, and Lowell Palmer, formerly of the  Philadelphia Phillies, play in the Sacramento League. Both Barr and Palmer are  pitchers who prefer being on the hill to being over the hill.  </P> <P> "When I was in the majors, it was a combination of pressure and fun," Barr, 41,  said. "The emphasis now is on fun. If I make an error, 4 million people won't  read about it the next morning."  </P> <P> The league with the most former pros is the eight-team Old Glories League in  the Dominican Republic, which features Rico Carty, Juan Marichal, Cesar  Geronimo and Frank Taveras. Although most of the games are between teams who  have no former pros, they still draw an average of 5,000 fans a game. The  Dominicans will send an all-star team to the World Series, in which they  finished third last year.  </P> <P> "At first, people thought it was just an old-timers' game and that we would  drop balls and laugh," said Humberto Franco, the 48-year-old president of the  league. "But this is serious baseball. We don't drop balls, and if we do, we  certainly don't laugh."  </P> <P> Last year, former major leaguers Luis Tiant and Orlando Cepeda played for teams  in Sacramento, but they have defected to a new over-35 league in Florida. That  eight-team league will be made up exclusively of former pros and is scheduled  to begin its 72-game schedule Nov. 1.  </P> <P> That former pros would play in the MSBL speaks volumes about how competitive it  is, especially because they are often not the best players.  </P> <P> Last year, a group of San Jose all-stars without former pros defeated the  University of Santa Clara, 11-6, in an exhibition game. Santa Clara, a Division  I team, later finished its college season with a 43-18-1 record.  </P> <P> "They came out and some of their guys were overweight and our guys didn't take  the game as seriously as if it were another college team," said Mike Cummins,  Santa Clara assistant coach.  </P> <P> "But those guys had some tools and they got our attention pretty quick."  </P></p>

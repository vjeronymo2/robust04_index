Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), told a news conference it is  strange that the Diet proceeding has been held up because of an  affair that took place 10 years ago.    He referred to an opposition demand that Hosokawa submit a  detailed report on 100 million yen which he said was borrowed  from Sagawa Kyubin trucking company.    Hayami's remark reflected worries in the business community  that the stalled debate on the budget proposal may affect the  domestic economy, which has shown signs of recovery.</p>

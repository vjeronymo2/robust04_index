			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: A glimpse behind the veil around the Hinduja empire - Stefan Wagstyl interviews the group's chairman and family head, Mr Srichand Hinduja FOR MORE than 50 years, an aura of secrecy has surrounded the businesses of the Hinduja family, owners of an international trading empire. With luxury homes in London and elsewhere, lavish parties and generous charitable donations, the Hindujas have enjoyed the trappings of wealth. They have been photographed with celebrities ranging from Lady Thatcher and Mr George Bush to Mrs Indira Gandhi. They make gifts to Cambridge and Harvard Universities and to Indian hospitals. But, until now, they have said little publicly about the enterprises from which they make their money. Last month, the Hindujas said they wanted to talk more openly about their businesses, because they planned to engage more in public commercial activities - such as running listed companies, tapping the capital markets, and, possibly, launching a bank. They have already invested in publicly-quoted companies in India, and may consider similar moves in other countries, including the UK and the US. Mr Srichand Hinduja, the group chairman and head of the family, told the FT: 'If we give away how we trade, we give away secrets . . . We don't talk about our business so people have this (sense of) confusion.' But the group now felt it should give out more facts. Sitting in a villa in Delhi with silk carpets at his feet, Mr Hinduja talked freely about world politics, the global economy and the value of Indian scientific traditions. Mr Hinduja gave glimpses of a group which employs 16,000 people, mainly in India, Iran, the Gulf states, Switzerland, the UK and US. He described activities ranging from fund management and project finance to trading potatoes. He declined to give figures for revenues, profits or assets, though he did not dispute estimates which put the family's wealth at above Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.54bn). Mr Hinduja puts down to political vindictiveness accusations against a family member in India's Bofors scandal, in which the Swedish arms maker was alleged to have paid bribes to secure a gun contract. The family comes from Sind, the fertile coastal province in present-day Pakistan, which is an ancestral home for many Indian merchant families. The Hindujas are devout Hindus, vegetarians, teetotallers and non-smokers, who have made their fortunes primarily in the Moslem world. Mr Srichand Hinduja's father moved from Sind to Bombay in 1914 and started trading textiles, dried fruits and other goods with Persia. The family later migrated to Tehran and stayed until just before the fall of the Shah in 1979. In Iran, the family traded goods such as fertilisers, cement, oil, metals and textiles. They made contact with the Shah's family and profited greatly when the 1974 oil shock pushed up oil prices and launched the Shah on a huge import buying spree. The Hindujas invested in electricity transmission towers, property and investment banking. They made money from films - buying the Iranian rights to Indian films and dubbing them in Farsi. This venture was so successful that they later named one of their trading companies Sangam after a top-selling romantic drama. After leaving Iran, Mr Srichand Hinduja and his three brothers - Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok - spread across the world to build a global trading network and to diversify their political connections. Mr Srichand Hinduja, now 58, moved to London, where he oversees the group from his main office in New Zealand House, in Haymarket. Mr Gopichand Hinduja, aged 53, also lives in London and is responsible for project finance and trade, including the group's continuing business with Iran, which survived the family's departure from Tehran. The third brother, 48-year-old Mr Prakash Hinduja, lives in Geneva, home of the group's financial services business. The fourth, 43-year-old Mr Ashok Hinduja, lives in Bombay, where he runs the group's fast-growing Indian operations. Of the group's 16,000 staff, some 2,000 work outside India. The main trading companies are Sangam in London, Alcari in Switzerland and France, HBI in the US, and Beromat in Germany. The group's most visible operation is Gulf Oil Trading, an oil trader and manufacturer of lubricants, which the Hindujas bought in 1984 from Chevron of the US. In 1990, the lubricants business was transferred into a joint venture with OMV, the state-owned Austrian oil company. The Hindujas retained full ownership of the trading operations. Financial services are organised in Amas, a Swiss-registered company, which manages funds, says Mr Hinduja, 'for high net-worth clients mostly from the oriental world'. Amas has joint ventures with Credit Anstalt of Austria, Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, and a fund management subsidiary of Jardine Matheson, the British-owned trading company. It also has a co-operation agreement with Morgan Stanley, the New York investment bank. In India, the Hindujas' biggest single investment is a controlling stake in Ashok Leyland, a leading bus and truck maker, which the family bought in partnership with Iveco, a Fiat subsidiary, in 1987 for about Pounds 30m. The partners are now investing about Rs15bn (Dollars 476.2m) in modernisation. Hinduja companies are also involved in a Rs30bn scheme to build a thermal power station in central India; plans for a Rs33bn oil refinery; and a joint bid with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications company, for cellular telephone services. But these last three projects have still to materialise. Mr Srichand Hinduja says the group has delayed its investments in India because it disliked operating in the heavily-regulated economy which preceded recent liberalisation. Mr Hinduja welcomes the widespread economic reforms started by the late Rajiv Gandhi and prime minister PV Narasimha Rao. He says he is 'very optimistic' about India's economic future. The country has manufacturers of 'world-class standard' and 150m-200m people capable of buying 'world-class goods'. Mr Hinduja is not put off by the inter-religious unrest which followed the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Similar conflicts exist elsewhere, he says. In India such tensions tend to cool down. The cloud of the long-running Bofors scandal still hangs over the Hinduja family in India, as it does over others in business and politics. The affair broke in 1987 when allegations emerged that the Bofors company had paid bribes to secure a SKr8.4bn (Dollars 1.13bn) howitzer order. Suspicions were raised that the beneficiaries might have included Mr Rajiv Gandhi. India's Central Bureau of Investigation, which is probing the affair, has not found any evidence implicating the late prime minister. But, in a prosecution report filed in 1990, the CBI named 14 people and companies in a case of alleged corruption. Among the accused is Mr Gopichand Hinduja. In pursuit of its case, the CBI is requesting details of bank accounts from the Swiss authorities. Mr Srichand Hinduja's name appears in a court list of people seeking to block the release of the Swiss documents to India. The Federal Court, Switzerland's top court, is due to decide the matter later this year. Mr Srichand Hinduja says the family 'had nothing to do with the sale of the Bofors guns', and that the allegations stem from the 'vindictiveness' of his political enemies. He insists that neither in India, nor in Iran nor anywhere else has the family dealt in arms. The Hindujas feel accusations of involvement in nefarious deals stem from ignorance of their trading skills. 'The secret is that we have diversified in-house strengths,' says Mr Srichand Hinduja. Overheads are kept low. The group does not borrow. Transactions are kept secret until they are complete for reasons of competition but, once finished, the information becomes known in the trading community. 'We operate in many fields and can match our knowledge of transactions with our knowledge of countries,' he says.</p>

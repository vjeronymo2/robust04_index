			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk after </F> officially opening a new factory to produce banknotes in Kiev on  22 March -- recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] If we have foreign money, our  bank headed by Viktor Andreevich [Yushchenko] will become a  branch of the Russian Central Bank. This is normal, we should  not blame the Russian Bank; this is a normal agreement. If you  are going to introduce the ruble, you have to become a branch.  Then, the newly elected deputies will gather in the Supreme  Council and will have to adopt decisions concerning their money,  on [words indistinct], taxation and they will be told that this  does not correspond to the interests of the Russian National  Bank. This is normal. Therefore, under these conditions, the  people will be allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will  not be allowed to adopt (?independent decisions). Therefore, we  -- myself, the prime minister, and the National Bank chairman --  are here to stress that this is a symbol of our independence.  If you hear talk about something else, this is only a deception  and represents an attempt to swindle the people. I do not want  to focus your attention on this particular aspect, but money,  finances, and banks are symbols. When reforms begin -- well,  they have already begun -- [words indistinct] in Ukraine will  set up our own banking system.</p>

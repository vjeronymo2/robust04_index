			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Intel overtakes rivals in integrated circuit sales TWO OF Europe's leading semiconductor manufacturers fell behind Intel, the US company, in sales of integrated circuits to the European market last year, according to an annual rankings list released today by Dataquest, the market research company. Intel overtook both Siemens of Germany and SGS-Thomson, the French group, to become the second largest supplier last year after Philips Components, the Dutch group, in the European market for ICs. However, in the total European semiconductor market - which includes devices such as micro controllers and opto-electronic components - all three European manufacturers retained their positions as the top three suppliers to Europe. Philips led the rankings followed by Siemens with SGS-Thomson coming in third. But Intel beat Texas Instruments (TI), another US group, to fourth place. TI is the European leader in bipolar standard logic technology, a sector which fell 13 per cent last year. Intel, which is the leading manufacturer of microprocessor chips, saw the strongest growth among the top 10 semiconductor companies in Europe, of 22 per cent in dollar terms. This compares with 6.6 per cent growth for the European semiconductor market to Dollars 11.37bn (Pounds 6.2bn) on a dollar basis and 10.3 per cent to Ecu9.29bn (Pounds 6.57bn) as measured in European currency units. The US group's achievement stemmed from its strong hold on the European market for IBM compatible microprocessors, where it enjoys a 35 per cent market share. Intel's strength was underpinned by the move last year by computer manufacturers to higher performance and higher priced microprocessors, a sector in which Intel enjoys a strong lead. Microprocessors were not hit by price erosion as in other sectors of the market. Europe's top three semiconductor manufacturers, on the other hand, experienced sluggish growth in 1991 as the main markets they supply were hit by recession. All three European manufacturers suffered from a heavy dependence on markets which declined last year. In worldwide semiconductor market share, the Japanese companies retained the top three slots, with NEC taking an 8.5 per cent market share followed by Toshiba with 8.2 per cent and Hitachi with 6.7 per cent. Their strength was supported by resilience in the Japanese consumer electronics market, particularly in camcorders.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      EUROPEAN SEMICONDUCTOR RANKINGS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Preliminary estimates                           1990    1991    1990       1991        1991                           rank    rank    sales      sales      market                                           dollars m  dollars m  share %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Philips                     1      1      1,155      1,172      10.3 Siemens                     2      2        964        958       8.4 SGS-Thomson                 3      3        908        887       7.8 Motorola                    4      4        765        770       6.8 Intel                       5      5        622        760       6.7 Texas Instruments           6      6        637        629       5.5 Toshiba                     7      7        490        509       4.5 NEC                         8      8        417        452       4.0 National Semiconductor      9      9        408        408       3.6 Hitachi                    10     10        273        318       2.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Dataquest  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

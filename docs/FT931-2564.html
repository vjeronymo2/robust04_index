			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Six face arrest in Efim fraud inquiry ROME magistrates yesterday issued six arrest warrants in connection with a fraud inquiry into the activities of the finance subsidiaries of Efim, a state holding company which was placed in liquidation last July. The six included Mr Giuseppe Carrapico, a well-known Rome businessman and owner of Rome football club, and Mr Mauro Leone, the son of the former Italian president Giovanni Leone and former deputy chairman of Efim. The arrest warrants were based on a string of fraud charges related to the activities of Efim's financial services arm, Nuova Safim and its factoring and leasing subsidiaries, Safim Factor and Safim Leasing in which BNL, the state-controlled commercial bank, had a minority state until 1991. The charges centre on alleged irregular leasing contracts for old people's homes and health clinics, as well as alleged false billings for the supply of equipment and services. The investigation came to light last September, shortly after Efim had been placed into liquidation with debts that are now known to be close to L18,000bn (Pounds 8.21bn). Safim Factor and Safim Leasing have subsequently been placed in liquidation as a result of the fraud enquiry. The extent of losses suffered by Nuova Safim as a result of the fraud has not been disclosed but it is understood to have been considerable. At the same time yesterday, the Italian parliament agreed to waive the immunity of three deputies from Naples accused of vote-buying in last April's general election. The three are Mr Francesco Di Lorenzo, the Liberal who resigned last month as health minister, Mr Alfredo Vito, a Christian Democrat party boss and Mr Giulio Di Donato, the leading Socialist in Naples. Both the latter two deputies were yesterday advised they were under investigation for alleged kick-backs in the privatisation of Naples rubbish collection.</p>

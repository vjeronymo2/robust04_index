			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / The Property Market: Doing it the Coin Street way London's least conventional property development occupies one of the capital's most promising sites: a sweeping bend of the Thames with magnificent views stretching from Parliament to St Paul's. Tucked in between the towering offices of IPC and Sea Containers House on one side and the grey hulk of the Royal National Theatre on the other, is a complex comprising a park, low-rise housing, off-beat craft shops and restaurants. Its centrepiece is a South Bank landmark, a tower with intricate motifs spelling out the word Oxo - a reminder of the days when the tower was a distribution centre for meats products including Oxo. Beneath the motif flaps a banner with the words: 'GLC working for London. Welcome to Coin Street. Homes and Jobs. A community victory.' This relic of the long-gone Greater London Council fluttering atop an apparently derelict building continues to attract attention from developers jealously eyeing what is undoubtedly one of London's best sites. For sure, the 5.5 hectare site is accustomed to attracting attention. In the late 1980s, it was the subject of a controversial and bitterly-fought planning battle. After two public inquiries, property developers Greycoat, which wanted to build 1m square ft of office space on the site, threw in the towel in 1984. The site was then sold by the GLC to a co-operative of community builders - the Coin Street Community Builders (CSCB) - for Pounds 1m, perhaps half its value, just days before the Tory government acted to curb spending by the GLC before its eventual abolition soon after. Instead of office blocks, the new owners let it be known that the site would be used for parks, affordable housing and workshops Nearly a decade on, Coin Street and its relationship with the rest of the South Bank is at a turning point. Stamford Wharf, the building that bears the Oxo tower, is to be redeveloped. By autumn 1993, Coin Street Community Builders hope to turn Stamford Wharf into a complex of cafes, restaurants, performance and exhibition spaces, rented housing and craft workshops. The developers hope to produce a genuinely mixed-use development for Stamford Wharf, ensuring that the vitality of the area does not ebb away in the evenings and at weekends. The Coin Street developers say they have secured the necessary Pounds 20m of funds from a mix of public and private sources and contracts have already been put out to tender. If the scheme does proceed to plan, it will be be a notable achievement in an area where other regeneration plans - the South Bank arts centre for instance - are on hold, victims of the recession. The aim of all developments in the area has been to enhance the South Bank, for long the poor relation of the north side of the Thames. The siting of County Hall and later, the Festival of Britain, on the South Bank were previous attempts to correct the imbalance. Indeed, Coin Street was originally mooted to reverse the area's declining residential population, which shrank from 50,000 in the 1930s to 5,000 by the 1970s, the consequence of floods, bombing, the disbandment of wharfs and relocation of industry. Coin Street has been the subject of planning arguments since the early 1970s when Heron Corporation proposed building Europe's tallest hotel on the site. A combination of developers' ambition and neighbouring councils' high rates and insistence on socially desirable but financially unviable schemes blighted the area for years. Local residents set up in 1977 the Coin Street Action Group, having earlier established a housing association to make available low cost housing. CSCB decided from the outset to develop the site in phases. Instead of hiding the development sites behind corrugated iron, it put the land into temporary use as parks and car parks. The most imaginative temporary project is Gabriel's Wharf, where the developers erected garages, painted a backdrop of mock Georgian facades and installed craft workshops. Work on redeveloping Stamford Wharf is due to start in the summer. Thereafter, a plot of land near Waterloo has been earmarked for housing and an exhibition centre. Clearly the action group - which includes printers, pensioners, a docker, a deliveryman and a telephonist - is doing it its own way. 'Coin Street: There is another way . . . ' is CSCB's slogan - a reference to the character, mix and management of the developments. To bring the 'alternative' nature of the project home, the riverside park has been renamed after one of the area's doughtiest campaigners against office development. 'London needs another office block like it needs another plague,' reads a poster in the community group's headquarters. Yet the community group's opposition to the development of more offices in London, which it argued passionately in the public inquiries of the early 1980s, is misguided. Contrary to CSCB's predictions, an acute shortage of modern offices arose in London in the mid-1980s. However, the virtues of the Coin Street scheme are only too apparent. Plastering London with office blocks has been shown to make little sense. Mr Iain Tuckett, Coin Street's company secretary, says the Coin Street experience shows that there is huge scope for community groups to determine the kind development they want in their area. 'The private market will do what is most profitable, that is its job. The public sector will fill in the worst gaps. There is a huge middle area,' he says. He maintains that the Coin Street activists, far from being woolly-headed idealists, have succeeded where others failed. 'No one else could persuade local authorities, government and banks to chip in. The public and private sector could not do it for 30 years,' he says. But the notion that Coin Street is blazing a trail that could be widely followed is probably wrong. The area had extraordinary advantages. With GLC backing, the group was able to buy the site cheaply, covering its interest costs from income from the car parks to the back of the South Bank. As well as providing comfort for its bankers, this income has allowed the group to subsidise its housing programme. Also, proximity to one of the most famous art complexes in Europe gives a huge boost to local shops and restaurants. Yet despite its alternative image Coin Street's approach has more in common with other developers than might be expected. Mr Tuckett says that the experience of two inquiries and constant surveillance of developers' plans taught CSCB some of the tricks of a developer's trade. Certainly the absence of the profit motive creates an important difference between Coin Street and other developers, says Mr Tuckett. But a profit-free environment hardly makes the Coin Street developers a soft touch, says Mr Tuckett. 'We are commercial; we have to be commercial,' he adds.  ------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  -------------------------------------------------------------                     Retail  Office  Industrial  All Properties  ------------------------------------------------------------- Year to April 92     -1.0    -13.4      -0.9        -5.9 Quarter to April 92  -0.2     -3.9      -1.7        -1.9 Month of April 92    -0.1 -    1.0      -0.5        -0.5  ------------------------------------------------------------- Investment Property Databank  -------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: British Syphon suffers margin pressure and lower interest income LOWER interest received and pressure on margins hit British Syphon Industries, the industrial group, in the first half of 1993. It reported a 13 per cent decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.3m, against Pounds 2.62m. Mr Brian Morrall, chairman, poured cold water on talk of an end to recession in the short term. BSI had not seen 'any material change in the economic climate'. In fact, the outlook remained uncertain with one of BSI's largest markets in Germany. Group sales were 11 per cent lower at Pounds 17.6m, depressed by the disposal of two businesses which contributed sales of Pounds 2.88m to the comparable turnover of Pounds 19.7m. Operating profits of continuing operations were 13 per cent down at Pounds 1.27m (Pounds 1.46m). Interest revenue fell by 33 per cent to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.5m). Earlier this month BSI paid a special dividend of 62.35p, as a way of distributing the bulk of its Pounds 33m cash mountain, leaving net cash of Pounds 11m. An interim dividend is not being paid against 2p last time. Mr Morrall said failure to reach agreement with Britannia, its 69.39 per cent parent, over a suitable acquisition had resulted in the special payment. Earnings per share were 0.2p lower at 4.5p. Newton Mill, the property management company owned by BSI, lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 16,000 to Pounds 52,000 in the six months ended June 30. Turnover improved to Pounds 75,000 (Pounds 40,000). After tax of Pounds 17,000 (Pounds 5,000) earnings per share worked through at 4.4p against 1.4p.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Well equipped for investment Sir, Once again the leading UK industrial associations are pressing a case for better fiscal incentives to stimulate investment ('Industry leaders press Clarke for investment Budget', October 10). In doing so they point to the lower investment levels in the UK relative to most other industrial countries in the past 30 years. This is a correct observation. Gross domestic fixed capital formation as a proportion of gross domestic product in Britain averaged 18 per cent over the period 1960-89, when compared with the OECD average of 22 per cent. However, all of this shortfall was a result of lower levels of investment in UK residential and non-residential construction. Investment in equipment and machinery as a proportion of GDP averaged 8.5 per cent over this period, compared with an OECD average of 8.7 per cent, and 8.8 per cent in France and 8.6 per cent in Germany. Thus, there has been no dramatic shortfall in the UK in the volume of equipment investment. Yet it is higher equipment investment which is usually postulated as being most likely to make a contribution to higher long-run productivity growth. This is the variable favoured by the 'new growth economics' currently popular with the Labour leadership, and by the industry associations. There may indeed be a case for looking again at the tax system to see if there are any biases against equipment investment. However, the level of equipment investment is not obviously the area where Britain has trailed significantly in recent decades.

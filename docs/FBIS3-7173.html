General Pol Saroeun, Phnom Penh's deputy chief of general  staff, said Khmer Rouge guerrillas were staging attacks  elsewhere to try to draw government forces out of Pailin.    "But we are not so stupid to do that. We have to maintain  Pailin forever," he said.    To hold the former rebel headquarters in northwest Cambodia,  he said, 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the old main road into  Pailin had to be cleared of the jungle overgrowth and mines  which had left it impassable for years.    "Soldiers have already started to clear the road from  Chireang to Pailin and the work should be finished within a  week," the general told AFP.    Pol Saroeun said access to Pailin via the stretch of former  National Route 10 through what had been Khmer Rouge-held  territory was essential so that fresh troops, supplies and heavy  weaponry could be sent in to secure the town.    The access would also help thwart any Khmer Rouge  counter-attacks, he said.    Government reinforcements, supplies and weaponry are now  taken in by truck over a muddy jungle track which snakes around  hills and mountains for some 30 kilometers (20 miles) in a  journey that can take up to three days.    The general admitted the unusually heavy rains in the past  few days were creating difficulties for government forces.    Two soldiers were killed and one wounded when a tank they  were travelling on hit an anti-tank mine Tuesday as [words  indistinct] to bypass the bogged-down traffic on the road.</p>

The  ruling was made following a plea of the defence to suspend the  implementation of Zhivkov's seven-year jail sentence passed by  the Supreme Court.    The defence cited the convict's age and health, as well as  the complicated range of issues tackled in the criminal action,  disputed according to Zhivkov's lawyer, Daniela Dokovska, not  only by the sides to the case. Prosecutor Krasimir Zhekov  described the motives of the defence as insubstantial and  insisted that the sentence be carried out.    After hearing the sides, the Criminal Divisions of the  Supreme Court decided to suspend the implementation of the  sentence until the Supreme Court has made a supervisory review.    The seven-year jail sentence passed by the Supreme Court on  the former head of state and the Communist Party, who ruled for  35 years, took effect on January 13, 1994, after an appeal with  a second-instance panel of the Supreme Court, chaired by Melkon  Melkonyan. Zhivkov pleaded for a supervisory review.    Zhivkov, 83, was convicted to seven years in prison and made  to restore 21 million leva (some $600,000), on charges of  exceeding powers and sharing out public funds and apartments  among top aides. A week ago the Prosecutor General's Office  postponed the execution of the sentence for two months, citing  the ex-dictator's age and health.    Zhivkov is a defendant in the case of granting public funds  in aid to communist movements and parties in the Third World and  in the case against the culprits in the 1980's campaign to  assimilate Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.</p>

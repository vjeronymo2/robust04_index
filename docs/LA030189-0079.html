			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. ARTISTS PACK 1ST MEETING ON CITY'S $20-MILLION ENDOWMENT  </P> <P> In an unusually strong show of local art world activism, a standing-room-only  crowd of artists packed a theater in Hollywood Monday night to voice concerns  over how the new $20-million Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts is spent.  </P> <P> Clapping and cheering, about 350 artists and arts administrators -- sitting in  the aisles and leaning against the walls -- gathered at Barnsdall Park's  Gallery Theatre for the first "town meeting" of the Los Angeles Arts Congress.  </P> <P> The congress is an ad hoc organization formed by local artists to involve the  arts community in shaping the endowment, a $20-million city arts program slated  to be fully operational in about a year. City officials are now developing  endowment guidelines through various studies and by attending such meetings as  Monday's.  </P> <P> "I haven't (ever) seen this many people for an event like this," said Los  Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs, who conceived of the endowment, designed to  benefit all disciplines, cultures, large and small groups and independent  artists citywide. "I guess that's what happens when you have $20 million to  give out."  </P> <P> Monday's multi-ethnic crowd, even bigger than the one that jammed City Council  chambers last November for the endowment's passage, was clearly grass roots,  composed mostly of independent artists and administrators from small arts  groups.  </P> <P> Lining up to speak at an "open mike," 52 people urged Wachs, Al Nodal (general  manager of the city's Cultural Affairs Department and chief endowment  administrator) and other officials to use endowment funds for everything from  inner-city youth arts programs to affordable dance, music and theater venues,  to psychiatric counseling for artists.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see some of this money used to set up theater programs all around  the inner city for young people," said actor Orlando Bonner. He and others said  the traditionally "undersupported" black arts community should receive more  funds.  </P> <P> "We want to make sure that the endowment guidelines are set up to include women  and make sure they are fairly represented," said Jean Towgood, president of the  Southern California Women's Caucus for Art.  </P> <P> "The Wallenboyd Theatre and Variety Arts Center have gone under," said Brent  Morris of the Rough Theater, echoing numerous concerns about affordable  performance and exhibition venues. "The city needs to take a lead in keeping  organizations like these in operation."  </P> <P> "So many of the poets in L.A. publish their own collections," said Carrie  Etter, one of several poets who spoke up for support for poetry publishing  houses and publications.  </P> <P> Bemoaning what a colleague called the "virus of isolation endemic to Los  Angeles," performance artist Tim Miller urged support for programs that  encourage an "intercultural" community that fuses the city's diverse cultures  and communities.  </P> <P> "It's not enough to fund black theater, Latino theater and gay and lesbian  programs" separately while "keeping us in our own little fiefdoms," Miller  said.  </P> <P> And decrying a lack of comprehensive medical insurance coverage for artists,  born of a national "lack of respect" for art, actress Veronica Redd said to  some laughter and loud applause: "I need counseling and I think every artist in  this country needs counseling, but (my) insurance will not cover counseling."  </P> <P> Nodal and other city officials have repeated publicly that the endowment is  designed to support many of the projects and areas of concern addressed at the  three-hour meeting. But Nodal, who took notes during the session, said he is  "committed to working with groups like this on an ongoing basis." At least two  other meetings to discuss the endowment, organized separately from the Los  Angeles Arts Congress, have been scheduled during March.  </P> <P> A planning session to arrange the next general meeting of the arts congress has  been scheduled for 8 p.m. Wednesday, April 5, at Gorky's Cafe, 536 E. 8th St.,  downtown Los Angeles. It is open to anyone but an R.S.V.P. is necessary: (213)  221-4094.  </P></p>

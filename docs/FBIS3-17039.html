			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 461] </F>   [Text] Vilnius, March 21, ELTA -- Chairman of Debt  management department of the Ministry of Finance Ruta Skyriene  has partly confirmed the last-week statement of Prime Minister  Adolfas Slezevicius which said "rendering of credits to  Lithuania were suspended".    Skyriene said until there was some dimness in the system of  Lithuanian banks, credits are suspended but not cancelled.    Workers of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank  Vilnius bureaus confirmed the information. Head of World Bank  Baltic states subunit Vilnius department Ramune Zabuliene said  the bank "did not suspend any project" and added that  "implementation of the project of restructuring of enterprises  and financial sector is being protracted".    Skyriene said until new banking laws corresponding to  international standards are not approved, process of  bankruptcies is not actually realized and a prospect of Currency  Board remains vague, problems with credits may remain.    Statements of the economic memorandum oblige the government  to present the parliament laws of Central bank and commercial  banks, to change law of bankruptcies and to present the law "On  the creation of a specialized bankruptcy court". Such a court  should be established before transferring the second part of EEC  loan.    Officials of international institutions are not directly  linking the suspension of credits with creation of the Currency  Board. IMF is interested not in the Currency Board itself but  in the results of the reforms, and inflation rate -- first of  all, as it now exceeds the allowed level.    Up to March 21, international institutions have lent  Lithuania 454 million U.S. dollars, 292 million of them have  been already used.</p>

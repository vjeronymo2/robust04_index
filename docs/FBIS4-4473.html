			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 1 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe on Friday [1  April] discussed shared concerns over North Korea's alleged  nuclear weapons development program, a Japanese Foreign Ministry  official said. Calling on Hosokawa at his official residence,  Juppe confirmed French concerns about Pyongyang's refusal of  full international inspections of its nuclear sites, suspected  of being used to produce nuclear weapons, the official said.    Juppe, who arrived in Tokyo on Thursday for a four-day stay,  did not touch on Japan's aspirations to win a permanent seat on  the United Nations Security Council, the official said. The  French foreign minister voiced support on Thursday for Tokyo's  bid to enter the council as a permanent member when meeting with  his Japanese counterpart, Tsutomu Hata.    Juppe's visit is his third since assuming his post in April  1993. He visited Japan last April to attend a Group of Seven  (G-7) joint ministerial meeting and in July to attend the summit  meeting of leaders of the seven major economic powers.    The visiting minister reportedly sought further expansion of  bilateral political, economic and cultural exchanges and  beefed-up two-way visits of political leaders between the two  countries.    Juppe also conveyed to Hosokawa French Prime Minister  Edouard  Balladur's invitation for him to visit France.    Hosokawa did not make any particular response, the official  said. But government sources said that Hosokawa is likely to  visit three European nations -- Italy, France and Germany -- in  early May.    Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, told  Juppe in a separate meeting that Japan will continue to observe  the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), denying it intends to  become a nuclear power. "Japan will stick to its three  non-nuclear principles in the future and will oppose to an  emergence of a new nuclear power," Aichi said, according to  Defense Agency officials.    Aichi made the remarks in response to an international  concern that Japan might go ahead with a program to develop  nuclear weapons if North Korea possesses nuclear bombs.    In reply to another question from Juppe, Aichi said Japan  has  no intention to build up defense capability to cope with the  tense situation on the Korean peninsula. "Functioning  effectively with the present self-defense capability and the  Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is the basis," for the stance, Aichi  said.</p>

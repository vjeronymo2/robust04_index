			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Before the New Year, Professor Jan Widacki, Polish  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania,  invited journalists to a press conference in which he tried to  dispel the myths about the allegedly unfriendly relations  between the Lithuanians and the Poles. According to the  ambassador, these myths are spread by some politicians and  reporters.    One of those myths is the opinion expressed in the  Lithuanian  press that Poland either had or has such political and social  groups that raise territorial claims to Lithuania.    The ambassador assured that this is not the case, and that  the Polish Government recognizes Lithuania's territorial status  quo.    Jan Widacki also expressed his surprise with the statements  that some "third party" is behind the issue of the registration  of the Home Army veterans' club in Lithuania. He ruled out the  proposal examined in the Lithuanian press that this club be  registered at some Lithuanian veterans' organization or function  within the framework of the Poles' Union.    To reduce such misunderstandings, the ambassador proposed  that journalists of both countries meet for seminars at least  twice a year.    In Jan Widacki's opinion, the journalists' duty is to dispel  myths which emerged in relations between the Lithuanian and  Polish nations rather than on the interstate level.</p>

			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Tories accused of 'betraying' jobless LABOUR launched a fresh attack on the government's record on jobs yesterday when it claimed that the Tories had failed to deliver 10,000 promised places on their Employment Action programme. The onslaught was a first shot in the opposition's promised summer offensive on the economy. It came when three members of the shadow economic team charged the government with a 'callous betrayal' of the unemployed. Labour said in a statement released by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that Mr Michael Howard, when employment secretary, had committed the government to finding work experience places for 60,000 people and to having 30,000 people on schemes at any time. Yet in May, two months after a target deadline had been passed, some 10,000 places had remained unfilled. 'In many constituencies there are as many as 10,000 people unemployed, with sometimes as few as 30 places on Employment Action available,' the statement said. It was also signed by Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, and Ms Harriet Harman, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.</p>

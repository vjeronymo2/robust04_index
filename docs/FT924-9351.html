			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Survey of Ireland (2): Cork is fighting back / A look at the second city WHEN the Culliton review group on industrial policy looked at Irish ports it found serious problems, expressed concern about competitiveness and recommended action. But the group bypassed Cork altogether - although the republic's second city has Ireland's most successful port. Complaints about being ignored are often dismissed as typical of the 'second city' syndrome. Yet the proposed designation of Cork as a Europort is a political football which has been kicked around fruitlessly for years. Just as there is an urgent need to improve the Cork-Dublin road, so there is a priority need, too, to improve the route from Dublin to Rosslare, Cork's competitor port. The view that Cork loses out to centralised decision-making in Dublin (particularly during the years when Charles Haughey led the Irish government) is widespread. Father Donal Linehan, parish priest of Mayfield, on Cork's poorer north side, is alarmed about large concentrations of people outside the labour force, and believes that for over 20 years the north side in particular has not benefited from national growth. Cork has lost its traditional industry base over the past 10 years. It is fighting back by capitalising on natural advantages such as Cork harbour, and the availability of a technically advanced and skilled young labour force. The Cork economy is heavily influenced by agriculture, but the 10 per cent increase in farm incomes this year is not matched by hopes of important expansion in 1993. This year the harvest was poor. High interest rates have brought widespread uncertainty, and consumers are not spending. 'A lot of people are just being very cautious,' observes George Mansfield, Allied Irish Bank's regional manager. 'But there have been quite a number of property deals, indicating confidence in the future.' Unemployment - intractable even in the good years - remains the big problem. The urgent need to deliver jobs fuelled local suspicions that chemical industries looking for new locations were pushing against an open door. Environmentalists lined up against industrialists during long public planning inquiries into a Merrell Dow proposal to build a factory on a greenfield site in east Cork, and the Sandoz plan to invest in Ireland's most expensive chemical plant at Ringaskiddy. Merrell Dow retains its planning permission but decided not to proceed. The Sandoz fire at Basle in 1986, which created an environmental disaster on the Rhine, contributed to an enormous negative public response when the Cork plant was first mooted. Sandoz mentioned Puerto Rico as an alternative location. Eventually planning permission was granted under conditions as rigorous as in Germany or Switzerland. Sandoz received 5,000 job applications on the basis of a plan which, if implemented, will ultimately employ 400 people. One advertisement for 40 operatives drew 1,800 applications. Sandoz is a company which the Cork Environmental Alliance (CEA) - which operates entirely on public support, with just one full-time staffer - continues to view with deep suspicion. Yet even here there is a sensitivity about the lack of jobs. 'We would like to see Ireland move in the direction of more jobs because of our environment, not in spite of it,' says Geraldine O'Brien of the CEA. 'We are not satisfied with the standards. Factories are not meant to produce smells. When they do the rate of prosecution is laughable - and the fines imposed are peanuts.' There is a shortage of research and information on the challenges to human health and the environment posed by the chemical industry in the Cork harbour area. 'We have laws and they are not enforced,' Ms O'Brien complains. Seven of the world's top 15 pharmaceutical companies now have operations centred in Cork or Munster. Most of these plants produce bulk chemicals for export (valued in 1991 at IrPounds 750-IrPounds 800m). Mr Neil Buckley, director-general of the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, points out that while the industry was establishing itself not one company closed down. 'The overall net picture is one of consistent growth in output and employment.' Other important newcomers are the computer and electronics industries. Apple Computers has its European manufacturing base in Cork. With over 1,000 people on the payroll, it is now the city's largest employer. There were shockwaves this year when Apple suggested that it might move printed circuit board manufacture to the far east. Cork's advantages in terms of just-in-time delivery and flexibility in manufacturing in a variety of languages averted the risk. The long-awaited decentralisation of the Central Statistics Office from Dublin to Cork, scheduled for next year, will be a significant move locally. The Industrial Development Authority (IDA) is anticipating the arrival of a Taiwanese electronics park at Ringaskiddy. Taiwan does not yet have a foothold in Europe, so this is a pioneering proposal. There was a hold-up in the granting of planning permission because of one objector, but this has now been resolved. The Gulf war reduced the number of visits from industrialists last year and, according to Barry Condron, the IDA regional director, its effects are still being felt. Visits undertaken by companies seeking a base in Europe show an increase this year, but decisions are likely to be delayed until there is an improvement in the market. Cork port benefited from strike problems at Dublin, but it has proved that it can attract shippers on its own merits. Free of industrial strife for the past 10 years, important rationalisation and investment programmes have made the port competitive and efficient. In the first nine months of this year, shipments topped 4.88m tonnes. Port authorities confidently expect a record-breaking 6.5m tonnes by the end of 1992. Brittany Ferries and Irish Ferries will each increase sailings next year, with services to Roskoff, St Malo, Cherbourg and Le Havre. This reflects the fact that more and more Europeans view Cork as the gateway to the west of Ireland - and road networks to the west are improving fast. Services will continue to improve, and in the next five years Cork port is planning investments in 12 projects worth over IrPounds 50m.</p>

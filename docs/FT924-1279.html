			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Tough rallying call on franc THE French franc weakened momentarily against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bank of France surprised some dealers by deciding not to change its official rates at the weekly repurchase operation, writes James Blitz. Foreign exchange dealing remained thin in the run-up to Christmas, and exchange rates fluctuated sharply. The dollar fell to a low of DM1.5445 from a previous close of DM1.5550. But upbeat US economic data later helped the US currency to rebound, leaving a rise of  3/4 pfennig on the day at DM1.5625. In New York it slipped back to finish at DM1.5575. The market's focus remained firmly fixed on the potential weakness of the French franc. In the European morning, the currency dipped below the FFr3.42 per D-Mark level, about a centime above its ERM floor, as dealers tried to anticipate what Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French prime minister, would say at a much-heralded news conference. In the event, Mr Beregovoy swore to maintain the current parity between the D-Mark and the franc and the currency appreciated to around FFr3.4150. The French and German central banks also helped to move the franc upwards by intervening in its support. But, once again, the amounts deployed were minimal. The decision not to raise the five to 10-day lending window later in the day surprised some dealers, and the franc again fell below FFr3.42, touching FFr3.4210. But it later improved to FFr3.4190, just marginally easier on the day. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank of America in London, said the French authorities should be well pleased by the way the day's events had gone. 'The onslaught on the currency, if it comes at all, may now only happen in the new year,' he added. However, others believe the pressures on the French currency will return unless France lifts rates. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economics analyst at Midland Global Markets, said the French authorities were playing 'a very dangerous game' by not raising rates. She claimed that a rise in official lending rates would have given the franc a sharp boost and could have quickly been reversed next week. 'Why would the Bundesbank want to come into the market and buy French francs through to next spring unless the French also show their commitment to tightening policy ?' she asked. The D-Mark remained strong against most currencies, helped by what was considered a hawkish monthly report from the Bundesbank. The Italian lira weakened to below L900 to the D-Mark, before finishing mildly down on the day at L898.7. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, helped to soften the impact of the report by issuing a statement later in the day saying that the French franc/D-Mark parity was inviolable.</p>

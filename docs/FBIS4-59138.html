			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 10 May (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first  Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's  Office for Political Affairs, has stated the need to broaden the  Middle East peace process to involve every track, particularly  the Syrian-Israeli track. Dr. al-Baz pointed out that  comprehensive and just peace will be achieved only if all these  tracks are included.    Dr. al-Baz made these remarks during a meeting here today  with a delegation of new heads of Israeli diplomatic missions to  several countries, which is visiting Cairo. He stressed that  Egypt is trying to overcome the obstacles obstructing the peace  process, particularly along the Syrian-Israeli track. Dr.  al-Baz explained to the delegation Egypt's position on various  Arab, African, and international issues.    Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David Sultan said the Israeli  diplomats wanted, before starting their new jobs abroad, to  learn Egypt's views on the peace process in the region and the  negotiations relating to this process. The ambassador noted  that the delegation's visit to Egypt will last three days.</p>

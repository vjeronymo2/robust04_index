			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: British Gas static after better second quarter - Regulatory squeeze on margins and OFT requirement hits UK supply activities ALTHOUGH the half year results of British Gas were little changed from the half-way point last year, the overall figures released yesterday masked a continuing change in the company's structure. As foreshadowed by a statement made at the time of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report last month, profits for the six months to June 30 on a historical cost basis were Pounds 634m compared with Pounds 637m a year earlier. That included a second quarter loss of Pounds 16m, a slight improvement on the corresponding quarter's deficit of Pounds 21m. The interim dividend remains unchanged at 6.4p. The result showed a fall in operating profit from UK gas supply from Pounds 809m to Pounds 742m because of the regulatory squeeze on margins and the Office of Fair Trading requirement that British Gas divest itself of a major portion of the industrial market. Mr Cedric Brown, the chief executive, said that 59 per cent of the firm contract market and 17 per cent of the market for customers using more than 2,500 therms a year was now in the hands of the competition. Mr Philip Rogerson, finance director, said that overall gas sales were down 2 per cent, but the result included a benefit of Pounds 36m attributable to the slightly colder weather in the UK over the period. Regulatory actions cost the company Pounds 140m in the first half through enforced loss of market share and price controls. Against this, overseas gas supply raised its contribution from Pounds 94m to Pounds 123m, and exploration and production rose from Pounds 112m to Pounds 196m. British Gas is now active in Argentina and Canada, and expects to sign a major contract shortly in Trinidad. Mr Robert Evans, the chairman, said that the relaxation of the price formula recommended by the MMC 'will do little to restore the profitability of the UK gas supply business. Even with the major rationalisation which we intend to implement, profits from that business will not reach the levels achieved in recent years, and the adverse effects will be felt by the company as a whole.' He said the investment programme, which totalled Pounds 2bn last year, would have to be reduced. However, he believed that the structure proposed by the MMC would introduce 'a measure of stability and clarity' to the industry. British Gas has already warned that the changes being forced upon it will result in the loss of 20,000 jobs over three years. So far this year, 3,000 have gone, bringing the total down to 79,284.</p>

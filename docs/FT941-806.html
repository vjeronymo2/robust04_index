			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Olivetti bid wins Italian telecoms licence The Italian government last night awarded the hotly contested licence for its new Europe-wide GSM standard mobile telecommunications network to a consortium led by the Olivetti computer group. The contract was awarded to the Omnitel-Pronto Italia consortium on the eve of the country's general election results. The losing consortium was Unitel, a joint venture led by Fiat and including Fininvest, the holding company of media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, Vodafone and BellSouth. The decision had been pending for several days but the timing of the Ciampi government's decision appeared linked to the likelihood of Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement being on the winning side in the elections. Omnitel-Pronto Italia won on technical grounds and by virtue of the higher fee that will be paid to the government - L750bn (Pounds 304m). The licence to run Italy's second mobile phones network, in competition with the Sip state telephone utility, which until now has held the monopoly, has been estimated as worth up to L4,300bn (Pounds 1.7bn) although the heavy investment required means profits are unlikely in the first few years of operation. Olivetti, which will provide 35 per cent of the investment by the winning consortium (grouping Bell Atlantic, Pactel and Mannesmann) needs to provide L200bn over eight years. Although Olivetti's board will ask shareholders for authorisation, if necessary, for a rights issue up to L1 trillion, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman, has ruled out a capital increase this year. Olivetti plans to use the licence as a key part of a new high-tech network to serve mobile phone and computer users. The company, which had net losses of L460bn in 1993, has sought increasingly to shift from unprofitable hardware into services. The contest was narrowed to two consortiums after two mergers between the original four applicants. The decision injects further pace into the restructuring of Italy's telecommunications industry following agreement to merge five network operators under the state-controlled Stet telecoms utility - itself due to be privatised this year. The cellular phones market is being opened up in Italy after pressure from the European Commission and rapid growth is expected. The total sales of Sip increased by 8.6 per cent last year to L23.4bn.</p>

			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / International Company News: Aegon lifts forecast after good nine months Aegon, the Netherlands' second-largest insurance group, reported a 19 per cent increase in third-quarter net profit to Fl 285m (Dollars 167m), from Fl 240m a year earlier, and said it was lifting its forecast slightly for full-year results. Aegon has not given a specific target for 1994 profit. The rise in the latest quarter takes results for the nine months to September to Fl 835.6m, up 13.4 per cent. Premium turnover in the first three quarters jumped by 45 per cent to Fl 10.74bn from Fl 7.41bn. Much of the increase was due to the first-time consolidation of Scottish Equitable Life in the UK. Without this factor, premium turnover would have risen by around 6.6 per cent. Aegon said it would be using a new method of accounting for capital gains and losses on share and property investments for its own account. The new calculations, which anticipate impending European Union regulations, would have 'positive implications' for the level of future dividends, it said.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Tour of world economy after the Berlin Wall Every successful human society works with a mixture of rules and spontaneous decentralised endeavours. You only have to go to any city shopping street to see stores driven by the profit motive and shoppers trying to gain the most for every pound or dollar or D-Mark they spend. You will also see traffic lights regulating the vehicles and policemen enforcing traffic rules - although the most important of the rules, such as driving on one side, do not depend mainly on coercion. But there will be no overall plan for the whole street and its activities. I have laboured the obvious to show that all-or-nothing arguments about markets versus planning or private versus public spending are inherently absurd. But there are reasons for preferring markets and private spending where there is a choice. One is freedom of choice by consumers, workers and investors. Another, more subtle one is that markets can make use of dispersed knowledge and discovery methods unavailable to a state planner. There is a different reason why writers like William Keegan, the Observer economics editor, have an inherent distaste for the market. This is that 'it brings out the worst in human characteristics'. Economists make a huge mistake in ignoring this moral dimension. I will readily concede that the gain motive is not the most beautiful on earth; but I have a prize for the first non-economist reader who can guess who wrote: 'It is better that a man should tyrannise over his bank balance than his fellow citizens; and whilst the former is sometimes denounced as being but a means to the latter, sometimes at least it is an alternative.' Such arguments were rudely terminated when the only developed system of 'real existing socialism' came crashing down with the Berlin Wall in 1989. (The system was never called by true believers Communism - that would only come when the state had withered away.) The Soviet downfall was a bitter pill for many western intellectuals. This is not because they were secret sympathisers, but because it became more difficult to talk of a Third Way between two extremes, one of which no longer existed. More specifically, it became more difficult to use terms like 'market forces' and 'capitalism' in a condescending way when the old Soviet bloc was crying out for them. Since then, the economic interventionists have recovered their nerve. The ex-Soviet countries have found their road to capitalism hard, while the capitalist economies have been suffering an unusually prolonged recession. Above all, the interventionists have taken heart from Clinton's election. In the UK, a Conservative prime minister has resurrected sectoral preference for manufacturing, is in danger of shunting backwards to generalised incomes policy by exhortation, and is also whipping up populist hostility to financial institutions, which could end up by prolonging the recession. These developments have given William Keegan the opportunity of a tract in favour of a much more managed form of capitalism. In The Spectre of Capitalism (Hutchinson, Pounds 16.99) he has provided a useful Cook's tour of the world economy before and after the Fall of the Wall. One cannot blame him for going to town on what the Left was quick to call capitalist 'triumphalism' and the disappointments it experienced. His favoured whipping boy is 'the US-IMF free market model', including its Czech and Hungarian followers. His own recommendations give pride of place to the German and Japanese models of capitalism over the Anglo-American variety, a return to Keynesian techniques and 'the rescue of the world trading order and the reinvigoration of the commitment to an orderly working of the international economic and financial system that characterised much of the 1945-73 period'. I can agree with the objective, although I wish the author would tell us a little bit more about how to achieve it. How in fact did Bretton Woods work? Nigel Lawson makes a powerful case in The New Conservatism - a 1980 speech reprinted at the back of his book The View From Number 11 and which is, despite its title, the best piece of political economy in the book - that the dollar standard of these years served as monetarism at one remove, until it was undermined by the inflationary financing of the Vietnam war. This is the case that Keegan has never answered, despite his personally generous review of Lawson's book. As for the trade side of the goal: surely the Uruguay Gatt round is an attempt to extend competitive market forces to an unprecedented range of goods and services - which is why the French farmers so hate it. But if Keegan wants to call the exercise international co-ordination, why quarrel? Where, however, I redraw the line is at Keegan's adulation of the Japanese and German models. If you are looking for any country that has experienced the succession of easy credit, inflated property values and debt overhang, it is Japan. The tables in this article, which are also in the statistical annexe in Lawson's book, suggest that, although Japanese growth rates have until recently been faster than elsewhere, there is a large catching-up element. Real output per head is much lower than in the US and slightly lower than in Europe. Even manufacturing productivity is well below American levels. Germany actually experienced slower productivity growth than the UK up to the peak of the last economic cycle. Much more important: the highly centralised and unionised German wage determination system was responsible for a wildly premature attempt to unify pay and social security levels in the two parts of the country - which had made unification so painful both for Germany and the rest of Europe. Not all good things go together; what Germany has to offer Europe is not its system of pay bargaining, but an independent Bundesbank intent on price stability. But I must be fair. Keegan's chapters on Japan and Germany are not starry-eyed; and the discerning reader can learn a lot. The problem is that someone who basically dislikes capitalism, but sees that socialism does not work, and is stronger on examples than analysis, will hanker for another country's version of capitalism - just as German radicals denounce anti-competitive bank domination of industry in their country. The Golden Age of the pre-1973 mixed economy was able to work as well as it did because inflation-blindness restricted real pay, the dollar standard restrained inflation and interest groups had not become as influential as they are today, especially in continental Europe. Ideological history is great fun. But I wish Keegan would look at the real obstacles in the way of going back to the soft Keynesianism of the postwar enlightenment, which go far beyond so-called extreme free-market writing.  ---------------------------------------------------------------- INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AND OUTPUT  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Indices of real GDP per worker  ---------------------------------------------------------------- UK 1979=100               UK      US         Japan     Germany    France  ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1963          70     126            35          68        69 1979         100     156            91         113       121 1983         100     152           100         113       122 1988         118     180           117         125       130  ---------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Summers, R and Heston.

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE FEEDING OF CATS AT CORONA DEL MAR  </P> <P> Concerning the story about the many "kitties" that are being fed at the Corona  del Mar cliff: not a good idea!  </P> <P> This kind of publicity only serves to encourage people who no longer want their  cat or kittens to dump them there.  </P> <P> Feeding these cats does not make a person kind. It only adds to the cruelty or  suffering for many of these animals.  </P> <P> Are any of these felines ever captured to administer the necessary vaccinations  so they will not suffer from common disease? When one of these cats becomes  very sick, it goes away and dies a slow death.  </P> <P> Those who feed the cats should be aware that not all of these cats get their  "fill." The most aggressive ones eat most of the food.  </P> <P> Yes, on the beautiful cliffs of Corona del Mar there is pain and there is  suffering.  </P> <P> ROSE HOSEA  </P> <P> Anaheim  </P> <P>  Rose Hosea is founder and president of Feline and Canine Friends Inc. in  Anaheim.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Andreatta and Berlusconi Clash </F> Swords"]    [Text] Rome, 14 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Foreign Minister  Beniamino Andreatta and media baron and political hopeful Silvio  Berlusconi clashed swords and exchanged insults today over the  electoral accord between Berlusconi's Forza Italia (Go Italy)  and the rightist National Alliance, headed by the neofascist  Italian Social Movement (MSI).    In an interview published at weekend, Andreatta, a Christian  Democrat, warned Berlusconi of the risk presented by an  electoral pact with the National Alliance. "I don't think Mr.  Berlusconi wants to play the role of Italy's Zhirinovskiy" he  said, adding how such an accord with the Right "would be  interpreted by the press and foreign governments as a most  dangerous sign of a 180-degree shift in Italy's foreign policy  and its international position."    In a reply to Andreatta's statements, Berlusconi today  issued  a statement in which he said "Instead of letting Italy's voice  be heard on the massacre in Bosnia, Andreatta is concerned with  letting the voice of his party be heard to attack, with an  uncivil and electoral tone, political opponents, seeking to  slander them in Italy and the world."    "In regards to his statements that I could be compared to  the  Russian demagogue Zhirinovsky, an authoritarian post-Communist  leader who has transformed himself into a liberal-democrat" the  Forza Italia leader continued, "I can reply only in the most  clear and obvious way: specialists in these kinds of  transformations are the old and new friends of Minister  Andreatta, the ex-communists who are wooed and cuddled by the  Christian Democrat Left, not by me."    Berlusconi went on to say how "My foreign policy, which will  be amply illustrated during the presentation of the Forza Italia  platform, is clearly European and firmly loyal to the historic  roots of the Atlantic Alliance. Anything else is small and  petty electoral propaganda, narrow-mindedness I would have  expected from the editor of L'UNITA (the daily of the Democratic  Party of the Left) and some of his zealous opinionists, not from  the chief of the Foreign Ministry, the most delicate ministry in  the government which should speak in the name of all citizens  and not just some of them."    Foreign Minister Andreatta was quick to reply to the Forza  Italia leader and, in turn, issued a statement in which he  argued "there is only one point in Mr. Berlusconi's rude reply  which merits being underscored: the total lack of any reply to  my question, as well as those by the foreign press, like THE  TIMES and HERALD TRIBUNE, on whether he felt is was more or less  compatible to have an alliance with those who support `historic  rights' over Istria and other territories."    "Mr. Berlusconi" Andreatta continued, "spoke instead about  other things. It's time he began to say something a little more  articulated than his television commercials, possibly without  having to wait for a new show to present his electoral platform."    The question of "historic rights" were those being  championed  by the MSI regarding the peninsula of Istria and the borders set  between Italy and the then Yugoslavia after World War II.    Andreatta had argued at the weekend how "the word `historic'  is an explosive expression in the mouth of any nationalist and  in Europe could provoke the same unease as that produced by the  German neo-Nazis when they speak of German Sudetenland or  Silesia."    Vladimir Zhirinovsky is the head of Russia's so-called  Liberal Democratic Party who put in a strong showing in the  recent general elections and who has alarmed observers in the  West with his visions for a Greater Russia, his threats to  employ weapons of mass destruction and support for Serb  extremists.</p>

The meeting, which lasted  more than an hour, took place at the initiative of People's  Deputies of Ukraine Volodymyr Terekhov and Serhiy Tsekov, ardent  supporters of Yuriy Myeshkov, the winner in the first round of  the presidential election in the Crimea. In the opinion of one  of the meeting's participants, who wished to remain anonymous,  the talk with President Kravchuk was not open in all respects,  because the plans of the Myeshkov supporters did not envisage  the presence at the meeting of other Crimean politicians, the  political opponents to the Republican Movement of the Crimea  (RRK).    Volodymyr Terekhov wanted to know whether Kiev was planning  to use force against the RRK and when Ukraine would begin to  combat terrorism in the Crimea. To the first question, Leonid  Kravchuk said no. As far as the second question was concerned,  he said the Ukrainian procuracy was already taking necessary  measures but that was a problem of power not only in Kiev, but  in Simferopol as well. The Ukrainian president said he had  nothing against Yuriy Myeshkov personally or against the  movement he heads. The president, however, stressed that all  the citizens and political forces in Ukraine, the Crimea  included, should abide by the laws of Ukraine. Leonid Kravchuk  spoke out against granting dual citizenship to the residents of  the peninsula.    In the opinion of a meeting participant who was interviewed  by the UNIAN correspondent, Kravchuk is well informed about  everything happening in the Crimea and in the entourage of  Myeshkov in particular. The people's deputy also believes that  the holding of the meeting was due, first and foremost, to the  uncertainty of Myeshkov and his team in their own strength.  "They did not want to win at the presidential election, because  they were not ready for this and now they do not know what to do  with this." He admitted that if Crimean residents learn about  the latest maneuvers of Myeshkov and his supporters, about their  refusal from the election promises (a referendum on the status  of the Crimea, secession from Ukraine, etc.) the second round of  the election scheduled for 30 January may fail to take place.</p>

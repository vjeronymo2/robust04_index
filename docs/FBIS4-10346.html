			<p>BFN     [Text] Brasilia -- The Brazilian Social Democracy Party  [PSDB] and the Liberal Front Party [PFL] on 6 April sealed an  agreement supporting the presidential candidacy of Senator  Fernando Henrique Cardoso (PSDB-Sao Paulo). In a meeting that  lasted all morning, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Luiz  Eduardo Magalhaes, PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies, made  progress in consolidating the alliance between the two parties  and seeking to find a PFL candidate for the vice presidency. In  another meeting, PFL President Jorge Bornhauser and Tasso  Jereissati established a schedule. At the beginning of May, the  two parties will hold simultaneous conventions to officially  report on their electoral ticket.    Despite having succeeded in ensuring an agreement to make  the  electoral alliance formal, the PSDB and PFL leaders did not  confirm Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' name as the vice presidential  candidate on Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket. Magalhaes is,  nonetheless, the candidate preferred by the PFL and by Cardoso  himself. In addition to the alliance, it also was decided on 6  April that two committees comprised of representatives from the  two parties will be created to draft a common government program.    Bornhauser explained: To avoid complaints about possible  differences in the program of each party, we decided to draft a  joint government program to last four years. This program's  pillar will be the resumption of development.    He believes that after sealing the agreement, the natural  tendency will be to gradually reduce the PSDB and PFL factions'  rejection of the alliance. The strategy now will be to seek new  partners for this front. According to Bornhauser, the initial  targets will be the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], the PPR  [Progressive Renewal Party], the PP [Popular Party], and the PL  [Liberal Party].    The wider the range the better, the PFL leader said.    One of the decisions made on 6 April was to hold the  regional  directorates responsible for eliminating the differences PFL and  PSDB members living in the various Brazilian states still might  have. Another proposal approved during the meeting was on  holding simultaneous conventions to officially announce the  PSDB-PFL ticket amidst huge celebrations. Two dates have been  suggested for the convention: 15 May or 22 May. Each party will  hold its convention separately as established by the law and, at  the end of these conventions, the two parties will get together  for a festive ceremony in which they will announce the electoral  ticket.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / PSBR reaches Pounds 11.3bn on fall in tax receipts THE FEEBLE state of the economy depressed government income and expenditure tax receipts last month, resulting in a higher-than-expected public sector borrowing requirement of Pounds 600m. The impact of the recession on the government's finances was masked by healthy privatisation receipts of Pounds 1.7bn from the second call on the sale of British Telecom shares. The July deficit, excluding privatisation receipts, was Pounds 2.2bn. This compares to a deficit of Pounds 200m in the same month a year ago. July's figure, released by the Central Statistical Office yesterday, brought the cumulative PSBR for the first four months of the 1992-93 financial year to Pounds 11.3bn, compared to Pounds 5.9bn in the same period last year. Excluding privatisation receipts, the cumulative total was Pounds 14.7bn. The second successive month of sluggish tax receipts means that the government's target for the PSBR of Pounds 28bn in 1993-93 is well out of reach, economists said. The Treasury's projections assume an increase of 13 per cent in receipts from value added tax this year. But VAT receipts were only Pounds 2.7bn last month, unchanged from the same month a year ago. The shortfall on VAT receipts alone is likely to be between Pounds 3.5bn and Pounds 4bn this year, according to Mr Simon Briscoe, economist at Midland Montagu, the investment bank. 'These figures are a clear sign of the economy's current difficulties and the pressures the government will face for the rest of the year,' he said. Midland Montagu expects the total PSBR for 1992-93 to be Pounds 33bn. The news came as little surprise to the markets, which were already aware that the PSBR will overshoot the government's target this year. Sterling ended the day at DM2.8125  - down half a pfennig from yesterday's close. This takes the pound even closer to its technical floor of DM2.778 within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System. Income tax receipts were also lower than analysts had expected, a further reason why the PSBR was larger than the market expectation of Pounds 400m in July. Total cash receipts were Pounds 18.3bn in July and Pounds 64.3bn in the first four months of 1992-93, 1.5 per cent down on the same four months a year ago. Total cash outlays were Pounds 19.1bn in July and Pounds 75.5bn in the first four months, up 8 per cent on a year ago. One good sign was the local-authority debt repayment of Pounds 100m in July, compared with a deficit of Pounds 600m a year ago. Mr Briscoe said this may suggest that the government's constraints on local authority spending are finally starting to bite.</p>

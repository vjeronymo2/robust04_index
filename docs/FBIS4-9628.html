			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B. Geroski: "Did Tirana `Turn its Back' on </F> Taci?"]    [Text] After several months of turmoil within the PDP  [Party for Democratic Prosperity] that resulted into a definite  split and separation of the leadership headed by Djeladin Murati  and the faction of Menduh Taci and Arben Djaferi, there appear  to have been no major events within this party for some time.  The PDP Central Assembly session of "continuity" and the  unexpected and easily banned Tetovo meeting of Taci's faction  did not point to any essential changes in the positions of the  two wings.  <H5>  Statement </H5>   Nevertheless, last week an event that can be seen as a  relevant change in the stance of official Tirana toward the PDP  took place. At the meeting with the CSCE head of mission in  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM],  Norman Anderson, Albanian President Sali Berisha stated he was  convinced that "with their participation in the government, with  the loyalty that they demonstrated to the coalition, and the  democratic methods that they have adopted for the consolidation  of their human and national rights, the Albanians will always be  the stability factor." In his discussions with Anderson,  Berisha reiterated the struggle for the consolidation of the  rights of the Albanians in Macedonia, for holding the census and  so on, however, the definition of their participation in the  government and the loyalty to the coalition as a factor of  stability in the state (a long termed goal of Albania) can be  seen as nothing but an implicit support to the delegate and  ministerial PDP elite.    There are speculations that this new stance of Tirana,  compared to the recent one by which it openly supported Taci's  faction, caused serious confusions within the ranks of the  faction. Now Tirana is moving Taci toward direct cooperation  with the government, urging him to take actions within the  institutional framework, which is totally opposite to the recent  statements of the faction's leader.    If we have accurately registered the symptomatic and  depressive words of the young Taci that he "has had enough of  policy," then we can explain them only in the context of the new  sounds arriving from Tirana. Namely, by everything that has  been stated so far by this self-conscious politician, it is now  really necessary to make a major in order to make the "big jump"  and chart a new political course.  <H5>  Determination </H5>   After the definite statement of the competent bodies related  to the "inheritance" of the PDP in favor of Murati's leadership,  it became clear that Taci's faction does not have a chance of  entering the elections unless it registers itself as a separate  (new) party. For the time being, the faction does not have the  will to do that, and even if it does, it will have difficulties  registering due to its party program. The only chance of  participation in the government and of making constructive  efforts for consolidation of the position of the Albanians in  Macedonia is by betting on the people of the  delegate-ministerial elite.    Of course, Tirana will not make such a turn around and  openly  support the present team of Albanian politicians involved in the  government (it is not out of the question, according to the  "hot-cold" system, that we can be once again surprised by them  if they give support to those who were, until only yesterday,  their disciples). However, Berisha has openly supported those  who participate and will participate in the government, probably  aware that Taci has no chance of winning.</p>

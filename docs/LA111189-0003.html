			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWILA G. REID, 94; STATE'S 1ST WOMAN SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT  </P> <P> Twila G. Reid, a pioneer educator for whom an Anaheim school, park and library  are named, has died in a Newport Beach hospital at the age of 94.  </P> <P> The Corona del Mar resident died Thursday of natural causes.  </P> <P> The first woman school district superintendent in California, she worked for 37  years in the Savanna Elementary School District in Orange County as a teacher,  principal and superintendent.  </P> <P> "I taught some of your brothers and sisters and I know many of your parents.  I'm so happy and proud to be here," she told children from the Twila Reid  School attending a 1973 groundbreaking ceremony for the 25-acre Twila Reid  Community Park. "I call it my park and my school."  </P> <P> Born Nov. 4, 1895, in Gleeten Hill, Pa. -- which was named after a family  member -- Twila Gleeten got her own elementary education in a one-room country  school. She later graduated from Edinboro University in Edinboro, Pa., and in  1917 married Paul G. Reid, who is now deceased, and moved to Orange County.  </P> <P> A dedicated citizen as well as educator, she was proud of voting in every  public election after women were given the vote by the 19th Amendment. After  her retirement in 1962, she served for many years as a polling place official.  </P> <P> She taught one year at the elementary school named in her honor.  </P> <P> She is survived by her son, Richard T. Reid of Whittier, daughter Eileene La  Barthe of Corona del Mar, two sisters and four grandchildren.  </P> <P> Services and interment will be at 11 a.m. Monday at Pacific View Memorial Park,  3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The family has asked that memorial contributions be made to the Reid School  Library Memorial Fund, 720 S. Western Ave., Anaheim.  </P></p>

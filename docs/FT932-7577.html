			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Lambeth criticised by auditor over Pounds 20m unlawful spending THE Labour-controlled London Borough of Lambeth has incurred unlawful expenditure of Pounds 20.2m in payments to one of its departments since 1988, according to a report published yesterday. Mr Paul Claydon, the district auditor, said that when the council finally allowed 'proper competition' for its highway contracts for the first time in July 1992, the winning bids were 29 per cent cheaper than those tendered by Lambeth's direct labour organisation. The council could have saved Pounds 5m by contracting out the work properly under the competitive tendering system during the period when the unlawful payments were made, the auditor's public interest report said. Mr Claydon is now considering whether to ask the High Court to order individuals to repay the money unlawfully spent. Examples of apparent 'deliberate manipulation' to the advantage of Lambeth's own workforce before 1992 included the withdrawal of a successful private contractor's tender in 1988 'after receiving threats', and the successful reduction of a bid by the direct labour organisation in 1986 after a private contractor had submitted a lower tender. More than Pounds 200,000 was paid out to the highway maintenance workers under a 'profit sharing' scheme without being authorised by councillors, the report said. Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, said the Department of the Environment would take action if compulsory competitive tendering requirements had been violated. This could involve closing Lambeth's internal organisation by forbidding it to tender for contracts. The DoE stressed that it would wait for Lambeth's detailed response before taking action, but Mr Redwood said: 'There is always a danger with authorities that don't treat financial control and discipline seriously that things will go from bad to worse.' The report also revealed that Pounds 173m was owed to Lambeth council in overdue rents, community charge, rates and other debts. The council last published its annual accounts on time eight years ago, while its financial health is 'fragile' following 17 separate public interest reports from district auditors in 14 years. Mr Andrew Foster, chief executive of the Audit Commission, which employs the district auditor, said the council had shown more vigour in the last year to improve its position but voiced concern that 'a number of deadlines have been missed'. The council said it was implementing 120 recommendations by the auditor for improved practice, and all allegations of malpractice would be referred to an independent inquiry conducted by Ms Elizabeth Appleby, QC.</p>

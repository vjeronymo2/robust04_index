			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / US real estate loans and S&amp;L curbs eased THE White House yesterday issued new regulations to ease lending conditions for real estate and to let 'well-capitalised' savings and loan institutions open branches in any US state. The Bush administration acted after both Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives had defied their leaders late on Wednesday by failing to approve Dollars 17bn in funding to liquidate bankrupt savings and loans bodies (known as thrifts) and pay off their depositors. The White House said the country 'can no longer afford to wait for Congress to act' on proposed legislation to allow inter-state branches. It claimed the authority to act unilaterally and said its moves would 'enhance the ability of banks and thrifts to make loans.' Under the new rules, the amount of capital that banks and thrifts must hold 'against conservatively underwritten loans for construction of pre-sold homes' is reduced. Also, the threshold for requiring licensed appraisals on loans secured by real estate is raised from Dollars 50,000 to Dollars 100,000. Mr Michael Waldman, director of Congress Watch, a citizens' group, said: 'The White House is using the regulatory apparatus as an arm of the campaign committee and the result will be huge tax-payer costs. It's a little injection of extra debt and looseness which makes you feel great at first, then there is a hangover.'</p>

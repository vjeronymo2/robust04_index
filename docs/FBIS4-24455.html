			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Work is progressing full  steam ahead on a new high-tech industrial belt along its  Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu expressway in north China.    The whole scheme is expected to be completed in about 15  years, according to a state plan.    This is one of the five high-tech belts so far planned in  the  country's coastal areas for the coming decades.    The others are located in the areas along northeast China's  Shenyang-Dalian expressway, east China's Shandong peninsula and  Suzhou and Wuxi city, and south China's Pearl River Delta.    At the eastern end of the expressway lies the Tianjin  development area and bonded zone, a hot spot for high-tech  investment from many world-known transnational companies.    Not long ago, the world's biggest enzyme producer invested  250 million U.S. dollars in a modern biological plant in the  development zone.    Midway along the expressway is arising the Wuqing  development  zone, another high-tech industrial park, covering an area of  24.8 square kilometers.    Approved by the state in 1991, the Wuqing zone is the site  of  114 foreign-funded joint ventures in electronics, biology, new  materials and new energy.    The Japanese-funded Tianjin Quartz Vibrator Company, built  in  the zone with an investment of five billion yen, went into  operation recently.    About 40 kilometers from the country's capital Beijing is  the  Langfang economic and technical development zone in Hebei  Province. The infrastructural facilities of the zone, including  transport, telecommunications and water and power supply  systems, have been completed.    It has attracted many governmental agencies and research  institutes which plan to build a number of advanced  technological projects and laboratories in the zone. Some of  the 16 foreign-funded joint ventures so far built in the zone  have gone into production.    At the western end of the expressway is the Beijing  development zone, which also has attracted a group of  international consortiums such as GE of the United States, JVC  of Japan and Bayer of Germany.    Within the three-square-kilometer first phase area of the  zone, more than 50 joint ventures have been built, involving 850  million U.S. dollars.    In addition, adjacent to the zone, an international  container  station and a goods transfer center have been built along with  the requisite customs office and commodity inspection bureau,  which facilitate procedures for imports and exports.    Started in 1988 and opened to traffic in September 1993, the  expressway is 142 kilometers long, linking Beijing to the port  city Tianjin.    The plan for developing the high-tech industrial belt  alongside the expressway was formulated by a group of Chinese  economists after a one-year investigation into the U.S. "Silicon  Valley" and expressway 128 in Boston.    Ma Qihui, an official with the Tianjin Commission of Science  and Technology, who participated in the economic belt planning,  said that the area boasts many advantages that will allow the  belt to boom.    She said that in Beijing and Tianjin there are more than one  hundred institutions of higher learning and thousands of  research institutes with an army of technical talents that  account for 37 percent of the country's total.    "This is the most distinct feature of the belt," he [as  received] said.    Analysts here believe that the rise of the industrial belt  will power regional economic growth. Its influence will be felt  throughout north China and even the whole country.</p>

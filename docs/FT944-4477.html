			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / After The VAT Vote: Teresa's troops are right behind their rebel MP The tea rooms and Tudor pubs of Billericay seem an unlikely hotbed of Conservative rebellion. At the very heart of Tory Essex, the prosperous commuter town returned Mrs Teresa Gorman to parliament with a 22,000 majority at the last election. But yesterday Billericay Tories were ready to show as much defiance towards government policies as their outspoken MP, who abstained in the crucial Commons vote on valued added tax. Mr Frederick Clewer, a member of Billericay Constitutional Club, said: 'I admire her actions. I think she has come alive recently, and most of the club members I have spoken to would support her on VAT. 'I do not believe that anyone should vote according to what the party says on a continuous basis. They should vote on how they feel.' Club members were unimpressed by reports last month that Conservative Central Office would disband the entire constituency party if they refused to deselect Mrs Gorman as the local candidate. Mrs Gorman was one of eight backbench MPs who lost the party whip after she abstained in the EU finance bill vote last week. Mr Peter Johns, a retired civil engineer, said: 'She came into the club on the Saturday after the European vote and I think she was largely supported. In economic terms, if you look at the quantity of VAT money out of an overall budget of Pounds 300bn, it is a very small amount. 'There are possibly other ways of raising the money without being unpopular.' Mrs Gorman seems to have improved her image among pensioners, whom the opposition claimed would be hardest hit by VAT on domestic fuel. In spite of an earlier pledge to support the government on the VAT vote, Mrs Gorman's rebellion is seen as a sign of her political integrity in Billericay. Mr Graham Johnson, a retired sales negotiator, said: 'People will stick by her because she has got the courage of her convictions. She has not got her sights set on promotion and is prepared to vote her own way. You have to respect that.' However, Conservative voters seem likely to return to the party whether or not Mrs Gorman survives the threat of deselection. Mr Richard Ward, a shipping sales executive, said: 'People vote for the party, not the person. The government is in a lot of trouble which it has to sort out - but there is plenty of time for that.' Mrs Gorman's rebellion won the backing of her local butcher, Mr David Bendall. 'I voted Conservative and she will get my support again. VAT on fuel is bad for the elderly and families with young children,' he said. 'Mrs Gorman . . . stands up for what she believes.'</p>

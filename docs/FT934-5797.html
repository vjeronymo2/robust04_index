			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / W German inflation falls The rate of inflation in west Germany fell for the fourth consecutive month and is set to dip below 3 per cent by the middle of next year, economists said yesterday. The cost of living in west Germany rose by 0.3 per cent this month, representing a year-on-year rise of 3.7 per cent. This is a sharp fall from July, when inflation reached a peak of 4.3 per cent, and from 3.9 per cent in October. Although the reduced inflation rate on the face of it encourages market hopes of a further rate cut, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president, warned yesterday that the current inflation rate was unsatisfactory. He said the Bundesbank would only deliver further cuts in interest rates if this did not conflict with the institution's main objectives of maintaining monetary stability and preserving the value of the D-Mark. The publication of the data and Mr Tietmeyer's comments came at a sensitive time for financial markets, as it is widely expected the Bundesbank will cut its official rates again before the end of the year at one of the two remaining meetings of its policy-making council, the first of which takes place on December 2. He reiterated the Bundesbank's standard line that it will continue examining whether there is further scope for interest rate cuts, emphasising that the decisive factor for German industry was long-term interest rates - at near-historical lows - rather than short-term ones. His comments on the importance of defending the D-Mark dovetail with remarks by Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, who said on Thursday that devaluing the D-Mark would be the 'the wrong medicine' for reviving the ailing German economy. Economists said the Bundesbank would not be rushed into cutting interest rates, pointing out that indicators other than the inflation rate - particularly the money supply, capital, and foreign exchange markets - were being watched closely by the Bundesbank. But any further easing of interest rates would be welcomed by investors in eastern Germany, where business confidence in the privatised sector is showing signs of gradual recovery. In a survey by the Halle Economic Research Institute of 300 enterprises in the food processing sector, 56 per cent of those surveyed said the outlook was more positive.</p>

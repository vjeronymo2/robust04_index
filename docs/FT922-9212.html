			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Societies pressed on rescue pledges BUILDING SOCIETIES were told yesterday that the government expects them to keep pledges made before Christmas to rescue mortgage customers facing possible eviction. Mr Anthony Nelson, the economic secretary to the Treasury, congratulated the Building Societies Association at its annual conference in Bournemouth for achieving a reduction in the likely number of mortgage evictions. 'We look to you, the lenders, to identify workable solutions to the problems which have emerged with these schemes, so that you will be able to deliver the commitments you made last December,' Mr Nelson said. Later Sir George Young, the housing minister, said mortgage-rescue measures should be a permanent fixture of the industry. First-time buyers considering a mortgage should be able to feel they would not be left 'stranded' if the economy and housing market moved against them. After talks with the government, the societies pledged more than Pounds 800m for mortgage-rescue schemes, intended to save at least 16,000 borrowers from eviction. Nearly six months later only a handful of borrowers have been saved directly by the schemes, although most societies have achieved a dramatic reduction in the number of evictions by improved debt counselling and similar services. Mr John Wriglesworth, a housing finance specialist at securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said: 'I estimate that these techniques may be successful in cutting repossessions from 280,000 to around 80,000 this year.' Abbey National, Britain's second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday cut mortgage interest rates immediately for new borrowers and from July 1 for existing customers. Rates on mortgages of up to Pounds 60,000 go down from 10.9 per cent to 10.7 per cent; Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 100,000 loans from 10.55 per cent to 10.2 per cent; and mortgages above that from 10.4 per cent to 9.99 per cent.</p>

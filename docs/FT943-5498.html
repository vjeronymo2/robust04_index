			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / UK Company News: GRT to take over SMT with agreed Pounds 11.2m bid The consolidation of the competitive bus industry continued yesterday with the announcement by GRT, one of the fastest growing bus operators in the UK, of an agreed Pounds 11.15m offer for SMT of Scotland. Mr Moir Lockhead, chairman of GRT, said the acquisition was expected to enhance earnings in the first full year. GRT, which came to the market in May, is paying about 74 per cent of the consideration in cash and the balance in new shares to value SMT at about Pounds 10m. It has also agreed to redeem some Pounds 1.15m in SMT preference shares if the offer goes unconditional. Mr Lockhead said SMT would further strengthen the group's competitive position in central Scotland. SMT operates public bus services in Edinburgh and the Lothian region. GRT currently operates in the north-east and central belt of Scotland, as well as Leicester and Northampton. SMT said the deal would protect the group in a period of intense competition. 'In our rapidly consolidating industry it is in the best interests of our employees and shareholders to become part of a larger bus group,' said Mr Andrew Gall, SMT chairman.</p>

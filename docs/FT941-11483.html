			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Few prospects in sight for an IMF agreement with Nigeria The International Monetary Fund ended its annual visit last night with no prospect of agreement between Nigeria and its official creditors until the new military government brings spending, inflation and the foreign exchange rate under control. But economists predict that some policies in last month's budget will undermine economic stability. Since late 1990 western-backed deregulation of Nigeria's economy has lapsed whilst fiscal policy has been out of control, leading to a budget deficit estimated at N100bn (Pounds 3bn) last year, about 15 per cent of GDP. 'The only thing which they deregulated in the past two years was government spending,' said an economist in Lagos. Officials say the Fund supported this government's policies of balancing the budget and accounting for all revenue and spending, but will not return for further talks until General Sani Abacha's regime achieves its targets in the coming months. Nigeria is set to accumulate arrears of Dollars 8.5bn (Pounds 5.7bn) by the year end on external debts of around Dollars 28bn and more than half is rescheduled debt to the Paris Club of official creditors, which it has not serviced since August 1992. Debt relief depends on either a standby agreement lasting nine to 18 months or a three-year enhanced structural adjustment agreement (ESAS) with the IMF. An ESAS would require comprehensive reform of the public sector but a standby deal could be reached more quickly if the government stabilises the economy and adopts fiscal, monetary, credit and foreign exchange policies which the Fund considers appropriate. Since seizing power in November the direction of Gen Abacha's regime has been unclear. In last month's budget it reverted to direct allocation of foreign currency and fixed foreign exchange and lending rates, ignoring advice from international creditors. Foreign accounts have been frozen since the budget and until the cabinet's civilian economic committee begins to allocate foreign exchange direct to end users at a fixed rate of N22 to the dollar. Bank lending rates have been capped at 21 per cent although inflation is believed to be around 80 per cent. This year's budget accounts more clearly for oil revenue than in the past but the government has not released payment for four months to its foreign oil joint venture partners which are owed an estimated Dollars 700m plus N3bn. Observers say that economic policy is largely determined by a cabinet committee containing several populist politicians with ambitions for high office, after the military leaves power, who may be reluctant to cut public spending.</p>

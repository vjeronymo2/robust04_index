			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Protection available under Irish procedures IF GPA fails to strike a deal soon with its creditors, it is likely to turn to the Irish courts for protection while it works out a financial restructuring. By asking the courts to appoint an examiner, the GPA board could remain in control of the company during the negotiations. As such, the Irish system is much closer to Chapter 11 insolvency procedures in the US than administration in the UK. Examination was brought to the statute books three years ago in an emergency all-night session of the Irish parliament. It was designed to provide a last-minute insolvency option to prevent Mr Larry Goodman's beef empire passing into receivership. Typically the directors request the courts to approve the appointment of an examiner. It is believed GPA has already lined up a candidate. Creditors can also request an examiner to be brought in. If creditors instead attempt to appoint a receiver, the directors may lodge an appeal with the courts to have the receiver removed and an examiner appointed. The examiner has wide powers including the right to apply to the court to have directors removed from office. He or she receives a statement of affairs of the company from the directors, and has up to 21 days to make a report to the court. This will cover its financial position, the reasons for insolvency, and a summary and assessment of any restructuring proposals. During that period, the company may seek new loans from banks, which become preferential creditors. More recently since the introduction of the procedure, the Irish courts have been granting interim examination orders lasting seven days. If a judge allows the process to continue, the examiner has a further three months to make proposals to a creditors' committee. Any decision taken must be ratified by the court.</p>

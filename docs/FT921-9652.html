			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Salomon puts an end to speculation - The plans of the US securities house for European growth The promotion of Mr Dennis Keegan and Mr Stephen Posford as joint chief executive officers at Salomon Brothers International yesterday is intended to put a stop to speculation over the direction of the Wall Street firm's European business. In an interview with the Financial Times, they stated Salomon Brothers' firm commitment to the equity business. Salomon plans to increase its presence in the UK stock and derivative markets, as well as in southern European equity markets such as Spain. 'We really want to slay this idea that we are getting out of the equities business,' says Mr Peter McSloy, chief administrative officer and a member of the new European management committee. Profits for 1991 in European equities were up 76 per cent on the previous year, he says. Mr Keegan admits that equity business is the area 'most damaged by errors made in pay and misunderstandings in the philosophy of the business'. But he says a decision has been taken to become more active in the UK markets, particularly as more clients are interested in these markets now that tax and accounting rules relating to the derivatives markets have been clarified. Salomon is already active in the Swiss and German derivatives markets, a position which Mr Keegan claims has helped generate other business in the Swiss and German markets. On the fixed income side, Mr Keegan says the firm will add Euroyen and Eurosterling bond trading to meet client needs. 'We assume there will be a higher proportion of European corporations wanting to borrow in the Eurobond market in future,' he says. Finally, Salomon wants to develop its investment banking operations, emphasising cross-border mergers and acquisitions, and privatisations. 'Billions of dollars of capital need to find a permanent home - our role is finding it,' says Mr Bill Strong, head of investment banking, pointing to the wave of privatisations expected in Scandinavia, France and eastern Europe. Whether these aims are achieved depends largely on how willing customers are to do business with the firm. For there is no doubting the impact of Salomon Brothers' misdemeanours in the US Treasury bond auctions on the firm's European business. Salomon was stripped of its title as US lead manager for the UK government's sale of BT shares, and has since been shunned by companies planning international equity issues. On the Eurobond side, Mr Keegan admits 'people are wary of giving us the lead manager position, but we're getting a lot of co-leads and joint leads. In the Eurobond market, many of the borrowers are sovereign and they are the most cautious ones.' The auction-rigging scandal also took its toll on staff. Some were made redundant while others left of their own accord, demoralised or dissatisfied over their compensation packages. Following the appointment of Mr Jim Massey (former chief executive officer in London) as head of international operations in New York late last year, insiders say there was an internal power struggle for the number one position, resulting in further departures. However, Mr Keegan and Mr Posford (who have worked together successfully as joint heads of fixed income, and then as joint heads of equity and fixed income business) are respected by colleagues, and are seen as good managers.</p>

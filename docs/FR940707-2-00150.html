The Joint Board has established an Advisory Committee on Actuarial Examinations (Advisory Committee) to assist in its examination duties mandated by ERISA. The term of the current Advisory Committee will expire on November 1, 1994. The charter for the Joint Board's Advisory Committee has been renewed, and a new Advisory Committee will be formed. This notice describes the Advisory Committee and invites applications from those interested in service on it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 1. General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To qualify for enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA, an applicant must have requisite pension actuarial experience and must satisfy knowledge requirements as provided in the Joint Board's regulations. The knowledge requirements may be satisfied by successful completion of Joint Board examinations in basic actuarial mathematics and methodology, and in actuarial mathematics and methodology relating to pension plans qualifying under ERISA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Joint Board, the Society of Actuaries and the American Society of Pension Actuaries jointly offer examinations acceptable to the Joint Board for enrollment purposes and acceptable to those actuarial organizations as part of their respective examination programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Purposes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Advisory Committee plays an integral role in the examination program by assisting the Joint Board in offering examinations which will enable examination candidates to demonstrate the knowledge necessary to qualify for enrollment. The purpose of the Advisory Committee, as renewed, will remain that of assisting the Joint Board in fulfilling this responsibility. The Advisory Committee will discuss the philosophy of such examinations, will review topics appropriately covered in them, and will make recommendations relative thereto. It also will recommend to the Joint Board proposed examination questions. The Joint Board will maintain liaison with the Advisory Committee in this process to ensure that its views on examination content are understood. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Function <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The manner in which the Advisory Committee functions in preparing examination questions is intertwined with the jointly administered examination program. Under that program, the participating actuarial organizations draft questions and submit them to the Advisory Committee for its consideration. After review of the draft questions, the Advisory Committee selects appropriate questions, modifies them as it deems desirable, and then prepares one or more drafts of actuarial examinations to be recommended to the Joint Board. (In addition to revisions of the draft questions, it may be necessary for the Advisory Committee to originate questions and include them in what is recommended.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Membership <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Joint Board will take steps to ensure maximum practicable representation on the Advisory Committee of points of view regarding the Joint Board's actuarial examination extant in the community of actuaries. In this regard, appointment will be made from the actuarial community at large and from nominees provided by the actuarial organizations. Since the members of the actuarial organizations comprise a large segment of the actuarial profession, this appointive process ensures expression of a broad spectrum of viewpoints. All members of the Advisory Committee will be expected to act in the public interest, that is, to produce examinations which will help ensure a level of competence among those who will be accorded enrollment to perform actuarial services under ERISA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Membership normally will be limited to actuaries previously enrolled by the Joint Board. However, individuals having academic or other special qualifications of particular value for the Advisory Committee's work also will be considered for membership. The Advisory Committee will be comprised of not more than nine members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Advisory Committee will meet about four times a year. Advisory Committee members should be prepared to devote from 100 to 150 hours, including meeting time, to the work of the Advisory Committee over the course of a year. Members will be reimbursed for Advisory Committee travel, meals and lodging expenses incurred in accordance with applicable government regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Actuaries interested in serving on the Advisory Committee should express their interest and fully state their qualifications in a letter addressed to: Joint Board for the Enrollment of Actuaries, c/o Office of Director of Practice, Internal Revenue Service, suite 600, 801 Pennsylvania Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20004. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any questions may be directed to the Joint Board's Executive Director at 202&hyph;376&hyph;1421. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The deadline for accepting applications is September 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Leslie S.

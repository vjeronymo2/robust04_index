			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (4): Leading carriers engage in fierce dogfight - North Atlantic The busiest and most competitive segment of the business air travel market remains the north Atlantic routes between the US, UK and, to a lesser extent, continental Europe. The UK is by far the biggest European market for non-stop flights to and from the US, with one third of all transatlantic capacity using UK airports. Over the past year the arrival in the UK of such dominant US carriers as United and American, plus the growth of Delta, has created a far greater challenge to British Airways than had seemed likely just a few years ago. Competition from the two main US carriers - Pan Am and TWA - had been muted as these airlines increasingly lost out following the dereg-ulation of air services in the US in the early 1980s. BA's position was also strengthened by the strict controls on airlines using Heathrow Airport which, because of its vast numbers of connecting flights, is preferred by business travellers over UK gateways such as Gatwick and Stansted. All that changed when Uni-ted and American took over the routes previously operated by Pan Am and TWA and the government's 'open skies' policy scrapped the controls on Heathrow. The result has been a fierce dogfight between the principal carriers for business hit by the weak economies on both sides of the north Atlantic. The extra capacity put on at a time of sluggish demand has inevitably led to fierce price discounting, although this has mainly been felt in economy-class seating rather than in business cabins. Yet the paradox of north Atlantic travel at present is that at the same time as there are too many seats chasing too few passengers, many of the aircraft on key routes into North America are flying with almost full loads. The reason, according to Mr Ron Spiers, publisher of the ABC World Airways Guide, is that discounting at the back end of the aircraft is forcing airlines to upgrade some passengers into business class cabins. The airlines, not surprisingly, deny this is happening. Another factor, especially for the US carriers, is the widespread popularity of their frequent flyer programmes. These not only offer the chance to fly free but also the opportunity for regular travellers to upgrade their class of flight to business or first at no extra cost. BA has been at a competitive disadvantage in this area, forcing it to offer its own Air Miles frequent flyer pro-gramme. Similarly, BA has also found itself at a disadvantage by not having access to the connecting routes within the US enjoyed by its rivals. Hence its decision to acquire a stake in the troubled USAir airline, although this move may now be blocked by the new administration of president-elect Clinton. While BA may have its problems, for executive travellers the competition in this key market is generally leading to rising standards of service and choice in the business class cabins. But business class fares are not being subject to the same degree of price competition for the simple reason that the airlines cannot afford to do so. If recession continues, however, then the battle over the north Atlantic can only intensify.</p>

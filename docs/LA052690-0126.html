			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> PRIZE WINNER CITES 99 'HAPPY' YEARS  </P> <P> At 99, Stella King was surprised to be honored as the eldest guest at the  annual Orange Senior Center luncheon for men and women over 80. While insisting  that she knew people who were at least a month or two older, King offered  secrets to her own longevity.  </P> <P> "I've always been happy, I think that's part of it. I've had a wonderful life,  so when my time comes, I don't have any regrets," said King, a resident of the  Fountain Retirement Center.  </P> <P> A bad back has kept her from participating in most of the center's activities,  "but I couldn't miss this," she said of the 15th annual "Elegant Eighties-Nifty  Nineties" party, the center's largest and most popular event.  </P> <P> "It's a very special day for everybody," said JoAnn Arntsen, the center's  activities and service director. The program Thursday, which included  appearances by City Council members along with entertainment, lunch and prizes,  attracts many more than the 125 seniors who eat lunch regularly at the center,  she said.  </P> <P> Lyla Culver, at 84 the founder of the event, said the party's over-80 guest  list has grown from 17 the first year to 114.  </P> <P> Guests sipped punch and nibbled candy during the pre-lunch program, which  included a performance by the Orange Blossoms, the center's choral group.  </P> <P> "It's like the 'Lawrence Welk' show come to the Orange Senior Center," said  musical director Marylee Mouser, introducing a song-and-dance number.  </P> <P> Stella King wasn't the day's only prize winner. Bottles of wine or care  packages went to others, such as the person with the most  great-great-grandchildren (12) and the person with the oldest living child  (70).  </P> <P> Dallas Bowman, who will be 92 in June, won a prize for being the oldest man.  </P> <P> "You know what I tell 'em. I don't drink, I don't smoke and I don't chase  women," said Bowman.  </P> <P> "He's one of a kind," said a dining partner. MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

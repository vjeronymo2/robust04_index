			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Madrid decline broadens and deepens THE MUTED performance of the Eurotrack 100 masked the movement in one or two senior bourses, and there was even more volatility on the periphery, writes Our Markets Staff. MADRID deepened and broadened its losses as the general index fell another 2.91 to 253.91. Banks continued to decline but disappointment over the Socialists' general election win spilled over into oils and chemicals, where Repsol fell Pta55 to Pta3,125, construction, where Cubiertas led the way down with a Pta360 drop to Pta7,050, utilities and industrials. Turnover climbed from Pta20.1bn to Pta23.6bn. Mr Javier de Frutos, who covers international equity markets at Beta Capital in Madrid, noted a conjunction of a strong peseta and a drop of 33 basis points in yields in the secondary bond market with the continued drop in equities and said that either bonds or equities will have to change direction soon. FRANKFURT closed below its best, the DAX index ending 6.00 higher at 1,661.61. Turnover rose from DM5.2bn to DM5.5bn as traders covered their shorts. In chemicals, Hoechst eased DM1.50 to DM245.50 as the company, which faced a storm of public and official criticism after a string of chemical accidents earlier this year, announced a replacement for its retiring management board chairman, Mr Wolfgang Hilger. In the construction sector, falls in the leading contractors after rating downgrades from Merck Finck and Bank Julius Bar were balanced by a DM45 gain to DM1,185 in Heidelberger Zement, on the grounds that there might be more potential in building materials suppliers. MILAN continued to be dominated by activity in the debt-laden Ferruzzi. The shares came off a further 8.7 per cent, to close L85 lower at L883.10. Among other companies in the group Montedison slipped L20 to L1,100 and then to L1,060 on the kerb, while Fondiara lost L460 to L27,865. However, Mediobanca, which is leading the consortium of five creditor banks put on L100 to L16,400. The Comit index was barely changed, rising 0.72 to 521.40. Elsewhere, a positive recommendation from Morgan Stanley, helped to lift Benetton L707, or 4 per cent to L19,454: the report noted that 1994 earnings should exceed this year's 'due to the benefits of the lira devaluation and to a reduction in the size of the collections'. PARIS was modestly higher with UAP rising FFr13 to FFr574 on news that the Swiss insurer, Winterthur, might increase its 3 per cent stake. The CAC-40 index rose 5.79 to 1,893.65 in turnover of some FFr2.7bn. Oil stocks remained firm with Total rising FFr1 to FFr273: the company is to participate in a planned consortium bid to develop a Chinese onshore oil field. ZURICH saw profit taking which left the SMI index 14.4 lower at 2,294.5. In insurances Winterthur lost SFr70 to SFr3,250 although it forecast higher profits after a setback in 1992. BRUSSELS saw early optimism in Petrofina, which jumped by more than 4 per cent at one point on optimism about a presentation to London analysts, and then receded a little to close BFr180, or 2.2 per cent higher at BFr8,350. The Bel-20 index added 10.98 at 1,197.43. STOCKHOLM fell back after profit-taking in Astra left the B shares down SKr17 at SKr693. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 10.2 to 1,078.4 in turnover of some SKr794m. HELSINKI fell by a further 2.4 per cent, the Hex index losing 26.6 at 1,115.1; COPENHAGEN gained 1 per cent after a cut in interest rates, the KFX index closing at 85.25. PORTUGAL weakened slightly but attention is now being turned to the release of May inflation data expected to be released on Friday. The BTA index slipped 7.4 to 1,992.5. Mr John Ferreira at Carnegie commented that forecasts were for a fall in year-on-year inflation to 5.8 per cent compared to 6.2 per cent in April. He added that if the figures came in as expected then a cut in interest rates might be expected next week. ATHENS shrugged off weeks in the doldrums as investors reacted positively to the affirmation by the national economy minister, Mr Stephan Manos, that the government's economic plan is still on track. The ASE index rose 23.64, or 3.2 per cent to 757.43. WARSAW dropped another 9.7 per cent, the 294 fall to 2,740.1 in the WIG index leaving it 1,006.9, or 27.6 per cent lower since May 31.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- June 8                                              THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1170.00    1169.67    1169.03    1168.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1221.04    1220.10    1220.54    1218.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1168.06    1168.41    1169.34    1168.70 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1218.63    1216.55    1219.11    1218.08  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        June 7    June 4    June 3    June 2    June 1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1167.78   1159.95   1160.81   1155.78   1153.22 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.66   1214.21   1217.28   1215.58   1215.43  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1170.15 ; 200 -  1221.18 Low/day: 100 -  1167.61  200 -  1216.46 .  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

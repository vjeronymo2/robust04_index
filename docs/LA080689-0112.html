			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEUSCHATZ MEMORIAL  </P> <P> I am an infrequent reader of the Real Estate Section of the L.A. Times since I  cannot imagine being able to afford "upgrading" from my condo in Studio City.  </P> <P> However, for some reason I opened that section this morning to find Sam Hall  Kaplan's wonderful column on my dear friend Royce Schaffer Neuschatz (July 23).  </P> <P> I, too, was at the memorial for Royce and when I went hiking yesterday in  Griffith Park with the Sierra Club, I saw the old zoo picnic area and  immediately thought of her. I began telling my "hike mate" of this terrific  woman.  </P> <P> Kaplan's idea is most fitting for Royce and I think she would heartily endorse  it. As Kaplan requested, I will contact the commission directly with my  support.  </P> <P> SHARON MAYER  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Survey of Thailand (7): Traffic jams and bottlenecks - Indecisiveness hampers vital public works Few people who have struggled to meet an appointment through Bangkok's gridlocked traffic would disagree with the proposition that Thailand's infrastructure is in a mess. Such is the pace of development, and so wholly absent a co-ordinated transport policy, that the roads simply cannot cope with an ever increasing volume of cars. Yet the long-suffering Thais themselves are strangely accepting of the situation. Politicians from the Bangkok region say traffic tops voter concern, but still the pressure is not such as to force the government to act. Perhaps the infrastructure problems matter less in the short run than outsiders at first sight imagine. Or perhaps everyone knows there is little the government can do. Both thoughts contain a grain of truth. With an economic growth rate expected to be in the region of 7 to 9 per cent over the next couple of years, there is little discernible impact yet on the economy from infrastructure bottlenecks. The traffic jams in Bangkok are highly conspicuous, but elsewhere the road network is good. If congestion in the capital causes growth to shift to the provinces, then, some would argue, so much the better. Development of the national economy would be better balanced. The real problem concerns Thailand's ability to make sensible decisions for the longer term. Unless the government can secure an efficient infrastructure, the country's competitive advantage could disappear. Thailand would find it hard to attract productive investment if a poor infrastructure made doing business just at the time when cheap labour from nearby Indochina was coming on stream. Unlike many developing countries Thailand has no need to sell off state enterprises at fire sale prices to cover its budget deficit. Indeed with government finances in surplus that particular question simply does not arise. Instead its privatisation programme has been driven more by the need to make state enterprises more efficient and to co-opt private capital for the expensive investments that inevitably lie ahead. The World Bank has suggested that as much as Dollars 12bn a year could need to be spent on the infrastructure for the next five years. 'A major concern is that sectoral reform ensures that existing efficiency is maintained and guarantees that huge infrastructural investments  ... can be financed and implemented in a timely manner,' the bank said in report last month. At this point the real problems begin. 'Thailand's economic management has been very strong on the macro side: it has been absolutely lousy on the micro,' says Mr Ammar Siamwalla of the Thailand Development Research Institute. 'The problem with infrastructure has nothing to do with lack of capital. It's much more the lack of capability of public decision-making.' To be fair, Thailand's record is not all bad. Egat, the electricity authority, has a long tradition of good technical management with the result that the power supply, though hardly cheap, has been reliable. There has been a notable improvement in the telephone service since the government pushed the two state operators - the Communications Authority of Thailand which deals with international calls and the Telephone Organisation of Thailand which serves the domestic market - into granting concessions to private operators. The snag is that the underlying legislation is not adapted to such an approach. The state enterprises retain basic monopoly rights which creates uncertainty for the private operators. Reshuffling of the concessions after they were granted on the grounds that one of the private operators, TelecomAsia, stood to earn too much looked arbitrary and capricious. At best it was a reminder that there is no coherent and predictable regulatory framework. A number of other developments compound the impression of regulatory weakness. Egat retained a controlling interest in the generating company EgCo when it was privatised recently. The World Bank has recommended that Egat reduce its stake in EgCo to below 50 per cent as soon as possible. The Japanese company Kumagai Gumi was squeezed out of Bangkok's second expressway consortium in March after it had been built - and after it had become clear that the road would be much more profitable than originally expected. The fiasco over Bangkok's proposed mass transit system continues. Contracts have been signed by three separate authorities with three separate operators. Hopewell, the Hong Kong construction company controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, is working with Thailand's state railways. Bangkok Land is working with a sub-division of the Ministry of the Interior and another local company, Tanayong, is working with the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority. None of the projects is designed to interconnect, but since contracts have been signed, the government cannot easily scrap the whole thing and start again from scratch . The common thread running through all these cases is the need first for co-ordinated planning to ensure that the public receives the services it requires, and second to establish a regulatory system that will prevent abuse of monopoly power in sectors where competition will always be limited. Such a prescription may seem a tall order for a developing country. Even in the UK, which has considerable experience of regulating privatised utilities, regulation seems flawed at times. But the Philippines is attempting to tackle the monopoly question. It is ultimately essential if the private sector is to take a significant role in the provision of infrastructure. That poses several difficulties for Thailand. One is that many state enterprises are profitable in their own right and their managements are highly paid. They will not open themselves up to competition easily, as the case of Egat has shown. Another is that Thailand's consensus approach to coalition lacks the single-mindedness needed for firm and impartial regulation. The peculiar history of the Bangkok mass transit suggests that the coalition only works because all the vested interests are allowed to have their say, despite the inherent contradictions. Democracy has survived in that way for two years now. At least where the infrastructure is concerned, the task for the next two may lie in making order out of chaos.</p>

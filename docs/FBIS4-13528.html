			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nasir 'Arif] </F>   [Text] An unpublicized Fatah Central Committee session  convened on 17 April in Tunis, was devoted to a discussion of  the makeup of the national authority due to take over in the  self-rule areas once Israel withdraws. The meeting, according  to informed Palestinian sources, also considered the logistics  for the arrival of the authority's bureaucrats and police  forces. The PLO is close to naming the members of the national  authority, which will likely be composed of 18 members. Of  these, seven will be PLO Executive Committee members, two Fatah  members, another two diaspora Palestinians, and the balance  technocrats from the territories occupied since 1967. 'Arafat,  predict the same sources, will move to Jericho shortly and take  up residence at the Hisham Palace Hotel, which will also serve  as offices for the national authority, assuming a mechanism is  agreed on for the implementation of the Declaration of  Principles now being hammered out between the PLO and Israel in  Cairo.    Meanwhile, a top Palestinian official disclosed to AL-ASWAQ  that the configuration of the national authority has virtually  been completed. The list will now be presented to the sponsors  of the peace process and the Rabin government for clearance.    Over the past few days, the PLO has directed the Political  Department's staff to be ready to travel for the self-rule areas  next week.    In another development, an official in charge of the  expellees affairs said the negotiating Palestinian team in Cairo  yesterday got clearance from the Israelis for the return of 50  exiles whom the PLO had demanded be allowed back at the first  round of the Cairo talks.    The list has been handed to Yasir 'Arafat who, for unknown  reasons, preferred to wait a few days before making it public.  Israel radio said yesterday Israel has okayed the return of 17  wanted Palestinians, whose repatriation, originally set for last  Sunday, had been delayed for what was termed as purely technical  reasons.</p>

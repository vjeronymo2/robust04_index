			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The international "Agroasia-94" exhibition is  coming to an end in the republican capital. President  Nazarbayev attended on 22 June.    Judging by the number of foreign companies displaying their  goods here, we can say that a great number of businessmen are  willing to cooperate with Kazakhstan and set up joint ventures  with it. This is what President Nazarbayev said during his  conversation with Shaffer, a representative of the German  Ministry of Agriculture, after he familiarized himself with that  country's equipment.    We are willing to manufacture all of them jointly with  German  companies. This is a beneficial area for cooperation and we  have agreed to develop it with Chancellor Kohl.    [words indistinct] a basis has been created for setting up  several Kazakhstan-German joint ventures. In particular,  everything is ready for starting the joint production of the  "Class"-type combines in Akmola, beet-lifters, machinery for  pressing and mowing grass, cleaning and grading grain, and  pre-sowing soil cultivation. They have been highly appraised by  farmers and experts from Kazakhstan's center for testing  machinery.    Relevant government agreements are available, [words  indistinct] technical documentation has been compiled and  buildings have been found. Germany has allocated the "Hermes"  special credit line.    Unfortunately, we can't use it now, since the Alem-Bank  despite [words indistinct] hasn't provided us with guarantees  for the efficient use of the credit and timely return of it. It  looks like serious financial decisions have to be taken here.  But we should take them, Nazarbayev said, and as soon as  possible. This will allow us to start promising new products.    "Why is it important for us to have joint ventures," the  president asked. "Because we have a good basis for this. There  is a great demand for highly efficient agricultural machinery.  We have metal for it. At the initial stage we will have to  purchase parts and units but later on we will be able to master  their production and create powerful industrial complexes.  [words indistinct] one of the directions followed by the  civilzed world." [passage omitted]    The president showed interest in the technology by leading  companies of the world used in the protection of plants and  processment of agricultural produce, higly efficient equipment  which could be used in food industry and laboratory equipment  for checking its quality. He also familiarized himself with the  latest achievements in telecommunications, and electronic and  power engineering systems of communications, which are being  displayed by businessmen from 16 countries of the world at the  "Atakent" business center.</p>

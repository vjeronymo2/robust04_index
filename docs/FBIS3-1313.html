			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Abuja, 24 March (PANA) -- Leaders of the Lake  Chad Basin Commission, meeting in the Nigerian capital Abuja,  agreed Thursday [24 March] to set up a joint security force to  ensure the safety of lives and property in the area.    In their communique, the heads of state of the five-nation  commission decided at the end of their two-day summit to  "immediately set up a joint security force with a clear mandate  and logistic support." The leaders said that troops and  material contribution to the force would be clearly defined.  [passage omitted]    The communique was signed by Presidents Sani Abacha of  Nigeria, Idriss Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger and  Felix Ange Patasse of the Central African Republic. Augustin  Frederic Kodock, Cameroon's minister of state for planning and  development, signed on behalf of Cameroonian President Paul  Biya. They also approved a document prepared in collaboration  with a French company, IGN-France, on the boundary demarcation  of the basin, urging each country to "adopt it, in accordance  with its national laws." The document is to be signed by each  country before the commission's summit in 1995 in Ndjamena.    The two-day summit was held amid heightened tension between  Nigeria and Cameroon, both members states of the commission.  Since the beginning of February they have been embroiled in a  renewed dispute over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula located in  the Gulf of Guinea, near south-eastern Nigeria. Efforts to  convene a summit of Nigeria's military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha  and Cameroonian President Paul Biya have failed.    The heads of state in their communique reaffirmed their  belief "in the ability of African nations to always amicably  settle their occasional differences either through bilateral or  regional fora." They also stressed the need for regular dialogue  at heads of state and government level.    Political observers in the Nigerian capital see both the  signature of the communique by Cameroon and its decision to  participate in the joint security force, to be stationed in  Nigeria, as the beginning of a detente between the two  neighbouring countries.    Conference sources told the PAN-AFRICAN NEWS AGENCY (PANA)  that the dispute between the two countries featured in the  14-hour discussions held Wednesday through early Thursday,  behind closed doors. The heads of state also reviewed a wide  range of current issues including the forthcoming elections in  South Africa, and the protracted wars in Angola, Burundi and  Somalia. The leaders also decided to re-elect for a second  three-year term the executive secretary of the commission,  Abubakar Jauro of Nigeria.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  on Friday [13 May] reiterated his readiness for a dialogue with  opposition parties as their attack on his minority government  continued in the Diet. Admitting the difficulty in handling a  variety of issues with only minority support, Hata said at a  plenary session of the House of Councilors that he will seek  cooperation from the opposition parties.    Hata's response to the questions by Takushi Hirai, a member  of the main opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however,  were for the most part repetitions of his remarks on Thursday in  the House of Representatives.    Hirai pointed to the shaky standing of Hata's minority  government and made a renewed call for the prime minister to  step down.    Hata said he will respect an agreement among the coalition  partners on key issues in April, before the Social Democratic  Party (SDP), the second largest opposition, stormed out of the  coalition.    The premier said he will seek cooperation from the SDP in  line with the platform and will also "consult frankly with the  LDP" in coping with the pending tasks.    The SDP walked out of the ruling coalition immediately after  it helped put Hata in office over moves among some coalition  components to form a new Diet bloc, excluding the SDP.    Hata also reiterated that the government will make efforts  to  pass the proposed tax reform through the Diet by the end of the  year after compiling the draft bills in June.    On the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  program,  Hata said the government will cope with any emergency, if one  should occur, with solid unity, while stressing the importance  of solving the issue through diplomatic efforts.    Hata, commenting on Japan's bid for permanent membership of  the UN Security Council, suggested that Japan is seeking the  permanent membership with veto power, like the current five  permanent members -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the  United States.    Germany also has said it is interested in joining the  council  as a permanent member with veto power.</p>

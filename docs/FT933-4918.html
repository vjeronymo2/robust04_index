			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / China curbs fixed asset investment CHINA yesterday announced measures aimed at curbing soaring investment in fixed assets, the main cause of inflation and economic instability, Reuter reports from Beijing. National newspapers published an order from the State Council (cabinet) listing seven measures to regulate investment and try to direct it along government guidelines. Fixed asset investment increased 70 per cent in the first seven months of 1993, driving up prices of raw materials and helping to keep the urban inflation rate in July at 23.3 per cent. The State Council ordered all regions and departments to reassess projects and go ahead only with those that were efficient or that eased bottlenecks in the system. Projects without the necessary capital, that do not match national policy or have no clear market, especially high-class hotels, offices and villas, must be rigorously reassessed. It said that funds, including foreign loans and those saved from suspended projects, must be concentrated on priority state projects such as agriculture, transport, telecommunications, power and production of raw materials. In principle no new projects should be approved in the year's second half, and banks would not lend to property projects with no official approval, the State Council said. The measures are the latest in a series since a 16-point plan unveiled in early July by Vice Premier Zhu Rongji, when he took over as chief of the central bank, aimed at cooling the overheated economy. Last week Mr Zhu stressed the successes of his programme - a stable yuan exchange rate, recovery of a third of illegal bank loans and a curb on property speculation.</p>

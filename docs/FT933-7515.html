			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): New fistful of 1993 highs around the Pacific Rim INVESTORS were discouraged by a lack of concrete measures to support Japan's economy at the first meeting of the new government's economic affairs ministers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost a further 85.71 to 20,687.47, having moved between 20,603.56 and 20,903.09. Foreign investors continued to be leading buyers, but the index faltered on selling by financial institutions. Volume declined to 250m shares from 288m. Falls outnumbered rises by 716 to 243, with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 11.10 to 1,664.76, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 1.10 to 1,271.60. The ministers agreed on an economic package which would pass the benefits of a higher yen to consumers, and on deregulation of industries and the distribution system by the end of next month. Investors felt left out. However, in spite of official denials of the possibility of an official discount rate cut, traders said speculation on monetary easing was still strong. Mr Robert Feldman, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said the BOJ was likely to make a cut of 50 basis points by the end of September. But he added that the cut was already discounted in share prices and it would take 75 to 100 basis points to make a large impact. At corporate level, Cosmo Securities, the second tier broker which will be bailed out by Daiwa Bank, ended at Y496, down from Friday's close of Y649. Ricoh, the most active issue of the day, forged ahead Y28 to Y799 on the company's development of technology to make paper-recycling copiers. NEC retreated Y22 to Y988, falling below the Y1,000 level for the first time since August 9. The stock had risen on hopes that the government would pump in funds to improve the country's telecommunications infrastructure; yesterday's lack of discussion was a disappointment. In Osaka, the OSE average shed 117.54 to 22,555.83 in volume of 131.9m shares, the highest since March 10. Roundup THE REGION produced another fistful of record highs, although London reactions to the Hang Seng Bank results in Hong Kong took some of the edge off the day. NEW ZEALAND, which has the unusual distinction of trading 48 per cent below its all-time peak set in 1987, made up more ground as the NZSE-40 capital index advanced 61.94, or 3.2 per cent, to 2,019.8. Turnover was described as 'absolutely extraordinary' as it rocketed to NZDollars 142m from Wednesday's estimated and extremely heavy NZDollars 90m. Carter Holt Harvey and Fletcher Challenge led the way, climbing 20 cents to NZDollars 3.39 and another 36 cents to NZDollars 3.83 after Fletcher's surprising results on Wednesday, which triggered a rerating of both forestry stocks AUSTRALIA broke through the 1,900 barrier as buyers snapped up industrial issues, the All Ordinaries index closing 31.6 higher at another post-1987 crash peak of 1,926.3. Turnover was heavy at ADollars 630.9m. Brokers said Wall Street's record high and improving bullion prices also provided momentum, the golds index rising 61.6 to 2,218.0. CRA, in base metals and gold, jumped 42 cents to ADollars 15.28. KUALA LUMPUR achieved another high after a late surge in several blue chips, including Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The KLSE composite index ended 7.80 stronger at 798.82 as volume rose from 312.5m to 413.1m shares. Malayan Banking firmed 50 cents to 15.60 ringgit after its impressive annual results. Tenaga and Telekom rose 20 cents each to MDollars 11 and MDollars 16.10. SEOUL finally wiped out the remaining losses following last week's ban on trading under false or borrowed names, the composite index rising 24.79 to 737.97 in turnover of Won60bn. BOMBAY's BSE 30-share index moved ahead a further 85.35 to 2,700.55 in trade restricted to one hour to enable delivery of cash shares. SINGAPORE tried to extend its record-breaking run but profit-taking came in after an intraday all-time high of 1,963.85, and the Straits Times Industrial index ended a net 2.62 down at 1,948.78.</p>

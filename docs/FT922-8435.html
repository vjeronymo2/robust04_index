			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Survey of The Reforming of Russia (15): Moscow's concern - Ratification of the START treaty AS THE successor to the former Soviet Union, the Russian government will undertake to ratify the START treaty signed between the United States and the USSR in July 1991, writes Judy Dempsey. This treaty involves the implementation of deep cuts in strategic weapons on both sides. By 1994, the missiles in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) must be cut from 9,700 to 4,900. However, ratification of START has encountered some difficulties. The independent republic of Ukraine, led by President Leonid Kravchuk, has intimated that since Ukraine has nuclear weapons stationed on its territory, it should be a signatory to the ratification of START - and perhaps even seek a seat at the START 11 negotiations. The Russian government is reluctant to accommodate Ukraine's wishes. Moscow's position is that since it is the successor to the former Soviet Union, Russia, on behalf of the CIS, should ratify START and then begin negotiations on START 11. Furthermore, as Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister argued: 'If Ukraine wants to sign the Non Proliferation Treat (NPT), but at the same time, it wants to be a signatory to START, this position amounts to a contradiction in terms.' Mr Kravchuk has repeatedly said that Ukraine remains committed to the idea of a nuclear-free state. However, it appears he may be trying to extract a price for this status. So far, and in line with the START reductions, Ukraine has agreed to withdraw 140 of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). The question of the remaining 46, each of which have 10 warheads remains open. Mr Kravchuk, who is anxious to allay fears, particularly among nationalists, that neighbouring Russia would threaten its security, wants compensation and/or some form of security commitment by western countries in return for withdrawing the remaining 46 ICBMs. Moscow is also concerned about the 104 strategic weapons located in the republic of Kazakhstan, and the 54 based in the republic of Belarus. These weapons are also included in the START reductions.</p>

			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / European Bonds: Little sign of German interest rate cut 'WILL they or won't they?' is the question buzzing round the European government bond markets. For what everyone wants to know is whether the Bundesbank's council members will agree to cut interest rates when they convene for their first meeting after the summer recess on Thursday, paving the way for other European central banks to ease. It was the Bundesbank's failure to lower the key discount (or floor) rate at its last meeting in July that precipitated a crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism. As a result the whole system had to be revamped at the beginning of August. When the European government bond markets opened on August 2, they found the fluctuation bands within which currencies could move had been widened to 15 per cent, dressing up a floating-rate system as a semi-fixed one and raising expectations that most of Europe's central banks would have a free rein to slash interest rates. Given that the Bundesbank was not prepared to lower its key interest rate at the end of July - and in the process rescue the old-style European exchange rate mechanism - what reason is there to believe it will cut rates this time? 'Although the weakness of the west German economy, and the recent attempts by the government to reduce the budget deficit keep open the chance of a rate cut, it is difficult to see the recent German data triggering an easing this coming week,' says Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International. The Bundesbank's latest monthly report stressed that monetary growth and inflation were still too high, and that the July M3 money supply figures, released last week, had crushed hopes of an imminent easing. Many in the market had predicted the July M3 figure would be 'artificially high', since it was expected to include the effects of intervention related to ERM turbulence at the end of last month. However, in the event not only was the figure high at 7.5 per cent (compared with 7.0 per cent in June and well above the Bundesbank's target range of between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent), but it turned out that intervention had little to do with the number. In fact, the effects of intervention will show up in the August figures instead. In addition to poor money supply figures, economists point out that the Bundesbank is unlikely to get much joy from the cost-of-living figures due out this week, as these are expected to show that inflation remains stubbornly high. Against this background, many say there is not much chance of the Bundesbank delighting the market with a 50 basis point cut in the discount rate - although some economists point out that the mere five basis point difference between the discount rate (now 6.75 per cent) and the repo rate (6.80 per cent) means it is possible the Bundesbank may make a technical adjustment to the former. Mr Adrian James, international bond analyst at NatWest Capital Markets, believes that 'even a cut in the discount rate (at this Thursday's Council meeting) is unlikely to be followed by much action on the repo rate'. So ERM members will have to act on their own initiative, rather than waiting for Germany to move first.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Kumpulan Guthrie advances 149% KUMPULAN Guthrie, Malay-sia's largest plantation group, yesterday reported a 149 per cent advance in group net profits to MDollars 57.22m (USDollars 21.99m) for 1991 from MDollars 22.97m in the previous 12 months, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur. The company said the higher profits were due to increases in commodity prices and a favourable performance of overseas marketing companies. The directors expect higher profits in 1992. The directors are recommending a final dividend of 7 cents a share, making 10 cents for the year, up from 9 cents in 1990.</p>

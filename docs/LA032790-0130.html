			<p><P> March 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FADDOUL AND KENNEDY COME THROUGH PERFECTLY  </P> <P> Brian Faddoul couldn't be blamed for being a bit apprehensive before starting  his first Garden Grove League baseball game for Kennedy High School Friday.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, Faddoul walked three batters but earned a save by pitching the  last two innings of an 8-5 victory over Rancho Alamitos.  </P> <P> And the week before, his teammates committed seven errors in Faddoul's only  loss of the season -- a doubleheader sweep by Gahr in which Kennedy committed  12 errors.  </P> <P> "Every time the ball was hit, I would cross my fingers," Faddoul said. "We  didn't have any errors that day and that was great."  </P> <P> The Fighting Irish, defending Southern Section 3-A champions, played error-free  ball. Bolsa Grande played hitless ball . . . and walkless ball.  </P> <P> Faddoul pitched a perfect game in a 3-0 victory. Only twice did the junior  right-hander have a three-ball count on a batter.  </P> <P> Faddoul, The Times' Athlete of the Week, was the most valuable player on  Kennedy's junior varsity team last season, moving up to the varsity for the  playoffs. But he only pitched during practice because of the dominance of  seniors Greg Hansell (13-1) and Peter Montera (11-2).  </P> <P> This season, Kennedy Coach Chris Pascal was counting on Faddoul to be one of  two starters even before the other, Mike Stenner, was lost for the season after  knee surgery. So Faddoul became the stopper, and Friday he shut down everybody.  </P> <P> "He hung a couple of pitches that he got away with," Pascal said. "You have to  be a little lucky to pitch a no-hitter, much less a perfect game."  </P> <P> The closest call came with one out in the seventh, when shortstop Rod Rosales  made an over-the-shoulder catch of a blooper.  </P> <P> "It bounced off his chest then it went into his glove," Faddoul (3-1) said, as  if he still had difficulty believing it. "I don't know, that was something  else."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Ken Dolan pitched a no-hitter and struck out 10 for San Clemente and the  Tritons defeated Capistrano Valley, 4-2, Wednesday.  </P> <P> Nate Julson led El Toro to a first-place finish in the Southern Section  swimming relays Saturday at Belmont Plaza. Julson anchored the winning 400-yard  backstroke team and had a personal-best 48.1 seconds in his leg of the 400  freestyle, which the Chargers also won.  </P> <P> Chad Rolish pitched a no-hitter and struck out 18 for Servite in the Friars'  4-0 victory over Bishop Montgomery Saturday.  </P> <P> Roshawn Sims of Esperanza was named the track athlete of the meet at the Orange  County Championships Saturday at Rancho Santiago College. Sims won the 400  meters in a meet-record 49.24 seconds and the 200 in 22.00. He also anchored  Esperanza's 400 relay team, which finished second, and the victorious 1,600  relay team.  </P> <P> Brian Faddoul  </P> <P> Kennedy High School  </P> <P> * Position: Pitcher  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 5-10, 160, Junior  </P> <P> * Last Week: Faddoul pitched a perfect game as Kennedy defeated Bolsa Grande,  3-0, Friday. Faddoul also pitched two innings to earn a save in an 8-5 victory  over Rancho Alamitos Wednesday.  </P> <P> * Season: Faddoul is 3-1 with a 1.97 earned-run average. He has struck out 32  and walked 13 in 28 1/3 innings.  </P></p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Swedish newspaper crash hits opposition THE secretary of Sweden's opposition Social Democratic party offered his resignation yesterday after a group of newspapers controlled by the party filed for bankruptcy, Reuter reports from Stockholm. Mr Bo Toresson, party secretary since 1983 and a board member of the A-Pressen group, told a news conference he had offered to resign as a result of the crash. His offer will be reviewed on Thursday by the party's board. Party leader Ingvar Carlsson said the Social Democrats, who ruled Sweden for most of six decades up to last year, would restructure most of its newspapers in a new group and inject SKr 100m (Dollars 17.5m) in capital. But Mr Carlsson said the party could not afford to assume financial responsibility for three of the group's newspapers, including the flagship Arbetet - a morning paper based in the southern town of Malmo. 'This is a very difficult and painful measure for the party. We lose ownership of three important newspaper companies and there is a risk that these papers will cease publication,' he said.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Printing employers divided on pay change PRINTING employers are divided over whether there should be a return to national wage bargaining in the industry next year. After widespread but inconclusive consultation with its 2,600 affiliated member companies, the British Printing Industries Federation has decided to hold talks with the GPMU print union over the future of the national agreement which was suspended this year. Mr Tony Dubbins, the union's general secretary, welcomed the invitation to talks yesterday and he stressed this would be without conditions on the union's side. The leadership of the employers' federation made clear in recent months that it wanted to scrap the national agreement for pay while retaining it for other issues such as training, resolving disputes and health and safety. Mr Andrew Brown, the federation's employee relations director, said yesterday that opinions over a return to national bargaining were 'evenly balanced' among companies. 'There is no definitive position either way - no clear indication of what to do,' he said. He added that, if national bargaining returned, the union would have to make a 'positive response' to the needs of employers who want to introduce greater flexibility into pay deals and achieve a low-cost agreement. The union has threatened to withdraw from all its national agreements with printing employers if industry-wide bargaining is scrapped.</p>

			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Canadian Dollars falls after meek budget THE Canadian dollar and bond prices tumbled yesterday as financial markets signalled their disappointment at the federal government's unexpectedly meek assault on the deficit in its latest budget. Business leaders were virtually unanimous in criticising Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, for failing to take a bigger slice out of government spending at a time when public opinion is solidly behind greater fiscal discipline. The budget, which left the deficit for the year to March 31, 1994, unchanged from last December's forecast of CDollars 32.6bn (Pounds 16.3bn), is widely seen as an effort to avoid tough decisions before a change at the top of the ruling Progressive Conservative party in June, and the election expected between August and October. The Canadian dollar lost about a cent yesterday, closing at 78.35 US cents. The Bank of Canada also pushed up its trend-setting bank rate yesterday for only the second time in the past 12 weeks. Mr Mazankowski estimated the budget deficit for the year to March 31, 1993, at CDollars 35.5bn, about CDollars 8bn higher than his projection a year ago, and the second highest shortfall on record. He forecast that the deficit would drop to CDollars 8bn in 1997-98, eliminating the need for new borrowings. Economists queried his assumption that gross domestic product will grow by an average of more than 4 per cent a year from 1994 to 1998. Mr Lloyd Atkinson, chief economist at Bank of Montreal, warned that 'when combined with the sharp deterioration at the provincial level, Canada now faces a fiscal crisis that, if not dealt with effectively - and soon - could precipitate a national economic crisis, characterised by a much weaker Canadian dollar, sharply higher interest rates and significantly weaker growth.'</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Book Review: Skilful navigator of the money flows MONEY, CREDIT AND ASSET PRICES By Gordon Pepper Macmillan, 304 pages, Pounds 40 Although Gordon Pepper's book has been some years in the preparation, and is retrospectively based upon nearly 30 years of experience as a stockbroker, it is oddly topical. Its publication comes in the wake of February's sharp break in the global securities markets, and the negative reaction of markets this week to Monday's further quarter-point increase in short-term interest rates by the US Federal Reserve. Monetary conditions, as always, have a strong impact on asset prices. Pepper began work in 1960 in the newly launched gilt-edged department of London stockbrokers W. Greenwell. At the time, the gilt-edged market was a stuffy and introverted place, overshadowed by a buoyant postwar equity market. Yet his time would soon come. By the mid-1970s, the government had huge deficits to finance, inflation surged, the UK securities markets staged dramatic slumps and booms, and Pepper became, through the Greenwell Monetary Bulletin, the most influential financial pundit in London - in the same way that Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers became Wall Street's dominant guru. As a trained Cambridge economist and qualified actuary, Pepper brought exceptional talents to bear upon the rather mundane (in the 1960s) world of UK government securities. He found himself drawn towards the deeply unfashionable field of monetary economics in a period when Keynesianism carried all before it and monetary policy, after many years in the deep freeze, was beginning to run wild. His book appears to be a delayed encapsulation of the perceptions he gained in the 1970s and early 1980s of the impact of money flows on the securities markets. It is a gilt-edged expert's view of equities: share prices in the short term do not, he argues, depend in any substantial way upon conventional valuation factors such as dividends or profits, but primarily upon bond yields. Flows of money, he argues, explain the paradoxes that make it so hard for the man in the street to understand or trust the stock market. Share prices go up when unemployment is rising and production is weak, but just when the economy appears to be showing decent recovery - as it is now - the indices begin to stumble. It is a question of timing. In the short run, the effect of the economic recovery on the flows of funds within the economy is to reduce the surpluses that have been pushing down long-term interest rates and pushing up share prices. Pepper's department at City University Business School, where he is now professor of banking and finance, studied the UK stock market indices from 1967 to 1989. It concluded that dividends had a negligible influence on the indices within a year or two, but the gilt-edged market had quite a powerful impact over such a time period. After five years, however, the 'real' factor of dividend growth was more influential then gilts. Pepper's conclusion is: don't use the behaviour of aggregate dividends and earnings as a basis for forecasting the overall level of the stock market over a year or two (although this might not apply to individual stocks). Instead focus on the flows of funds and especially upon imbalances within the financial system. This leads on to the other main theme, the cyclical forces within the monetary economy. In the 1960s and early 1970s, for instance, UK banks used to swing from financial deficit to surplus and back again during the economic cycle. This led to predictable changes in demand for gilt-edged and sterling. Nowadays the patterns are more difficult to interpret, because most western economies have opened up to international flows of funds. Cycles in the securities markets tend to be longer, but are punctuated by sharp setbacks. Pepper does not bring his analysis sufficiently up to date in this respect (though there is a late chapter on cross-border flows). But he points out that securities markets respond strongly to an economic recession and subsequent recovery - more strongly than should be expected by believers in the efficient market hypothesis, who might assume the predictable movements in interest rates would be discounted in advance. Coming right up to the minute, for instance, why did the international bond markets respond so negatively earlier this week to the latest Fed tightening? The rise in interest rates was scarcely unexpected, and most investors expect further rises soon. Pepper's views on this particular issue are a matter for conjecture, but his general approach is to point to market participants who are forced into transactions for non-investment reasons. In certain circumstances markets can have a 'nasty feel' which professionals recognise. Imbalances are developing, and forced sellers exist. Alternatively, certain kinds of speculators may push the markets to unsustainable levels. In these conditions crowd psychology may be much more important in explaining market prices than the rational expectations of individuals which are the basis of conventional financial market theory. Unfortunately Pepper does not fully develop the relationship between his monetary approach and the efficient market analysis - for instance, in the impact of fluctuating discount rates. And too many of his examples go back to the 1970s and earlier (although there is a lengthy discussion of the 1987 stock market crash). The core of the book is in a few short early chapters. Many later sections are reprinted papers and speeches of variable vintages, which make the book appear rather disjointed. All the same, the text is full of the kind of original analysis and insights which made the Monetary Bulletin such essential reading for many years. For amateurs and professionals alike wishing to deepen their understanding of the often mysterious and counter-intuitive fluctuations in asset prices, this book provides essential reading.</p>

Of the 436 congressmen who voted, 236  rejected the measure, 193 supported it, and seven abstained.  The proposal was submitted by the general rapporteur, Deputy  Nelson Jobim (PMDB-RS) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party-Rio  Grande do Sul State]. Had the measure been approved it would  have gone into effect in 1995. It would not have been valid for  this year's elections.    The implementation of the non-compulsory vote was defended  by  Deputy Jose Genoino (PT-SP) [Workers Party-Sao Paulo State]. He  said the non-compulsory vote would rock safe electoral districts  and affect the floating vote. Jose Serra (SP) [Sao Paulo  State], the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democratic Party] leader in  the Chamber of Deputies, also defended the non-compulsory vote.  "A right should not be converted into an obligation," he  stressed.    In their speeches to the plenum, Deputies Liberato Caboclo  (PDT-SP) [Democratic Labor Party-Sao Paulo State] and Roberto  Freire (PPS-PE) [People's Socialist Party-Pernambuco State],  former government leader in the Chamber of Deputies, spoke out  against it. Caboclo said the measure would stimulate political  incapability.    Freire said the obligation to vote is a duty of the people.  "This is why the vote must be obligatory," he stressed. Senator  Josaphat Marinho (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party-Bahia State]  adopted the same line of thought, saying that to have approved  the non-compulsory vote would have "abandoned the fundamental  rules of the people."</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Tories study fresh child care tax move THE government is examining new tax relief measures aimed at encouraging small and medium-sized employers to participate in child care schemes outside the workplace, it emerged yesterday. Also under consideration are special payments or vouchers to help working mothers pay for creches and other child care during working hours. Budget reforms three years ago introduced tax relief on the use of employer-provided nurseries. That could now be extended to registered nurseries out of the workplace, allowing employees in companies that employ too few people with small children for an in-house creche to benefit if their employers contribute to local schemes. Womens' interest groups are also pressing for allowances payable to mothers whose jobs are jeopardised by the need to care for children in the afternoons or holidays. They suggest that a payment or voucher worth about Pounds 5 a week could help at a cost to the Treasury of as little as Pounds 10m a year. Mrs Angela Rumbold, Home Office minister responsible for womens' issues, is expected to see Mr John Major, the prime minister today or tomorrow to press for measures to raise the Tories' electoral appeal to women. She said last night: 'I believe that my Treasury colleagues are well aware of the political importance of making sure working women are not disgruntled.' Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, yesterday confirmed that the government was looking again at homelessness among the mentally ill. He said most of those released from long-term institutions over the past few years had found accommodation.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Property Market: New act on the fringe circuit - Opportunities beyond the Square Mile The shabby, historic fringes of the City of London provide as telling evidence of the property crash as anywhere in the UK. When the buoyant property market started to reverse into recession in the late 1980s, an immediate visible result in areas such as Southwark and Clerkenwell on the City fringes was street after street of boarded-up offices, derelict sites and brand-new but empty developments. But the City fringes are not just a unpleasant reminder of the severity of the property slump. They also present opportunities for a fundamental rethink about land use in central London. Housing, rather than offices, could become the favoured choice for empty sites in the 1990s. The case for converting offices into housing is persuasive. In Islington, 181 sites which have been granted planning permission for offices remain undeveloped, according to Applied Property Research (APR), an independent research company. Given the bleak outlook for the City's office market, it is unclear whether these schemes will ever be viable. Last summer, APR visited and photographed all 181 sites and graded them according to their office potential. They concluded that 20 per cent of the sites would never be a good office site, 63 per cent had little hope as an office site, 15 per cent could be an office site in 10 years and 2 per cent could be an office site within 5-10 years. None of the sites fell into the category 'good office site, developable within 2-5 years'. 'Much of the borough will be blighted by vacant and derelict sites until the end of the century and beyond,' says APR. The plethora of planning permissions that were granted in the 1980s bear witness to an extraordinary transformation in the perceptions of the City's fringe area over the past decade. Between mid-1982 and 1987, the rents of fringe City properties increased by 125 per cent, compared with 100 per cent in the central City area and 50 per cent for the west end, according to Hillier Parker, chartered surveyors. At its peak, rents were bid up to as high as Pounds 40 per sq ft. The fortunes of the fringe areas were closely linked with those of the City. In the run-up to Big Bang in 1987, an unprecedented level of property activity in the City forced developers to look beyond the Square Mile's traditional boundaries. The overspill went into the fringes. With the emergence of screen-based trading in the 1980s, financial institutions no longer felt bound to huddle together within the Square Mile. The need for modern offices to house the banks of computer screens also persuaded banks, brokers and related service companies to move outside the confines of the City. Some moved to the City fringes, which in turn displaced existing tenants. The pressure on the fringes provoked mixed reactions from neighbouring left-wing boroughs. These boroughs were eager to maintain their strong industrial base. But they were forced to relax their position because of a combination of factors: the decline of industry in central London; successive Conservative victories in general elections; and a substantial easing of the planning regime. The planning changes came about as a result of the 1987 Use Classes Order, in which offices, research and development and light industry were combined under a single category for planning purposes. These changes, prompted by a desire to boost businesses' flexibility and cut local government red tape, often resulted in an upturn in the number of new offices at the expense of workshops and manufacturing sites. For the councils, the attraction of granting office planing permission was the prospect of some community benefit being provided by developers, a quid pro quo which suited both sides. In the absence of any overall strategic planning in London, councils had little reason to turn down planning requests since this would probably have resulted in the loss of potential business and jobs locally. But this no longer holds; for over the past few years, the surge in demand for offices has reversed. The central London service sector has lost almost as many jobs in the past three years as it created in the previous six. And the financial services sector, which fuelled the rise in demand for offices in the City fringes, has suffered among the biggest job losses in the service sector. Rents in the City fringes have virtually halved since their peak in May 1990, according to Hillier Parker. Yet the prospects for the better City fringe office developments are not hopeless. Some buildings will attract tenants by letting individual floors; others will become serviced offices offering flexible leases to the small businesses that have always been an important part of the London economy. But the majority of tired, obsolete office buildings and vacant sites may never have a useful future unless their use is reconsidered. The oversupply of offices in the capital is matched by an undersupply of housing in its centre. The long commuting times endured by most London office workers and the high cost of housing point to an underlying shortage of residential property, even though the market is currently hard hit by recession. APR calculates that 72 per cent of the Islington sites with office planning permission were suitable for housing, if not for private residential property, then for housing associations and student hostels. Converting offices to residential uses is neither cheap or easy. The problems are greatest in the air-conditioned, glass blocks built in the 1980s, with large floor spaces and wall-to-wall sealed windows. Windows need to be blocked out and new wiring, plumbing and independent heating systems installed. Moreover, refurbishment on commercial buildings attracts value added tax, unlike residential property. It is frequently cheaper to demolish an office building and start again, rather than convert to residential property. Obtaining planning permission for office conversions can also be a problem. Residents, fearful of noisy parties, often object to planning permission being granted for student accommodation; developers warm to this type of conversion because offices divide easily into bedsits and the absence of gardens and car parking present no problems. Furthermore, councils are sometimes reluctant to allow a change of use because commercial buildings attract jobs. Conversions are not confined to Clerkenwell; similar office-to-housing changes of use are taking place in Mayfair, Battersea and even the Docklands. But what makes the City fringes more appropriate for such conversions is that the area already has the infrastructure of launderettes, shops, cafes and post offices which serve the existing community. Unlike the office ghettos of the City centre, the fringes already have a life outside the hours of nine to five.</p>

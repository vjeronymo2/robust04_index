			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TREND WATCH  </P> <P> A roundup of business developments spotted by other publications.  </P> <P> Research Link: After a 3-year test, Arbitron will soon go national with a TV  and radio ratings system it hopes will prove revolutionary. The system, called  ScanAmerica, asks participants to tell not just what they watch, but also what  they buy. A participant uses an electronic wand to scan the bar codes on  household purchases. With this added information, Arbitron can tell advertisers  whether the watchers of, say, "Knot's Landing," are more likely to include cat  food or diapers in their weekly shopping. St. Paul Pioneer Press  </P> <P> Mortgages for Movers: Barnett Mortgage of Jacksonville, Fla., and SunTrust  Mortgage of Atlanta have come up with loans for home buyers who don't plan to  own one house for the rest of their lives. The loans, called 7-30 mortgages,  offer a fixed rate for the first seven years and an option to renew at an  adjusted rate over the remaining 23 years. The advantage to new homeowners is a  lower initial rate than traditional mortgages. Florida and California, with  their transient populations, are expected to embrace the new offering, but the  loans may also attract military families, first-time home buyers and executives  who relocate frequently. St. Petersburg Times  </P> <P> Ready Cameras: Film manufacturers are taking advantage of consumers' interest  in low-end 35-millimeter cameras. Polaroid, Kodak and Fuji films will be joined  in the market by Konica's new film and a 3M product under the Scotch name. One  reason for the increased competition: 35-millimeter film sales soared 87.4% in  1989, a $254-million increase over 1988. Chain Drug Review  </P> <P> Child Labor: The Labor Department reports that 90,000 children between the ages  of 14 and 15 are working in the United States, and estimates that the United  States employs more persons under 18 than any other industrialized nation. The  numbers reflect intentional or accidental violations of U.S. law, especially in  restaurants, supermarkets, gas stations and farms. The department is concerned  not only about children's safety, but also their education. In the United  States, where 10% to 12% of high schoolers are employed, the overall literacy  rate is 75%, compared to 95% in West Germany and Japan where less than 1% of  teens work.

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity traders on the defensive tack TRADERS in the UK stock market achieved their purpose yesterday, which was to leave buy/sell commitments evenly balanced ahead of what could prove a difficult weekend for sterling. 'Flat' positions had been ordered at morning meetings at most leading securities firms and 'flat' positions had been largely achieved by the close of business. In order to achieve this happy, or at least non-threatening, state of affairs, the stock market had to close its eyes to less satisfactory developments. Sterling slipped again to close within one pfennig of its ERM floor and the latest Maastricht opinion poll from France showed a 53 per cent 'no' majority. Share prices drifted lower at first, reflecting the general lack of genuine investment interest but rallied when the Footsie dipped briefly below 2,300. The gentle recovery continued and the close the Index was unchanged from overnight. The final calculation showed the FT-SE at 2,312.6, a net one point up on the day. Strategists remained apprehensive, believing that the stock market is still vulnerable to interest rate worries. Seaq volume slipped to 339.5m shares from the 474.1m of the previous session. Fund managers remained on the sidelines yesterday, and retail business was believed to be no better than the Pounds 878.6m recorded on Thursday. However, Sharelink, Britain's largest execution-only broker, said that its largely private client business has been weighted heavily on the buy side again this week. The stock market, pre-occupied with its own internal factors, paid little heed to currencies for most of the session, although it grew nervous at the close when sterling eased and the D-Mark headed the ERM range. However, equity trading had closed in London before the EC's monetary committee ruled out a realignment of the EMS currencies. UK share traders went home for the three day Bank Holiday weekend in the UK, wondering if the currency picture will have changed by the time they return to work on Tuesday. Interest-related stocks, including the stores, moved narrowly around overnight levels and the brewery and leisure sectors found little support as the market continued to digest the previous day's trading statement from Scottish &amp; Newcastle. However, buyers came in for pharmaceuticals, safe havens at a time of global economic recession. Retail business remains very poor, even by the standards of a holiday period. Business levels are barely profitable for securities firms.</p>

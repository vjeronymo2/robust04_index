			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Autonomous Region Party Committee's Policy </F> Research Office: "What Are the Peasants Thinking? A Survey of  Peasant Households in the Region"]    [Text] Recently, 275 cadres of Hedi county in the  Autonomous Region fanned out into the rural areas to conduct a  large-scale peasant households survey; they came to understand  peasants desires and demands through direct investigation into  the basic conditions in rural areas and face-to-face contacts  and exchanges with both the rural grass-roots cadres and  peasants themselves.  <H5>  I. Reactions of Peasants </H5>   A. The survey shows that 95.4 percent of the households  considered the situation in rural area to be generally good, but  60.5 percent were ambivalent; while pleased that conditions are  generally good, the peasants were worried that there are still  numerous problems of concern to them. The situation is generally  good, they felt, because the policy on contract responsibility  remains effective, that this good policy was not altered but has  continued to be refined since coming into effect; that under  market guidance, rural production and the rural economy are on  track to stable development and the trend shows that grain  production and income are on the increase; and that rural  livelihood has improved markedly and the peasants are fully  confident that they will become well-off.    With respect to problems in rural areas which have remained  unsolved, however, the peasants expressed a great deal of  concerns. 1) A majority of the households felt that agriculture  is still in an unfavorable environment today, and some peasants  compared the situation to two persistent sicknesses of "malaria"  and "edema," [waxing and waning in enthusiasm for agriculture on  one hand and an excessively bloated condition on the other] for  although agriculture has long been considered to occupy an  important position [in the economy], it is basically still weak.  If the two "sicknesses" were not cured, it would be difficult  for rural areas and the rural economy to advance to the next  stage. 2) 87.4 percent were very much worried that policy  measures designed to protect them and agriculture will continue,  particularly measures to increase government input in  agriculture, reduce the social burdens on peasants, control the  unhealthy tendencies, and permit and encourage peasants to seek  employment in secondary and tertiary industries in the cities.  3) The peasants surveyed anxiously looked forward to seeing  their agricultural production and enterprises get in the market  channels as soon as possible and having their income increased,  but the gap between their need and the actual situation remains  considerable. The survey demonstrates that irrational structure  in rural enterprises is the greatest inhibiting factor. In 1992,  among model village households, the ratios of income derived  from grain, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline products and  fishery were 73:3:17:2:5; the ratios of income from growing  grain versus cash and other crops were 79:13:8, and nonfarm  income was 40 percent of total income. In 24.3 percent of model  village households, the per capita income was as low as 300  yuan. 4) The pressure of agricultural surplus labor in rural  areas is increasingly severe. The annual labor transfer rate in  model village households is only 0.8 percent, and one-third of  the labor force is idle reflecting a trend of declining labor  productivity; in over 70 percent of the households, real income  is showing slow growth or negative growth.    B. On rural reforms and rural policies, the survey shows  that  the peasants placed their greatest hope in both these areas, and  their major demand is that reforms should be pursued even more  rigorously to achieve breakthroughs proceeding on a foundation  of basic policy stability. 1) 77.3 percent of the households  felt that the joint household contract responsibility system  should remain unchanged over the long term; 48.5 percent felt  that changes would not be necessary in contract land and that  the system can operate satisfactorily by voluntary transfer [of  contract land]. 2) 54.2 percent considered that application of  reforms and other policy measures should differentiate among  households and not treat all of them equally, for income  discrepancy is normal and some people should be permitted to  become well-off first; but 28.9 percent felt that from the start  attention should be paid to preventing the gap between rich and  poor from growing too wide, and achieving common prosperity  through coordinated reform policy measures. 3) All 100 percent  of the households felt that rural reforms and policies should  focus on the crucial issues of assisting peasants achieve  breakthroughs in a market economy within a broad framework,  particularly in breaking down the duality which divides urban  and rural areas, and adjusting the enterprise structure and  social services system. 4) 49.3 percent felt that further  efforts should be made to perfect policy and reform measures and  to coordinate with other plans as important as those for a  market economy.    In the survey, the peasants revealed four difficult issues  in  rural reform that must be addressed and resolved: First, the  discrepancy between urban and rural reforms whereby many  measures which benefit rural economic development and increase  rural income cannot be implemented because of incompatibility  with urban reforms. Second, with policies being formulated in  different quarters, forceful coordination and supervision of  policy implementation are lacking, and peasants themselves could  hardly resolve policies which are contradictory; some good  policies lack firmness and corollary measures to ensure their  implementation; at present, insufficiently firm policies are a  particularly notable problem. Third, the lack of clear-sighted  policies which affect the crucial question of economic  development today. Policies which peasants have anxiously  awaited are still pending, creating numerous difficulties which  peasants cannot solve in a timely way under condition of a  market economy. Fourth, propaganda and education for peasants on  reform policies are inadequate. Channels for peasants to learn  about and understand these policies are limited, and feedback on  peasants needs is not timely which affects the enthusiasm of  peasants to participate in implementing the policies.    C. Views toward the rural areas and economy. On evaluating  the enthusiasm for production, especially grain production,  views of the peasants varied considerably. The survey indicates  that 59.3 percent of the households considered there is a future  if agriculture is handled well; 63.4 percent felt that to ensure  adequate grain production, continued efforts are required; 60.2  percent felt that with grain prices freed, and if grain can be  sold under such conditions, they would be willing to increase  input in agricultural production; and more than 90 percent felt  that even if a large part of the labor force were diverted to  various nonfarm pursuits and enterprises, contract land should  not be abandoned.    The peasants surveyed also gave their reactions to the  various factors which affect grain production enthusiasm under  the present system. 1) 40.7 percent felt that if the relative  benefits of agriculture were to continue to decline and the  grain market remained in its slump, they would consider  abandoning farming; 2) 56.4 percent felt that when more grain is  grown than can be sold, "prices obviously would drop given the  glut in supplies." Some considered that given the current  situation of grain in surplus and money in short supply, it is  more important to hang on to cash and wait to see if protective  policy measures would have any effect in reviving prices; 3)  16.2 percent felt that the current shortage of capital has  resulted in insufficient agricultural input, and fragmentation  of land use has affected raising of agricultural productivity.    On the various avenues for developing the rural economy,  views of the rural cadres and peasants are: 1) Developing the  rural economy should begin by developing various forms of  enterprises. Household enterprises should be preserved and their  enterprise structure adjusted according to market demands. 2) It  is necessary to take advantage of any opportunity to adjust the  enterprise structure, particularly by allowing different forms  of ownership to freely evolve in rural enterprises. In 1992, the  income peasants households derived from rural enterprises was  only 18.8 percent of their total income, lower than the national  average but with considerable growth potential. 3) The  collective economy should be firmly supported. In 1992 the  villages surveyed had fixed assets valued at 35,318,500 yuan,  averaging 318,100 yuan per village, which constituted an  important productive force in the rural areas. To develop the  collective economy at the village level, it is necessary to  perfect a dual-level operating system by vigorously developing  basic infrastructure enterprises, rural enterprises and  strengthened services for rural areas.    D. Views on development of the rural society. The survey  shows the peasants to be eager for more rapid social development  in the rural areas: 1) 85.7 percent felt that the pace of social  development in rural areas should be stepped up; 90.5 percent  would be willing to contribute some capital or labor toward  building up and improving the rural areas and markets. 2) 82.6  percent felt that small cities, townships and market towns  should be built up. 3) 27.8 percent indicated they would  consider settling in such small cities, townships and market  towns.    In social development, which aspects should be emphasized in  the near term? The peasants generally felt that building  infrastructure facilities is important. 1) 51.6 percent felt  that priority should be given to building up townships and  villages to meet requirements of a developing market economy;  25.1 percent felt that social development should benefit village  residents and improve village appearance; 22.4 percent felt that  the focus should be on unifying water supply system to solve  problems of potable and clean water. 2) 41.9 percent expressed  concern over their feeling of insecurity due to the poor public  security in certain parts of the region where such cases are  increasing in number; they therefore felt that safety and  security of peasant households should be given priority in any  social development. 3) 92.4 percent advocated vigorous promotion  and building of spiritual culture. All the households without  exception wanted the authorities to grasp the problems with both  hands and resolutely carry out the basic tasks of improving the  peasant society.    On promoting a spiritual culture, views of the peasants are:  1) Propaganda on law and order is inadequate, building of a  legal system has been lagging, and understanding of the concept  of a legal system is weak. On law and order propaganda, 50.3  percent said it has been sporadic; 18.9 percent said there has  been no such propaganda. 2) The building of a spiritual culture  is considered a soft task and this is reflected in work the  government carries out in rural areas. 3) Many aspects of  building a spiritual culture are divorced from the reality of  peasants life, and activities which emphasize only form without  firm substantive objectives have produced [unfavorable] side  effects among the peasants. 4) Building a spiritual culture will  naturally take a period of time and must take into account both  [agricultural] production and the reality of peasants life. More  than one-half of the households surveyed suggested that  henceforth government work teams should be trained before they  are sent to rural areas to carry out model propaganda education  on a regular basis.    E. Views toward grass-roots level development. According to  estimates by agricultural cadres, 82 percent of the households  considered the behavior of grass-roots level cadres to be good  or basically good; 85.6 percent felt that the cadre-peasant  relationship is harmonious. The peasants also felt, however,  that there are too many such cadres, that "many dragons are not  necessarily needed to fight drought." In model villages, there  is an average of 5.8 cadres per village. The peasants felt that  the basis of their assignment should be sending small numbers of  well-trained cadres, numbers which peasants can afford to  support and which will also fully demonstrate the cadre  enthusiasm and potentials.    Improving the grass-roots level cadres means first improving  the party rank and file, that is the relatively uniform view of  the peasants surveyed. The survey shows that 38.5 percent of the  households felt that a majority of party rank and file are  effective, but 18.9 percent do not have a very good basic  impression of them in the rural areas.  <H5>  II. Hopes, Opinions and Demands of Peasants </H5>   The peasants surveyed expressed some of their hopes,  opinions  and demands which may be summed up in terms of the following:    1. The peasants hoped that leaders at every level will visit  rural areas, and come to their villages and households for  face-to-face conversations and draw out what is in their hearts.  At present, the real situation in rural areas becomes diluted as  it is reported upward level by level, and there is discrepancy  between propaganda and reality, e.g. over the extent to which  peasants are supposed to be well-off today.    2. They hoped that central and local governments will be  resolute in applying real efforts to carry work in rural areas;  if agriculture is considered the foundation of the national  economy, then work in this area should be given that degree of  emphasis; with agriculture the topic of meetings, slogans and  government documents, the peasants anxiously hoped that this  emphasis will lead quickly to many good policies which will  benefit them when implemented.    3. The party holds peasants in high regard and gives them an  important political status, the peasants surveyed were most  grateful and pleased. But despite the high political status,  peasants felt that if they were not able to catch up  economically, their social status will not be any higher. Today  the urban-rural gap is getting wider, and the peasants though  anxious cannot do anything about this; they therefore hoped that  their leaders will truly open up the gates to the cities, tear  down the "bamboo wattled wall," give more thoughts to how to  increase peasants income, narrow the [rural and urban]  discrepancy in incomes, and draw closer together the hearts and  minds of both rural and urban residents.    4. Stabilizing and perfecting basic policies for rural areas  please all the peasants surveyed. While at this time it is  correct to emphasize stabilization of the joint household  responsibility system, it is not enough, for many other policies  should also be stabilized. For example, some peasants were  afraid that the policy allowing them to develop individual  enterprises may change and therefore held back from trying.    5. They hoped that as in the 1950s and 1960s, the  authorities  will integrate and blend together support coming from all  quarters for the rural areas, and assist peasants to develop the  economy and increase their income. In such a context, any action  which hurts, cheats, discriminates, oppresses or tries to  shallow up the peasants will immediately evoke a reaction such  as that of people crying out to kill a rat seen running across  the street.    6. Rural education is a major task of concern to several  generations of peasants, and education should be the first task  in developing the rural areas. Today, the transition in  agriculture is difficult for peasants to manage, but many do so  in the interest of their next generations. To help the rural  economy become prosperous, the peasants hoped the government  will do its best in the task of education.    7. To improve public security in society, it is necessary to  begin in rural areas; if it is not done well there, and rural  areas are insecure, then this will affect the cities. A  coordinated approach to improving public security requires that  attention be given to both urban and rural areas.    8. In dealing with corruption, major cases must not be  allowed to drag on, and issues of administrative corruption must  first be dealt with. At present, action to redress unhealthy  tendencies in the enterprises has not been adequate, and the  peasants hoped that more effort will be made. The best approach  would be to focus on the worst model and openly attack it within  a broad framework.    9. More efforts should be made to train leadership cadres  for  rural areas. Selected for training should be persons of ability  who think for themselves, who work with their hands and who rely  on their labor and talent to produce wealth.  <H5>  III. Issues That Require Effective Implementation </H5>   Judging by the situation revealed in this large-scale  households survey, and considering the coming period of  intensified rural reforms and accelerated development of the  rural economy, the following issues will require major  implementation efforts from a macro standpoint:    1. Strengthen and nurture the basic rural enterprise units  by  stabilizing the overall situation in rural areas. Survey results  demonstrate that in the Autonomous Region, the work in  stabilizing and perfecting the household contract responsibility  system in the context of a dual-level enterprise system has been  effective and should continue. In perfecting both systems,  reforms and policies should aim at solving new contradictions  that emerge, particularly on the key issue that in rural  economic development, rural households be made the basic  enterprise units which need to accommodate demands of a  developing market-based economy. To raise the level of household  enterprises, we need to promote rural market development. At the  same time, our policy should create advantageous conditions for  building and perfecting socialized services for the rural areas.    2. Vigorously develop high-quality and high-efficiency  agriculture and raise the benefit ratio of agriculture. To  achieve this type of agriculture, it is necessary to put  economic efficiency and market demands first as we change from  concentrating on quantitative increase in production to  emphasizing raising qualitative benefits. We should aim for  major breakthroughs in reforms by vigorously adjusting the rural  enterprise structure, establishing conditions favorable to  market development of pillar enterprises within the Autonomous  Region, accelerating development of enterprises with good  benefits ratios, vigorously developing new enterprises, and  promoting the unification of production and sales. We should aim  to combine breakthroughs in key areas with growth in all areas,  to establish agricultural model demonstration areas, and to  intensify development of improved product variety, grade and  quality.    3. Through breakthrough reform of the households  registration  system, accelerate unification of rural and urban areas. An  important aspect of the deepening rural reforms is to break down  the dual economic setup and system. We should first remove  restrictions on rural households then encourage the peasants to  take jobs in secondary and tertiary industries in cities,  townships and market towns and, through the momentum and  indirect effects of this trend, promote social development in  rural areas and unification of rural and urban areas.    4. To put agriculture and the rural economy within the  overall national economic strategy, support further multifaceted  development. We should effectively implement the "agricultural  law," guarantee that financial input in agriculture will  increase by fixed percentages on a yearly basis, widen the scope  of credit support for agricultural development and adjust the  rural enterprise structure. We should support internal liquidity  of agricultural cooperative funds. We should develop new  approaches and measures to provide overall social support to  agriculture and activities in rural areas, and develop various  kinds of alliances and cooperations.    5. Based on demands created by the changing economic system,  strengthen the building of a spiritual culture. To do so  requires that we strengthen efforts to deal with the basic  tasks, change our approach from focussing on form to  concentrating on substance, and take into account peasants  thinking and rural reality in developing effective activities.  In the current period and foreseeable future, we need to  administer the rural areas according to regulations and allow  democratic management to come to the fore.    6. Earnestly strengthen the leadership for work in rural  areas. First, we should quickly establish a consolidated  leadership structure for work in rural areas under the direct  supervision of the party and government, strengthen organization  and coordination of any work with peasants, and carry out  effective analysis and supervision of policy measures and  macro-level guidance. Second, based on demands of the Central  Government, built basic-level organizations in rural areas in  stages within a three to five year period. We should concentrate  on improving the party organization before any basic-level  organizations in rural areas, educating party members before  rural cadres, raising the quality of party rank and file before  the peasants, and finally developing and shaping teams of party  cadres who possess firm and forceful leadership and can take the  lead [to energize the masses]. Third, change and improve on  methods to evaluate performance of leadership by using peasants  real income increase as criterion to judge effectiveness of the  cadre teams and of the support given by leadership and  government departments at every level for developing the rural  economy and increasing peasants income.</p>

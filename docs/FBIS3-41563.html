Levels of five air pollutants, including nitrogen oxide and  suspended particulate matter (SPM), were measured by general  monitoring stations in residential areas, and by special  automobile exhaust monitors along the nation's highways.    Less than half of the monitoring stations in Tokyo, Osaka  and  other metropolitan areas recorded levels of nitrogen oxide below  the environmentally safe standard.    Throughout the nation, 97.4 percent of the general  monitoring  stations and 71.4 percent of the highway monitors recorded a  level of nitrogen oxide below the environmental standard of 0.06  parts per million.    The figures show an improvement of 3.3 percentage points at  general monitoring stations and 8.6 percentage points at highway  monitors over the previous year.    In Tokyo and the Osaka-Kobe region, however, only 46.1  percent of the highway monitoring stations recorded levels at or  below the environmental standard, even with tougher automobile  exhaust laws in those areas.    The number of highway monitors failing to reach the  environmental standard increased in Aichi, Kyoto, Okayama,  Hiroshima, Fukuoka, and Nagasaki, suggesting air pollution is  spreading in those metropolitan areas.    Meanwhile, the number of monitoring stations recording safe  levels of SPM increased by 7.9 points to 57.6 percent, and by  3.4 points at highway monitoring stations to 33.5 percent.    The environmental standard is a daily average of less than  0.1 milligrams of SPM per 1 cubic meter.    Tokyo, Gunma, Saitama and Yamanashi failed to have a single  monitoring station record the recommended standard.    Exhaust from diesel engines is said to cause 20 to 40  percent  of the SPM in the atmosphere.</p>

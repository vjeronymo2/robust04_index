			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. GEARING FOR CUTBACKS OF $85 BILLION  </P> <P> As things stand now, if Congress and the White House fail to reach a budget  agreement by midnight Sunday, the federal government will have to slash its  spending by a staggering $85 billion, causing sharp cutbacks in services that  will quickly be felt by millions of Americans.  </P> <P> Sharp reductions in money for programs -- and the furloughing of thousands of  federal employees -- would disrupt commercial air traffic, reduce access to  national parks, cause delays at ports of entry and trigger shortages of fresh  meats, weather forecasts and even coins.  </P> <P> That is but a sampling of the potentially far-reaching consequences of a  continuing budget stalemate that could, under the Gramm-Rudman deficit  reduction law, mandate unprecedented across-the-board spending cuts throughout  the federal bureaucracy.  </P> <P> Even mail delivery, which relies on commercial night flights, would probably be  affected.  </P> <P> Late Friday, Budget Director Richard G. Darman ordered all department heads to  be prepared to close down their agencies Monday morning if negotiators do not  reach a budget accord by the Sunday night deadline. He said passage of a  stopgap spending bill was "unlikely."  </P> <P> Some essential services or agencies are exempt from the automatic cuts --  including salaries for military personnel and benefits under Social Security,  disability and workers' compensation, Medicaid, food stamps and most other  welfare programs.  </P> <P> But, even in those areas, the widespread furloughing of federal employees is  likely to cause sharp reductions in business hours, delays in processing of  applications and possibly huge backlogs that could affect government services  for months.  </P> <P> There are these examples:  </P> <P>  -- Some of the most severe effects of the spending cuts would be felt by the  nation's air traffic control system, where cutbacks in work hours of air  controllers would force cancellation of about 3,000 scheduled flights a day.  </P> <P> LAT  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / International Company News: New chairman shows legal cool THE loss of six board directors in as many days, the announcement of a ADollars 256.8m bottom-line loss, and the need to grapple with more than ADollars 1bn worth of balance sheet debt, might seem like a severe headache for anyone. But Fred Millar, former senior partner of a Sydney law firm and now faced with the unenviable task of leading Australian transport conglomerate TNT out of its troubles, was playing it cool yesterday. 'If I could be assured of as much fun as I've been having recently, I'd stay on forever,' the new chairman remarked, with only a hint of sarcasm, when the question of his own tenure was raised. Shareholders may be slightly less sanguine. While the past week's boardroom upheavals at the transport group have helped to clarify the future strategy, analysts have few doubts that there is an uphill task ahead. TNT shares, which were trading at over ADollars 3 in the late 1980s, now stand at ADollars 1.38. Dividends were axed last year, and are unlikely to restart before 1995. Perhaps the least of TNT's problems are now in the boardroom. Last week's departure of Sir Peter Abeles, the rags-to-riches tycoon who arrived from Hungary in 1949 and quickly built up the Alltran trucking company which later merged with Thomas Nationwide Transport, marks the end of an era. Sir Peter, colourful and controversial, once ruled TNT in autocratic style, but stepped down as managing director last year. His dramatic departure from the board last week - along with four other directors - followed disagreements over how the group should tackle its parlous balance sheet. The net result was to leave control firmly in the hands of Mr Millar and TNT's new, lower profile managing director, Mr David Mortimer. Yesterday, Mr Millar indicated that some of the boardroom vacancies will be filled, but that the total number of directors would probably shrink. Much more delicate, even without Sir Peter's distracting influence, is the question of how TNT addresses its debt burden. According to Mr Mortimer, net debt on the balance sheet stands at around ADollars 1.12bn. More than ADollars 400m falls due for repayment in the current year, and a similar amount in fiscal 1995. Mr Mortimer's solution centres on a continued asset sale programme, which has already raised some ADollars 220m, and which should bring in another ADollars 200m over the next 12 months. On top of that, Commonwealth Bank of Australia last week provided a new ADollars 252m facility, and TNT has said that it is 'actively exploring opportunities for a significant capital raising'. Mr Mortimer is not inclined to talk about timing or numbers - but rumours of some form of quasi-equity offering in the ADollars 300m range have circulated recently. Will that suffice? 'Fiscal 1994 has never been the problem,' said one analyst at Baring Brothers yesterday. 'The question has always been 1995. With the CBA facility, they're some way towards helping the situation.' The third challenge is operating performance. Here, analysts saw some grounds for encouragement in the latest figures. The large bottom-line losses contained some hefty abnormal items, and TNT was quick to stress that there was a slim ADollars 14.2m operating profit before these charges (on an equity-accounted basis). This compared with a ADollars 75m operating deficit in the previous 12 months. But, examined more closely, the results concealed some mixed performances. On the plus side, the Australian freight and transport operations were back in the black, while the domestic freight operations in Germany, Italy and the UK held their ground and contributed satisfactorily. The same could not be said for the Spanish business, whose deterioration was blamed largely on the economy. Meanwhile, TNT's share of the losses at GD Express Worldwide, its 50 per cent-owned international express freight venture, stood at ADollars 48.3m before abnormal items. On the last front, TNT says that an eight-part restructuring plan is being implemented, aimed at cutting costs and improving efficiency. The objective is to eliminate losses by June 1995. Whether that is possible remains to be seen. The final piece of good news, meanwhile, was a positive contribution from Ansett, the airline business owned jointly by TNT and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Accordingly, TNT is no longer in a hurry to leave the business, saying that its 50 per cent holding is 'not considered for sale,' although the company does back plans to bring new investors into Ansett. In fact, Mr Millar was keen to emphasise the point: 'Ansett is not causing TNT any problem at the moment,' he said firmly, seeming relieved to be spared one headache at least.</p>

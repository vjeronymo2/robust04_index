			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Czech Statistical Office report: "Foreign Trade of the </F> Czech Republic Developed Successfully in 1993"]    [Text] The trade balance ended with a surplus of 5.9  billion korunas [Kc], while changes in the territorial structure  continued, particularly as a result of the Slovak Republic  becoming a foreign trading partner. Firms that used to deal  with Slovak enterprises had to start using customs documents and  transfer from domestic to foreign trading relations. Changes  also continued in the structure of imports and exports according  to the individual categories of goods. The share of fuels and  raw materials in imports declined in comparison with the  preceding year. The share of machines and vehicles in exports  increased. While import prices declined, export prices rose,  and real trade relations developed favorably.    If we do not include trade with Slovakia, for which there  are  no 1992 data, in comparison with the preceding year, exports  grew faster than imports in 1993. While exports grew by 20  percent, imports rose by only 2.7 percent. The volume of  foreign trade increased by 10.6 percent.    The total value of imports, including imports from Slovakia,  reached Kc366.4 billion, and the total value of exports,  including exports to Slovakia, amounted to Kc372.3 billion. The  trade balance was in surplus each month until May, there was a  small deficit in June, and this trend continued in July as the  deficit grew. Then there was a surplus in August, September,  and October, while the balance showed a deficit again in  November and December.    From the territorial vantage point, the share of the total  foreign trade turnover (including trade with Slovakia, which is  responsible for 18.9 percent of the total) with states with an  advanced market economy amounted to 58 percent (European Union  [EU] states 43 percent and EFTA [European Free Trade  Association] countries 10.4 percent), the former Soviet Union to  8.7 percent, developing countries 6.8 percent, European states  with transitional economies (except for the former USSR) 6.1  percent, and states with a state trade system 1.5 percent.    According to preliminary calculations, in January to  November  1993, import prices declined by 1.1 percent in comparison with  the same period of the preceding year, and the physical volume  of imports rose by more than 17 percent. Export prices rose by  2 percent, while the physical volume of exports rose by 15  percent. Real trade relations reached a value of 103.1 points.    In trade with the Slovak Republic, imports reached Kc65  billion in 1993, and exports Kc74.6 billion. The trade surplus  amounted to Kc9.6 billion. Industrial goods were dominant in  the exchange of goods and raw materials, with 33.8 percent of  total imports and 26.3 percent of total exports, and machines  and vehicles, with 23.8 percent of total imports and 25.9  percent of total exports.    Imports from countries with an advanced market economy rose  by 7.5 percent in 1993 in comparison with the preceding year,  and exports to these countries by 24.2 percent. The trade  balance was in deficit to the tune of Kc12.1 billion, but there  was a surplus of Kc7.5 billion in trade with EU countries.  Trade with the EFTA countries resulted in a deficit of Kc12.0  billion. The single most important trading partner among these  countries was the FRG, with a 26 percent share of the total  turnover of Czech foreign trade, followed by Austria (6.9  percent) and Italy (4.9 percent). Imports were dominated by  machines and vehicles, which made up almost half of all goods  and materials; exports by industrial goods with a 31.9 percent  share of the total. Trade with the OECD countries also  flourished. Imports from these countries reached Kc209.9  billion, increasing by 7.5 percent in comparison with the  preceding year; exports amounted to Kc200 billion and increased  by 24.1 percent. The trade showed a deficit of Kc9.9 billion.    Imports from the developing countries increased by 8.7  percent and exports to this region by 29.2 percent, in  comparison with 1992. The trade surplus amounted to Kc13.5  billion. Almost 30 percent of imports were food and livestock,  and 35.6 percent were machines and vehicles. About 45 percent  of exports were machines and vehicles, and, at almost 38  percent, the industrial goods share was also high. The so-called  Asian tigers (Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, and  Malaysia) have become interesting partners. They contributed  only 2 percent to the total volume of Czech foreign trade, but  the exchange of goods with these countries is growing fast.  Imports increased by 38.9 percent and exports by 65.8 percent,  in comparison with 1992.    Imports from the European states with transitional  economies,  excluding the former Soviet Union, increased by 4.6 percent,  while exports declined by 11.9 percent. The trade surplus  amounted to Kc8.5 billion. The largest trading partner in this  group was Poland, with a 2.7-percent share of total foreign  trade, and Hungary, with 1.7 percent. The Czech Republic mostly  exported industrial goods to these countries (31 percent of  total exports) and machines and vehicles (24.3 percent).  Approximately 20 percent of total imports were mineral fuels,  lubricants, and related products, industrial goods, machines,  and vehicles.    The trade surplus achieved with states with the state trade  system--the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Laos, China,  Cuba, Vietnam, Mongolia--amounted to Kc6.3 billion. The volume  of imports from these countries was 32.6 percent higher than in  1992, and exports almost tripled. Dominant in imports were  various finished products, with 50 percent of the total; in  exports it was industrial goods, with 55.5 percent of the total,  and machines and vehicles, with 43.8 percent.    Imports from the former Soviet Union steadily declined to  80.1 percent of the 1992 volume. Exports remained approximately  at the level of the preceding year. The trade deficit amounted  to Kc19.8 billion. In the structure of imports, according to  the category of goods, imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and  related products were dominant because crude oil and natural gas  are in this category, which accounted for 71 percent of the  total. The largest category of exported goods was machines and  vehicles (45 percent). The same share of exports, approximately  15 percent, was taken by food, livestock, and industrial goods.    In the structure of imports, according to categories of  goods, the share of imports of mineral fuels, lubricants, and  related products declined in 1993 in comparison with the  preceding year by 3.1 percent to 12.4 percent of total imports.  In 1993, 5.6 million tonnes of oil were imported (7 million  tonnes in 1992) and 7 billion cubic meters (6.8 billion) of  natural gas. The share of imported machines and vehicles also  declined by 3.1 percent, to 38.4 percent. The share of imported  finished products of all kinds increased by 2.7 percent to 12  percent, industrial goods by 1.8 percent to 12.1 percent, and  chemicals by 1.7 percent to 11.5 percent.    The structure of exports according to categories of goods  was  characterized in 1993, as compared with 1992, by the growing  share of machines and vehicles (by 2.4 percent), which reached  27.8 percent of total exports. On the other hand, the share of  food and livestock declined by 2 percent to 6.1 percent. The  export share of the most important category of goods, industrial  products (at 31.9 percent of total exports), marginally declined.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Arts: European Community Youth Orchestra THE European Community Youth Orchestra has been in existence for 14 years, drawing its members from music colleges and conservatoires across the community and coming together twice yearly for rehearsals and tours. Out of its ranks have grown the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the Gustav Mahler Jugendorchester, as well as a host of smaller groups. From the beginning, the ECYO's standards have been astonishingly high, and its roster of conductors matches that of any orchestra in the world  - from Abbado (who was the first artistic director) and Karajan to Bernstein, Solti and Haitink. The current tour is shared between Carlo Maria Giulini and Mstislav Rostropovich. Giulini conducted performances of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony in Switzerland and the Low Countries, while Rostropovich's concerts take him from Luxembourg to Britain to Greece and back to France and Italy. His two programmes consist of works by the composers with whom he has been most closely associated as cellist and conductor, Britten, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. The Britten is the War Requiem, which the ECYO brought to Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Monday. The soloists were Makvala Kasrashvili, Ian Caley and David Wilson-Johnson, with the London Symphony Chorus, the St Michael's Singers and the boy choristers of Coventry Cathedral. It was a bold, thrilling performance, full of grandeur and drama, starkly characterised by Rostropovich. He concentrated his efforts entirely on the chorus and main orchestra, recruiting Christopher Bell to direct the chamber ensemble and male soloists. There were a few problems of continuity; in the second half of the requiem, always difficult to sustain after the fury of the Dies Irae has passed, the performance had to ride some awkward gear changes. Invariably, Rostropovich was able to raise the emotional temperature in the noisiest passages but nevertheless the impression this time was of an artful patchwork, almost formulaic in its use of the Wilfred Owen poems to undercut the blandishments of the Latin mass. The very best versions of the War Requiem manage to disguise that weakness entirely. Ms Kasrashvili's wide vibrato and fearsome attack were well matched to soprano lines conceived by Britten for the Slavonic timbre of Galina Vishnevskaya, Rostropovich's wife. Caley's thin, reedy tenor was more pleasing in duet than in the solo settings, but Wilson-Johnson was magnificent, concentrating attention on every word, judging the nuances of the text perfectly, wringing out their irony and anguish. Both male soloists were placed well to the right of the Symphony Hall platform, and revealed an unexpected directional bias in the acoustics: when Wilson-Johnson in particular sang straight ahead his voice appeared blurred; only when he turned slightly towards the centre did it snap into sharp focus. Against that blemish however, must be set the wonderful handling of the choral sound, absolutely distinct from triple piano to the loudest forte, and the wealth of luminous detail in the orchestral textures. * * * Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony was the main work in the ECYO's Prom on Saturday, a serious, intense account which was a fine illustration of the way in which Rostropovich's approach as a conductor has settled and matured. It is not damning with faint praise to describe the Eleventh as the best of Shostakovich's neglected symphonies; it was written to celebrate the events of 1905 in St Petersburg when the Tsar's troops fired on unarmed demonstrators, and no doubt its socialist realism has told against it in some quarters. Leaving aside the programme, though, it stands as a coherent symphonic structure in its own right - four hefty movements built around fragments of political songs, with a grave funeral march at its core, and a finale of urgent drama. The ECYO conveyed it magnificently - the orchestra's brass section was outstanding here and in the Britten - and provided the accompaniment for a startling performance of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. The soloist was Martha Argerich on her most electrifying form, defying the conductor and orchestra to outdo her in vividness and attack. That they failed to meet the challenge was no disgrace at all; this was playing of a quality that few living pianists could approach in this work. London, Royal Albert Hall; Birmingham, Symphony Hall. The ECYO tour is sponsored by the Commission of the European Community and Digital Equipment Corporation</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians rescue Greek oranges STRONG DEMAND from Russia this winter has helped to compensate Greek orange growers for lost market share in the European Community. Exports of oranges reached 262,700 tonnes, a 13.6 per cent rise from last year, according to the Greek Fruit Exporters' Association. The Soviet Union had been Greece's biggest customer for citrus fruit, taking about 250,000 tonnes every winter. But demand collapsed with its break-up and the demise of the state purchasing system and Russian importers bought a paltry 3,500 tonnes in the winter of 1991-92. This winter, however, they were back with a vengeance, buying more than 150,000 tonnes. 'Citrus fever overtook the Russians this winter. We could have sold them practically the whole Greek crop, if it were possible to ship it all,' said Mr George Frangistas of Gefra, one of Greece's largest fruit exporters. Gefra exported about 48,000 tonnes of oranges to Russia, selling mainly to small private import companies, he said. However, Greek orange exports to other EC countries fell by 61 per cent over the same period to 15,100 tonnes, most of which went to Germany. Following a much-improved harvest, exports of lemons reached 35,900 tonnes, compared with only 8,800 tonnes last winter. But Russian importers showed no interest in Greek lemons but demand was lively in other eastern European countries. Increasing competition from Spanish and Italian producers has steadily eroded Greece's share of the EC market and Greek orange producers can no longer claim subsidies for exporting elsewhere in the EC.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Abbey Life The inexorable rise of bancassurance has been at least slowed by recession. Black Horse Financial Services, which sells to Lloyds Bank customers, had little more luck selling regular premium savings products in the first half of the year than other life insurance companies. Unit trust sales took up the slack as savers moved out of low-yielding deposit accounts. But that business offers lower margins than selling traditional life products, and might be expected to tail off. The question, then, is whether Black Horse will regain momentum as the economy turns. The tougher disclosure rules proposed by the Treasury might help. Lower administration and sales costs should be more of a competitive advantage once customers are presented with such information in clear terms. This is assuming Black Horse can come up with a convincing formula of what its sales costs are. But having made an initial trawl through its captive audience of Lloyds' customers, it may find winning new business tougher from here on.</p>

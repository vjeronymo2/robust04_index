			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN WHO RAN OVER WIFE ARRESTED IN ALLEGED BEATING OF HER  </P> <P> Costa Mesa resident Jerry Allen Holland, who ended an argument with his wife by  driving their 2-ton pickup truck over her three times in April, was arrested  Thursday morning for allegedly beating her, police said.  </P> <P> The 24-year-old man was arrested at his home on the 300 block of Ogle Street  after police received a call from his wife, Lindy Sue Holland, who reported  that her husband had assaulted her, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Sam Cordeiro said.  </P> <P> Holland was being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail on  suspicion of beating his wife.  </P> <P> Cordeiro said the woman told police that her husband woke her early Thursday  and started beating her for no apparent reason, which led to the call to  police. The 33-year-old woman had red, swollen marks on her arms and her left  ankle, Cordeiro said.  </P> <P> At the couple's home Thursday afternoon, Lindy Holland said she did not want to  talk about the alleged beating.  </P> <P> "This has been a very emotional time. . . . I just can't talk about it right  now," she cried as she retreated into the couple's home on a quiet Costa Mesa  street.  </P> <P> Only 2 weeks earlier, the woman requested that her husband be released from  jail after he ran over her with their truck after she refused to give him her  $400 paycheck, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher P. Kralick said.  </P> <P> Kralick declined to say whether Holland would be charged in the latest  incident.  </P> <P> Holland was charged with attempted murder, assault and assault with a deadly  weapon in the April 19 incident. His wife suffered only cuts and bruises  because the truck ran mainly over her legs while she was lying flat on the  ground, Cordeiro said.  </P> <P> The woman, however, refused to cooperate in prosecuting Holland on the  attempted murder charge, Kralick said.  </P> <P> "She made it real clear that she was in love with him and they were going to go  to counseling together," Kralick said.  </P> <P> Without her cooperation, prosecutors were forced to drop the attempted murder  charge. Holland then pleaded guilty to assault with a deadly weapon and was  sentenced to 3 years' probation by a Harbor Municipal Court judge.  </P> <P> "Given the circumstances with that case, I felt fortunate that we were able to  get the probation sentence," Kralick said. "Other situations where spouses  refuse to cooperate usually get dismissed without a hearing."  </P> <P> Kralick said incidents in which girlfriends or wives stick up for their  companions happen very often. "We have lots of girlfriends and wives (who)  refuse to prosecute," he said.  </P> <P> And there's a myriad of reasons: "They don't want to go to court. They love the  man and say it's an isolated occurrence. They say it'll never happen again. Or  they want to go on with their lives," Kralick said.  </P> <P> As part of the probation sentence, Holland was restricted from contact with his  wife unless she initiated it. He was ordered not to violate any laws and was  required to seek counseling and cooperate with his probation officer.  </P></p>

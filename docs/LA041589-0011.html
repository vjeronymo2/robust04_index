			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PESTICIDES, ADDITIVES IN FOOD: 'RUINED BY A DIET OF NEUROSIS'  </P> <P> Dr. Plested, a heart surgeon and president of the California Medical Assn. no  less, says we Americans are the "healthiest, most-informed people in history,"  and are being "ruined by a diet of neurosis." The good doctor typifies the  medical Establishment's moderate approach to curbing the country's mass  addiction to sweets and fats and gimmicky things in boxes.  </P> <P> Perhaps none of the competing food "faddists" has the complete answer, but I  prefer selecting options provided by being "most informed" to the sick  situation mandated by Plested and his peers of "balancing" demonstrably  unhealthy practices with a few good ones. The medical, beef, and dairy  industries all benefit from such moderation, but hundreds of thousands of  unhealthy and young potentially unhealthy Americans aren't. Eventually the  moderate constituencies will go the way of the tobacco industry, but at what a  price in the world's "most-informed" country!  </P> <P> DENTON PORTER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

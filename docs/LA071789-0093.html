			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> HURRICANE EXPECTED TO MISS HAWAII  </P> <P> Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii today on a course that would take it  150 miles south of the state's southernmost island, meteorologists said.  </P> <P> "Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little from it, but not  much," said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here. "But  then you can't be too optimistic."  </P> <P> At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was 830 miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island,  southernmost in the chain, moving west-northwest at 20 m.p.h., Manning said.  Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 m.p.h.. A storm is classified a  hurricane when that speed reaches 74 m.p.h.  </P> <P> At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass south of Hawaii  Island, the "Big Island," on Tuesday night.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, June 10 (XINHUA) -- U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher said today that U.S. hoped to resolve  regional conflicts through peaceful means.    Speaking at the ongoing ministerial meeting of the North  Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) held here, Christopher said  that "We face the most destructive conflict in Europe since the  Second World War. We have seen violence in the Caucasus and in  Central Asia."    On the Bosnian conflict, Christopher said the U.S. believes  that the steps agreed at the Geneva ministerial meeting last  month offer the best chance for a resolution to that "horrible  conflict."    Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in February of 1992  when Moslems and Croats, about 80 percent of the 4.3 million  population in the former Yugoslavia Republic, voted for  independence from Belgrade. Thousands of people have been  killed in the fighting.    NATO foreign ministers threw their weight Thursday [9 June]  behind an effort to impose a territorial solution on the Bosnian  conflict and reaffirmed their readiness to send a peacekeeping  force once the warring parties sign an accord.    The 16 alliance members welcomed a one-month truce among the  warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems, scheduled to take effect  today, as a "positive first step."    They urged that the cease-fire should be expanded to include  the separation of the combatants, the use of United Nations  Forces to ensure the truce and the withdrawal of all heavy  weapons.    The U.S. secretary of state said there were also potential  conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, especially Ipdjina, Kosovo,  and The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    "They must be resolved to avoid a wider conflict in the  region," said Christopher.    He said that "in the former Soviet Union, the United States  has worked with all the parties to keep disagreements from  erupting into violence."    "European stability depends on all countries' respecting of  the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of all  the states that emerged from the Soviet Empire," he noted.    Christopher held talks today with his Russian counterpart  Andrey Kozyrev on the U.S.-Russian relation and strengthening of  the cooperation between NATO and Russia.    In a joint press conference following the talks, Christopher  said that U.S. welcomes Russia's signature of the Partnership  for Peace in the near future.    Forty-one foreign ministers from the NACC and former East  Bloc countries are attending the meeting.</p>

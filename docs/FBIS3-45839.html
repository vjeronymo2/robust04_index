The officials said this figure is 85 percent up from 1992,  and represents 60 percent of the province's agricultural and  industrial output value in that year.    In 1993 the province's village and township industrial  enterprises produced an industrial value of 68.7 billion yuan,  exported 17 billion yuan-worth of goods and contributed a total  of eight billion yuan to the state coffers in taxes, the  officials noted.    According to the officials, the shareholding system has  proved to be especially suitable for rural enterprises.    In 1993 the province registered 19,000 rural joint stock  companies with a total capital of more than 10 billion yuan.    In Zhangzhou city alone over 4,000 stock companies were  launched in 1993, representing 80 percent of the newly-formed  rural enterprises. They boast a total registered capital of 800  million yuan.    Over the past year, while launching 1,800 joint ventures  with  overseas businesses, rural enterprises in the province also  started 31 ventures abroad, the officials said.    In 1993 rural enterprises received 800 million U.S. dollars  of overseas investment, which accounted for 40 percent of their  total capital input in the year. They also gained 3.9 billion  yuan in investment from other Chinese regions.    In the same period rural enterprises formed 94 group  companies and launched 700 industrial development areas. One of  them, the Fuxing Development Area on the outskirts of this  provincial capital, has 132 projects in operation or under  construction. Supported by 300 million U.S. dollars in  contracted overseas investment, its production value is expected  to reach one billion yuan a year.    The officials said rural enterprises have greatly boosted  the  economies of the rural areas and increased the incomes of  farmers. The province now has 69 villages each with an annual  production value of 100 million yuan.</p>

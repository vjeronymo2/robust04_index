			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / UK Company News: One investor buys rump of Trafalgar rights The rump of Trafalgar House's Pounds 404m rights issue was bought entirely by one investor, believed to be a Scottish institution, in an auction arranged by the underwriters yesterday. The 1-for-3 rights issue of convertible preference shares, offered at 100p, was taken up by 91.5 per cent of shareholders. That left 30.2m shares for which the underwriters had to find subscribers. The proceeds from selling these shares goes to shareholders who did not take up their rights. The attraction to the buyer was said to be the yield on the shares. They offer a 6 per cent net rate of interest, but to a non-taxpaying investor, and at the 141 1/4 p bid price, the yield is about 5.3 per cent. Instead of taking the usual route of placing the shares, Swiss Bank Corporation and Robert Fleming auctioned them at 4.30pm yesterday. The winning bid came from one institution which put in an 'all or nothing' bid at 141 1/4 p. Another institution was a close second with a bid for the lot at 141p. The price compares with a closing price of 139 1/2 p to 140 1/2 p for the convertibles. Trafalgar House shares rose 5p to 109p. Although there was a higher bid for a smaller amount, at 141 1/2 p, the average of bids, excluding the two 'all or nothing' offers, was 140.316p. SBC said that the auction had produced a better price for shareholders than the usual placing method. The auction was brought to the UK equity market last year when a number of companies offered enhanced scrip dividends with a cash alternative provided through selling unwanted shares. However, the use of the auction in a rights issue has ruffled some feathers. One institutional investor which did not bid in the auction said yesterday, 'usually if you underwrite an issue you expect to get a chance at the rump'. Brokers involved played down suggestions of a row, saying everyone's first concern was to get the best price for shareholders.</p>

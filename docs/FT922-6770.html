			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Brittan clears Hongkong bid for Midland Bank LLOYDS BANK'S hopes of buying rival Midland received a setback yesterday when the European Community competition commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, said there was no need for an extended investigation into a competing bid for Midland from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading is believed to have recommended to Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade, that Lloyds' proposed offer should be subject to a lengthy investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. It made its recommendation late on Wednesday evening. Only rarely is the OFT's recommendation rejected by the Department of Trade and Industry, Mr Heseltine's department. He is likely to announce his decision by early next week, probably on Tuesday. Lloyds and its advisers admit in private that they expect their planned bid to be referred. The bank is expected to tell Midland's shareholders that it is confident of being cleared by the MMC and would therefore ask them not to accept Hongkong Bank's bid, pending the outcome of the inquiry. As a testament of its confidence in the outcome of an MMC inquiry, it may buy Midland shares in the stock market. It believes it could buy up to 10 per cent, held by 'arbs' or speculators, relatively easily. However, it would have to ask Mr Heseltine's permission to buy the shares if the bid is referred, although it is confident of receiving this. Sir Leon Brittan said yesterday: 'We found that Midland Bank and Hongkong Bank compete in very few sectors, and that if the merger (of those two banks) went through, fierce competition would remain in these sectors.' The clearance means the government cannot open its own investigation into the bid unless it invokes an as yet unused clause in the EC anti-trust rules. This allows member states to examine bids for prudential reasons even if they have been cleared by the Commission. However, the Bank of England has already indicated it is happy with the Hongkong Bank deal, and Mr Heseltine would have difficulty finding another plausible reason to reopen an investigation. EC officials said they did not expect him to try. The Commission finished its examination six days short of the official deadline, having discovered that the only significant overlap between Hongkong and Midland was in the gilts market. But 'even in this sector . . . competition is intense and would remain so after the merger,' the Commission said. Lobbying over takeover gathers steam, Page 21</p>

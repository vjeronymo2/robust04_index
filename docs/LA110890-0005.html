			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ETHNICITY IN AMERICA  </P> <P> In response to "For the Last Time, Darn It, I Am Not a Mail-Order Bride"  (Campus Correspondents, Opinion, Oct. 21):  </P> <P> I am sadly disappointed and repulsed to see such an article written by  "American " Anne Kim.  </P> <P> I am a senior at Birmingham High School.  </P> <P> I, along with my parents and sister, emigrated to the United States from Taiwan  when I was 4 years old. Like the author, I have been raised with a "a messy mix  of MTV and McDonald's." However, when fellow Americans tease me about being  "fresh off the boat," I promptly correct them. I am proud of my Chinese culture  and defend it at all times. I do not believe that anybody should be subjected  to this type of criticism. My advice to the author: Instead of trying so  desperately to conceal your Korean ancestry and taking pride in mispronouncing  your Korean middle name, take a good look around you. Why are you trying to  identify with the very people who stereotype you? Think about it.  </P> <P> DORRIE CHANG  </P> <P> Reseda  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The U.S. Administration has welcomed statements by  Belarusian Government officials who confirmed their commitment  to follow the path toward a market economy, as well as to  fulfill their obligations to transform the Republic of Belarus  into a non-nuclear state. We are interested in Belarus  continuing on this course. We will cooperate with Vyacheslav  Kebich's government and try to encourage this government to take  up reforms. It is a long-term policy of the United States, said  White House Spokesperson Dee Dee Myers during a briefing with  journalists. The agreement on the liquidation of nuclear  weapons provides for the allotment of $12 billion to former  Soviet republics which will dismantle their nuclear weapons. It  is a great financial stimulus for such countries as Belarus and  Ukraine, she stated.    According to the Belarusian Embassy in Washington, an  official of the U.S. State Department held a briefing, during  which he paid much attention to the political situation in  Belarus. He stated that the United States is somewhat troubled  by the Belarusian Supreme Soviet resolution of 26 January. At  the same time, (Macary) referred to Foreign Minister  Kravchanka's statement to the diplomatic corps in Minsk on 27  January, with regard to the continuity and consistency of  Belarusian foreign policy, first of all, in the sphere of  nuclear disarmament. We consider this statement to be of great  importance, emphasized the U.S. official.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By G. van Oudtshoorn] </F>   [Text] Ulundi Feb 23 SAPA -- Describing the approved  amendments to the constitution as a concession to the Freedom  Alliance [FA] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] was an insult  not only to his intelligence but to the IFP and all South  Africans, Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Wednesday [23 February].  The IFP president was commenting on amendments to Section 126 of  the interim constitution adopted by the Multiparty Negotiation  Council on Monday which were described by the African National  Congress [ANC] as a major concession to the federalistic demands  of the FA.    "Once again the press has failed to exercise its duty of  critique, analysis and investigation and has reported the  propagandistic untruth of the ANC/SA Communist Party alliance  and the National Party/South African Government at face value,"  Mr Buthelezi said.    "Upon analysis it appears clear and incontrovertible that  describing the amendments to Section 126 as a concession to the  Freedom Alliance and the IFP is an insult to my intelligence, is  an insult to the intelligence of my party and is an insult to  the intelligence to all South Africans.    "All they did was to delete the word 'concurrent' and add  language which unequivocally ensures that powers of the  provinces can only be concurrent rather than exclusive. The  normative value of Section 126 before the amendment is exactly  the same as after the amendment."    Mr Buthelezi said it was stated in the amendment that  provincial legislatures would have competence to make laws as in  the limited list of powers set out in Schedule 6, and that  parliament would be competent to make the same laws with regard  to the same matters on which provinces had jurisdiction.    Parliament therefore had concurrent legislative powers over  the same matters. In case the two legislative powers cannot  co-exist without creating a conflict with one another, the act  of Parliament would prevail over the provincial legislation "in  substantially the same cases and situations".    "In fact the national government is entitled to prevail with  its legislation over provincial legislation on the basis of  about 15 broadly worded over-rides," Mr Buthelezi said. "This  means that in a province there will be national schools,  hospital and housing programmes co-existing with provincial  schools, hospitals and housing programmes."    He said the national government would have the power to  extend the rules set out for national schools, hospitals and  housing programmes and every time it could argue that it did so  on the basis of one of the broadly worded 15 over-rides.  "Needless to say, the national schools, hospital and housing  programmes will be backed by respective national health,  educational and housing policies, which will make any effort in  such fields by the provinces politically and socially irrelevant.    "I am saying this because unless our press accepts the duty  of going into this type of detail, there will not be correct  information on the truth of the constitutional negotiations  which took place in this country," Mr Buthelezi said.</p>

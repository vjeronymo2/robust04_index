			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ashcroft steps down as managing director of Survival Aids MR JOHN ASHCROFT, the former Coloroll chairman, is stepping down as managing director of Survival Aids, the outdoor clothing company, which was his first acquisition following Coloroll's collapse with debts of about Pounds 350m. Mr Hugh Lapham, former operations director for B&amp;Q, replaces him next Monday. He has already begun work at the Cumbria-based business on a consultancy basis. Confirming the management change yesterday Mr Ashcroft, who remains chairman, said it was always his intention to appoint a full-time managing director in 1993, after spending two years in the driving seat. He said the business, the retail branch network of which he has extended from three shops to 14, covering Glasgow to Bristol, now needed somebody with good retail expertise to take it forward. The departure of Mr Colin Corlett, the finance director, was also a factor in the decision to bring in a full-time managing director. Late last year, some suppliers to Survival Aids were complaining about late payment. Yesterday, Mr Ashcroft said he had not been happy with Survival Aids' payment situation and was nervous about trading prospects for this year. He disclosed that he and two other key shareholders, who together have a 72 per cent stake, had made a further investment, bringing the total to Pounds 1m. 'I suggested we strengthen the management team and put in more money,' said Mr Ashcroft. 'I felt the business would benefit from having a stronger balance sheet and a better cash position.' Since acquiring Survival Aids, Mr Ashcroft has bought two other companies, which he declined to name.</p>

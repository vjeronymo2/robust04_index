			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' BASKETBALL DIVISION I SEMIFINALS  </P> <P> After losing in the semifinals last year and in the finals two years ago, the  Santana girls finally advanced to the Division I Section final with its victory  over Rancho Buena Vista.  </P> <P> "We wanted this one really bad," said Santana junior center Stephanie Thompson,  who scored 17 points.  </P> <P> "We didn't come in with the right attitude last year."  </P> <P> Santana (24-4) got Shawna Edge, RBV's leading scorer, in foul trouble in the  first quarter and had no problem after that. The Sultans led 15-8 after a  quarter and 29-19 at half, before blowing the game open in the third quarter.  </P> <P> They scored the first six points of the third quarter and were never threatened  again.  </P> <P> Rebecca Aase led Santana with 18 points and Desiree Weimann added 12. Skiy  Burton paced RBV (21-7) with 18 points. Edge fouled out with 6:00 left in the  game and finished with just four points. RBV point guard Stephanie Howells went  out with a knee injury early in the third quarter and scored just two points.  DAVE MCKIBBEN  </P></p>

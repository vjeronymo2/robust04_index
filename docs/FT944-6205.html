			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Package aims to get the unemployed back to work - Incentives for employers and aid for former claimants Under a banner of new work incentives and a budget for work, the chancellor announced a Pounds 680m package of measures to help the unemployed back to work and reduce the cost to employers of taking them on. There are four measures to encourage employers to take on people who have been out of work, particularly for long spells: Employer national insurance contributions cut by 0.6 per cent from April 1995, for all employees earning less than Pounds 205 a week, at a cost to the Treasury of Pounds 250m a year. Employer NIC holiday: from April 1996, employers who take on someone who has been out of work for at least two years will be able to get a full NIC rebate for that person for up to one year. On average, employers will save more than Pounds 300 for every person they take on, at a cost of Pounds 45m a year. Expansion of Work Trials scheme: there will be more opportunities for employers who give people who have been unemployed for more than six months a three-week trial in a job before deciding whether to take them on permanently. Unemployed people will continue to receive their benefits during the trial, so the scheme is free to employers. There will be 150,000 Work Trial places over the next three years, costing Pounds 30m. * New Workstart pilot schemes: there will be more grants for employers who take on the long-term unemployed, through further Workstart pilots. Details of the pilots are to be finalised, but around 5,000 people will benefit at a total cost of Pounds 8m. In addition, the Chancellor announced four measures to ease the transition from unemployment to work: Speeding up housing benefit and council tax benefit, plus four-week rent and council tax guarantee for people taking jobs. From April 1996 people who have been out of work for at least six months will be able to get their housing benefit and council tax benefit paid at full existing rates for the first four weeks after they take a job. The aim will also be to ensure people are told how much continuing help they will get with housing and council tax benefit within the four weeks, and that this will be paid promptly. The scheme will cost Pounds 50m a year and 440,000 people will benefit. The government will shortly be consulting local authorities who are responsible for paying housing benefit and council tax benefit. Speeding up the payment of family credit The government plans that by April 1996, 95 per cent of family credit claims from employees will be dealt with within five working days of the claim being received by the Department of Social Security. The cost is Pounds 5m a year and 400,000 people will benefit. announced in October, will be tax free. People who lose benefit because they do a few hours work while claiming income support or the new Jobseeker's Allowance will get a cash lump sum of up to Pounds 1,000 when they move to work of at least 16 hours. National extension of Jobfinder's Grant: Up to 25,000 grants will be available to people who have been unemployed for at least two years when they start a lower-paid job, to help with initial work expenses. The grants are worth an average Pounds 200 each and will cost Pounds 5m a year. Two measures to help people who want full-time work: Extra money for family credit claimants working full-time: anyone who is entitled to family credit who takes a full-time job (at least 30 hours a week) will get an extra Pounds 10 a week, from July 1995, at a cost of Pounds 205m a year. People who also receive housing benefit and council tax benefit will be able to keep an extra Pounds 10 of income before these benefits are affected, guaranteeing that they will benefit by the full amount of the extra family credit. Some 350,000 families on low incomes will be helped. Further Jobmatch pilot schemes: people who have been unable to find a full-time job will be helped to build up full-time hours and wages by taking on a number of part-time jobs. The design of the new pilots is being finalised, but there will be up to 3,000 opportunities at an annual cost of Pounds 5m. For the unemployed, there were three measures to keep unemployed people in touch with the labour market: National extension of 1-2-1 interviews and Workwise courses: help for 18 to 24s unemployed for a year to look for work more effectively Community Action: work experience and help in looking for work for long-term unemployed. The measures also included a Pounds 25m pilot scheme for unemployed people without children. The pilot scheme will run for three years from October 1996, and include 20,000 people or one in 25 childless people in the UK. If they show the scheme is successful, the government will consider introducing the benefit nationally. Consultations on the details of the scheme will begin in April 1995. Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, welcomed the budget measures and said: 'Prospects look good. Unemployment is down by 455,000 from the December 1992 peak and by a third of a million compared with a year ago. We have more of our working-age population in jobs than any of our major European partners. Our Employment Service is meeting and beating its toughest ever targets to place unemployed people into jobs. And the new Jobseeker's Allowance will ensure that our benefit system is simplified and more than ever geared to helping every individual who wants work.'</p>

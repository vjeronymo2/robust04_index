			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Unfortunate advice Sir, Tony Baldry's advice to local authorities on tendering is misguided, if not wrong. He states (Letters, November 16) that 'it is not possible to decide whether Tupe applies until the contractors' proposals are seen'. Not only is it often possible to make such a judgment, legal advice we have sent to local authorities indicates it would be absurd in many cases not to. Indeed, we have found that contractors often prefer the certainty of knowing what the position is when making their bid. Mr Baldry believes he has issued further advice on this matter. I thought we were currently consulting him on this. He has clearly already made up his mind. That is unfortunate as his advice flies in the face both of the law and common sense. His letter is symptomatic of the government's attitude to Europe - seeking to evade its responsibilities. Local authorities, however, recognise they have obligations under European law and will act in the light of them. What must be deplored is Mr Baldry's attitude in threatening local authorities that if they do not do as he says he will take action against them. It is time for a more considered and helpful approach to this problem. Jeremy Beecham, chairman, Association of Metropolitan Authorities, 35 Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BJ</p>

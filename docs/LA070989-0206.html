			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FIREWORKS BAN  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that the Los Angeles Times and apparently a handful of others  still cling to the idea that if something is banned, no one will obtain it or  use it. In your editorial "A Ban Against Fireworks Should Be Countywide" (July  2), you continue to wring out the same tired reasons you feel a ban on all  fireworks is necessary.  </P> <P> Actually, most states allow their residents to legally purchase and use some  type of fireworks for the Fourth of July. Eight allow all types of class C  fireworks, including firecrackers, skyrockets and star shells. I'm not saying  those should be legal here, but I do feel most residents of California are  responsible enough that they should be able to purchase some items legally if  they choose to do so.  </P> <P> It's also disappointing that you choose to criticize the groups that still sell  legal fireworks somewhat harshly. It's never been easy to raise funds, no  matter how you do it. And despite how you feel about them, fireworks are a very  popular item. Nobody is forced to buy any, but sales continue to do well year  after year.  </P> <P> As for the Boy Scouts, I really don't care whether they sell fireworks or not,  but it is interesting that an organization that tries to teach young people how  to do things correctly and responsibly says no to something that, in a way, can  be a teaching tool. Most people handle flammable objects many times during a  life, be they matches, road flares or any of a thousand other things. Why not  instruct them on how to handle legal fireworks correctly? Personally, I can't  help wondering whether they have since canceled all cookouts and campfires too,  since those can also be hazardous if misused.  </P> <P> No item is risk-free, but legal fireworks are probably the safest items of  their kind sold anywhere to the public. I have tried most class C items in  various states where they are legally sold, so I know something of where I  speak.  </P> <P> Urge proper use and proper supervision. Strongly discourage use of illegal  goods and offer the best and most reliable products in their place, and I think  you will achieve much more than you would with a total ban. I sincerely hope  that the seven Orange County cities that allow legal fireworks sales and use  will continue to do so.  </P> <P> CHRIS SQUYRES  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Arts: Today's Television This is the day the Channel tunnel is opened. Sorry, 'inaugurated' is perhaps the safer word. BBC1 follows the Queen to France and back from 11.30am onwards. Her Majesty actually goes on a train, unlike the public who will have to wait. Julia Ford features in the first of A Skirt Through History (BBC2, 9.30pm), a series which views the past through the lives of women. Queen Victoria could not conceive of a sexual relationship between women so lesbianism never suffered the legal restraints of male homosexuality. A rare insight into the life of a 19th century lesbian surfaced in the 1980s when the diaries of Anne Lister, a Halifax gentlewoman, were deciphered. They reveal an active sex life, invariably thwarted by the wish for a conventional marriage by most of her lovers. Conjugal Rites returns for a second series (ITV, 8.30pm). This is a typical modern sitcom, dealing with the mid-life crisis of an 'ordinary' couple, played by Michael Williams and Gwen Taylor. All the usual contemporary issues are aired, with the idea that the audience can identify with the protagonists.</p>

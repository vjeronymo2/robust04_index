			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Observer: How green is Wanless? If the government wanted a financial man to take over the chairmanship of the Advisory Committee on Business and the Environment, Derek Wanless was the obvious choice. He has claimed for NatWest, which he runs, the title of Britain's greenest bank, and aged only 46 he might almost be said to belong to the environmental generation. Wanless recently put his name to NatWest's environmental audit, the first by a UK clearing bank, and last year he was one of the moving forces behind the UN's declaration on banks and the environment. NatWest's annual report is printed on paper from 'sustainably managed resources' and the postal wrapper is 'UV light degradable.' But will Wanless have the time and vision to fulfill his new role? He has only been running NatWest for 16 months, and it is still recovering from its financial woes. His environmental audit revealed as great a preoccupation with saving envelopes and switching off lights as it did with the great ecological issues of the day. 'Environmental sense, business sense' is Wanless' watchword. The government will be looking for something rather more instructive than that from its 'green chip' businessmen. As for the investment community, there will be a worry that Wanless's enthusiasm for fashionable extra-curricular activities suggests another sort of greenness. Chairing government quangos is normally a job for elderly bank chairmen, not young bank chief executives.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand has put forward a proposal to the United  States on exchange of agricultural information, global market  forecasts and technological know-how for farm production.    The Secretary-general of the Office of Agricultural  Economics, Pitiphong Phungbun na Ayutthaya, said the proposal  was raised with the US Department of Agriculture at a recent  meeting.    Mr Pitiphong said the US has such an agreement with the  European Union, China and Indonesia, and wants a similar one  with Thailand because of the implications of the recent  conclusion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.    Thailand is interested in the exchange programme,  particularly with regard to the farm products of countries which  have exchange agreements with the US. The agreement with the US  will give Thailand access to information on farm products of  these countries.    Cooperation can begin immediately after negotiations are  completed within three months.    US agriculture officials will arrive for discussion with Mr  Pitiphong in June after their trips to Indonesia.    On a proposal of the ASEAN Free Trade Area [AFTA] agreement  to include non-processed agricultural products in the agreement  list, he said the office is in the process of informal  discussion as there has been no official request yet for the  inclusion. Should there be a formal request, a study must be  conducted to gauge its long-term impact on the products, he said.    If non-processed products are included in the AFTA list  products which are subsidised will be affected because they will  be uncompetitive.</p>

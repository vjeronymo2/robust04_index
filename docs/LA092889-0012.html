			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOTHER MARSHALL PLAN?  </P> <P> Forty years ago the United States committed itself to a $12-billion program to  finance the reconstruction and integration of Western Europe's war-devastated  economies. That effort, first publicly proposed by Secretary of State George C.  Marshall, achieved spectacular successes.  </P> <P> Now the prosperous Western Europeans, joined by Japan, the United States and  other major industrial nations, are lining up to help as Poland and Hungary  embark on an unprecedented political transformation. The recognized need to  prevent threatened economic instability from eroding these reform efforts gives  a special urgency to the outside aid program.  </P> <P> The Marshall Plan succeeded in no small part because Western Europe already  possessed the political and economic culture -- including a large pool of  talented technicians and officials -- to make it work. Poland and Hungary lack  many of those advantages. Four decades of state-controlled Marxist economies  have in the main produced only wide-scale inefficiencies, distortions,  shortages and massive international debt. Many of the basic institutions that  are needed to support the shift to free-market economies are weak or  nonexistent. Poland, for example, lacks even a single commercial bank to make  loans to newly hatched small businesses or to finance private home  construction.  </P> <P> The donor nations are proposing $648 million in new commitments to Poland and  Hungary next year, on top of the $271 million in food aid already announced.  Proposed help runs the spectrum from pesticides, medicines, farm machinery and  environmental cleanup to improved market access for Polish and Hungarian goods  and training in capitalist management. The initial U.S. contribution, announced  earlier by President Bush, is for $219 million in economic and food aid.  Democrats have been critical, saying more should be done. In an address  yesterday to the International Monetary Fund, which can be expected to play an  important role in the economic restructuring in Eastern Europe, Bush agreed "we  must do more." He has yet, however, to commit his Administration in any more  practical terms.  </P> <P> The direction of international help that is required now and in the years ahead  nonetheless has been set, and the readiness to show generosity seems clear. The  new political leaders in Poland and the emerging and changing leaders in  Hungary have said in so many words that their countries are abandoning  communism and intend to move swiftly toward free-market economies and more  democratic institutions. All this represents a truly historic turning point in  the history of Europe and the postwar world. The need for outside help to speed  this process along is compelling. The encouraging news is that there is a clear  willingness to provide that help.  </P></p>

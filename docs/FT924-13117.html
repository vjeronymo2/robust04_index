			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Andrews Sykes board backed MR JACQUES MURRAY, the dissident shareholder who holds a 29.2 per cent stake in Andrews Sykes, the specialist industrial services group, yesterday lost his battle to unseat Mr David Hubbard, chairman, and take control of the board. Shareholders, led by institutional investors, representing more than 62 per cent of the ordinary shares, voted, and issued proxies, in support of Mr Hubbard and the existing board at an extraordinary meeting called at the request of Mr Murray. The vote ends a bitter six-week battle for boardroom control between Mr Murray, who is also chairman and majority shareholder of Nu-Swift, the fire protection, office cleaning and property company, and the Andrews Sykes board led by Mr Hubbard who became non-executive chairman last autumn. Mr Murray had asked shareholders to back six resolutions at the extraordinary meeting which would have removed Mr Hubbard and Mr David Crowe, one of the two other non-executive directors, from the five-man board, and replace them with himself and three of his associates. All of the resolutions were rejected by a substantial majority. European Fire Protection, one of Mr Murray's investment vehicles, issued a statement saying it was disappointed with the outcome but added that it felt justified in 'focusing shareholders' attention on Andrews Sykes' poor financial performance and the failure of management to address the decline in profitability with an effective strategy.'</p>

			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRAF SWEEPS MALEEVA TO WIN 50TH SINGLES TITLE;  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO TENNIS: AFTER RECOVERING FROM SURGERY, THE WEST GERMAN HAS WON TWO  CONSECUTIVE TOURNAMENTS GOING INTO THE U.S. OPEN.  </P> <P> Sinus surgery has made it easier for Steffi Graf to breath in more ways than  one. It has seemed to clear her mind as well.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Graf won her 50th career singles title Sunday at the San Diego  Tennis &amp; Racquet Club, defeating fourth-seeded Manuela Maleeva, 6-3, 6-2,  in the $225,000 Great American Bank tennis tournament final.  </P> <P> Since her semifinal loss to Zina Garrison at Wimbledon, much ado has been made  about everything Graf has said, but particularly about what she hasn't said.  </P> <P> Her personal problems, stemming from her father's alleged liaisons with a  model, were reported by some tabloids as the reason she abruptly left Wimbledon  and returned briefly to her home in West Germany.  </P> <P> Graf has said all along that surgery was the lone reason for her sudden flight.  Her recent performances would seem to support her contentions that she feeling  better as a result of the operation.  </P> <P> Graf said she has benefited from the surgery and pronounced herself fit for the  U.S. Open, her next competition.  </P> <P> "Yes, I definitely feel much better," she said. "That's why I had surgery."  </P> <P> Pavel Slozil, Graf's coach, said her play has improved since surgery, but the  most dramatic change has been in her attitude.  </P> <P> "It's especially good," Slozil said, "and it's important because now she  believes she can play good tennis again."  </P> <P> He said Graf's problems -- she also injured her thumb earlier in the year and  sat out two tournaments -- are becoming things of the past.  </P> <P> "She had a lot of problems before," Slozil said. "Finally, most of them are  behind her."  </P> <P> And fading from Graf's memory.  </P> <P> "It's been said that after the last couple of (tournaments) that I'm not as  strong as before," she said, "but if you know what I've gone through the last  couple of months, you know why it's not easy to come back, and you understand  it a little better if you think about it."  </P> <P> Against Maleeva, she looked liked the old Graf. Her trademark power forehand  sizzled and she never let Maleeva get into the match.  </P> <P> "I was holding back on some shots," Maleeva said, "and not going for the  winners. This was the difference."  </P> <P> But she was pleased with her showing in the tournament.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy overall," she said. "I played some good tennis this week. It  gives me some confidence, this tournament. I played some good matches this  week."  </P> <P> Said Graf: "I pretty much knew what to expect. It's up to me to be aggressive  and not let her get into the match."  </P> <P> Maleeva said her right shoulder was hurting a little, but not enough to make a  difference.  </P> <P> "I was a little bit slow, a little tired from playing a semifinal match late  last night," she said.  </P> <P> Sunday's victory in San Diego gives Graf back-to-back singles titles. She won  the Canadian Open Aug. 5 in Montreal. Her next competition is the U.S. Open in  Flushing Meadow, N.Y., but she will appear in an exhibition, along with  Jennifer Capriati, in Mahwah, N.J., Aug. 20.  </P> <P> She said this tournament and Canada were good warmups for the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "I've played two tournaments in a row," she said. "And I think playing those 10  matches gave me a lot of experience and gave me the kind of match practice I  needed."  </P> <P> Graf's record is 279-11, and three losses have come this year. Her 50 singles  titles has been surpassed only by Chris Evert's 157 and Martina Navratilova's  152.  </P> <P> Friday, Graf celebrates her third anniversary as the No. 1 player in the world,  and on Aug. 27, she will break Navratilova's record of 157 weeks at the top of  the rankings.  </P> <P> But what do titles, ranking and records all mean to Graf?  </P> <P> "When I think about it," she said, "I enjoy looking at them. Those kinds of  things are nice to look at, but I just keep going."  </P> <P> Maleeva said it will be difficult for Graf to stay at the top much longer.  </P> <P> "It's very difficult to say for how long," she said, "because (Monica) Seles is  playing well, (Gabriela) Sabatini is playing well and Martina (Navratilova) is  playing well, so everyone is getting much closer."  </P> <P> The $45,000 first-prize money increased Graf's earnings this year to $814,941,  passing Seles, who has $788,696, to move into second among the tour's money  winners. Although ranked second behind Graf, Navratilova is No. 1 in prize  money, with $900,384.  </P> <P> Navratilova could have moved closer to the million-dollar mark had she not  withdrawn from this tournament early in the week.  </P> <P> Patty Fendick and Zina Garrison defeated Elise Burgin and Ros Fairbank-Nideffer  in the doubles final, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).  </P></p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / South Africa blocks land deals Mr Derek Hanekom, South Africa's land minister, yesterday announced the withdrawal of authorisation for land transfers to leaders of the former black homeland of Lebowa who had allegedly bought large amounts of state-owned land for personal use. The move was a response to claims on Tuesday that tens of thousands of hectares of land in the former homeland had been privatised and handed over to tribal chiefs immediately before last April's elections, when Lebowa was formally reincorporated into South Africa. The money used to pay for the land allegedly came from a special government fund that had been budgeted for drought relief for local farmers.</p>

How do we evaluate this struggle?  How will the future anticorruption work be conducted?    Bringing along reflections on these issues as well as the  high expectations of the people, responsible persons from the  discipline inspection departments of various party and  government organs at the central as well as local levels  gathered in Beijing to discuss the situation and problems.  People have a consensus that the anticorruption struggle must  be deepened to serve reform, development, and stability.  [passage omitted]  <H5>  New Attempt, New Review </H5>   Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection  [CCDI] Wei Jianxing said at the opening ceremony of its third  plenary session: "This anticorruption struggle is not only a  tempering for party and government cadres at all levels and the  vast contingent of cadres of our discipline inspection and  supervisory organs, but also a new attempt to combat negative  and corrupt phenomena under the new circumstances."    At the meeting, comrades in charge of discipline inspection  and supervision from relevant departments in 16 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as organs under  the party Central Committee and the central government gave  briefings on their measures in unfolding the anticorruption  struggle. Through these measures, experiences were accumulated  for waging a deep-going anticorruption struggle in the next  stage. [passage omitted]  <H5>  A Deep-Going, Sustained, and Effective Way Holds the Key </H5>   How do we carry out anti-corruption work in 1994, a year in  which the most reform measures yet will be formulated? This is  the issue most frequently pondered by discipline inspection and  supervisory cadres.    CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing pointed out clearly that under  the new circumstances, discipline inspection and supervisory  organs should unswervingly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  strategic principle of "fostering both material as well as  cultural and ideological progress, attaching equal importance to  both," resolutely combat corruption in a down-to-earth manner,  and strengthen the building of party work style and clean  administration to provide conditions and guarantee the proper  implementation of various reform measures; the sustained, rapid,  and healthy development [chi xu kuai su jian kang fa zhan 2170  4958 1816 6643 0256 1660 4099 1455] of economic construction; as  well as political and social stability.    Over the last few days, the 103 CCDI members attending the  plenary session earnestly discussed General Secretary Jiang  Zemin's important speech and Comrade Wei Jianxing's work report  to the meeting, holding that General Secretary Jiang Zemin's  speech and the work report given by Comrade Wei Jianxing on the  CCDI Standing Committee's behalf conformed to reality and would  serve as a guide for waging a deep-going, sustained, and  effective anticorruption struggle in the next stage.    During their discussion, CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin  pointed out: To conduct the anticorruption struggle in a  deep-going, sustained, and effective manner, first, we should  consolidate the achievements of struggle in the previous stage  and keep up the good work until the end; second, earnestly carry  out the various work arranged at this meeting in a down-to-earth  manner; and, third, persist in fighting corruption throughout  the entire process of reform, opening up to the outside world,  and economic construction. In addition, he pointed out: In  taking charge of the anticorruption struggle, it is necessary to  heedfully guard against two one-sided understandings: one being  the belief that "the anticorruption campaign has already been  carried out quite adequately", which leads to complacency about  the achievements in the previous stage; the other being the  attitude of focusing excessive expectations and efforts on a  single operation so much so that interim objectives and  achievements are neglected. [passage omitted]    The establishment and improvement of an effective mechanism  for supervision and restriction is a hot topic discussed by many  delegates. CCDI Secretary Wei Jianxing stressed: In waging an  anticorruption struggle, we must effect a permanent cure besides  taking stopgap measures, and should strengthen regular education  on party work style and clean administration among party members  and cadres to gradually form a system. It is necessary to  accelerate legislation for rectifying party work style and  strengthening the building of a clean administration and to  gradually establish and improve a code of conduct for party  workers and state functionaries. It is especially necessary to  establish a mechanism of supervision and restriction at law  enforcement departments and positions directly in charge of  personnel, property, and material to guard against the abuse of  official power for personal gain. CCDI Standing Committee  member Fu Jie believes that it is necessary to persistently  bring the interim results into line with the protracted nature  of the anticorruption struggle to effect a permanent cure while  solving its current problems, as the struggle is a long-term  task. In effecting a permanent cure, we would have to rely on  rule by law and education.</p>

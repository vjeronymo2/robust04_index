			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: A temperate look at the Tories - Alan Clark enjoys the reminiscences of a witty man doomed to rejection by the party leaders A BAG OF BOILED SWEETS by Julian Critchley Faber Pounds 17.50, 256 pages Julian Critchley was in Parliament for a very long time. He watched the Tory party change (the euphemism is 'adapt') and did not much like what he saw. So for historians he is a valuable source. We enjoy the bonus of his literary style and his powers of observation: there (in 1962) is the prime minister 'who would attend upon the '22 (Committee) with difficulty, nervously fingering his Brigade tie'. But 20 years later it was 'pull up our socks' and 'we've got work to do'. As a diarist, an impressionist really, the author has this delightful light touch which, like a watercolour by Cezanne, is so delicate in its use of colour as to please the connoisseur but leave (perhaps) the philistine puzzled or impatient. (This was also true of much of the way Critchley commented and conducted himself in Parliament, I may say.) Take this introduction to a visit to Harold Macmillan: '. . . Birch Grove, a modern country house the back of which abuts on the Bluebell Line, a preserved steam railway often to be glimpsed on television.' Future students will be able to write a whole doctoral thesis on Critchley's economy of language, and the gentle tone of mockery which pervades his treatment of even the most sententious topics. Here he is on one of the 'safest' bits of his own constituency: 'Fleet, a curiously dull early 20th-century planned town where retired Colonels and their ladies hang like an army of bats in the mouth of some Goanese cave.' At one point the author falls foul of Lord Grimston, a nonentity who chaired the Carlton Club (foolishly and youthfully Critchley had entertained Jo Grimond to lunch there). Critchley was summoned to apologise and an appointment was agreed. A Lucky Jim sequence followed. Pouring rain, no taxis, no buses, no (after some hour and a half) Critchley. A cross note from Grimston awaited him when finally he turned up. But the episode is neither enlarged on nor subsequently referred to until much later. Critchley (at that time pretty broke, no longer an MP and now writing about wine) brings into the club as a guest Cyril Ray, a tiny left-wing twerp who also postured as a wine buff: '. . . luckily there was no sign of Lord Grimston'. Rancour, that chemical inseparable from the human condition, especially when in introspective 'mode', is almost entirely absent. Only two colleagues are categorised as 'nasty bits of work'. George Wigg, who undoubtedly was one, and the hapless Robin Maxwell-Hyslop (whom I always found eccentric and combative but, nonetheless 'a good sort'). Michael Heseltine, whom poor Critchley was deluded into thinking of as his 'best friend' (there is a revealing description of Critchley being slowly frozen out from both the house which they shared and the job to which Heseltine had appointed him) is confirmed as callous and single-minded but (my interpretation) so obsessionally egocentric that even the Tory Party, when it came down to it, would do anything to avoid having him as leader. There is a profusion of anecdote. Some, many, we have heard before, but they continue to give pleasure being literarily Homeric. They have entered into myth, and enjoy continuing and adaptive embellishment. One omitted, and worth recounting because it may illuminate his 'difficult' relationship with the then prime minister, is from a dinner held in 1988. There is a photograph in the book which the author has pleasingly and characteristically captioned 'the remnants of the 1959 intake ('quite . . . the worst of my experience' - RA Butler). The woman in the middle is Mrs Thatcher.' At the conclusion of this meal Julian had the trickyish task of introducing the prime minister. 'Margaret, what can I say about you that has not been said already?' Acknowledging this, in that special sugary tone which she reserved for those whom she disliked, the prime minister opened: 'Julian, what can I say about you which you haven't said already?' And I suppose that much of this delightful book has, by the author himself, been 'said already.' But it is lovely to have it all under one cover; the testament of a clever, witty man who loved politics but was doomed to rejection. Critchley mourns the transition of his party from Knights of the Shires to Estate Agents and Motor Dealers. But reading him carefully will reveal that the author was too fastidious for acceptance by either.</p>

			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Brazilian star faces Fifa ruling on suspension The fate of Leonardo, the Brazilian defender who faces suspension for cracking the skull of the USA's Tab Ramos in the World Cup's second round, was being decided yesterday by Fifa. Soccer's governing body is trying to combat thuggery and has already suspended one player for three games after a foul that did less damage than Leonardo's blow. The Brazilian will certainly miss Saturday's quarter-final against Holland, and may be banned for the rest of the tournament. In the US-Brazil game, Ramos and Leonardo tangled for the ball near mid-field. Ramos was spun round and struck on the left side of the face; he lost consciousness for several moments and was taken to hospital for observation.</p>

All such expenses will be allocated to each class of shares in a Portfolio on the basis of the relative net asset values of the classes of that Portfolio. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Except as noted below, each class of shares may be exchanged only for shares of the same class in another Portfolio and in all events will be limited to within the same ``group of investment companies'' as that term is defined in rule 11a&hyph;3 of the Act. Exchanges will be permitted among classes should a shareholder cease to be eligible to purchase shares of the original class by reason of a change in the shareholder's status. Exchanges among classes may be made when a shareholder of a class becomes eligible to purchase shares of another class and ineligible to purchase shares of the class originally held. This situation might occur, for example, when an investor who beneficially owned shares held by an institution becomes the holder of legal title by reason of a distribution from the institutional account. Such distributions may be occasioned by a termination of a trust and distribution of the corpus of the trust to beneficiaries. An individual would become the holder of shares designed for institutions, and the individual may desire the services offered by Service Organizations in substitution of the services formerly provided by the trustee of such trust. In such a case, an exchange may occur upon the request of the shareholder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The proposed issuance and sale of certain classes of securities representing interests in the Fund's or future Funds' investment portfolios, including the allocation of voting rights thereto and the payment of dividends thereon in the manner described below, might be deemed to result in a ``senior security'' within the meaning of Section 18(g) and to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) and also to violate the requirement in Section 18(i) that every share of stock issued by a registered management investment company shall have equal voting rights with every other share of outstanding voting stock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and voting rights relating to the Plans in the manner described is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. Although investors purchasing shares offered in connection with a Plan would bear the costs associated with the related services, they would also enjoy the benefits of those services and, in the case of Distribution Shares, exclusive shareholder voting rights with respect to matters affecting such Plans. Conversely, investors purchasing shares that are not covered by a Plan would not be burdened with such expenses or enjoy such voting rights. Moreover, because with respect to any Portfolio the rights and privileges of shares would be substantially identical, the possibility that the interests of the various classes of shareholders would ever conflict would be remote. The interests of each class of shareholders would be adequately protected since the Plan, the Service Agreements and the Service Payments would conform to the requirements of rule 12b&hyph;1 or the protection described in the application, including the requirement that they be approved by the Board of Directors of the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The abuses that section 18 of the Act are intended to redress are set forth in section 1(b) of the Act which declares that the interests of investors are adversely affected when investment companies by excessive borrowing and the issuance of excessive amounts of senior securities increase the speculative character of the other securities, or when investment companies operate without adequate reserves. The proposed arrangement does not involve borrowings and does not affect the Fund's existing assets or reserves. Nor will the proposed arrangement increase the speculative character of the shares in a Portfolio, since each class of shares in a Portfolio will participate in all of such Portfolio's appreciation (if any), income and expenses (with the exception of the proposed Service Payments and Class Expenses) on the basis of the applicable net assets of such class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The cabinet today approved working permits for  35,000 Arabs of the territories to enter Israel. Approximately  20,000 have been designated for the construction sector.    Next week, the cabinet is due to discuss the request of  Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer for another 20,000  permits. After the cabinet meeting, Minister Yosi Sarid said  any Palestinian with what he called a serious and urgent medical  case, will be allowed to receive treatment in Israel. Also at  the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres said he  believed there appears to be positive movement by Jordan in the  peace talks. Security officers told the ministers they were  pleased with the way the Palestinian police were operating in  the self-rule areas, but they said the fact that members of the  police are not getting their salaries could cause problems for  both Palestinians and Israelis.    Police Minister Shahal has rejected Yasir 'Arafat's claim  that Israeli rule has destroyed the Palestinian education,  health, and housing services in Gaza and Jericho. In an  interview with Jack Katzenell, Shahal said the economic progress  of the Palestinians in the territories has surpassed that of the  Arabs in Syria, Iraq, and even Jordan. The minister said it was  high time Yasir 'Arafat came to Gaza instead of just talking.  Shahal also rejected Likud opposition charges that the  government had given Yasir 'Arafat a secret letter about the  future of Jerusalem.    [Begin recording] [Shahal] We did not give or submit any  commitment on the issue of Jerusalem beyond the documents that  have been submitted to the Knesset after the Cairo agreement.    [Katzenell] Mr. al-Husayni was saying that he and the other  Palestinian leaders in and around Jerusalem are going to  continue establishing Palestinian offices, Palestinian  institutions, Palestinian governing bodies here in Jerusalem.  Where do you stand on this? Is this a violation of the  agreement and what precisely are you, as police minister, going  to do about it?    [Shahal] Well, certainly if the Palestinians are going to  establish Palestinian organizations and institutes in Jerusalem,  this is a violation of the agreement, of the declaration of  principles, and we certainly are going to take measures to  prevent the establishment of such institutes in Jerusalem.    [Katzenell] What about armed Palestinian security guards?  We hear that he has armed guards at Orient House.    [Shahal] This should be licensed by the Israeli Police and  certainly there will be no armed force in Jerusalem which does  not belong to the Israeli police force. If any person will do  such a thing then he is violating the laws and he will be  arrested like any other person within the state of Israel.    [Katzenell] Lastly sir, Yasir 'Arafat said yesterday that  Israel is leaving scorched earth in Gaza. The educational  system is destroyed, the housing is destroyed, everything is  destroyed. All the services are destroyed, he says, because of  the occupation. What is your reply to this? Has Israel  neglected and even destroyed the civilian infrastructure of the  territories?    [Shahal] Compared to what we received after the Six-Day War,  the situation in health, education, and the infrastructure is  immensely better than what we received. I think that what we  have done during that period of time cannot be compared even to  the progress in other Arab countries. The Palestinians living  in the West Bank and Gaza have more telephones per family, more  cars per family, than those say in Syria, or in Iraq, or even in  Jordan. [end recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in English at 1500 GMT on 5 June  also  reports that "the government has approved a loan of 400 million  shekels to the Kupat Holim Klalit Health Fund. Finance Minister  Avraham Shohat and Police Minister Moshe Shahal supported  appointing a receiver to the health fund, but they were the only  ministers who voted against the loan. Meretz ministers Yosi  Sarid and Ya'ir Tzaban abstained. Finance Minister Shohat said  he would honor the cabinet's decision though he said it did not  provide the solution necessary, and that drastic steps are  necessary to reform the health fund."]</p>

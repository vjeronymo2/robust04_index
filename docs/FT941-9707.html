			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Books: Victorian variations on Ali Baba - Anthony Curtis is still charmed by tales told by Sheherazade THE ARABIAN NIGHTS: A COMPANION by Robert Irwin Allen Lane Penguin Press Pounds 20, 344 pages As I read Robert Irwin's book I became more and more painfully aware of my ignorance of the whole fascinating corpus of stories that goes under the title of The Arabian Nights. (Literal translation, 'One Thousand Nights and a Night'). To rely upon one's few childhood memories of the stories of Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor (heavily bowdlerised, it emerges) is like thinking you know the Bible because you know about Moses in the bullrushes, David's conquest of Goliath and other biblical tales re-told for children. We tend to regard the Nights as a collection of Arab fairy tales. Irwin, a novelist and former university teacher, points out that the material 'includes long heroic epics, wisdom literature, fables, cosmological fantasy, pornography, scatological jokes, mystical devotional tales, chronicles of low life, rhetorical debates, and masses of poetry. A few tales are hundreds of pages long; others amount to no more than a short paragraph.' The Nights represent texts crucial to Western as well as Middle Eastern culture; but like the Bible and the works of Homer their authenticity, chronology, transmission and translation are all matters on which experts disagree. We do not know who the original authors were; we do not have complete primary texts from which to work and we English speakers do not even have a reliable translation of the whole collection, an authorised version. The earliest manuscript dates from the ninth century and is in the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The Victorian period saw a number of translations into both French and English. The most enlightening part of Irwin's book is the chapter where he deals with these. The version by Edward Lane, a lithographer, who worked in Cairo, appeared from 1838 to 1841, and gave the tales a wide currency in England. Lane was highly praised by Leigh Hunt; soon Tennyson, Browning and other Victorian writers were reading the tales. After that few imaginative writers escaped their influence in some form. Somerset Maugham read the Nights avidly when he was a schoolboy in his uncle's rectory in Kent where they were the only fiction on offer; and RL Stevenson wrote a linked series of fresh tales he called The New Arabian Nights. Lane's Nights were superseded in 1876-77 by the much fuller version made by John Payne for the Villon Society containing the scurrilous material that Lane, a clergyman's son, had left out. Then Sir Richard Burton, the explorer, who had been consul in Damascus and had published an account of his Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, approached Payne apparently to collaborate with him but went on to produce his own version. Irwin shows the lengths that Burton went to try to disguise how greatly his version was indebted to Payne's. There had been versions in French of Les Milles et une nuits since the 18th century. In 1704 Antoine Galland, an Arabic interpreter and museum curator, made a version. The odd thing about this was that it appeared to contain tales that are not in the extant manuscripts and no one is quite sure where Galland got them from. At the turn of the century Andre Gide, enamoured of all things Arabic, poured scorn on Galland's version in order to promote a new version by a friend of his - a Dr Madrus who hailed from the Caucusus but who was born in Cairo and had a career in France in medicine. Acclaimed when it appeared, the Madrus version reads now like a typical art nouveau product containing 'a fantasy Orient, compounded of Opium reveries, jewelled dissipation, lost paradises, melancholy opulence and odalisques pining in gilded cages'. Madrus claimed to be translating from a 17th century North African manuscript. In fact no such manuscript existed but the lie enabled Madrus to put in embellishments and new stories of his own. This version was translated from French into English by Powys Mathers in 1923. As recently as 1986 it was being marketed in paperback as 'the only complete and accurate version' in English. In 1990 an English version appeared by Husain Haddaway which Irwin thoroughly recommends for accuracy and readability. But this was taken from a Calcutta manuscript containing only 271 nights. A wider selection is to be found in the 1973 version for Penguin by NJ Dawood. Fortunately much of the charm and the compulsiveness survives in whatever version one happens to have to hand. The framing device of the whole series whereby the life of the narrator - the Vizier's beautiful daughter Sheherazade - hangs on her ability to sustain the curiosity of her tyrannical audience of one - King Shahiyar - is a timeless metaphor of authorship. It replicates throughout as characters within stories tell stories about characters who tell stories upon which their lives depend. If this was a valid notion a long time ago in the Middle East, Vladimir Propp the Russian folklorist analysed its continuing validity in his Morfologia Skazi in 1928, and there have been many subsequent attempts to codify the tales. Meanwhile contemporary creative writers like John Barth in his Chimera in 1973 and Salman Rushdie in his Haroun and the Sea of Stories in 1990 showed how the infinitely proliferating story can be resuscitated today. It will last as long as their are tales to be told and people to listen to them. Robert Irwin makes us aware of the strength of this narrative tradition in a fine, elegant, learned book.</p>

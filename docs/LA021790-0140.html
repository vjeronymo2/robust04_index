			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI'S TIEN STEPS INTO CENTER OF DEBATE ABOUT ASIAN STEREOTYPE  </P> <P> A stereotype has lurked behind the controversy over the allegations of  anti-Asian bias in UC Berkeley's admissions policies: Asian-Americans as  academic super-achievers.  </P> <P> Discipline and other cultural factors have propelled Asian-Americans to  extraordinary successes in higher education. But, Asian-American activists say,  bigots resent their achievement and fear universities will be overrun by Asian  students.  </P> <P> Into the debate steps Chang-Lin Tien, the UC Irvine executive vice chancellor  who was named Thursday as the next chancellor of UC Berkeley. Tien is the first  Asian-American to head a UC campus and may be the first to lead any major  research university. He and his family make no apologies for the super-achiever  image.  </P> <P> "I think he is a super-achiever and can accomplish anything," Masayoshi  Tomizuka, a mechanical engineering professor at UC Berkeley, said of the man  who was once his colleague and will soon be his boss. "Aggressive might not be  a good word, but he is very outgoing."  </P> <P> Tien, 54, and his wife, Di-Hwa, have two daughters and a son. All three  children graduated from UC Berkeley and are enrolled in tough graduate  programs: Norman in microelectronics at UC San Diego, Phyllis at UC San Diego  Medical School and Kristine at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.  </P> <P> Earning multiple degrees is a family tradition. Tien was born the son of a  banker in pre-revolutionary China. He earned an undergraduate degree in  mechanical engineering from National Taiwan University, a master's from the  University of Louisville (where, as a nonwhite, he felt anguish in the  segregated South of the 1950s), and a second master's and a Ph.D. from  Princeton University. All by age 24.  </P> <P> He went on to a long and prize-winning career in teaching and research,  specializing in heat-transfer technology, at UC Berkeley, eventually becoming  vice chancellor for research there. He was praised for his efforts to help  improve -- after much controversy -- conditions for laboratory animals.  </P> <P> Tien has been second in command at UC Irvine since 1988. Administrators, staff  members and students there credit Tien with initiating a number of innovative  programs, particularly in regard to affirmative action.  </P> <P> At a news conference on the UC Irvine campus Friday, however, Tien talked  modestly about his accomplishments and the role he played at the school, saying  that Chancellor Jack W. Peltason deserves much of the credit for the advances  made during Tien's 18 months at the campus.  </P> <P> "We initiated a number of initiatives in terms of getting cultural diversity, "  Tien said of the efforts he made with Peltason. "Again, I must emphasize that  many things were not initiated by me. . . . I don't think my leaving will  affect any of the programs or impact on their completion. The institution will  go on."  </P> <P> He also gave thanks for the support he received during his tenure. "I feel the  community here and the faculty, students and staff have been extraordinarily  generous and kind to me," he said.  </P> <P> Prof. Joseph Frisch, who worked with Tien in the mechanical engineering  department at UC Berkeley, described him as a bright, friendly and hard-working  man "who can be very hard-nosed if he has to be."  </P> <P> "He is not the typical engineer," Frisch said. "He is not just a  problem-solver. I think he has a very good understanding of psychology."  </P> <P> Ling-chi Wang, chairman of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley, said that Tien, a  naturalized American citizen, "is not the stereotype of the Chinese scholar  being very reserved, very dignified, very soft-spoken; nor is he the stereotype  of the aggressive white executive slapping people on the back. He is sort of in  between."  </P> <P> Tien takes over at UC Berkeley July 1. Among his challenges will be to replace  the large number of professors expected to retire within the next few years and  to raise the number of minority teachers at the school while maintaining the  school's worldwide reputation for excellence. He also will inherit a federal  investigation into allegations of ethnic bias in admissions. The federal  inquiry comes after several state and university investigations that turned up  nothing conclusive.  </P> <P> "I don't think any world-class university can achieve excellence without  diversity," said Tien, who still has a strong Chinese accent. "So diversity and  excellence must come hand-in-hand."  </P> <P> Staff writer Tony Marcano contributed to this report.  </P></p>

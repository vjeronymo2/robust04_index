			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (8): The walls have come down - Philip Manchester on security Breaches of security in computer networks are not only embarrassing  - they are also costly. A survey of UK companies conducted by the National Computing Centre (NCC) this year put the average cost of a security breach at more than Pounds 9,000. The survey also revealed that four out of five companies had reported security breaches in the past two years. The NCC survey describes a wide range of security problems and highlights how important the issue has become  - especially since the spread of computer networks and powerful desktop computers. Malicious network hackers, 'virus' software, criminals and even staff with a grudge are just some of the possible security threats which are the inevitable result of opening up computer networks and distributing computer power. 'With today's networks, security is an architectural issue. As we move to distributed computing by replacing the central mainframe with networks of PCs, it makes systems more vulnerable,' says Mr Gordon Eubanks, chief executive of US security software specialist Symantec. 'It is a bit like the change from guarding a house with one entrance to guarding a house with 10  - it is not an insoluble problem but it needs companies to take action,' Mr Eubanks continues. Mr Chris Hook, a managing consultant at the NCC who specialises in security, says: 'The walls around the system have come down and control has shifted to end users. They do not know how dangerous it is not to take precautions because they have not been trained.' He says staff training is one of the keys to making computer network more secure and that there is room for improvement. In the NCC survey, companies were asked if they trained their staff to follow security procedures and most said that they did. But when asked if the procedures were actually followed, the picture was very different. 'Only 27 per cent were following the procedures in practice. This shows that companies think they have trained their staff when in fact they need to explain why the procedures are needed,' Mr Hook observes. In addition to proper training, Mr Hook also recommends that companies must plan both for preventative security and for coping with breaches. 'You have to think through the implications of a security breach on the business and identify the important threats,' says Mr Keith Dunnicliffe, a security consultant at Group Bull in the UK. 'There is a danger that people get carried away with technology and pour a lot of money into anti-virus programs, log-in systems and the like. But you must step back and look at the simple things  - the company procedures; who has access to the system; and so on. Then you can see the risks and the costs of coping with them in a business context.'</p>

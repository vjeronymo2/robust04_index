			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Citroen plans more cuts in workforce CITROEN yesterday said it was cutting 1,180 jobs from its 30,000 workforce in response to the depressed state of the European car market, writes John Ridding in Paris. They will be in addition to the 860 still to be shed as part of previous rationalisation plans by the French car company. Most of the reduction is expected to be accomplished through early retirement, part-time employment and relocation of employees. The French car market is forecast to shrink about 16 per cent this year in volume.</p>

			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / IG Metall predicts acceptance of steel deal STEEL, metal and engineering workers throughout east Germany will soon accept the Saxony compromise agreed last Friday between IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, and the employers, union officials predict. Mr Jorg Barczynski, IG Metall's federal spokesman, was confident yesterday of acceptance despite the initial rejection of the deal in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Berlin-Brandenburg. However, strikes in the steel industry could continue 'for a bit longer' because it would not receive the same pay increases as the metal and electrical workers. Last week's agreement between Gesamtmetall, the metal and electrical employers' association, and IG Metall delays the equalisation of east and west German wages by two years to mid-1996. Pay increases, designed to bring eastern wages up to 80 per cent of western German levels last April, will be postponed until next December. Mr Barczynski said these pay rises, although short of the 26 per cent for the metal and electrical sector agreed in the March 1991 contract between the union and employers, still represented a victory. 'In practice, the pay increase is about 21.7 per cent if we take into account other gains, such as two days longer holidays and Christmas money.' Yesterday, union officials in Berlin-Brandenburg said they wanted equal wages among the steel and metal industries. Talks are due to resume today with the metal and electrical employers, but the union said strikes in the steel sector would continue until the steel employers drew up a separate agreement. Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin-Brandenburg, said: 'The Saxony agreement makes the road to income parity too long, and the wage increase this year too small.' The union yesterday started holding ballots in Saxony to end the strike. If 25 per cent of its members vote Yes, the strikes could be called off in that state tomorrow. Ballots are expected to take place today in Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia.</p>

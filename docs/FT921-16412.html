			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / A Hurd day's night: Robert Mauthner on a typical working day for the UK foreign secretary It is just as well that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, refused to subscribe to the social provisions of the recent Maastricht treaty, for it would have disqualified his foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, from doing his job. A 48-hour working week - one of the central tenets of the Social Chapter - was never devised for anyone heading an important department of state, let alone for a foreign secretary at the centre of important international events or negotiations. Britain may have lost an empire, but it has gained a European Community, increasing rather than diminishing the workload of what is still called the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Today's 'restless natives' are to be found in Europe rather than in the remoter regions of Africa or the far east, but they are no less time-consuming. Day-trips or two-day visits to Brussels and other Community capitals, often involving very late-night return flights to London, have become part and parcel of the normal working week of a foreign secretary who sees his EC counterparts rather more often than his own Cabinet colleagues. But even an average 'non-travelling' working day can last as long as 18 hours, including official lunch and dinner engagements, not necessarily always enjoyable occasions; a constant round of cocktail party dialogue can be very boring, even when you have had as much practice at it as Mr Hurd. A fairly typical day would see the 'SOS' (secretary of state), as he is familiarly known to his staff, getting up at 7am at his official residence at No 1 Carlton Gardens. A quick skim through all the newspapers followed by a light, non-cooked breakfast (in the kitchen, it is said) with his wife Judy and children Philip, 8, and Jessica, 7, sets Mr Hurd up for the first ordeal of the day: live radio interviews with Radio 4's Today programme and Independent Radio News, both of which have sent radio cars to his home. After listening to the 8am news in the radio car and being put through his paces by the BBC's Mr Brian Redhead or Mr John Humphreys, Mr Hurd will often briskly walk the few hundred yards to his office in King Charles Street, his green Loden overcoat giving him the air of a member of the imperial Habsburg household. First stop will be the private outer office on the first floor, where Mr Hurd's principal private secretary will present him with a batch of something like 60 telegrams, some of them requiring urgent attention. Once a week, this will be followed at 9am by a policy co-ordination meeting of all the FCO ministers and most senior officials and advisers, particularly on issues of immediate political significance. At such meetings Mrs Lynda Chalker, a minister of state, might bring up the plight of the Kurds in Iraq (as she frequently does), or a discussion will take place on the advisability of recognising Croatia and Slovenia. During the run-up to the European summit in Maastricht last month, the frequency of such high-level internal meetings chaired by the foreign secretary became much greater. Typically, at 10am, in the presence of Sir David Gillmore, the permanent under-secretary, Mr Len Appleyard, the political director, and Mr Michael Jay, the assistant under-secretary for European Community affairs, the Dutch proposal on majority voting for common foreign and security policy decisions was carefully analysed, the first of several such discussions on the subject during the day. The foreign secretary always takes a very active part in these talks with the experts, frequently disagreeing with the proposals put up to him and imposing an alternative policy line. However, this is always done by rational argument; putting down officials in front of their colleagues is not Mr Hurd's style. Mid-mornings will often be spent in talks with visiting foreign officials for which Mr Hurd will have to adapt himself to a completely different geographical region and subject matter; on this occasion he is calling on President Masire of Botswana at the Dorchester Hotel. Supported by the Foreign Office's most senior African expert, Mr Patrick Fairweather, a deputy under-secretary, Mr Hurd will have to switch his attention from proposals for extending democratic control over the EC's centralised institutions and the civil war in Yugoslavia to the spread of democracy in Africa and the intensification of violence in South Africa. From the Dorchester, straight to Nomura House in the City, where shortly after midday the foreign secretary is to attend a British-Japanese parliamentary symposium on Japanese trade and investment in Europe and the US. After a few well-chosen words, he has to rush back to No 1 Carlton Gardens where he is hosting a 'smallish' lunch for the Greek foreign minister, Mr Antonis Samaras. Mr Hurd likes Mr Samaras, who is unusually young for a Greek cabinet minister, and whom he sees as often as every 10 days either in EC or Nato meetings. Plenty of talk about the consequences of Maastricht, Greece's application for membership of the Western European Union defence organisation and, of course, Cyprus and Turkey. But all very informal, including the toasts. No Churchillian cat naps after lunch, but a quick conversation with his wife Judy, who does not have too many opportunities to be with her husband, except during the interminable if infrequent Commonwealth heads of government conferences. In the afternoon the pace quickens. First, a briefing for the new British ambassadors to the three Baltic states, to prepare them for the difficult task facing them in these newly-independent countries, presently reviewing their relations with the recently set up Commonwealth of Independent States. Then, half-an-hour with ex-US President Jimmy Carter, who has come to talk to Mr Hurd about his Centre for the Promotion of Democracy and Conflict Resolution and his experience of monitoring elections in Zambia. A quick office meeting on an article the foreign secretary has undertaken to write for a Sunday newspaper on the outcome of the Maastricht conference, is followed by a meeting with an all-party Kashmir group, a 15-minutes letter- and telegram-signing session, 30 minutes with Mr Tony Galsworthy, the British representative on the Sino-British Hong Kong Joint Liaison Group and a rapid appearance in the early evening at a party given by his old boss, former prime minister Mr Edward Heath. The pace continues briskly as the evening gets under way. On many evenings the foreign secretary attends a cocktail reception or hosts a dinner. Today, Mr Hurd is giving a dinner at his residence for Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the Czechoslovak foreign minister, to which he has invited a wide range of guests including academics, industrialists and journalists. This is the kind of function Mr Hurd likes best. It is intended as a relaxed prelude to more official talks with Mr Dienstbier the following day. The last guests do not leave until about 10.45 pm and then the work continues. Mr Hurd retires to the sitting room with his red box full of what are known in the official jargon as 'submissions' - formal proposals and recommendations put to him by other ministers and officials on subjects ranging from the dissolution of the Soviet Union to the fight against drugs. They include a number of so-called 'trigger' telegrams which will not be issued until the 'SOS' gives his formal imprimatur Bed-time is usually not until 1am, often later. It has been a heavy day, but no heavier than attendance at an EC or Nato conference abroad, when plenary sessions are interspersed with bilateral meetings with foreign ministers from other participating countries, not to speak of the obligatory media conferences which no politician can afford to avoid. Injected into this punishing schedule are parliamentary debates, question-time in the House of Commons and frequent visits to his own west Oxfordshire constituency and tours of other constituencies. Yet Mr Hurd still found time to visit Maxim Gorky's house during a recent visit to Moscow, sprint round the Roman forum during the November Nato summit, take a quick peep at the picturesque main square in Maastricht after the gruelling European summit and attend the carol service at his son's school just before Christmas. 'If there's half an hour to spare, he'll get out,' an admiring, if exhausted official panted. 'Yet he's always contained and never really explodes, though he's pretty intolerant of waffle.' That is hardly surprising given the foreign secretary's tight timetable. Yet one feels sure that, if push came to shove, he could even spare a couple of minutes for waffle.</p>

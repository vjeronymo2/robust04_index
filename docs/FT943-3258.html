			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / World Trade News: German exports set for 7% rise German exports are set to rise by around 7 per cent this year and next year, according to a report from the Hamburg-based HWWA research institute which predicts the German trade surplus could reach around DM80bn (Dollars 52bn) by the end of next year, Michael Lindemann writes from Bonn. This is close to levels last seen in the mid-1980s. Imports are likely to grow about 6 per cent in real terms over the same period, the report said, helped by rising imports from eastern Europe.</p>

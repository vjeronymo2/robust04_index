			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Books: Bedside books WHAT a long way we have come. Sex was once a private affair whose existence could not be acknowledged without a blush or a wink. Today it ranks with fashion, gardening or home improvements as a leisure occupation that supports a multi-billion-dollar industry. Paul Ferris's book Sex and the British (Michael Joseph Pounds 18.99, 337 pages) is about how the British have over 100 years learned to accept sex as something you get taught on television. He has heroically consulted a great many sources, collected a great many anecdotes and stitched them together in a stylish way. Yet his history proves as indigestible as a double helping of steamed jam roll. Better not to treat it as a narrative, but as an anthology to taste from the index backwards. A bedside book, in other words. Helen Fisher, an anthropolo gist, has written the ancient history of sex in Anatomy of Love (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 16.99, 430 pages). She takes us back to the caves and suggests that adultery is the consequence of a genetically-transmitted chemical change in the brain which occurs after four years of passion (not seven). It may be comforting - or not - to learn that modern sexual licence is just homo sapiens reverting to type. Men's adultery is old hat, so publishers are interested in women's. In The Erotic Silence of Married Women (Bloomsbury Pounds 16.99, 304 pages), Dalma Heyn, an American feminist, talks to a number of women who tell her that sex outside marriage is more fun than sex within and that shopping can be just as exciting. Her title is a tease, her book a bore. Lotte and Joseph Hamburger have a more promising subject in Sarah Austin, a respectable Victorian woman who falls in epistolary love with a Prussian bounder, Prince Hermann von Puckler-Muskau, whose saucy memoirs she has translated and censored. It is sad to see such innocent affection exploited in Contemplating Adultery (Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 314): one's first reaction is to wish that poor Mrs. Austin's unrevealing letters had never come to light. Few writers are good at sex, they say. They are right.</p>

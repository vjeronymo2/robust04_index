			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hoogovens buys control of NB Steel HOOGOVENS, the Dutch steel producer, has agreed to acquire the 60 per cent it did not already own in Norsk Blikkvalseverk, of Norway, AP-DJ reports from Amsterdam. NB Steel will add 130,000 tonnes a year to Hoogoven's annual steel production of 670,000 tons for the packaging industry. The Dutch company declined to disclose revenues from its packaging steel business. However, prices presently run at between Fl 800 and Fl 1,200 (Dollars 700) per tonne, depending on the type and quality of the steel being used, industry officials said. Hoogovens said the full takeover of Bergen-based NB Steel would strengthen the Dutch company's position in the world packaging steel industry. Hoogovens acquired the initial 40 per cent stake in NB Steel in January 1990. Meanwhile, Hoogovens declined to comment on a report that it is seeking a deferral of payments on a loan from the Dutch government. Hoogovens is seeking to reschedule payments on the 10-year, Fl 570m subordinated loan issued in 1984 by the Economics Ministry, according to the report. The loan was obtained to help finance a far-reaching restructuring plan following the collapse of Estel, its partnership with Hoesch, the German steel manufacturer.</p>

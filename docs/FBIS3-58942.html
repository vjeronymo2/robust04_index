			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jochen Thies: "Germans Shy Away From </F> Partnership in Leadership"]    [Text] Unification has turned Germany into one of the major  actors in international politics. Yet Bonn continues to prefer  keeping a very low profile in terms of foreign and security  policy. German foreign policy suffers from a lack of concept and  orientation. One reason for this is that the Foreign Ministry  continues to be affected by the fact that under Hans-Dietrich  Genscher it used to focus on positions -- both regarding  personnel and contents -- many of which have become shaky since  1989 or turned out to be wrong.    Only four years ago, it looked as if Bonn had really risen  to  a real partner at the side of the United States during the  two-plus-four process, while, meanwhile, the picture has  changed. Not only since the Brussels NATO summit one has the  feeling that German foreign policy, particularly in East Europe,  is sailing in the tow of the Americans. As far as the Balkans  is concerned, UN Security Council members Britain and France can  determine what is going on at Germany's doorstep. Bonn has  conformed itself to the role of junior partner. Would the same  be conceivable in Northern Ireland or in Algeria under reverse  circumstances?    In view of Germany's recent past, the current conditions in  Europe, and international politics, no one will endorse a  foreign policy that undertakes actions of its own in East Europe  and the rest of the world. The request cannot be: the Germans  to the front. [preceding five words in English] Nevertheless,  it is necessary for Germany to formulate interests of its own.    One dilemma of Germany's current Russia policy is, for  example, that the United States has put high stakes on the  Moscow card and neglected the remaining East European area.  Thus, Germany has been maneuvered into dangerous tracks. After  all, the laws of history and geography are valid and they make  German politics vulnerable should it turn out wrong one day to  exclusively have banked on Gorbachev and, subsequently, Yeltsin.    If Germany has learned a lesson from the last century and if  there is a moral requirement for Germany, then it is the  following: Under all circumstances cooperate as closely as  possible with those countries of East Europe to which it has a  major historic obligation; first of all, Poland, Hungary, and  the Czech Republic. Germany must not become once again a  barrier between West and East, and, thus, a special case in  politics.    This requirement has been neglected in the past few months.  Amid major efforts to include the French into the GATT  agreement, Bonn's ostpolitik has been ignored. Along with  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, Clinton has taken the  initiative here. Although one hears of close coordination with  Bonn, one feels very little of it in practical politics.    In the 1980's, the politicians travelled too much, whereas  now they do not meet often enough. In his European tour,  Clinton conspicuously left out Germany. The short previous  visit by Vice President Gore to Oggersheim cannot change this  fact. Characteristically, the chancellor now has to pay a  lightning visit to the United States at the end of the month to  compensate for the "canceled meeting."    The Balkans conflict has become almost the only reason that  West Europeans still meet, while they have achieved nothing  there but only pile up flight kilometers and conference hours.  As a superpower, the Americans discuss things with Russia  while, otherwise, concentrating on domestic policy issues and  their neighbors in the Pacific. Clinton met Yeltsin for the  first time in Vancouver and received the Pacific Basin neighbors  in Seattle. Now there is the danger of civil-war like  developments in the neighboring country -- NAFTA partner Mexico  -- which might reduce America's interest in East Europe, while  Germany can be happy to see the last Russian withdraw by August  without the interference of Zhirinovskiy.    Under these extraordinarily dramatic circumstances would it  not be necessary to finally practice that partnership in  leadership, which George Bush offered the Germans in his famous  speech in Mainz on 31 May 1989? Bonn is still hesitating, but  even the Bundestag election year is no reason to abstain from  world politics.</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Southern Radio at Pounds 165,000 SOUTHERN Radio, formed last November via the reverse takeover of Invicta Sound, reported profits of Pounds 165,000 pre-tax for the six months to March 31. The outcome included a four-month contribution from Radio South. Mr Robert Sperring, chairman, said that advertising revenue has 'shown encouraging signs that business confidence is returning'. Earnings per share worked through at 0.71p but 'due to the continuing volatility of advertising expenditure' no interim dividend is proposed. Directors hope to resume payments at the year-end.</p>

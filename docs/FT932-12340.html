			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Serb parliament backs peace plan SERBIA'S parliament yesterday endorsed an international peace plan for Bosnia in an effort to stave off military intervention. The belated show of support for the previously vilified plan comes a day after tough new sanctions were imposed on Serbia and Montenegro. The new measures were imposed after the Bosnian Serb assembly on Monday rejected a peace plan, despite its backing by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav president, and Mr Momir Bulatovic, president of Montenegro. The parliament's vote to back Mr Milosevic's appeal could signal a split in the alliance between his ruling Socialists and the ultra-nationalist Serbian Radicals. Diplomats yesterday remained unconvinced by the last-minute appeal for peace. 'There have not yet been tangible signs that they are prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the Bosnian Serbs aboard,' said one. Meanwhile, new clashes between Croat and Moslem forces erupted in central Bosnia. Bosnian radio said Croat forces were launching sporadic attacks near Jablanica and Kiseljak, just west of Sarajevo. Bosnian Radio said Serb forces had launched an assault near Brcko, in the north-east, while Serbian radio claimed Moslems and Croats were attacking the area. Bosnian Serbs warned the UN High Commissioner for Refugees that aid convoys would not be allowed into the eastern town of Gorazde for two weeks. According to Bosnian radio there was also heavy fighting in Bihac, the north-western Moslem heartland. Reuter adds: A UN Security Council team recently returned from Bosnia proposed designating Sarajevo a UN safe area, as well as the towns of Tuzla, Gorazde and Zepa. This would involve the withdrawal of weapons. The first safe area declared by the Security Council, on April 16, was Srebrenica.</p>

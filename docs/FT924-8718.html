			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Land Rover raises output of Discovery LAND ROVER is increasing production of its Discovery four-wheel-drive leisure vehicle by about 10 per cent to 600 a week. The move to the higher output level, which began yesterday, is to cater for increased demand, particularly in the UK, Land Rover said last night. It comes in the wake of the faint hopes raised by the statistics for October new-vehicle registrations that the long and severe slump in UK sales of new vehicles may at last be coming to an end. Sales of new cars in October were 8.2 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago, bringing sales in the first 10 months of the year to 1.4m, although this is still 1.9 per cent lower than a year ago. Recovery hopes were strengthened by registrations of new commercial vehicles also rising last month, by 5.3 per cent. Demand for the Discovery has been consistently ahead of the mainstream car market, with UK sales up 19 per cent so far this year. This is the second time within three months that Discovery output has increased. Earlier in the year it was 500 a week. No extra jobs will be created. The 8,000 workers at Land Rover's Birmingham plant will meet the higher output levels through overtime and Saturday working. And Land Rover said the number of workers was expected to continue to fall by about 10 per cent a year through non-replacement of leavers and improved productivity. The plant is to stay on single-shift working. Land Rover's total output, which includes Range Rovers and Land Rovers, is expected to remain unchanged this year at about 55,000. This is similar to 1991 but below the record 69,000 output of 1990. About 70 per cent of Land Rover's total output is exported. The company refused to forecast whether overseas sales would be boosted by sterling's devaluation - the main factor behind an announcement by Volkswagen yesterday that it is increasing its UK prices by an average of 2.9 per cent from November 16. Most leading car importers have been studying how best to raise prices after the devaluation. They have delayed only because of the depressed state of the market. Several German and French producers have already raised prices in Italy following the lira devaluation. BMW and Mercedes-Benz are expected to impose increases of up to 6 per cent, and Volkswagen's is widely expected to be a two-stage increase, with a second rise early next year.</p>

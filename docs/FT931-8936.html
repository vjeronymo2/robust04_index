			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Lucas Industries to lay off 510 staff LUCAS Industries, the international engineering group, plans to lay off 510 employees at its plants which make pumps for diesel engines, in Gillingham and Rochester, Kent. The group yesterday blamed falling demand, especially in the agricultural machinery and off-highway vehicle markets. Some redundancies had been expected at the plants. Last October Lucas said it would reduce its workforce by 2,750, half of which would be in the UK - reducing the worldwide Lucas workforce to 47,000 from 59,000 in July 1990. The Rochester plant, which has 156 employees, will close this summer. The Gillingham plant, which also supplies diesel fuel injection systems for the Ford Transit van, has 1,856 employees. Yesterday Lucas could not say how many of the latest round of redundancies sprang from the fall in orders and how many were the result of the planned slimming of the group workforce.</p>

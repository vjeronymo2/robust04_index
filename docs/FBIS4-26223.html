			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS) -- According to the Ministry  of Agriculture, though the area under cultivation of summer  grain crops this year in the country is seven million mu less  than that of last year, China is still expected to have a good  summer harvest this year.    The area cultivated for rape seeds this year is about 84.2  million mu of land in the country, 7.7 million mu more than that  of last year. The actual harvesting area is estimated to be  around 80 million mu, 5 million mu more than that of last year.  Its gross output is predicted to have a remarkable increase  this summer.    The production of summer grain crop this year met some  difficulties. First, owing to the restructuring of crop  planting, this summer's grain-crops-growing area dropped.  Second, because of the adjustment of exchange rate of renminbi  and price rise, prices for the main agricultural production  materials increased greatly. Third, the weather in early days in  such crops' growing period was not so good with the accumulated  temperature in this period being 200 to 300 degrees centigrade  less than that in past years.    Thanks to the strengthening of field management and good  weather in later days, a good harvest of such crops including  wheat is guaranteed.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRESS ADDS TO NASCAR LEAD WITH SAUGUS WIN  </P> <P> How is Dan Press driving? Dial 1-800-EAT DUST.  </P> <P> Rewriting the NASCAR All-American Challenge Series Southwest Tour record book,  Press, a resident of Frazier Park, increased his sizable points lead Saturday  night, racing to his record seventh victory of the season before a crowd of  5,861 at Saugus Speedway.  </P> <P> The competition, which has seen little more than Press' rear bumper this  season, may as well have phoned this one in.  </P> <P> Press, the field's fastest qualifier, started eighth in a partially inverted  starting system but climbed into the lead for good on Lap 54 of the 100-lap  race by virtue of skillful inside passes on the one-third-mile oval.  </P> <P> From there, Press roared unchallenged to the checkered flag, his lead pared  only by three lengthy yellow flags that helped extend the race into a 78-minute  marathon.  </P> <P> Press finished one second ahead of pole-sitter Mike Chase of Bakersfield.  </P> <P> "We started running the tour on and off when it started a few years ago," Press  said. "But we knew we had the potential. We knew if we could get our stuff  together, we were going to be successful."  </P> <P> Press has been a smashing success. He is the only driver in the Tour's  four-year history with more than five victories in a season. He also is the  only driver to post three top one-lap qualifying times in a season.  </P> <P> Earlier in the evening, Press established a track record with a one-lap time of  15.58 seconds. The mark was the fastest of eight qualifying marks that bettered  Press' record time of 15.75 seconds established in June. That night, Press won  the 125-lap Southwest Tour event at Saugus.  </P> <P> "He's just a little bit faster at Saugus," said Chase, the Tour's 1987  champion.  </P> <P> With the win, Press extended his points lead over Troy Beebe of Modesto to 134  points with four races remaining. He earned $3,200 for the victory. Press'  earnings this season stand at $30,424.  </P> <P> Barring misfortune, Press is a certainty to eclipse the Tour's season record of  $35,501, set by defending champion Roman Calczynski of Sepulveda.  </P> <P> Calczynski, winless this season, finished third.  </P> <P> In other races, Steve Teets of Poway won the 25-lap Southwest Tour semi-main  event to advance to the main event. Kevin Riniker of Riverside finished second.  </P></p>

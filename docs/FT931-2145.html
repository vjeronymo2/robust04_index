			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / People: BP clips senior executives' wings Less flying and more decision-making seems to be the main purpose of the latest top management reshuffle at BP. Rodney Chase and Hugh Norton, BP's two regional managing directors who have been based overseas in Cleveland and Singapore, are being brought back to BP's group headquarters in London. Rodney Chase, 49, who took over as chairman and chief executive of BP America a year ago, will remain chairman of BP America and retain group responsibility for the Western hemisphere. Hugh Norton, 56, who was sent out to Singapore less than two years ago as part of an upgrading of BP's presence in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, will retain his responsibilities for these areas. But he will be based in London from July and Chase will return from the US in the second half of the year. David Simon, who took over as BP's chief executive after the ousting of Bob Horton in June, says that the moves 'complete the co-location of BP's businesses and regional managing directors in one centre and will enable the executive team to extend and integrate its work programmes more closely.' Given that both men are supposed to put in appearances at the regular managing directors' meetings, it meant they spent a considerable amount of their time either flying to London or missing meetings. Although BP portrays the latest upheavals as a routine reorganisation, it means that BP America will have had its third chief executive in less than two years. Chase replaced James Ross, who left to be chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless, and Chase is now being replaced as chief executive of BP America by Chuck Bowman, who has headed BP Australia for the last three years. Bowman takes up his new post at the beginning of 1994. He in turn will be replaced by fellow American Ron McGimpsey, currently chief financial officer and senior vice president of BP America. Les Atkinson, general manager of BP Oil, succeeds Norton as regional director Asia Pacific, also becoming chief executive BP Oil, S E Asia.</p>

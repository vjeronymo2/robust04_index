			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Wild card in volatile gameof nuclear power poker: Territorial claims to Crimea THE FRONT page of Crimea's most popular newspaper last week displayed a deck of cards in which the joker had been replaced by a map of the sunny Black Sea peninsula. The drawing illustrated Crimeans' rueful awareness that this stretch of rocky beaches and vineyards has become the wild card in the volatile relationship between Ukraine and Russia. For the time being, Ukrainian-Russian disputes over the military and economy have been restricted to volleys of newsprint and hostile parliamentary resolutions. But should economic crisis create political instability in the two nuclear Slavic giants, Crimea could play Sarajevo in the sparking of a military confrontation potentially more destructive than the First World War. In fact, Russia's attachment to Crimea is warm but not too deep. Russia first took control of the peninsula little more than 200 years ago and as recently as 1926 Russians accounted for only 22 per cent of the population. Likewise, Ukrainian interests in Crimea are more geopolitical than emotional. To date the conflict has been more of a high stakes diplomatic poker game than a Yugoslav-style fight to the death. The players are expected to show their hand on Friday, when presidents of the Commonwealth of Independent States meet in Minsk. The Russian strategy, as outlined in a memorandum from Mr Vladimir Lukin, then chairman of the parliamentary commission on foreign affairs, to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, is to use territorial claims on the Crimea as a lever to pressure Ukraine to drop its aim to take over a substantial part of the Black Sea fleet. From the Ukrainian perspective, Crimea is the key to a Pandora's box of rival territorial claims, which could transform the former Soviet Union into a Yugoslavia writ large. Most western leaders have carefully labelled Crimea a hands-off internal dispute, but in Kiev last month Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, backed Ukraine saying it had 'strong legal arguments' for retaining Crimea. In a delicate and dangerous diplomatic game, Mr Lukin's memo was followed in mid-January by a resolution from his commission questioning the legality of the 1954 transfer of the Crimea from Russia to Ukraine. The Ukrainian parliament responded with scathing criticism. The Russian parliament then opted to postpone its review of the matter until after the Minsk meeting, but passed a resolution insisting that the Black Sea fleet should not be divided, as Ukraine would like. Mr Lukin's barter of the Crimea for the fleet may work. At the weekend Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, deputy chairman of the Ukrainian parliament, said it was likely Ukraine would agree to the deal. This manoeuvring, inside what was once a superpower, exemplifies the way in which the collapse of the Soviet Union has rewritten the rules of international diplomacy. But Crimeans believe much is unchanged. 'We were not consulted in 1954 and we are not consulted today,' complained Ms Elvira Kara-Oglan, a 26-year-old Crimean Tartar. In Simferopol, Crimea's capital, people have been queueing to sign a petition calling for a referendum on Crimean independence. A vote will be mandatory if 180,000 signatures are gathered by April 3. Many Ukrainians argue that independence is just the first step to unification with Russia and that is certainly the thinly veiled hope of Mr Yuri Mishkov, leader of the movement that is spearheading the petition drive. But many Crimeans, who voted narrowly for Ukrainian independence in December but have since been disappointed by the country's inept economic reforms, genuinely wish to opt out of the Ukrainian-Russian tussle. Mr Hennadi Iarovyi, the deputy mayor of Simferopol, predicts a vote for independence but warns that Ukraine could retaliate by cutting off electricity and water. That tactic has worked before. In 1918, by means of a tariff war, the short-lived Ukrainian Republic compelled Crimea's shaky German-backed government to join Ukraine as an autonomous republic with wide local authority. That is the very arrangement Ukrainian politicians hope to entrench in negotiations with the Crimean leadership over the next month.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Splitsville for Chong and Howell: C. Thomas Howell has filed for divorce from  actress Rae Dawn Chong, citing irreconcilable differences after just over a  year of marriage.  </P> <P> Howell, who starred in "Soul Man" and "The Hitcher," separated from Chong on  June 1, court documents said. In his petition, Howell, who lives in Los  Angeles, asked the court to award him clothing, jewelry and personal items and  "post-separation earnings, accumulations and acquisitions." The petition seeks  a division of community property, but no spousal support. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

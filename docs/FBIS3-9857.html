			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The two rapporteurs of the Council of Europe,  Friedrich Koenig and Gunnar Janssen, who are currently visiting  Bucharest, have so far held three meetings with the  representatives of the UDMR [Democratic Union of Hungarians in  Romania], the Romanies' minority, and with representatives of  the National Council for Ethnic Minorities.    Our correspondent Dan Preda informed us that the  representatives of the UDMR made numerous critical remarks about  the Government of Romania and accused it of having an attitude  of duplicity and of lacking any real political will to solve the  recommendations formulated for Romania upon our country's  admittance to the Council of Europe. The UDMR representatives  mentioned that, in the six months that have elapsed since the  day when Romania joined the Council of Europe, no program for  fulfilling the recommendations has been drafted or implemented.  Likewise, the representatives of the UDMR affirmed that certain  parties or political circles, both in the parliament as well as  at the level of local administration in Romania, are still  showing an attitude of intolerance and xenophobia. The UDMR  representatives also criticized the attitude of the mayor of  Cluj-Napoca Municipality and affirmed that he started  implementing new discriminatory measures. The prefects were  accused of taking abusive measures disfavoring the Hungarian  minority as far as the bilingual signs and inscriptions are  concerned.    The UDMR leaders also mentioned that the parliament approved  certain discriminatory articles or laws, and as an example they  mentioned the law on war veterans and the police law.    During the talks with the Council of Europe rapporteurs, the  UDMR representatives mentioned that the pardoning decree signed  by Romania's president, quote, only partially satisfied a  written request of the UDMR, but since the act itself took place  just before the arrival of the Council of Europe rapporteurs, it  does not show a consistent policy aimed at implementing the  recommendations of the Council of Europe, unquote.    Senator Gyorgy Frunda said that the presidential decree was  based on ethnic criteria and several members of the Executive  Committee of the Romanian Communist Party of Hungarian origin  have remained imprisoned. He also draw Mr. Koenig's attention  to the fact that Pal Cseresznyes, condemned after the March 1990  events in Targu Mures, although not guilty, has still not been  pardoned.    Continuing their discussions, the rapporteurs met with  representatives of Romanies and discussed the problems faced by  this minority. During the talks, the Romanies discussed ways in  which the court of justice approached cases that referred to the  devastation of Romanies' dwellings in some counties.    Finally, the two rapporteurs held a meeting with the  representatives of the National Council for Minorities. Viorel  Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government, said that the  law on minorities is in its final stage of drafting and the  government will forward it to the parliament the moment it is  ready. Mr. Hrebenciuc also said that he hopes that Romania will  ratify the convention for human rights by 15 April.    During the same talks, the representative of the (?Italian)  minority affirmed that any ethnic minority has the right of veto  in discussions that refer to that minority's own problems, and  this does not justify any withdrawal from the Council of  Minorities. The withdrawal of the Hungarian representatives  from this council was considered as an example of lack of  patience in finding solutions to certain problems. The head of  the council, Viorel Hrebenciuc, also said that the establishment  of this council shows the interest and political will to solve  the problems of minorities in our country, and this is why the  council has asked for a higher budget for this year than for the  last year, our correspondent Dan Preda also informed us.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / International Company News: Swiss watchmaker SMH to create new share class SMH, the leading Swiss watchmaking group, said it would split its registered shares and convert its participation certificates into a new class of bearer share. However, it would maintain restrictions on foreign ownership to ensure that the Swiss identity of the group and its products - which include such famous brands as Swatch, Omega, Longines, Tissot and Rado - would be preserved. The group plans to split each SFr100 registered share into five SFr10 registered shares plus one new SFr50 bearer share. Each SFr20 registered share will be split into two SFr10 registered shares. Each SFr100 participation certificate will be converted into two SFr50 bearer shares. The new bearer and registered shares would each have one vote per share. The pool of Swiss shareholders led by Mr Nicolas Hayek, which has 52 per cent of the votes, will probably see their voting power decline fractionally. Mr Hayek said the proportion of foreign ownership of the group was probably over 40 per cent. But the by-laws provide that foreigners as a group can vote only 30 per cent of the registered shares and, as individuals, can only vote 3 per cent. Motor-Columbus, the electrical technology group controlled by Union Bank of Switzerland, plunged into a loss of SFr182m last year, compared with a profit of SFr65m in 1991, and the directors proposed passing the dividend.</p>

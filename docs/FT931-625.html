			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Peolple: Fine balance at NHS Trust The allocation of top jobs at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, which are combining to form the biggest National Health Service trust in London, shows a fine balance between the two ancient institutions. This follows the appointment earlier this month of Tim Matthews, St Thomas' chief executive, to head the new organisation. Michael Maisey, consultant in nuclear medicine at Guy's, and Tony Young, consultant surgeon and director of surgery at St Thomas', will jointly hold the post of medical director on the new board. John Pelly, finance director of St Thomas', will be the new finance director. He worked at 3i and Rank Xerox before joining the public sector. The post of project director goes to Karen Caines, currently general manager of Guy's. Before taking up the Guy's job in 1991, she headed the Department of Health implementation unit responsible for introducing the NHS reforms. Before that Caines was deputy head of the 10 Downing Street efficiency unit where she was co-author of proposals leading to the establishment on Next Steps agencies, delivering services at arms-length from government. Gabriel Scally, director of public health in Belfast, has been appointed to a similar position with South East Thames regional health authority, one of the four regions covering London and the home counties.</p>

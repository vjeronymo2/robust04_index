			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEVADA RENO SHOOTERS ON TARGET, USD'S AREN'T; TOREROS LOSE BY 19  </P> <P> Nevada Reno's men's basketball team is not particularly tall. Its lineup ranges  from 6-feet-10 to 6-1.  </P> <P> It runs a full court press at times, but you wouldn't describe the Wolfpack as  quick.  </P> <P> Experience? Three underclassmen on the starting five, one senior on the team,  and its leading scorer, Kevin Franklin (27-point average), is a sophomore.  </P> <P> No. These guys are shooters. From the free-throw line, from three-point range,  from the hip -- they do not miss often.  </P> <P> At least they didn't Thursday night in a 88-69 drubbing of the University of  San Diego.  </P> <P> UNR shot 53% (26 of 49) from the field, including 59% (10 of 17) from  three-point range. It made 77% (26 of 34) from the line, including its first  15.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Toreros missed almost everything. They missed a breakaway dunk  attempt late. They missed five shots on one possession, after which Franklin  took the rebound, dribbled down and pumped in a three-pointer.  </P> <P> In all, USD missed 49 shots for a dismal 32% (23 of 72) from the field,  including 18% (two of 11) from three-point range. Its free-throw shooting  wasn't bad -- 70% (21 of 30) -- but hardly good enough to prevent the loss.  </P> <P> USD fell behind early and never caught up. After a pair of John Jerome free  throws tied the score, 6-6, UNR scored the next 12 points. Franklin had a pair  of three-point plays on USD fouls, Ric Herrin had two baskets, and Jon Baer a  layup.  </P> <P> USD pulled to within 24-16 on baskets by Jerome (two), Kelvin Woods, Wayman  Strickland and Anthony Thomas. But UNR was off again, eventually taking a 47-31  halftime lead.  </P> <P> UNR shot 55% (16 of 29) from the field in the half, including 67% (eight of 12)  from three-point range. UNR did not miss a free throw in seven attempts.  </P> <P> "When you've got a 10-point lead, you can shoot three-pointers with a lot more  ease and confidence," USD Coach Hank Egan said.  </P> <P> Franklin, who led all scorers with 28 points, had 17 by halftime. Matt Williams  added 18, Kevin Soares 14.  </P> <P> Jerome had 10 of his team-high 18 points in the first half. Anthony Thomas had  15, Craig Cottrell 11.  </P> <P> UNR controlled the boards, 19-13, in the first half. But USD, thanks in part to  its many misses, held the second-half advantage, 34-23.  </P> <P> In a game of highlights for UNR, Williams and Soares teamed up for the play of  the game with 14 minutes left. On an out-of-bounds play near the UNR bench,  Soares lofted a pass to Williams, who played off a screen, went backdoor and  made the alley-oop dunk.  </P> <P> The only backdoor USD was thinking about was an escape route out of its Sports  Center, where the Toreros have dropped two games this week to Big Sky teams.  </P> <P> Talk before this eight-game home stand was of "getting well" after a rough  five-game road swing left USD 2-5. The Toreros are now 3-7 and looking for  answers.  </P> <P> UNR, which had not won a road game before Thursday, evened its record at 4-4.  </P></p>

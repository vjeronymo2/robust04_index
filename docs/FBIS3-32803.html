Vargas, a member of the government commission that signed  the  peace accords, reportedly said yesterday there are FMLN groups  that have yet to be demobilized.    "Vargas is misinformed," Ocampo said, adding "he (Vargas)  was  a witness" of the FMLN's total demobilization, which the United  Nations has also affirmed.    He recalled that the FMLN's structure was dismantled in  August 1993 and that FMLN leaders rejected any responsibility  for weapons found in the future.    Ocampo said "everyone is protected by the law" now, and  sanctions will be enforced against those who violate it.    Referring to human rights supervision in El Salvador, he  said  "this is the most supervised country in the world as far as  human rights are concerned," adding there are three operations  underway: a permanent operation by the Onusal Human Rights  Division, an independent observer, and one operation by the  Human Rights Commission, which has its headquarters in Geneva.    He said the human rights situation "has achieved  extraordinary progress." Ocampo made those statements after  signing as a witness the 12th gentlemen's pact signed by  representatives of the political parties that participate in the  electoral process.</p>

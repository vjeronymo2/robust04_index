			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. Karevski: "The Desire for Luxury Led Them </F> Into Crime"]    [Text] Well-informed people in the city claim that  the jailed policemen were known for their easy and attractive  life, and that they intended to invest their rapidly acquired  profits in private business. Among those jailed is one policeman  from Serbia, who coordinated things from the other side of the  border. Were people from Customs also involved in the  smuggling?    Bitola, 10 Feb--The discovery and arrest of a group of  smugglers of luxury automobiles a few days ago in Bitola, and  the scandal that was caused immediately afterward by the still  not officially confirmed but also still undenied reports that  several policemen from the Bitola UVR [Internal Affairs  Administration] (at least one of them with the rank of police  inspector) were also active members of that group, will probably  be a distinction by which the first part of February will be  remembered in this city for quite a long time to come. And if  (in the interests of the investigation) the embargo continues on  any official statements and information for the public, it will  only intensify the latter's curiosity and imagination: It is  precisely that ordinary public that is analyzing by itself in  detail the entire case, seeking an answer to the question of how  and to what extent crime has taken root among people in uniform.    The Bitola public, especially people who say that they are  thoroughly informed about the entire case, is already skeptical  about the question of whether it really will be completely  cleared up, since allegedly this has to do with a network of  organized criminals much broader than the chain that was  "broken" in Bitola, and because after the breaking of the  "Bitola connection" those who "operated" in several other  Macedonian cities are allegedly still in hiding. Furthermore,  "those in the know" claim that a broader circle of policemen  knew about the activity of the "Bitola connection," that they  kept it quiet for the sake of their friends and colleages, but  that in the end they nevertheless informed their superiors in  the UVR, avoiding the risk that their passive attitude might  involve them as accomplices. In any case, trying to be more  precise, the Bitola public is now insisting on the "assertion"  that there are four (already former) police officers from the  local UVR in jail, and that among the jailed foreign citizens  there is likewise one policeman (from the Republic of Serbia),  who coordinated things from the other side of the border, and  came to Macedonia in order to see the results of his involvement.    It is now being said of the jailed Bitola policemen that  they  are fairly young, that they were well known in the city for  being in love with an expensive, easy, and attractive life, and  reasons are being sought here for their going over to the other  side of the law. "Working" then on intensive smuggling,  exclusively of luxury automobiles (those involved were mostly of  the Mercedes, BMW, Golf, and Ford makes, and only one  Renault-5), they apparently succeeded in acquiring considerable  amounts of foreign exchange. Allegedly, as much as 180,000  German marks [DM] was found on one of the people arrested and  was confiscated from him, and they also had a certain number of  unsold cars "in stock." "Those in the know" say that the former  policemen intended to invest their quickly acquired profits in  opening private enterprises, and that the world of private  business was their main vision, and thus, even without the  police action, the Bitola smuggling chain would have collapsed  on its own. That the ex-policemen really did intend to resign  not only from smuggling but also from the police profession,  according to the "information" of the Bitola public, is also  confirmed by the (allegedly) regularly performed procedures for  the registration of private enterprises. The problem arose,  however, when the people simply forget to stop when faced with  the magical rustling of green banknotes.    In any case, spurred by the statements that the  investigation  is constantly encountering new elements, the Bitola public is  now also talking about new arrests and jailings. Solely on the  basis of the "logical assumption" that the entry of the smuggled  automobiles into Macedonia would have been impossible without  the involvement of people from Customs as well, they are  manipulating the "facts" that several people are "losing" their  careers there as well, and the list of accomplices among  ordinary citizens who allegedly also had vital functions in the  criminal chain through their own occupations is expanding  greatly.    In any case, however, the investigation is under way.</p>

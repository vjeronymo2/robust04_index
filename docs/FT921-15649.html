			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Norwegian group sold to Sun Alliance SUN ALLIANCE, the UK's biggest composite insurance company, is strengthening its position in Scandinavia by acquiring Forenede-Gruppen, Norway's fourth biggest life insurer, through a bid from its Danish subsidiary, Codan. Codan's offer of NKr200 per share - valuing Forenede at NKr814m (Pounds 72m)  -has been accepted by the board of Forenede, Sun Alliance said yesterday. The Codan bid is a third higher than that offered by Gjensidige, a rival Norwegian company. Sun Alliance owns 71.45 per cent of Codan, whose shares are quoted on the Copenhagen stock exchange. The deal is the most significant recent expansion by Sun Alliance in Europe, reflecting its strategy of 'seeking to develop in Europe on a highly selective basis', according to Mr Ralph Petty, managing director of the group's overseas operations. The acquisition is the most significant made by Sun Alliance since its purchase of a 75 per cent stake in Swinton Insur-ance which was completed last year. Sun Alliance paid just over Pounds 100m for the Manchester-based broker in three separate deals. Forenede has not yet published accounts for 1991 but in 1990 its life assurance premium income of NKr1.33bn - sold by a network of 500 agents and a number of group schemes - amounted to a market share of about 10 per cent. The company has a larger share of the market for group life and pensions business, and its non-life premium income (NKr758m in 1990) - generated by personal lines business sold in central Norway - is also attractive. Sun Alliance's interest in the Scandinavian life market was signalled by an unsuccessful bid for the Danish state-owned life insurer, Statsanstalten for Livsforsikring, which was privatised in 1990 and the group is optimistic about future growth prospects in the Scandinavian savings market, where state pensions schemes have come under increasing strain in recent years. Sun Alliance said the acquisition had been influenced by Codan's particularly strong financial position - it counted with a solvency margin of between 350 per and 400 per cent at the end of 1990, although the deal could have a marginally adverse impact on the solvency position of the group as a whole by the end of the year.

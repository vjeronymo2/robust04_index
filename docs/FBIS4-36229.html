			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Aden, Yemen, June 7 (AFP) -- Northern Yemeni  troops advanced closer to the south's bastion of Aden in a snap  offensive on Tuesday [7 June] and four people died and more than  40 were wounded in shelling as a ceasefire collapsed,  correspondents reported.    Northern forces loyal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  captured the Sabr village 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of Aden  in a push which took them several kilometres (miles) closer to  the city, an AFP correspondent witnessed at the front line.    Southern Lieutenant Muhammad Husayn accused the Sanaa  authorities of using the ceasefire, announced unilaterally by  Salih's government late Monday, to mass troops and tanks in  preparation for the dawn advance.    There were heavy artillery exchanges as southern forces  tried  to halt the northern tank offensive. [passage omitted]</p>

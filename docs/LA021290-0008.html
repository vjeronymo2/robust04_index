			<p><P> February 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NHL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> FLAMES' SPECIAL TEAMS KEY WIN OVER RANGERS  </P> <P> The Calgary Flames' specialty teams were a little too special for the New York  Rangers.  </P> <P> The Flames' league-leading power play produced three goals in five chances and  their penalty-killers added a short-handed goal as Calgary ended a three-game  losing streak with a 5-2 victory over the New York Rangers on Sunday at New  York.  </P> <P> "The special teams were a big part of the win," Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said.  "We did it both ways. The two power-play goals put us up early, and it's much  easier to play in this building with a lead."  </P> <P> The Flames are tied with Edmonton atop the Smythe Division.  </P> <P> Al MacInnis, Joe Nieuwendyk and Joe Mullen connected on the power play for  Calgary. Theoren Fleury added a shorthanded goal and the Flames stopped New  York on six of seven power plays.  </P> <P> Edmonton 7, Winnipeg 4 -- Petr Klima and Esa Tikkanen each scored twice as the  Oilers overcame a 3-0 deficit and beat the Jets at Edmonton.  </P> <P> Klima scored his goals in a four-goal outburst in the final period, with  Tikkanen and Glenn Anderson also scoring as Edmonton overcame a 4-3 Winnipeg  lead.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Mario Lemieux extended his near-record  point-scoring streak to 46 games with his 44th goal and the Penguins beat the  Flyers for a rare victory at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> The Penguins won for only the eighth time in 70 games at the Spectrum (8-56-6).  </P> <P> St. Louis 4, Buffalo 2 -- Brett Hull scored his 52nd goal and extended his  scoring streak to a team-record 20 games as the Blues downed the Sabres at St.  Louis.  </P> <P> Steve Tuttle, Adam Oates and Dave Lowry also scored for St. Louis, 7-1-2 in the  last 10 games.  </P> <P> Vancouver 4, Boston 2 -- Petri Skriko and Paul Reinhart scored 56 seconds apart  in the second period and the Canucks beat the Bruins for their first victory at  Boston Garden since 1980.  </P> <P> Cam Neeley scored his 40th and 41st goals for Boston.  </P> <P> Washington 5, Minnesota 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli and Dale Hunter each had a goal  and an assist apiece and Steve Leach set up two third-period goals as the  Capitals defeated the North Stars at Landover, Md.  </P></p>

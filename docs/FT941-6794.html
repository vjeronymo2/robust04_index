			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / International Company News: US oil and gas refiner forced to cut output Castle Energy Corporation, the US oil and gas refining company whose sole customer is MG Corp, the US subsidiary of Germany's Metallgesellschaft, is struggling to pay suppliers and has been forced to reduce output as MG tightens its credit arrangements with the company. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Castle said: 'The uncertainties resulting from MG's and its affiliates' possible inability to continue to meet their obligations (to Castle) raise substantial doubt about (Castle's) ability to continue as a going concern.' If MG Corp does not honour its credit and purchase agreements with Castle, the company said, it could force Castle into default on a Dollars 120m long-term credit facility held by the French bank Societe Generale. The MG affair caused the bank to limit Castle's access to the credits, but not before Castle had drawn Dollars 93m on the loan. MG Corp last year not only agreed to purchase all of the output of Castle's two oil refineries at highly beneficial margins, but entered into a web of credit arrangements with Castle that closely tie the two company's fates. Castle has stated it would be unable to repay its loans from operating revenues and its ability to seek additional financing would be hampered if MG defaulted on its purchase contracts. MG's own financing difficulties caused it to constrict the flow of credit to Castle during December and January, hampering payments to suppliers and forcing the company to reduce refinery production. MG arranged Dollars 300m in fresh liquidity from its creditor banks in February, and some of that money is expected to flow to Castle. The refiner's financial situation could worsen next month, when it must begin to make deliveries on a 12-month Dollars 125m forward sale of crude oil it made in September to an unspecified third party.</p>

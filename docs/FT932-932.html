			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report NICKEL crashed to seven-month lows on the LME as speculative liquidation and investment fund sales were triggered below Dollars 5,540 a tonne for three-month metal. Expectations that stocks will rise again soon also weighed on the market. Three-month metal closed at Dollars 5,420 a tonne, down Dollars 162.50. Three-month ALUMINIUM broke higher, extending a technical move above Dollars 1,200 a tonne, and ending near new 3 1/2 -month highs. Dealers said the market continued to benefit from a constructive chart picture, but the rise was in danger of becoming top-heavy, and resistance was likely around current levels. On the fundamental side no fresh factors emerged, although there was persistent talk of some approaching development, such as a smelter closure. COPPER trading was largely routine, with the market settled comfortably into a range and paying little heed to talk of sizeable stock movements. The current TIN downtrend shows little sign of abating. Three-month metal fell to a new 20-year low of Dollars 5,005 a tonne, and the Dollars 5,000 level now looks vulnerable. London COCOA suffered a moderate downward correction following the recent climb to a three-month peak. Compiled from Reuters</p>

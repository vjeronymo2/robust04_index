			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Arts: More than Messiahs OPERATIC fare in London this festive season promises to be unusually rich, various and interestingly contrasted. This has less to do with what is on offer at the two opera houses, more with the crop of rewarding operas-in-concert that are planned to spring up in December. The biggest venture is that of the London Symphony Orchestra in its Barbican Hall home: a long-awaited concert mounting of Berlioz's magnificent epic, Les Troyens (its two parts done thrice on consecutive days - December 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 8 and 9 - and then on the afternoon and evening of December 12). Colin Davis, mighty London champion of this work for three-and-a-half decades, leads a fascinating international cast headed by Vladimir Bogachov (Aeneas), Luciana D'Intino (Dido) and Jane Henschel (Cassandra). Even rarer is the single-evening (December 6) concert performance of Tchaikovsky's late, lovely one-acter, Iolanta, at the Albert Hall. This launches a proposed long-term collaboration between the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Kirov Opera, here represented by the St Petersburg chief conductor Valery Gergiev and a team of leading Kirov singers, including soprano Galina Gorchakova, tenor Gegam Grigorian, baritone Sergey Leiferkus. At the Queen Elizabeth Hall on December 8 and 11 there is Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppaea in concert, with John Eliot Gardiner leading his trusty 'period' performing cohorts and a superb cast - Sylvia McNair, Anne Sofie von Otter, Michael Chance, Bernarda Fink, Kenneth Cox. This is the most important but not the only QEH novelty: also on its December schedule are the single visit (December 18) of Music Theatre Wales with its new staging of Philip Glass's Poe opera, The Fall of the House of Usher, and, after Christmas, the short (27-31) run of Music Theatre London's Cos fan tutte, latest of the company's irreverently witty Mozart updatings. In the 'legit' London opera houses, the art-form would appear to be wearing a livelier festive-season aspect at the Coliseum than at Covent Garden, where the play-safe repertory is made up of the new Magic Flute and the very old (1964) Tosca, with Anna Tomowa-Sintow latest in the long line of heroines stepping into the Empire dress originally created for Callas. English National Opera's choice offering (from December 20), sure to provide bliss for lovers of Czech opera and unexpected delight for others, is a new production of Smetana's buoyantly tuneful romantic comedy The Two Widows; David Pountney directs, Adam Fischer conducts, Marie McLaughlin, Anne-Marie Owens and Arthur Davies take principal roles. For the rest, the ENO runs in repertory its new Lohengrin and recent Figaro revival, plus the return (from December 3) of Richard Jones's 1991 production of Die Fledermaus, a technologically elaborate piece of modernist fantasy, occasionally mildly diverting. Outside London the biggest attractions are provided by Welsh National Opera, which tours its new Massenet Cendrillon and superb Falstaff in Oxford, Bristol and then back to Cardiff; and Opera North, which in Leeds on December 18 unveils another of the year's most eagerly-awaited events: the company's first-ever staging (by Phyllida Lloyd) of Britten's Gloriana, with the great Josephine Barstow as Elizabeth I. Other than what is already noted above, the London concert scene contains its familiar more-than-fair share of carol concerts, Messiah outings and Grand Opera Galas. But worth keeping in mind are the exceptions to that rule: the single London concert (Festival Hall, December 4) by the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Seiji Ozawa, at the start of its latest European tour and billing an imaginative all-Berlioz programme; the last instalment (December 3) of the Barbican's current tribute to Olivier Messiaen; attractive Wigmore Hall recitals by the sopranos Elizabeth Connell (December 8) and Sumi Jo (December 14); and the annual occupation of St John's, Smith Square by the now-inappropriately-named choral group The Sixteen for a bunch of pre-Christmas concerts.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Business and the Environment: Utilities unite in E7 club The chairmen of eight of the world's largest electric utilities meet in Tokyo tomorrow to establish a co-operative framework for promoting 'sustainable development' on a global scale. They have formed a club - called E7 after the G7 group of large industrialised countries - to support joint action. Its aims range from informal discussions about energy policy to practical consultancy work in developing countries and the former Soviet Union. Early proposals include the promotion of solar power in Indonesia and Malaysia, pollution control in India, clean coal technology in China and hydroelectric development in Georgia. A small E7 secretariat in Montreal, Canada, co-ordinates the projects. The eight utilities include two from Canada and Japan and one each from Italy, France, Germany and the US. Two of the club's leading figures are Gilles Menage, chairman of Electricite de France, and Maurice Strong, chairman of Ontario Hydro. The UK is the only G7 country not represented. After the privatisation and restructuring of the electricity industry, there is no British company which satisfies the E7 rule that members should be integrated utilities both generating electricity and selling it to consumers. There is likely to be a debate in Tokyo about whether to expand E7. 'It seems too bad that we cannot have a British member when the UK has led the way in restructuring its power sector,' said one participant. But the priority will be to convince funding agencies such as the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development that the club is not a vehicle to promote its members' business interests. They will give their experts' services free of charge to E7 consultancy projects.</p>

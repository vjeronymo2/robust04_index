			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: A QUIET PLACE ON THE TRAIL  </P> <P> Picture this: I am strolling up a quiet trail in the Santa Monica Mountains,  whistling a charming ethnic tune my mother taught me and listening to the  twitter of rufous-sided towhees.  </P> <P> From far off I hear a faint whirring sound and cup one hand to my ear, like a  maiden in a fairy tale harking to the buzz of an insect in the chaparral;  perhaps a cricket rubbing its thighs together to summon a love of its own.  </P> <P> Then I hear the shout, "Go, dude, man rip 'er out," and I realize this is no  love-smitten cricket. I leap to the side of the trail, barely escaping three  teen-agers from hell coming at 40 m.p.h. on fat-wheeled bicycles.  </P> <P> It's happened.  </P> <P> The birds and I have had to scatter for our lives to escape the dimwits howling  down on us like banshees, leaving shattered serenity and an enraged, otherwise  peaceful stroller in their wake.  </P> <P> The incident, one of many, occurred on a fire trail in Topanga State Park,  where I often spend my leisure. As a result of these encounters, my attitude  toward mountain bikes is not what you would call forbearing, unless you  perceive forbearance in the attitude of the Israelis toward the Palestinians.  </P> <P> I therefore view with alarm the possibility that these kamikaze cyclists will  soon be allowed not only on fire trails but on hiking trails as well. Heaven  help the rest of us.  </P> <P> Even as I write, a policy regarding bikes in the Santa Monica Mountains is  under review by the California Department of Parks and Recreation. Should they  or should they not be allowed on hiking trails whereupon stroll decent,  God-fearing, flag-loving people like you and me?  </P> <P> The Park Department's Dan Preece, who oversees the Santa Monica Mountains  District, has made his recommendations to Sacramento but won't tell me what  they are. I'm hoping for the best but preparing for the worst.  </P> <P> That is not to say I believe everyone on a mountain bike is thoughtless and  demented. Many of them no doubt read and write, have learned to tie their own  shoelaces and are kind to puppies.  </P> <P> But the others have little regard for bones or speed limits, and set out each  weekend to break them with impunity on the fire trails of the mountain parks.  To allow them on hiking trails would be to put rattlesnakes in a baby's crib.  </P> <P> The Sierra Club feels the way I do, only more so. It would allow only coyotes  and barefoot children in the park and views with horror the possibility of  wheeled vehicles on the trails, including bicycles. The jury is still out on  baby carriages and wheelchairs.  </P> <P> One big problem, says Sierra Clubber Dave Brown, is that you can't hear the  bicycles coming, except for the insect-like whirring sound. Brown is chairman  of the club's Santa Monica Mountains Task Force.  </P> <P> "The silence, speed and growing numbers of them make them incompatible with the  natural outdoor experience," he said. "They will take over easy hiking trails  used by senior citizens and bird watchers. Old ladies will be in danger of  being clobbered."  </P> <P> Senior citizens and bird watchers cartwheeling down a mountainside, while  amusing, would certainly not add to anyone's enjoyment of the parks.  </P> <P> I put all this to Peter Heumann, who is on the steering committee of the  Concerned Off Road Bicycle Assn.  </P> <P> Peter is one of the good guys. He is not, as he puts it, a 15-year-old trying  to take your elbow off on a downhill run.  </P> <P> If Peter on his bicycle and me on my feet happened to meet unexpectedly on a  precipitous trail, I know Peter would ride off into space rather than  jeopardize my safety.  </P> <P> Peter, in short, is a saint.  </P> <P> "Sure there are irresponsible cyclists," St. Peter said, "just as there are  irresponsible hikers and irresponsible equestrians, but the Sierra Club doesn't  own the mountains. We pay taxes and have a right to enjoy them too."  </P> <P> If bicyclists don't belong on the trails, he adds, then equestrians don't  belong on the trails either.  </P> <P> "Your right to peace," St. Peter declared, "should also include not stepping in  horse manure."  </P> <P> The trouble with talking to reasonable people on both sides is that you end up  like a feather in the breeze, floating somewhere between them.  </P> <P> But I still don't think even St. Peter is going to be able to control kamikaze  bicyclists on mountain trails, and they don't belong there until someone can.  </P> <P> I want to go back to listening to the Rufous-sided Towhees and the love call of  crickets without fear of being skewered on somebody's handlebars.  </P></p>

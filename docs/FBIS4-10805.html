			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elvia Moreno de la Vega] </F>   [Text] Foreign Relations Secretary Manuel Tello Macias said  in a brief interview at Mexico City's international airport upon  returning from Paris that Mexico's admittance to the OECD is not  a cure-all but a recognition of Mexico's democratic and economic  pluralism. He said the act signifies acceptance of Mexico's  respect for human rights and the opening of various markets.  Manuel Tello also assured that Mexico will continue developing  in order to meet the needs of the Mexican people, who still lack  the most basic necessities.    [Begin Tello recording] It is recognition of our policies to  establish a market economy; it is recognition of the democratic  pluralism in Mexico; it is recognition of Mexico's respect for  human rights. Those are the three conditions for entry into the  organization, and we have met them. [end recording]    Tello also emphasized that Mexico's admittance to the OECD  was by consensus and in recognition of President Salinas de  Gortari's economic policies.    The foreign relations secretary added that he did not  believe  that the Chiapas events would affect Mexico's image abroad.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALBANIA;  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS ALLOW NEW POLITICAL PARTIES  </P> <P> The ruling Communist Party in Albania decided to allow the formation of  political parties, the state news agency ATA said.  </P> <P> The surprise decision to liberalize politics in the Balkan nation was made  during a meeting of the party's policy-setting Central Committee. Albania would  be the last country in Europe to introduce a multi-party system. The Central  Committee meeting was held following student unrest that started over the  weekend. ATA said the Central Committee also fired five full members and one  candidate member of the Politburo. Some observers said the reshuffle and the  call for independent parties was a defeat for hard-liners.  </P></p>

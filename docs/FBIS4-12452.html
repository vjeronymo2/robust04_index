			<p>BFN     [Text] The outskirts of the towns of Kafra and Yatar have  been coming under shelling since 1530 today from the occupation  center in Jabal Humayyid. A center belonging to the Nepalese  contingent in Yatar was hit by machine-gun fire coming from the  Lahd agents' post in the occupied strip opposite the town. The  Martyr Husayn Nasir Mahdi group of the Islamic Resistance laid  an ambush for a Lahdist security convoy on the Bayt Lif road.  The strugglers showered the convoy's cars with a hail of fire  from machine guns and artillery. Several artillery shells hit  the car transporting the security officials.

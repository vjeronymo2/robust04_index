			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 27 (YONHAP) -- The main opposition  Democratic Party (DP) held a lawmakers' meeting at the National  Assembly Friday and elected Rep. Sin Ki-ha as their floor leader  for the next two years.    Sin, 53, a third-term representative from Kwangju, defeated  the incumbent floor leader, Rep. Kim Tae-sik, by receiving 49  votes to Kim's 46 with 96 DP lawmakers taking part in the vote.  One vote was taken as an abstention.    Sin's election came as a surprise to many as he represents  the non-mainstream faction while the incumbent had been endorsed  by Chairman Yi Ki-taek, Rep. Kim Won-ki, a leading member of the  Supreme Council, and followers of former Chairman Kim Tae-chung.    The party will now have to live under an awkward arrangement  in which the mainstream leadership must carry out parliamentary  business through a whip from a non-mainstream faction.    As a result of Friday's election, discord between the two  large factions in the opposition party is expected to deepen.    Analysts said Sin apparently managed to demonstrate  unexpected strength because the competition was waged more on  personality than on factional considerations.    Many DP lawmakers were obviously wary of re-electing the  already- powerful Kim Tae-sik to another two-year term, they  said.    Sin is currently a member of the policy-making Supreme  Council and chairman of the DP's Kwangju city chapter.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SULLIVAN PRAISES TROUBLED LEARNFARE  </P> <P> The nation's top welfare official on Friday commended a Wisconsin experiment  tying welfare benefits to school attendance but cautioned officials to resolve  the program's administrative problems.  </P> <P> Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said his office would  continue to monitor the Learnfare program for improvement but had already found  the program's goals "quite laudable."  </P> <P> Learnfare, started in 1987, trims Aid to Families With Dependent Children  benefits to families whose teen-agers skip school. It has been touted as an  incentive for teen-agers to continue their education and chances of employment,  but has been harshly criticized by welfare advocates.  </P> <P> The program was ordered suspended in Milwaukee schools this week by U.S.  District Judge Terence Evans, who cited poor record-keeping that resulted in  some families being wrongly penalized.  </P> <P> Evans' injunction applies only to the 3,200 teen-agers attending Milwaukee  public schools who have lost or are in danger of losing welfare benefits under  Learnfare. The program continues in other parts of the state.  </P> <P> Sullivan, who was in Marshfield to dedicate a new $6.1-million research center  at Marshfield Clinic, said he was not concerned by the judge's action.  </P> <P> "Obviously, with any program that is new, there are always a number of glitches  or problems that might need to be addressed," he said.  </P></p>

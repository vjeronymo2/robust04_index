			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Arts: Bruce Springsteen - Rock The Boss is back. No, not Margaret Thatcher - I can't imagine her in a black vest doing the business in the Milton Keynes Bowl - but Bruce Springsteen, dropping into middle England for his only visit this year. You know where you are with Springsteen. He may be one of the dinosaurs of pop, with his man-of-the-people, belt-and-braces, rock and roll, but there has to be one big star who sings for the guy on the petrol pump, the girl at the supermarket check-out. And although a 44-year-old millionaire might not be the obvious candidate, Springsteen gives his all. He looks so much the part, the muscular trucker who would stop to help a buddie with a blow-out, although his designer stubble has been cultivated into an Errol Flynnish beard and moustache. The raspy voice is now almost a croak, but at the perfect moment he cracks the mirror between the star and his fans, darting across the stage like a young 'un, dangling over the ravine to press flesh, and flopping into the throng before being restrained by two hefties. He blows his harp, he belts his guitar, he leers into the mike, and sweats for us. He injects total passion into his songs of urban alienation, of the American dream unstuck, of innocence betrayed by the system. He is the American rebel whom time has converted into the American hero, even for the Establishment. And he seems to enjoy it all so much. There is the odd sign of ageing. The subdued acoustic introduction where he seemed to parody Bob Dylan; the songs that dwell on the lack of choice on television as much as unemployment; the rather disappointing announcement that his message for the people of Britain is 'everybody needs somebody to love'; the need for an interval after only 70 minutes. He also tried to inject some unconvincing gospel into his act with 'Satan's Jewelled Crown': sentiment is not his strength. As twilight darkens, the man pulls out his heavy guns, those dramatic soaring rock ballads that may not be immediately distinguishable but which represent one of the most compelling riffs in contemporary music. You really believe 'The night is made for lovers' while 'The River' seems like the short story that sums up America. It may be an illusion: it is getting rather cold, and your neighbours in the throng are crashing down like drunken ninepins. But that is a great Springsteen attraction. He makes mundane reality heroic while really it is sitting for hours in a Milton Keynes car park waiting for the world to go home.</p>

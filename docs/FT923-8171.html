			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Personal computer market 'stagnant' THE UK market for personal computers is stagnant and plummeting prices appear to have done little to stimulate sales, according to a survey by Context, a London-based consultancy. The volume of indirect sales - sales through dealers or high street shops - increased in the 12 months to June by only 0.5 per cent over the same period last year, the survey says. In earlier years, sales have grown by more than 20 per cent annually. The total number of machines sold in the period was just under 800,000. Indirect sales account for some 75 per cent of all UK sales of personal computers. Fierce price cutting has had a powerful effect on revenues. In the same period, the total value of sales fell 16 per cent to Pounds 1.5bn. Mr Jeremy Davies, senior partner at Context, said buyers were confused over technology and prepared to delay purchases to see if prices fell further. 'PC sales have stalled and it is not only the effect of the recession,' he said. 'At the beginning of the year, buyers were saying 'Why should I buy now? If I wait six months, I can get more PC for less money.' Six months later, the same thing is happening again.' Context's figures do not take into account machines sold directly - by mail order, for example - but Mr Davies said he estimated the whole market had grown at most by only a few per cent over the year. Manufacturers have been cutting prices heavily - last year prices fell on average 40 per cent. Components have become cheaper and competition has intensified. IBM and Compaq, the market leaders, have both introduced new, inexpensive computer lines to compete with Asian manufacturers. Dealers believe prices may fall a further 20 per cent this year, adversely affecting gross profit margins for manufacturers and distributors and further confusing potential customers. Context's figures show that IBM (21.2 per cent), Compaq (19.7 per cent) and Apple (12.2 per cent) have consolidated their positions and now account for more than 50 per cent of sales through the indirect channel in the UK. The fastest-growing market sector is notebook personal computers, which account for 17 per cent of sales, compared with 13 per cent a year ago.</p>

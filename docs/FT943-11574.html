			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Cheers The UK beer industry, struggling to stem the flow of duty-free continental European imports, should raise a glass to John Major's choice of David Heathcoat-Amory as paymaster general. The former foreign office minister's uncle Derick was, after all, one of the very few British chancellors - Sir Stafford Cripps being another - to have cut tax on beer excises. In April 1959, he lifted a whole tuppence off per pint. Good to hear one minister has duty-cutting in the genes.</p>

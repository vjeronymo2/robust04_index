			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Japan cautious on surplus cut JAPAN's current account surplus is unlikely to be reduced in the next two years despite last week's agreement with the US that there should be a significant cut, a senior Japanese government official warned yesterday. Mr Sozaburo Okamatsu, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's vice-minister for international affairs, said the surplus would probably only start to fall in three years' time and the pace of change would depend on the state of the world economy as much as the strength of Japanese domestic demand. He confirmed the Japanese government was discussing policies which would allow it to meet its commitment to pursue strong and sustainable domestic demand. Miti officials believe it could take up to five years for the surplus to be significantly reduced, as the agreement demands. Mr Okamatsu, the senior Miti official involved in negotiating a trade talks framework with the US, said the agreement did not sanction the use of numerical targets to open up Japanese markets to imports. The 'objective criteria' referred to in the framework to measure progress in opening markets would only be used to assess past progress and not set goals. 'We only agreed to use data from the past, not data which could be used as a target for the future,' he said. The use of numerical targets to guide Japanese policy had been the most contentious issue in talks over the framework, which culminated in an agreement last Saturday. The US had been pressing Japan to accept the goal of halving the current account surplus - expected to be about Dollars 150bn (Pounds 100bn) this year - to 1-2 per cent of gross national product. Instead, the agreement commits Tokyo to 'achieve a highly significant reduction in the surplus over the medium term'. Mr Okamatsu defined the medium term as about five years.</p>

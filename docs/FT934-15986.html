			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: J Bibby plans Pounds 75m float-off J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the heavily-indebted conglomerate which is 79 per cent owned by Barlow Rand of South Africa, plans to raise about Pounds 75m next year by floating off its paper, agricultural and science businesses. The move is designed to reduce Bibby's debt, incurred largely as a result of the hostile Pounds 82m takeover in July 1992 of Finanzauto, Spain's only Caterpillar distributor. Since the takeover, the Spanish construction market has declined more sharply than Bibby had expected. Mr Richard Mansell-Jones, Bibby chairman and a board director of Barlow Rand, said the construction market in 1993 was just 25 per cent the size it was in 1991. 'It has hit the wall', he said. The sharp decline has forced Bibby to incur higher than estimated costs to restructure the lossmaking dealer. Bibby reported net debt of Pounds 155m at the interim stage. Borrowings are expected to be somewhat lower when the group reports in November. Bibby is aiming to float the three divisions as one company in February under the Bibby name through an offer for sale. The newly-listed group is expected to be floated with some debt. It will take some directors from the original company, but is likely to have an independent non-executive chairman. This division accounted for 48 per cent of Bibby's total of Pounds 416m sales and about 52 per cent of Pounds 15m operating profits in the 26 weeks to March 27. The original company, containing the Spanish and Portuguese Caterpillar operation and the Hyster materials business, will be renamed Stratford. Barlow will retain 79 per cent of Stratford and 20 per cent of the new Bibby.</p>

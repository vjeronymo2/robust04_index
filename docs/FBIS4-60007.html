			<p>BFN     [Text] Mecca, May 18, IRNA -- Iran's embassy in Riyadh in a  strongly-worded letter to the Saudi Foreign Ministry Wednesday  [18 May] condemned the continued siege of the Iranian pilgrims  headquarters in Mecca by Saudi troops. The letter said the  crackdown on the movement of Iranian pilgrims to and from the  camp has seriously hampered the pilgrimage of Iranian Muslims.    Saudi commandos have been stationed in front of the  headquarters barring people from entering or leaving the  building. Since this morning, Saudi military helicopters have  started flying at low altitude over the headquarters and filming  all movements around it.    The deployment of scores of armored personnel carriers,  water  cannons and a large number of armed-to-the-teeth commandos  around the camp indicates that Saudi Arabia has purchased large  amounts of riot equipment for fear of outbreak of domestic  unrest and rebellion.    According to an Egyptian pilgrim, who is a member of the  armed forces of that country, Saudi Arabia has been deeply  worried about possible domestic unrest in recent years  particularly since the deployment of American forces in holy  Islamic lands during the Persian Gulf war which prompted public  outcry.    Due to such concern, he said, Saudi leaders have spent  billions of dollars on purchase of anti-riot equipment and  training some of its military units in suppressing domestic  riots.</p>

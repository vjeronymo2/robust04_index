			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / International Company News: Trygg US arm to raise Dollars 355m TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the Swedish insurance group, said its US associate Home Holdings plans to raise Dollars 335m through an initial public offering and seek a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The group made the announcement as it unveiled a doubling of operating profits for the first eight months of the year to SKr975m (Dollars 121.1m) from SKr437m. The 1992 figure excludes the impact of SKr6bn in losses related to investments in Gota AB and two credit insurance operations. The IPO will be in the autumn with the main aim of reducing Home's leverage. Home is the 34th largest insurer in the US, specialising in areas such as lawyers' professional liability insurance. Trygg said Home's reserves would be strengthened by Dollars 290m to meet the rigorous requirements imposed on listed US insurers. The cost will be met partly by realised capital gains of Dollars 140m and partly by shareholders. Trygg said its share of the reserve strengthening would wipe SKr450m off its result. After the IPO, the Trygg-Hansa SPP group's total ownership of Home will fall to 47 per cent from 64 per cent, although it will have an option to purchase a further 5-10 per cent. Mr Bjorn Sprangare, Trygg's chief executive, said Home remained an important strategic investment. Profits from Trygg's property and casualty business climbed 53 per cent to SKr510m in the period. The market value of investments rose 19 per cent to SKr21.1bn while solvency margin - the ratio of shareholders' funds to premiums - rose to 150 per cent from 134 per cent.</p>

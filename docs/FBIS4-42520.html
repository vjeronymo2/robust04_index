			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "a.u.": "Fasslabend: Ukraine Important for </F> Stability"]    [Text] Vienna -- "The independence of Ukraine is one of the  most important factors of stability in Europe." This assessment  was reached by Defense Minister Fasslabend after a visit to the  large successor state of the Soviet Union. However, the  minister came to some conclusions which contradict many other  critical reports about the country: In his view, the city of  Kiev or the large Antonov works (aircraft) work better than  other East European states. [sentence as published]    "What does not work is the reorientation of the economy. In  that regard there are big problems." Fasslabend also noted that  Ukraine is still defining itself very much in its old context,  that of the Soviet Union. "The country's identity must be  strengthened." In the establishment of the new Ukrainian Armed  Forces, there is great emphasis on external symbols -- new  uniforms, new defense districts.    Bilaterally, the minister wants to cooperate more with Kiev.  The first step is sending a military attache to Kiev.    Particularly important for the new state is the current  Crimean crisis with Russia. "This is an emotional issue. It is  so important that Ukraine will do anything to prevent the Crimea  from seceding."</p>

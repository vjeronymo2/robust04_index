			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / Japan plans Pounds 85bn economic package to boost growth The Japanese government this week plans to follow its agreement on political reform with a long-delayed package of tax cuts and government spending, estimated to total at least Y14,000bn (Pounds 85bn). Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, said at the weekend he aimed to announce details by the end of the week. His seven-party coalition government would seek co-operation on economic policy with the opposition Liberal Democratic party. The package will come as a relief to the US and to Japanese business organisations, which have been urging the government to take steps to relieve the worst recession since the second world war. Until the weekend, the coalition's ability to act on the economy was paralysed by its attempts to win parliamentary agreement on plans to redesign the electoral system and curb political corruption. Failure to reach a deal by the end of the parliamentary session at midnight on Saturday could have led to the government's collapse. However, parliament voted in favour of a last-minute compromise worked out between Mr Hosokawa and Mr Yohei Kono, president of the LDP. The newly confident coalition plans to hold elections under the redesigned electoral system 'anytime from this autumn', said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. Ministers responsible for the economy started work on the package at the weekend. Early drafts envisage Y6,000bn to Y7,000bn in income and residential tax cuts, plus Y4,000bn of government spending on infrastructure, according to government officials quoted in the Japanese press. The package is also said to include increased loans for housing and small businesses, plus possible tax concessions for corporate land sales. The government will draw up its budget for the coming fiscal year by February 15, nearly two months late, said Mrs Manae Kubota, director of the Economic Planning Agency. It may also expand an existing five-year programme of public works, worth Y430,000bn, officials were quoted in the press as saying. This week's package would be the fourth and possibly largest pump-priming plan in 14 months. The previous three, worth a total of just over Y30,000bn, have so far failed to rekindle growth. The package means Mr Hosokawa will have evidence of attempts to stimulate domestic demand when he meets US president Bill Clinton in Washington on February 11. US-Japanese trade relations have been strained by failure to agree on US demands that Tokyo accept numerical targets for reducing its trade surplus. The Japanese government knows Mr Clinton is under pressure to use sanctions if talks break down. Pact drives coalition into LDP's arms, Page 4</p>

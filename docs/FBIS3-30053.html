Prime  Minister Hosokawa has remained tight-lipped after repeatedly  denying the reported meeting with Watanabe, former deputy prime  minister and foreign minister, who is affiliated with the  opposition Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. Their reported  meeting is spawning speculation that the prime minister has met  with Watanabe with the aim of keeping Chief Cabinet Secretary  Takemura and other ruling coalition parties members who are  distancing themselves from him in check and driving a wedge in  the LDP, which has yet to shape a vision for retaking power.  One ruling party after another are reacting negatively to the  reported meeting between the prime minister and Watanabe. Some  members of the ruling coalition parties are raising doubts about  the motive behind the meeting, but the truth remains a mystery.    On the morning of 24 February, Takemura phoned Ryutaro  Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP Policy Research Council, to ask  the latter, "Has Watanabe really met with Hosokawa?" On 23  February, Takemura appeared to have information that "Messers  Watanabe and Hosokawa are likely to meet." Unable to confirm  the reported meeting from the prime minister because of their  chilled relationship, Takemura ran around all morning. In the  afternoon, Takemura met with the prime minister to discuss the  issue of reshuffling the cabinet, but the prime minister told  Takemura, "I have not met with Watanabe."    Of course, the prime minister is not at ease. His reported  meeting with Watanabe has been seen as an attempt to thrust the  "Watanabe card," as his new partner, at Takemura who has been  boasting of his close ties with the LDP and revealing his  resolve to quit the cabinet in a reshuffle. A senior Sakigake  [Harbinger] member, who has been struggling to patch up the  Hosokawa-Takemura relationship, is reacting against the reported  meeting, saying: "If Watanabe joins the Hosokawa cabinet, our  party would back out of the coalition. With Watanabe in the  Hosokawa cabinet, the cabinet could not take any steps for  changes."    Political forces exploring the possibility of forging an  alliance with Mr.Takemura, social democrats, and liberals, are  reacting against the reported meeting with anger, saying, "It is  very disgraceful," (according to a senior member of the ruling  Social Democratic Party of Japan).    Tomiichi Murayama, Social Democratic Party of Japan  chairman,  Keigo Ouchi, Democratic Socialist Party chairman, and Nakamur,  Democratic Reform Federation representative, met with the prime  minister on the evening of 24 February to urge the latter to be  cautious about reshuffling his cabinet. In this way, they  checked the prime minister from contacting LDP people like Mr.  Watanabe.    The reported meeting is sending a complex ripple to  Shinseito  [Japan Renewal Party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] that  make up the coalition government. Mr. Watanabe is said to share  the political belief of Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro  Ozawa, and it is said that they maintain a behind-the-scenes  relationship. A politician close to Mr. Ozawa has emphatically  denied Mr. Ozawa's role in the reported meeting, saying, "Mr.  Ozawa was not aware of the reported meeting." While the  "Watanabe card" has the effect of keeping Sakigake in check and  putting the LDP, which has lost its centripetal force, into  turmoil, it will complicate the structure of the coalition  partners, which are now moving toward a bipolar party structure.  It can be said that it is not a good policy for the prime  minister to play the "Watanabe card" openly now.    Amid moves toward a realignment of the political parties,  Komeito, which has been vying with Watanabe for support from  Shinseito, has accused Watanabe, saying: "The ruling coalition  parties have been attacked so much by him. They cannot forge an  alliance with him simply because he agrees with their plans for  resolving the tax system issue and other issues" and raised  questions about the prime minister's real intentions.</p>

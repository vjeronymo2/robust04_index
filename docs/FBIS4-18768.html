			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Johann Georg Reissmueller commentary: "Spheres of </F> Influence in Southeastern Europe"]    [Text] Russia has certainly achieved one thing in  southeastern Europe without intending to do so: The United  States, which was first pleased but then alarmed about Russian  activities in the former Yugoslavia, for the first time since  1991 when the war started, is now behaving like a power that  wants to restore order in the region and does not want to leave  the field to itself or another power.    The goals that the U.S. Administration has set for itself  are  slowly emerging. Above all, the longer a war lasts, the more it  attracts more foreign forces -- Russians and possibly a growing  number of Islamic radicals from Asia and Africa -- but this  should dry out quickly. The order after the war should ensure  that the major part of the eastern Adriatic coast remains in  reliable hands, and that Russian influence remain as small as  possible in the western Balkans. The United States wants to be  able to rely on the states in the region that share the same  vital interests.    The United States is confronted with other powers in the  region -- above all, the Serbs who have captured territory in  Croatia and Bosnia. Serbia is the state with the greatest  concentration of weapons in Europe west of Russia. Still, this  is not a factor that might disturb U.S. circles in the long run.  However, because the United States and its Western allies are  determined not to use military force against the Serbs, Serbia  is the one power in southeastern Europe that the United States  is treating very cautiously and with great consideration. A  soft Western -- and U.S. -- attitude, even encouragement, has  made President Milosevic important in Belgrade.    Serbia is being endorsed by Russia, which found a supporter  in Belgrade after its return to world politics. An old affinity  strengthens relations, which is in line with the political  pan-Slavism that is again spreading in Moscow. Russia has been  striving for predominance in the Balkans since the last century.  First, the Turkish, then the Hapsburg empires were in its way,  then it removed itself with the introduction of Bolshevism.  After his World War II victory, only Tito, who wanted to be a  Stalin himself, prevented the Moscow empire from taking  possession of the whole Balkans. For the first time after the  changes in Europe in 1990, there is a renewed opportunity for  Russia to gain a political foothold in southeastern Europe. The  Russian objective is diametrically opposed to that of the United  States: Moscow wants to establish a sphere of influence that  extends as far as possible from Serbia to the west and north, as  far as the Adriatic Sea, and toward Central Europe.    In the former Yugoslavia, West European powers have  relinquished the field to the two major world powers. If their  influence increases again, Great Britain and France in  particular will not only pursue common Western but also their  own interests -- which might collide with U.S. interests. This,  and not only the Russians, may be one reason for Washington's  hurry.    The United States would prefer a Bosnian state within its  old  boundaries. Yet Washington knows of Belgrade's plans for a  greater Serbia, which are being encouraged by Russia. There are  also doubts that the Serbs in Bosnia will form a common state  together with the Bosnian Muslims and Croats. Some things --  including Washington's lack of interest in the Serbian  offensives in eastern and northern Bosnia -- suggest that the  United States has accepted Bosnia's partition. Then the United  States would be left only with the task of ensuring a  sufficiently large and coherent territory for the  Muslim-Croatian canton state proclaimed, under its leadership,  after negotiations with the Serbs and Russia.    The United States would certainly welcome a return of the  Croatian territories occupied by the Serbs. Yet what efforts  will it attempt to ensure that Serbia gives up the most valuable  result, strategically and economically, of its war of conquest?  The "normalization" being negotiated between the Zagreb  government and the Serbian leaders in the occupied territories  might finally consist of Croatia being granted sovereignty over  these territories that exists only on paper, and in Croatia  having to content itself with the reopening of the traffic  routes. Then the Serbian war of aggression would have been  worthwhile in Croatia -- just as in Bosnia.    The United States would then be the protector of a reduced  Bosnia and an amputated Croatia. However, it also appears to  view Macedonia and Albania as countries belonging to its sphere  of influence. Yet there are obstacles and uncertainties. The  Greek ethnic lobby group in the United States prevents the  administration from efficiently supporting Macedonia against the  Greek blockade. Albania is anxiously looking at neighboring  Kosovo. If Serbian authorities increase the mistreatment of the  Albanian population there, there might be a mass exodus to  Albania one day.    How would the protector, the United States, react? As early  as today, Washington may be considering a partition of Kosovo,  with the "ethnically cleansed" portion remaining part of Serbia.  The other half with the double Albanian population would fall  to Albania. Yet such a cut would leave behind deep wounds. The  United States would have to guard another trouble spot.</p>

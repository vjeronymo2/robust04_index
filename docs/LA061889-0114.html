			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> REP. UDALL, BATTLING PARKINSON'S DISEASE, FENDS OFF CALLS FOR RETIREMENT  </P> <P> In the House Interior Committee hearing room hangs a portrait of Chairman  Morris K. Udall (D-Ariz.), standing tall with his coat slung over his shoulder.  The longtime lawmaker, former presidential candidate and well-known humorist  appears eager for a challenge.  </P> <P> But the man occupying the chairman's seat across the room no longer mirrors his  portrait. He sits stooped in his chair, his hands quivering and his voice  barely audible.  </P> <P> Although physically ravaged by Parkinson's disease, Udall, 67, fends off calls  for his retirement and still gets his message through clearly.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Replacement Not in Sight  </P> <P> "My replacement hasn't been born yet," Udall recently told Rep. Ben Nighthorse  Campbell (D-Colo.), who had the temerity to ask his fellow Democrat whether he  had been grooming anyone to take over the House seat he's held since 1960.  </P> <P> "He's as tough as in the portrait," said Rep. John J. Rhodes III (R-Ariz.),  whose district neighbors Udall's.  </P> <P> "His mind is still very sharp," said Rep. Don Young of Alaska, the committee's  ranking Republican. "We've been fighting for 14 or 15 years. I've beat him two  or three times, but it's very difficult."  </P> <P> Udall, who once played a year of pro basketball despite having a glass eye and  unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination in 1976, has taken  the disease as a challenge and, his staff says, is fighting it with a sense of  humor.  </P> <P> There has never been any doubt about that sense of humor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Makes Joke About Disease  </P> <P> One of the jokes aides like to repeat was used by Udall back when news was  circulating about Paula Parkinson, a shapely lobbyist whose kiss-and-tell habit  had many members of Congress nervous.  </P> <P> "There are two kinds of Parkinson's disease," Udall said. "Both of them give  you the shakes."  </P> <P> Although Udall, a liberal, says he doesn't use an iron hand to rule the  committee, which oversees government lands, it's easy to see that legislation  he opposes doesn't stand a chance.  </P> <P> Republicans stalked out of a committee session one day in May when their  amendments to the Udall-sponsored American Heritage Trust Act were defeated by  Democratic proxies held by Udall.  </P> <P> "My style is different," he said in a recent interview. He uses "the merits" to  argue his position, he said dryly. Pausing, he said, "I jest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defined Power in Washington  </P> <P> Then, with the sagacity for which he is known, Udall defined power in  Washington as "the ability for me to have you vote 'aye' when you want to vote  'no.' "  </P> <P> "It may be because of a favor from the past, because you like me or because I  gave time to the opposition," he said.  </P> <P> Udall was hospitalized in May to have his Parkinson's medication adjusted and  for treatment of pneumonia. An old friend, Ben Cole, wrote a column for the  Arizona Republic suggesting that Udall retire.  </P> <P> "It hurt him," said Cole, former Washington bureau chief for the Republic,  retired and living in suburban Virginia. "I'm sorry for that."  </P> <P> But Cole said he sticks by his column. "You can't ask people to stay young  forever," he said, adding that he fears that people will start taking advantage  of Udall because of his health.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colleagues Support Decision  </P> <P> Committee colleagues from both parties support Udall's decision to stay.  </P> <P> "We owe him," Young said. "Even though we are adversaries on many issues (and)  our philosophies are different . . . I respect him very much."  </P> <P> Another frequent adversary on the committee, Rep. Ron Marlenee (R-Mont.), said  he would "support Mr. Udall for as long as he chooses to come to Congress. I  have the greatest respect for him."  </P> <P> Former Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, mentioned by Cole as someone who knew when  it was time to pass the burden to younger shoulders, wrote Udall after the  column was published.  </P> <P> "Your fellow Arizonans are sitting out here, reading that everybody in the Land  of Oz is urging you to step down and come home," Goldwater said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'To Hell With Advisers'  </P> <P> "I hope to God you do what you want to do, to hell with these advisers that  want you to come back. I'd love to have you in Arizona, with me, (but) to be  honest with you, I'd rather have you in Washington doing the things you do for  our state."  </P> <P> When he was released from the hospital May 26, Udall's doctors told him to rest  for a week or two. Five days later, he was back in his office.  </P> <P> "He keeps very active, which is very important," said Frank Williams, executive  director of the American Parkinson's Disease Assn., of which Udall is honorary  chairman.  </P> <P> Williams acknowledged that at times Udall looks bad, but said Parkinson's  patients have intact mental abilities.  </P> <P> "They do not lose their faculties," he said. "They watch their body deteriorate  day after day."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battled Illness for 10 Years  </P> <P> Williams said some people function for 25 to 30 years with the disease. Udall  has battled it for about 10. He also suffers from arthritis, said an aide,  which accounts for his stoop.  </P> <P> Parkinson's is a neurological disorder that affects automatic movements,  forcing sufferers to concentrate on muscle reactions normal people have without  thinking.  </P> <P> Another symptom is loss of voice, said Williams.  </P> <P> Despite that handicap, Udall speaks to other Parkinson's patients at functions  arranged by the association. "He's an inspiration because he hasn't given up,"  said Williams.  </P> <P> Many don't want him to. Goldwater gave Udall this advice on detractors:  </P> <P> "Tell them to go to hell."  </P></p>

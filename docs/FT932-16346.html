			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dolphin dives to Pounds 1.5m DOLPHIN Packaging con-tinued to suffer from difficult trading conditions in 1992 and saw pre-tax profit halved, from Pounds 3.03m to Pounds 1.51m. The dividend, however, is maintained at 4.5p with a final of 2.8p. Earnings per share were 5.22p (10.55p). Turnover fell 8 per cent to Pounds 25.6m (Pounds 27.8m) reflecting lower selling prices but also higher product volumes, said Mr Moger Woolley, chairman. Dolphin and DRG Plastics have agreed to settle their dispute which began in June 1991, after DRG brought legal proceedings against Dolphin regarding its rotary thermoforming process. The agreement maintains the confidentiality of the process with Dolphin selling its rotary thermoforming machinery to DRG at an agreed commercial value.</p>

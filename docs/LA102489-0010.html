			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'PROBLEM' TURNS OUT TO BE THE SOLUTION;  </P> <P> GOVERNMENT: UNDER ATTACK AND UNDERFUNDED, OUR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS PROVIDED THE  HEROICS AFTER THE BAY AREA QUAKE.  </P> <P> Responding to criticism of the Deukmejian Administration's earthquake  preparedness policies, the governor's press secretary said it was "shameful" to  talk politics in a time of disaster.  </P> <P> But politics is central when the public sector is put so rigorously to the  test. What is shameful has been the long-term, unrelenting ideological attack  on the very public institutions on which our health and prosperity so clearly  depend.  </P> <P> That dependence was never more obvious than last week in Northern California.  The test of our government went beyond the obvious emergency responses such as  police and fire. Transit was particularly heroic. The Bay Area Rapid Transit  District quickly became the vital heart of the transportation system, while  buses and ferries rescued the stranded and geared up for a commuter crunch.  Transit systems that have long been criticized instead turn out to be critical  to our economy in the light of bridge and highway collapses. The usually  invisible corps of building inspectors, public-works engineers and  water-district workers was also out in force struggling with broken buildings,  roads, sewers and water mains. And, of course, the disasters on the highways  put the state Department of Transportation at center stage.  </P> <P> In spite of years of austerity, Northern California's public sector has  performed well so far -- with the exception of highways. California's  progressive-era legacy of a relatively competent, reasonably paid and generally  honest government has not been lost; those building inspectors, bus drivers and  highway maintenance workers we like to complain about turn out to be vital to  our safety. In New York, a freeway collapse would have stemmed from a  contracting scandal. Here, the scandal is ideological -- an anti-tax,  anti-government ideology that has denied adequate funding for vital public  needs.  </P> <P> For 11 years since Proposition 13 generated a political earthquake and slashed  public funding, California conservatives have maligned government as "the  problem, not the solution." Local government in particular has borne the brunt  of spending cuts. Fortunately, the locals have muddled through. Where would  Northern California be now without a relatively effective, honest and competent  set of public institutions? The private and nonprofit sectors certainly pitched  in, but the heaviest responsibilities fall on the mayors, supervisors and city  and county managers.  </P> <P> President Bush promoted another version of the same false ideology by stating,  before even setting foot in California, "Thank God for the volunteers."  Actually, thank God (or progressive Bay Area citizens) that a government that  has been attacked for years is competent enough to utilize those volunteers  while responding to a myriad of problems. Nor does Sen. Pete Wilson seem to  understand when he proclaims the problem of the collapsed Nimitz Freeway to be  technological, not fiscal: If he wants to be governor, he better learn that  having the right technology is useless unless you're willing to pay to put it  in place.  </P> <P> Fortunately, California voters will soon have the opportunity to shed two of  the legacies of the anti-government ideology that have compounded the problems  of the quake. One is the state spending limit, which in its absurd current form  requires that emergency spending incurred beyond the limit be paid back by  service cuts in future years, effectively denying real spending increases even  for emergencies. The other is a low gas tax that places California 50th among  states in our highway funding effort, making sure that freeway safety, among  other needs, receives short shrift.  </P> <P> A measure heading for the June ballot corrects the inflexible and outdated  spending limit, including its harmful emergency provisions, while permitting a  gas-tax increase. The Legislature and governor knew that this increase was  necessary, but the spending limit did not permit it. Now, in a special session,  the Legislature should enact a temporary emergency increase in the gas tax to  resolve the immediate uncertainty in highway funding. Not incidentally, such an  action will improve the chance of passage of the measure concerning the  spending limit by giving voters the opportunity to ratify a gas tax already in  place.  </P> <P> Beyond that, the quake should provide the occasion for a reaffirmation of the  traditional California relationship between healthy public and healthy private  sectors. Our health and prosperity depend on public investment and private  investment taken together, but the public side of the equation has been ignored  for too long. That's obvious when a bridge and highway go down and no one can  get to work. It's less obvious when our human and physical infrastructure decay  slowly, but it's no less true. The adequacy of our underfinanced local  institutions will be sorely taxed in coming months. We might even consider  giving them some more resources to work with.  </P></p>

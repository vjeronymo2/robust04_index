			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGRY LIBRARY USERS WIN REVERSAL OF CUTBACK IN HOURS;  </P> <P> BUDGETS: COUNTY SUPERVISORS HAVE VOTED TO SPEND THE ENTIRE LIBRARY CONTINGENCY  FUND OF $318,000 AND AUTHORIZED 10 NEW POSITIONS.  </P> <P> Disgruntled library patrons in Ventura County won a victory this week when  county supervisors reversed themselves and voted to reopen library doors four  nights a week and on Sunday afternoons.  </P> <P> Beginning Jan. 8, libraries in Ventura, Simi Valley, Camarillo, Port Hueneme  and Ojai will expand their hours from two nights per week to four, and library  hours in Fillmore and Moorpark will be increased from two to three nights per  week.  </P> <P> In addition, Foster Library in Ventura and the Camarillo, Simi Valley, Port  Hueneme and Ojai libraries will reopen from 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays beginning March  4.  </P> <P> The cities of Oxnard and Thousand Oaks operate their own libraries. Santa  Paula's library is privately run.  </P> <P> Using the entire library contingency fund of $318,000, the supervisors funded  nine new positions for librarians and clerks, as well as a 10th slot for a  coordinator to supervise the system's 575 volunteers.  </P> <P> Students were the big evening users and, together with their parents and  teachers, became the most vocal complainers when the hours were cut Sept. 5,  county officials said.  </P> <P> "If we can't reopen to this group of people, we're really not doing our job,"  Supervisor James R. Dougherty argued Tuesday.  </P> <P> "You can have the most expensive computer system in the world and the  nicest-looking library in the world, and it isn't going to do you any good at  all if the doors are shut."  </P> <P> The decision came after hundreds of complaints from library clients, Library  Services Director Dixie D. Adeniran said.  </P> <P> "I heard over the telephone, through the mail, by people who pulled on my  sleeve at public meetings," she said. "The most serious concern was weekday  evenings."  </P> <P> The cuts became necessary after supervisors decided on a $9-million budget for  library systems in July. At that time, the board funded a new computer system  for $1.6 million, but denied Adeniran's request for an additional $1.2 million  for staffing to handle increased business at the system's 17 branches.  </P> <P> The $318,000 taken from the contingency fund set aside for emergencies will  finance the 10 positions for the remainder of the fiscal year.  </P> <P> "This is the minimum level of funding needed to open the doors," she said.  "Even at this, we are still fairly severely understaffed."  </P> <P> For that reason, she said, she welcomed a review now under way by the county  administrator's office.  </P> <P> The review, which is to be finished in two months, may recommend staffing  alterations or other methods to work within the budget constraints, she said.  </P> <P> The volunteer coordinator will supervise the unpaid aides, write grants and  plan fund-raisers. Adeniran and Supervisor Madge L. Schaefer called the  position "money well spent."  </P> <P> Adeniran said she expected the board to continue to fund the library at its  restored hours in future years.  </P> <P> Supervisors made the unanimous decision -- a four-fifths vote was required to  take money from the contingency fund -- over the objections of County  Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg, who urged the board to delay action  until his office completes its review.  </P> <P> "My fear is that we're going to be in a situation where we're going to be  really hurting . . . where your board is going to be stretched again,"  Wittenberg said.  </P> <P> Hours effective Jan. 8 at Foster and Wright libraries in Ventura, and in  Camarillo, Simi Valley, Ojai and Port Hueneme will be from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m.  Mondays through Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays.  Presently, the branches close at 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. On March  4, all the branches except Wright will open from 1 to 4 p.m. Sundays.  </P> <P> Hours effective Jan. 8 at Ojai, Moorpark and Fillmore will be from 10 a.m. to 9  p.m. Mondays through Wednesdays, 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays, and  noon to 6 p.m. Saturdays.  </P> <P> The three are now open from noon to 9 p.m. Mondays and Tuesdays, 10 a.m. to 5  p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays, and noon to 5 p.m. Saturdays.  </P></p>

Speaking  to reporters during the second day of his official visit to  Israel, he was today lecturing at the Hebrew University. More  from reporter Dick Winter:    [Begin recording] Winter: Dr. Vaclav Klaus, in  his first visit to Israel, met this morning with his former  economic adviser: the governor of the Bank of Israel, Ya'aqov  Frenkel. Frenkel, in 1986 a senior official in the  International Monetary Fund, helped Dr. Klaus to plan the new  Czech Republic's emerging free market economy.    But reporters' first question to the visiting prime minister  was about the charges that the Czech firm Skoda, one of the  Czech Republic's largest companies, is selling nuclear  technology, along with other weapons, to Iran.    Klaus: Well, I must say those are just rumors and  speculations usually created by the competition in the Western  European countries, in the United States companies which want to  catch the markets themselves and try in advance to send rumors  to undermine the Czech position. Simply that's not true.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

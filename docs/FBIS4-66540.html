			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Abraham: "Dinesh Briefs European Union </F> Leaders"]    [Text] Brussels, Feb. 9--The External Affairs Minister, Mr.  Dinesh Singh, made a forceful presentation of India's  perceptions on the causes for the problems in Kashmir at his  meeting with the troika of European Union Ministers here on  Tuesday night and was in turn told that the E.U. had been  telling Pakistan not to support terrorism.    "I told them that if Pakistan stops supporting terrorism,  then we could hold elections and the people of Jammu and Kashmir  would be able to form their own Government," he said in an  interview to THE HINDU after the meeting.    "I explained that Pakistan does not raise the issue of human  rights in international fora for the sake of human rights, but  only wants to internationalise the issue," he said.    With the possibility of a Pakistani attempt to introduce a  resolution in the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, it was  important for India to get a sympathetic hearing from the  Europeans, and yesterday's meeting appears to have been an  important step in this process. "I think they absorbed whatever  I said, and they will keep it in mind whatever decision they  take on the resolution," Mr. Dinesh Singh said.    A meeting with the Belgian Foreign Minister, Mr. Willy  Claes,  this morning was also cause for satisfaction. The Belgian  Minister reportedly affirmed that India and Pakistan should sort  out their problems bilaterally indicating that his country was  against internationalising the issue.    At yesterday's meeting with the troika, Mr. Singh, who is  still frail from his recent illness and finds it difficult to  speak for a long time, shook off all traces of tiredness, and  made a spirited defence of India's position on Kashmir. He urged  the Europeans to think of the human rights of the victims of  terrorist action, too.  <H5>  Balanced Approach </H5>   Kashmir and human rights were bound to figure in the talks,  but the Indian side drew some satisfaction from the relatively  mild and balanced way in which the Europeans addressed the  issues. The Greek Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. T.  Pangalos, representing the Presidency of the European Union,  said that Europe was concerned about what was happening in  Kashmir, and stressed the need for restraint on the part of the  security forces. But he balanced this by stating that Europe  would continue to urge Pakistan to restrain its support for  terrorism. He pointed out that no country, not even in Europe,  had a perfect human rights record.    The visit to Kashmir by E.U. Ambassadors based in Delhi came  in for favourable notice, but Mr. Pangalos urged greater access  for non-Governmental organisations. The Minister welcomed the  resumption of the dialogue at the Foreign Secretary level  between India and Pakistan and urged that efforts be made to see  that it continued.    India also probed the E.U. on its ideas about the expansion  of the U.N. Security Council, a question which is receiving  increasing attention in New Delhi. The Indian delegation was  informed that there was no clear consensus within the E.U.  itself on the form and content of expansion. India made it clear  that it would be unhappy if expansion was restricted only to the  two current front-runners (Germany and Japan), and pointed out  that it would be unwise to rush a decision on the expansion.  <H5>  India Pleased </H5>   The Indian delegation has been pleased with the outcome of  the meeting for several reasons. Firstly, it allowed India to  get a hearing at the ministerial level in the E.U. and put  forward its views on various issues. Secondly, it also provided  the opportunity for a dialogue between the Foreign Secretary,  Mr. K. Srinivasan, and his counterparts from the Belgian, Greek  and German Foreign Ministries. They discussed a number of  substantial issues including the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty],  European restrictions on sale of dual use technology, illegal  immigration, terrorism and drug trafficking.    The Foreign Secretary or Political Director level talks as  they are known were significant for the detail in which two  related issues of importance to India, the NPT and dual use  technology restrictions were discussed. As far as the NPT was  concerned, the Europeans, as expected, urged India to consider  signing the Treaty.    India has been worried about the E.U. making a list of  countries to which the sale of sensitive dual use technology  would be banned. The Indian delegation urged that the country  should not be put on the list, and said that the Government was  willing to certify end use of imports for civlian use.    The meeting was not expected to lead to any concrete  declarations, but was only meant to carry the process of  political consultation forward. It has done this and also laid  the steps for further dialogue. The two sides have agreed on  regular meetings at the official level on illegal immigration,  terrorism, and drug trafficking, an outcome India is pleased  with.    The first real results of the meeting will, however, be felt  only in the weeks and months ahead, as Europe takes positions on  the Pakistani resolution on Kashmir in Geneva and similar issues.</p>

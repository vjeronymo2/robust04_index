			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Scottish constitutional stance may be reviewed by Tories says Major MR JOHN MAJOR hinted yesterday that the government would review its opposition to constitutional change for Scotland if the Conservatives won the general election. He said in a BBC radio interview recorded during his weekend visit to Scotland: 'I have come to Scotland to set out the case for maintaining the union in all its aspects . . . After the election we will take stock. For the moment that's what I've done, that's all I have done and I'm going no further.' In a speech in Glasgow Mr Major urged Scots to reject independence and devolution, and extolled the virtues of the union of the United Kingdom and the role of Scotland within it. While only a minority of Scottish Tories support constitutional change, many believe the party might have to change its policy if it loses some of its nine Scottish seats in the general election. There was no sign of a change of policy from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, when he opened a five-hour debate on Scotland's constitutional position at the Scottish Grand Committee of Scottish MPs in Edinburgh. The debate, in the chamber built for the Scottish assembly planned by the last Labour government, produced few new arguments. It was marked by acrimony between Labour, which wants a devolved Scottish parliament, and the Scottish National party, urging independence. Mr Lang attacked the funding structure for Labour's planned parliament, saying even if it were assigned all income tax and VAT raised in Scotland, that was 'less than half of total identifiable public expenditure in Scotland and less than a third of total government expenditure in Scotland'. Even if the Scottish parliament, as Labour had said, imposed an extra 3p on income tax in Scotland, it would only raise 2.5 per cent of government revenue in Scotland. In a whole range of ways, he said, 'a Scottish parliament would run amok among the business and individual taxpayers of Scotland, to fund the policies that would bring her to her knees'. Mr Donald Dewar, the shadow Scottish secretary, defended Labour's proposals for a Scottish parliament. Scots would be 'governed by representatives they elect and will retain our links with the other countries which make up the UK'. Mr Lang, he said, 'always agonises over the impact of a Scottish parliament on the UK. He never considers the damage being done to Scotland by the present system'. Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP, said that a devolved Scottish parliament would be unstable, as was the status quo. A devolved Scottish parliament would depend for more than 90 per cent of its income on the discretion of Westminster. It would have little say in Scotland's dealing with the EC.

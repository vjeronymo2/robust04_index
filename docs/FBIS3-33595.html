			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The decision has been made: Now that Congress has  approved the Social Emergency Fund [FSE], the economy's new  leading index will go into effect early next week. Finance  Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso today explained that the Real  Value Unit [URV] will be adjusted for 100 percent of inflation.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Ana Paula Padrao from Brasilia]  The minister was very pleased that Congress had voted for the  FSE; it put him in a very good mood. On his way to work this  morning, he stopped to purchase newspapers, and briefly refuted  the more sensationalist headlines. He promised: Nobody has to  rush to the banks to take out their money, because the new  economic plan does not change anything in the lives of the  workers. He confirmed that the provisional measure establishing  the URV will be issued on 28 February, adding that he is not  worried by the coincidence that the Cruzado Plan had been  launched on the same date. The Cruzado Plan was a good economic  plan, Cardoso said, adding that a lot has been learned in the  meantime, and the new plan will be successful.    The minister stated that measures designed to punish  companies which increase their prices outrageously are being  studied. Cardoso confirmed, however, that the policy of the  economic team is to adjust salaries according to the inflation  average and keep prices free. From his point of view this is to  the workers' advantage. He explained that those whose salaries  are stated in URV will be protected. Once the URV is  implemented, salaries will not stay behind inflation for a  single day.    [Cardoso] The wages of workers who get paid by the day will  be adjusted practically every day. Those who get paid by the  week will have their wages adjusted throughout the week, and  those who get paid by the month will have their wages adjusted  throughout the month. That is not the case now, because wages  are adjusted for only 90 percent of inflation three months out  of four, and only on the fourth month are the workers' wages  adjusted for 100 percent of inflation. It will be different  from now on: Wages will be adjusted for 100 percent of  inflation throughout the month.    [Padrao] Once salaries are adjusted for the average  inflation  through the URV mechanism, what will happen to prices?  Everybody is worried because prices will not follow the same  approach.    [Cardoso] The less prices follow the same approach the  better  for the salaried workers, because the value of their income will  be guranteed while prices will have no adjustment reference.  Therefore, the longer businessmen take to adjust their prices  through the URV mechanism, the better for the workers. [end  recording]</p>

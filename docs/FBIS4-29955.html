			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [From the Zoom Up column] </F>   [Text] The work of the Petroleum Policy Basic Issues  Subcommittee of the Petroleum Council's Petroleum Section, which  is discussing the issue of relaxation of petroleum industry  regulations, is facing its greatest crisis. The "interim draft  compilation" of the mired details of the discussion so far will  be submitted in a "concentrated form" at the sixth meeting of  the subcommittee on 9 June. It is expected that only a harsh  refutation led by petroleum side members will result, the  compilation of "an interim report" on the same day will be  difficult, and it is certain that "final compilation" will be  carried over until 20 June. Although the "compilation draft"  that will be submitted to the subcommittee on 9 June is  considered "to have the appearance of a mosaic" (Petroleum  Department, Agency of Natural Resources and Energy), it seems  that they have clearly worked out the direction toward  relaxation of regulations on the whole. The concern with the  contents is that the "basis" is the "Memo of Major Discussion  Points" in the form of a consolidation of previous discussions  submitted by the Secretariat to the subcommittee meeting held on  19 May. The "draft compilation" will probably be created  referring to this memo. Therefore, one can attempt to anticipate  the "compilation" via the "Memo of Discussion Points"...    For the first point of discussion, "In what direction should  we aim for a stable supply guarantee policy in the long term,"  noted in the memo are both the assertion that 1) "An oil crisis  is generated every 10 years, and in the future, dependence on  the Middle East will rise, tight supply and demand are  anticipated, and we should aim at a stable supply for the future  by a consumer-site refining method," and the idea that 2)  "Considering the trend toward internationalization of the  petroleum products market, especially the progress in  integration of the Asian market, it will be impossible to close  the domestic market forever, and also inappropriate from the  viewpoint of opening up future prospects for the petroleum  industry. Along with planning for internationalization of  product price levels and price structure by liberalizing  imports, we should consider a stable supply within an  international market." However, it appears that the "trial  draft" on 9 June will be closer to the second point.    Concerning the second discussion point, "Should the  consumer-site refinery method be secured by the Designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law," the memo  asserts: 1) "From the importance of a stable supply, it is  necessary to secure systematically a consumer-site refinery  method by the Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional  Measures Law, and the insurance premium for that should properly  be borne by the public." 2) "The framework of the designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law has become  such that imported goods do not flow directly into the domestic  market, and it impedes the efficiency of the market and hinders  the elimination of price structure distortion and the foreign  and domestic price differential. Insurance premiums are too high  in the current arrangement." 3) If there is an obligation for  storage of imported products to guarantee a stable supply, that  is sufficient and the law should be abrogated." 4)  "Consumer-site refining is both economical and efficient and,  considering that Japan's petroleum industry has international  competitive power at the refining stage, it is excessive to  guarantee the consumer-site refining system by the Designated  Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law." Among  these, ideas 2, 3, and 4 will probably be incorporated.    On the third point, "Will it be necessary to review the  storage system in case of expanding imported products," this  issue perceives the necessity of storage and it does not appear  that it will result in a large dispute.    On the fourth point, "To what extent should we  systematically  guarantee the quality of petroleum products in the case of  expanding imported products," it says: 1) "It is necessary to  make a systematic guarantee in order to maintain the  environment, safety, and existing high quality, including  performance covering that." 2) "Supplying only high-quality  products robs the consumer of the opportunity of selection, and  we should supply products with diverse product quality." 3)  "Based on the trends of various countries of Europe and the  United States, we should continue to study in detail to what  extent it is necessary to guarantee systematically the current  high level of quality." This issue will probably be mentioned in  the "compiled draft" with points 1 and 3 as the axis.    Three assertions are listed for the fifth point, "Is it  necessary to manage the domestic distribution routes in  peacetime from the viewpoint of response in an emergency," but  as a whole, in preparing for a crisis and carrying out  compulsory constraints on demand, there is a strong possibility  that the direction will be indicated toward the necessity for  service stations to accurately manage supply routes.    For the sixth and final point, "Shouldn't we proceed with  distribution efficiency," the focus has been on assertions that:  1) "Service station (SS) sales are one-fourth that of the United  States and one-half that of Europe. The cost per sale is great  and we should promote further efficiency." 2) "Expansion of  imports is necessary for overall efficiency in the distribution  system." 3) "We should indicate the direction of abolishing the  designated district system based on the Gasoline Sales and  Distribution Business Law." 4) "It is necessary to pursue  cutting services in response to the criticism of excessive  service, and safety regulations preventing introduction of the  self-service method are excessive." 5) "By promoting  distribution efficiency, 400,000 people have been hired  centering on small service stations, which exerts a considerably  bad effect on service station management itself." Here, it is  certain that a tendency is shown toward the promotion of  efficiency while being mindful of point 5. Viewed thus, the  "interim compilation draft" which each member will have in his  hands on 9 June will probably be rather remote from the  assertions of the petroleum industry which considers that "the  Designated Petroleum Products Import Provisional Measures Law is  absolutely necessary" (Petroleum Federation chairman, Yasuoki  Tateuchi). In any case, the "settlement" of "heated argument"  anticipated by the subcommittee on 9 June will determine the  future direction of the relaxation of petroleum industry  regulations.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Technology: Focusing in on the future -After years of delay, Australia's high-technology city is suddenly moving forward Six years after it was proposed by the Japanese government, a moribund Australian plan to build a high-technology 'city of the future' in Adelaide is showing signs of returning to life. The project, inelegantly named the Multi Function Polis, has been stalled by political instability since it was approved by the federal and South Australian state governments in 1991. The delay prompted speculation that the MFP was being allowed to die - a view that gained ground with the retirement in March of John Button, the former federal industry minister, who was a strong supporter of the project. But a sudden flurry of activity by the MFP Development Corporation, set up by the state government to run the project, suggests a scaled-down version of the MFP will go ahead. Most significantly, the corporation's board, appointed only last October, recently appointed its first chief executive, ending a six-month search for someone capable of reviving the project. It will not be an easy task. The MFP concept has been shrouded in confusion since it was floated in a 1987 speech by Hajime Tamura, then Japan's minister of international trade and industry. A joint Australian/Japanese feasibility study which followed Tamura's speech prompted concern by referring airily to the MFP as 'a biosphere' and a place for 'renaissance living' without putting any flesh on the vision. Australian unease increased when a second report produced for the federal government concluded that the project would only be viable with a population of 200,000, of whom 80 per cent would have to be foreigners. There has also been confusion about the cost of the project, which has been variously estimated at ADollars 6bn (Pounds 2.6bn) and ADollars 13bn. The corporation now says only that the first of 10 phases will cost ADollars 150m. Paradoxically, the delay in getting the MFP off the ground may have saved the project by giving the development corporation time to refine the elements that were unlikely to work or politically unacceptable. There is now no sign of the science fiction jargon which dogged the MFP's early days, although officials continue to brush aside criticism of its clumsy name. But there are more substantial refinements, too: The proposed population has been reduced to about 50,000 people, equivalent to less than 5 per cent of Adelaide's population. Most of the newcomers would be Australians. Japanese involvement is being played down, although officials deny that this is a response to criticism. The international advisory board comprises three Australians, two Japanese, two Koreans, a Taiwanese, an American and four Europeans. Grandiose proposals for a fee-paying 'world university' have been abandoned, and a proposed 'information utility' joint venture with the private sector will now be a public-sector project. Complex plans to make the project a joint venture with the private sector have been dropped, at least for the first phase. Instead, the development corporation is seeking direct government funding. The revised plan envisages the development over about 30 years of a series of 'villages' on four sites centred on 1,840 hectares of wasteland at Gillman, a low-lying area about 20 minutes' drive from central Adelaide. The villages would include about 1,000 hectares of waterways and 800 hectares of parklands and forests, creating a pleasant urban landscape not dissimilar to some existing Adelaide suburbs. There is little doubt that the swampy Gillman area could be successfully developed - similar land elsewhere in the city has already been developed privately into an upmarket housing estate. The state government also controls most of the potential residential land in and around Adelaide, enabling it to underwrite the value of housing on the site by delaying the release of land elsewhere. But if it is to succeed, the MFP will have to be much more than an upmarket housing estate. Specifically, it is designed to help Australia develop expertise in four key areas: Innovative urban development. The sites would be 50 per cent more energy efficient than the South Australian average, and would feature dual water and sewerage systems, allowing recycling of water for non-drinking uses. A services company set up by the development corporation and a number of private companies would develop energy saving and waste recycling technology and expertise for commercial sale. The services company is considering a host of ideas, including the commercial use of sewage sludge for brick making and fertiliser and generating electrical power from waste disposal. Information technology. All buildings would be linked by broadband fibre optic cable, allowing a large-scale experiment in the use of interactive and intelligent communications devices. If the federal government and other state governments agree, the MFP would co-ordinate national tele-medicine activities (in which diagnosis and even surgery can be controlled over large distances using videoconferencing facilities.) The project would include a media studies centre on the Gold Coast of Queensland, providing advanced facilities for film and television post-production work. The MFP planners also hope to build on Australia's high reputation for innovative computer software. One promising area is the conversion of western software to Asian languages and conventions. Education. In place of the abandoned plan for a world university, the MFP is now promoting a joint venture with South Australia's three universities to establish a fee-paying Asian business school to expand Australia's existing role as a source of education facilities for emerging Asian economies. The project also plans to develop Australia's expertise in distance learning techniques, including an expansion of a fibre optic video conferencing system already being used to deliver technical further education to remote communities. Environment. Building on the polluted and swampy Gillman site would provide valuable environmental management skills, which are increasingly in demand around the world. Other ideas include using recycled water to replenish underground reservoirs (aquifers), which are being depleted by overuse. Some researchers even speculate that the sandy aquifers could be used to treat raw sewage. Despite the simplifications, MFP officials still have difficulty in explaining the project concisely - Rod Keller, the acting chief executive, took 15 minutes to deliver a 'one sentence' explanation of its objectives. But Keller says the project will gain credibility over the next few months as earthmoving work starts on the Gillman site and final decisions are made on the availability of government funding. Keller admits that less than ADollars 300,000 has so far been committed to the project by its overseas corporate supporters, which include some of the biggest companies in Japan and South Korea. But he claims most criticism of Japanese involvement in the project is racist, and insists that the 84 Japanese corporate supporters will begin to invest as soon as Australia shows its commitment to the MFP. 'My father was killed by Japanese bombing in Darwin (during the second world war), so I have as much reason as anyone to be suspicious of the Japanese,' Keller says. 'But if we can't get past that and recognise that we need investment from Japan, South Korea and other foreign countries then we all ought to put our heads in the sand.' Robin Marrett, chairman of the state's Economic Development Authority, says the project dovetails neatly with South Australia's need to develop technology-based industries to replace manufacturing, which has been hit by reductions in protective tariffs. Marrett says the project will make 'real strides forward' in the next 12 months. But he concedes that the project may yet face problems. 'Right now the MFP is at a crossroads. There has been a lot of talk about it, but the talk has been mainly in conceptual terms.</p>

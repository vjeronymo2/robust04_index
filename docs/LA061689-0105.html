			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: CD PACKAGE SALUTES THE ALLMAN BROTHERS  </P> <P> At its peak, the Allman Brothers Band in many ways was the Grateful Dead with  fire.  </P> <P> Like Jerry Garcia and company, the Allmans -- whose blend of country and blues  strains defined Southern Rock in the late '60s and early '70s -- frequently  engaged in marathon jams on stage, sidestepping visual flash for sheer  instrumental authority and grace as it wove an almost magical spell over the  audience.  </P> <P> But the band -- which framed the superb guitar interaction of Duane Allman and  Dickey Betts against one of rock's most accomplished rhythm sections --  injected the music with an energy and tension that was more consistently  involving than the Dead's.  </P> <P> The Allmans' era -- starting with brothers Gregg and Duane's early Allman Joys  and Hour Glass bands, but reaching its creative peak with the emergence of the  formal Allman Brothers Band in 1969 -- is saluted in an extraordinary  four-disc, 55-track retrospective that will be released Tuesday by PolyGram.  </P> <P> Titled "Dreams," the boxed set will sell for around $55 in CD (it'll also be  available in vinyl and cassette). The set was produced by Bill Levenson, who  also put together "Crossroads," last year's Grammy-winning Eric Clapton tribute  set, and contains an illustrated, 36-page history of the group.  </P> <P> Besides a generous serving of familiar Allman numbers (including "Whipping  Post," "In Memory of Elizabeth Reed" and "Ramblin' Man"), "Dreams" offers more  than two hours of rare or previously unreleased demos, alternative takes and  remixed material. The latter ranges from an Allman Joys' demo of the Yardbirds'  "Shapes of Things" to a live, 1973 rendition of "One Way Out."  </P> <P> Though the musical flavor of this tragedy-riddled band shifted at several  points (both Duane Allman and bassist Berry Oakley were killed in separate  motorcycle accidents in the early '70s), there is a surprisingly strong  continuity of vision. The original passion and drive of the band continued even  after leader Duane Allman's death at 24 in 1971, and on into the music offered  by Gregg Allman and Dickey Betts when they started their own rival bands.  </P> <P> There have not been half a dozen more musically compelling bands in American  rock than the Allmans, and "Dreams" underscores the point. The set commemorates  the group's 20th anniversary, a celebration that will include the first U.S.  tour since 1980 by Betts, Gregg Allman and drummers Butch Trucks and Jaimoe,  the four remaining members of the 1969 edition of the Allmans.  </P> <P> ALSO NEW: Capitol Records' reissue of satirist Stan Freberg's wildly ambitious  musical panorama of the country's founding, "Stan Freberg Presents the United  States of America," contains two sketches that weren't on the original 1961  package. They are "The Discovery of Electricity" and "The Midnight Ride of Paul  Revere." . . . The sound quality is spotty on Island Records' "Scandal Ska" as  most of the 16 selections on this survey of early '60s Jamaican ska were dubbed  from records because the master tapes were presumably unavailable. But the  package is noteworthy because it contains Bob Marley's first record ("Judge  Not") as well as numbers by Jimmy Cliff, Desmond Dekker and Laurel Aitken.  Already available in Britain, the album will be released here July 17.  </P></p>

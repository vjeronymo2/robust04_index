According to a report by the Central News Unit, he  considered  the trend of the movement of the state economy as being towards  a planned economy, and he described the advances of the state  economy as outstanding during the first state economic, social,  and cultural development plan, and he said: During the years  when the First Development Plan was being implemented, while the  international economy was facing a recession we were one of the  five countries which advanced its economy at a relatively high  percentage.    He said: While in 1993 the world economic growth has been  estimated to be 1.2 percent, our economy in the current year  [Iranian year beginning 21 March 1993] has enjoyed a growth of  7.7 percent.    On investment in various economic sectors, the minister of  finance and economic affairs said: During the First Plan we  spent more than one third of our foreign currency earnings on  investment in development plans and production projects. Ninety  percent of our debts are connected with that type of investment.  He pointed out that more than 50 percent of the state foreign  currency earnings during the years when the First Plan was being  implemented were used up on investments in development projects.    In the field of the domestic GNP, Mohammad-Khani said: In  1367 [year beginning 21 March 1988] the GNP was 7 percent. It  reached 14 percent in 1371.    He continued: On average the added value [as heard] in the  agricultural sector during the period of the First Plan grew by  5.9 percent. That is 0.3 percent more than envisaged in the  plan so that the volume of the added value of the sector  compared to the beginning of the plan has increased four fold.    Announcing that non-oil exports grew by 28.7 percent in the  First Plan period, he described one of the most important  objectives of the First Plan to be replacing imports. He  recalled the role of non-oil exports in reducing the state  foreign currency requirements and said: At the moment the  increase in domestic products in the field of oil refining,  petrochemical, intermediate, and consumer industries is  satisfactory so that our domestic products have grown to such an  extent that they can reduce the country's foreign currency  requirements to one third of those in 1367. That indicates the  success of the economic move in that field.    The finance and economic affairs minister said that the  forecast in the First Plan for the annual growth rate of the  public sector spending was 24.4 percent and added: Nevertheless  the forecast of the public sector spending growth rate in the  Second Development Plan amounts to 43.2 percent. The reason for  that is the growth of the government's development expenses.    Referring to the high volume of investment in the production  sector, the reduction of the state foreign currency requirements  for importing capital-intensive goods as well as the  arrangements made in the past few weeks to regulate the currency  market, Mohammad-Khani considered the effect of oil price  reductions in the trend of the state economic movement to be  little.    He considered the combination of implemented policies in  support of domestic products, creating employment, supporting  the national currency and regulating the state economic  structure as significant and said that at the moment inflation  and consumerism are two of the worst of the country's  fundamental problems. On inflation, Mohammad-Khani said: The  rapid growth of the economic structure, international recession,  population growth, and a tendency toward consumerism in the  community, have beset the regulation and coordination of  economic and social development with difficulties and directed  the greater part of the pressure resulting from that growth  toward the salaried stratum. Therefore the government is duty  bound to pay more attention to reduce that pressure on the  vulnerable strata. The rate of inflation as well as the  pressure on the low-income strata will be reduced through the  start of commissioning production projects -- in which  investment has been made -- as a result of increased supply,  government support for vulnerable strata and a reform of the tax  system.    Continuing, the finance and economic affairs minister said:  the annual rate of consumption during the period of the First  Plan was forecast to be 5 percent. We have now reached a figure  of 10 percent. That is why it is necessary for the public and  private sectors to act to reduce consumption and cooperate to  adjust the state economic status. He added: One of the policies  of the government in the First Plan was to pave the way for  investment in the Second Plan in the private sector, and the  government intends to bring about increased investor confidence  by supporting domestic investments.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: Cariplo agrees to acquire 21% share stake in IMI CARIPLO, Italy's biggest savings bank, yesterday ended months of speculation by signing a letter of intent to buy a 21 per cent stake in Istituto Mobiliare Italiano (IMI), the big Rome-based investment banking and financial services group. No price for the deal, which is part of the current wide-ranging restructure of Italian banking, has been revealed. However, S. G. Warburg, the UK merchant bank which valued IMI for the Treasury, is thought to have put a L6,000bn to L8,000bn price tag on the company, valuing the deal at between L1,250bn (Dollars 1.01bn) and L1,680bn. IMI is 50 per cent owned by the Italian Treasury, while the remainder of the shares are held by a number of public and private-sector financial institutions. Cariplo is controlled by a public-sector charitable foundation. The link between the two could provide the first step towards creating a third big, full-service bank alongside Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino and the big new bank being established in Rome via the merger of Banco di Roma, Banco di Santo Spirito and the Rome savings bank. However, although the Cariplo-IMI deal is appealing in business terms, it has been criticised by some politicians as furthering the expansionist aims of big north Italian banks, while doing nothing for their poorer southern counterparts. Such views have sometimes masked more complex political considerations, linked to the some politicians' views that the Christian Democrats, Italy's biggest party, is already over-represented in the highly-politicised public-sector banking world. Cariplo, chaired by a former leading member of the party, Mr Roberto Mazzotto, is firmly in the Christian Democrat camp. The political impact of letting Cariplo, which had total assets of L120,000bn at the end of 1990, buy into IMI will be softened by offering a further 21 per cent stake in IMI to other savings banks over the next 15 months, with the aim of counterbalancing Cariplo's presence. The Treasury would retain 8 per cent of IMI. However, the proposal is still vague, and it remains to be seen whether other savings banks will want to join in the deal. Long-running talks last year between Cariplo and four other big city savings banks on a joint investment in IMI foundered on political differences and hostility among the smaller banks to paying large amounts in return for what seemed little say in IMI. The go-ahead for Cariplo to buy into IMI may also be the first stage in other politically-sensitive banking transactions, notably a recapitalisation of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the Treasury-owned bank.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 14 (XINHUA) -- Deputies from  underdeveloped northwest China to the National People's Congress  (NPC) expressed concern over a continuous exodus of its  professionals to east China.    The deputies, who are here attending the second NPC session,  agreed that in recent years, talent loss has adversely affected  economic growth in their respective regions and further widened  the development gap between China's east and west.    Government statistics show that every year thousands of  professionals move out of northwest China, which covers Gansu,  Shaanxi and Qinghai Provinces, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous  Region and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.    For example, 10,000 scientists and technicians have left  Qinghai province over the past six years. Moreover, the exodus  has been increasing at an annual rate of 27 percent.    The deputies aired their views on how to solve the problem.    Zhang Wule, acting Gansu provincial governor, said, "I  think,  in the final analysis, market competition means competition for  professionals and for scientific and technological progress."    The exodus of professionals, he said, makes it very hard for  west China, inhabited largely by ethnic minority people, to  develop its rich natural resources, improve the competitiveness  of locally- produced goods and eliminate poverty.    Solution for the problem lies in changing the concept of  managing professionals and reforming the personnel managerial  system, he said.    According to Zhang, it is imperative to formulate policies  that will attract professionals to stay on.    Mamatjan Amet, commissioner of Yili Prefecture in Xinjiang,  said that over the past two years 6,000 intellectuals have left  Xinjiang and many more are ready to go.    He said this is due primarily to a widening of the economic  and income gaps between the country's east and west.    He called for government officials in west China to pay  greater attention to the well-being of intellectuals and do  everything within their power to let the intellectuals make the  best use of their talent.    According to Song Pengsheng, deputy director of the Qinghai  Provincial Science and Technology Commission, one reason for the  exodus is that intellectuals are not well respected in many  parts of northwest China and that their working and living  conditions are poor.    Wang Yu, a senior engineer from Ningxia, emphasized the  importance of taking all "possible and feasible" measures to  encourage professionals from elsewhere to move to northwest  China.    Many other deputies agreed that, to solve the problem of  professionals leaving for east China, the state should provide  additional policy and financial support to northwest China.</p>

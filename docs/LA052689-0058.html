			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> Jury selection has begun in a lawsuit over a woman's accidental death 2 1/2  years ago in a hot tub on Dustin Hoffman's Roxbury, Conn., estate. Sheila Cruse  Fionda, 43, was found floating face down in the hot tub at Hoffman's estate in  1986. The actor was not there at the time and Fionda had gone out to dinner  with the estate's caretaker earlier. Police concluded that Ms. Fionda drowned  accidentally, her blood-alcohol level being three times the legal limit for  driving in Connecticut. Her former husband, A. Joseph Fionda, sued Hoffman, the  property's former caretaker, the tub installer and the manufacturer of its  heater. The suit, which does not specify amount of damages sought, accuses  Hoffman of failing to have the area of the hot tub fenced, failing to ensure  that the water did not get too hot and failing to instruct the caretaker about  the safe use of the tub.

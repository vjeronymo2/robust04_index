			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INJURED PLAYER'S FATHER ALLEGEDLY HIT COACH  </P> <P> Joey Hernandez Sr., the man arrested Friday night for allegedly striking Buena  Park High School Coach Martin Luczaj after a Freeway League football game, is  the father of Joey Hernandez Jr., a Fullerton running back who suffered an  injured knee during Fullerton's 21-12 victory.  </P> <P> Hernandez, a senior who also plays linebacker, was hurt in the second quarter  while being tackled after his only carry of the game, a one-yard gain.  </P> <P> After watching films of the play, Fullerton Coach Pat Ward said the injury was  caused by a Buena Park defender who speared the knee with his helmet after  Hernandez had been stopped.  </P> <P> Tests on Hernandez's knee will be performed Monday to determine the extent of  the injury, which almost certainly will keep him out of the Indians'  first-round playoff game Friday.  </P> <P> "It was a flagrant cheap shot and the film shows that," Ward said.  </P> <P> Ward said Hernandez's injury apparently sparked the postgame incident that  involved at least two Fullerton fans. Hernandez Sr. was cited and released at  the scene. Luczaj did not appear to be hurt.  </P> <P> Sgt. Steve Matson of the Fullerton Police Department said Saturday that the  district attorney will review the case and decide whether to file misdemeanor  assault and battery charges.  </P> <P> Reached Saturday by telephone, Hernandez Sr. declined to comment. Luczaj did  not return calls to his home. MARTIN BECK  </P></p>

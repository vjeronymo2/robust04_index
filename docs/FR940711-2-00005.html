Based on an analysis of ships' manifest data (PIERS), the Department estimated that the named respondents accounted for approximately 40 percent of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation. Consequently, on May 18, 1994, the Department sent 40 antidumping questionnaires to the named firms, with additional copies sent to MOFTEC and the China Chamber.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following an entry of appearance by counsel for a previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on May 31, 1994. Finally, at the request of a second previously unnamed producer/exporter, the Department sent a questionnaire to this additional firm on June 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Other Events  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On June 2, 1994, the Department issued a decision memorandum which stated that we would not postpone our preliminary determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on reasonably supported allegations submitted by petitioner on June 10, 1994, the Department initiated an investigation on June 14, 1994, of whether critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of fresh garlic from the PRC. On June 14 and 21, 1994, the Department requested monthly shipment data for exports to the United States from questionnaire recipients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this investigation are all grades of garlic, whole or separated into constituent cloves, whether or not peeled, fresh, chilled, frozen, provisionally preserved, or packed in water or other neutral substance, but not prepared or preserved by the addition of other ingredients or heat processing. The differences between grades are based on color, size, sheathing and level of decay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subject merchandise is used principally as a food product and for seasoning. The subject garlic is currently classifiable under subheadings 0703.20.0000, 0710.80.7060, 0710.80.9750, 0711.90.6000, and 2005.90.9500 of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this proceeding is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The scope description provided above differs from the scope description used by the Department in its notice of initiation of this investigation (59 FR 9470, February 28, 1994). Changes to the scope include (a) the addition of more concise language (and additional HTS subheadings) related to the packing of the subject merchandise, and (b) additional language to exclude further processed products. The revisions are a result of comments received from the Customs Service on March 17 and June 30, 1994, and from counsel for petitioner on June 29 and 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is August 1, 1993, to January 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

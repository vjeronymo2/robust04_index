			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Salim Salih Muhammad, Presidential Council  member and assistant YSP [Yemeni Socialist Party] secretary  general, said that the option for peace, for dialogue, for  sitting at a roundtable to discuss the entire situation, was the  only way to settle the current crisis.    He said that the YSP, which had led the moves for unity and  democracy, had neither planned nor even thought of resorting to  a military approach. Brother Salim Salih Muhammad added, in a  radio interview with him today with the Netherlands  international radio, that the readiness of the Armed Forces had  been destroyed over the last four years. There were also  various assassinations of YSP leaders, cadres, and members. It  was the other side which was driving the country into the  inferno of this destructive war. The only real loser would be  the Yemeni people.    He pointed out that the Yemeni people -- from one end of the  country to the other -- their brothers in the Arab homeland, and  their friends worldwide, demanded an immediate cessation to the  fighting, which was destroying the resources of Yemen, its  military establishment, and all the other facilities which they  had been building over the last thirty years.    Moreover, the war was inflicting a fatal wound to the body  of  national unity built four years ago. The brother member of the  Presidential Council said that the ideal option of imposing  unity could not be effected without conviction. People should  come to unity voluntarily, not by force, by the pounding of  villages and towns, or by genocide. He demanded an immediate  end to the fighting and the beginning of a dialogue. All issues  should be tabled for discussion. By these means we can arrive  at solutions satisfactory to the Yemeni people, their brothers,  and their friends.</p>

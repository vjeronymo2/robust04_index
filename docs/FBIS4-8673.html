			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by J.B.L.: "Deputies' Initiative Causes a </F> Coalition-Belvedere War; Constitutional Blackmail"]    [Text] After the statement was issued that the deputies of  the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance  [SLD] want to amend the Small Constitution, Lech Walesa stated  that if the coalition attempted to restrict his powers, he would  dissolve the Sejm "in the interest of the role of the president  which he must fulfill in the state." He stressed that he would  do this even if he were to be brought before the State Tribunal.    Since the information that 16 PSL and SLD deputies proposed  amendments on 15 April to the Small Constitution (the  possibility of rejecting a presidential veto in personnel issues  and prolonging the period of the Sejm's functioning from the  moment it is dissolved until a new parliament begins working)  was released, the politicians of the coalition have been saying  that they do not want a war with the Belvedere. Such statements  were made both by Jozef Oleksy, who said that meetings and talks  should be held, and Michal Strak, who commented on this issue as  the only PSL politician ("The coalition did not and does not  want a war with the president"). They also recall that for the  time being it is only an initiative launched by a group of  deputies and within a week the clubs will take a stance on it.  Speaker Oleksy said that the amendment bill might be discussed  by the Sejm at the beginning of May at the soonest. Some (Marek  Borowski, for instance) believe that it is the president, not  the coalition, that is heading for a conflict, and they point to  the fact that it is because of him that the government has not  had a deputy prime minister and finance minister for a few  months now.    The coalition representatives recall that Lech Walesa  himself  started speaking about changes in the Small Constitution -- he  discussed changing the status of the National Security Council  and of the Constitutional Tribunal. They also claim (Jozef  Oleksy and Michal Strak, for instance) that they do not want to  restrict the president's powers, because he still may or may not  sign nominations. A novelty would be only the possibility of  rejecting this veto in a parliamentary ballot, which would  eliminate a situation in which "a paralysis of the political  system is a fact." (Jerzy Jaskiernia)    In a television program "Minor Skirmishes" on Sunday,  Aleksander Kwasniewski said that in a dispute between the  president and the prime minister the Sejm should fulfill the  role of an arbiter. Lech Falandysz pointed out, however, that  it would be a judge in its own case because the Sejm is  dominated by the coalition which has formed this government; he  stated in addition that the next step of the coalition would be  nominating its own ministers in the presidential ministries.  Kwasniewski said that these suspicions were too great. He also  stated that the coalition would collect two-thirds of votes  necessary to pass amendments to the Constitution.    Coalition politicians (M. Strak, Z.Siemiatkowski, A.  Kwasniewski) are not concealing the fact that the direct reason  for the deputies' initiative is the deadlock that developed  after Lech Walesa rejected the candidacy of Dariusz Rosati.    The president cannot dissolve the Sejm because the deputies  want to amend the Small Constitution, claim SLD politicians.  The same opinions are voiced by Constitutional Professors Piotr  Winczorek and Stanislaw Gebethner; they recall that the Sejm has  established the government and passed the budget; therefore,  there is no reason why it should be dissolved.    It is not clear what the behavior of the other deputies'  clubs would be if there were a ballot on the amendments to the  Small Constitution. The opinions of politicians of the Labor  Union and the Democratic Union [UD] are not unequivocal. Even  though Ryszard Bugaj believes that the president's powers should  be thought over, he is against any changes in the Constitution  only because the coalition is going through problems. His party  colleague Janusz Szymanski is of the opinion that amending the  Constitution is a necessary step because when the Small  Constitution was being drafted, the authors counted on  activities in good faith and in conformity with the law, which  is not always the case.    Tadeusz Mazowiecki of UD believes that the proposal on  amending the Constitution (which the parliament is entitled to  do) should not be a reason to threaten to dissolve it; however,  according to Jan Litynski (UD) the war with the president was  started by the coalition -- when it tried to restrict his  powers. UD will not take part in this dispute.</p>

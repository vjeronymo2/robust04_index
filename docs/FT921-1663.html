			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Secretaries 'often used as glorified typists' MANY secretaries feel trapped in their jobs and are still treated as glorified typists in spite of their 'amazing mix of skills,' according to the Industrial Society. Managers were wasting their companies' money by failing to delegate properly to their secretaries, the society, an independent organisation that promotes good industrial relations, said before publishing a survey of more than 500 secretaries and 300 managers. According to the survey more than 40 per cent of bosses see typing as the first priority in a secretary's job. The society commented that the difference between a typist and a secretary needed to be defined in many organisations. This would help to 'eliminate the frustrations caused by under-use' of secretaries' abilities and training. Companies could also save money by employing typists instead of secretaries to process text. The survey indicates that a boss's ideal secretary shows initiative and is accurate, but is not assertive and probably does not display a sense of humour. Asked which attributes they rated most in secretaries, managers put initiative top, followed by accuracy and confidentiality. Low ratings were received for flexibility, confidence, knowledge and tact. Bottom of the list of desired qualities came a sense of humour and assertiveness. The society said it was difficult to see how a secretary could show initiative without having knowledge. Furthermore, confidence was essential if secretaries were to do many of the jobs bosses wanted. The jobs secretaries perform have changed significantly since 1987, when the society last carried out a similar survey. Today's secretaries are likely to spend less time arranging travel and meetings. Secretaries. Industrial Society, 3 Carlton House Terrace, London SW1Y 5DG. Pounds 15.</p>

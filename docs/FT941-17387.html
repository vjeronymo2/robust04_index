			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Kabul battles rage again Infantry battles raged for a fourth day in Kabul yesterday, killing dozens of people and injuring over 1,700, in a power struggle between Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and an ex-communist general, Reuter reports from Kabul. Government jets bombed fighters loyal to warlord Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum while Mr Rabbani's infantry made advances, pushing back the front line in the south of the city. Fighting spread in the north around Gen Dostum's base of Mazar-i-Sharif, capital of Balkh province, in the battle for supremacy between the president and Gen Dostum, backed by Mr Rabbani's arch-enemy, Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. The Iranian embassy has meanwhile offered to negotiate a peace settlement.</p>

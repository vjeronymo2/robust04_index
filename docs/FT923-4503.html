			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / EMS faces fresh test of credibility: Doubts emerge over effectiveness of efforts by EC to stabilise financial markets THE European Monetary System faces a new test of credibility this week following the strongest reaffirmation to date of existing exchange rates by European Community governments. Doubts surfaced yesterday as to whether the latest effort by EC finance ministers to buttress the EMS and calm financial markets would be effective after Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, appeared unconcerned over the outcome of informal weekend talks in Bath. The discussions among ministers and central bankers, dominated by recent currency turmoil and growing signs of weaker EC economic activity, secured a pledge from the Bundesbank that it would not increase its interest rates 'in present circumstances'. However, Mr Schlesinger, speaking yesterday on BBC radio, declined to give explicit support to a statement issued by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that the EMS countries would not realign their currencies. Mr Lamont, as chairman of the meeting, announced that the ministers had decided to: Reaffirm their August 28 agreement not to realign the EMS currencies in the exchange rate mechanism. Intervene if needed in exchange markets, 'exploiting as fully as necessary the means and instruments' provided under the EMS. Emphasise the importance of EC member states implementing economic policies to curb budget deficits and inflation. Take advantage of any opportunity to reduce interest rates. Speaking on Saturday after nine hours of hard bargaining, including concerted pressure on Germany to cut interest rates, Mr Lamont said he hoped that the Bundesbank's promise would contribute to stability on exchange markets. Officials believe it could change expectations in financial markets by making clear that the next move in German rates would be downwards. But Mr Lamont made clear that Britain would raise its interest rates if necessary to safeguard ster-ling. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said all countries agreed that they should move to lower interest rates. 'That's a great novelty,' he said. He stressed that EC central bankers, who are in Basle today and tomorrow for regular monthly meetings at the Bank for International Settlements, have 'immense means' to steady currencies. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, said: 'We are betting that the results of the meeting will give enough confidence to markets to re-establish stability.' On the BBC's World This Weekend yesterday, Mr Schlesinger appeared to cast doubt on his commitment to ruling out a realignment of currencies in the European ERM. He said the question went to his heart and the answer was therefore something which he would not make public. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of Global Currency Research at UBS, the Swiss bank, said: 'Not enough has been done.' He added that European central banks would have to be prepared to sell Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.5bn) or Dollars 10bn-worth of D-Marks a day for one or two days to convince the markets that they were serious about stabilising currencies. Mr Gerry Holtham, chief international economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said the Bath talks were 'not likely to dissipate the feeling that the Bundesbank is not prepared to modify its policies for international reasons.'

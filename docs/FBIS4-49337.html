			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng Speaks on China's Consistent </F> Implementation of the `One Country, Two Systems' Policy; Views  Solution to the New Airport Issue"]    [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY Hong Kong Branch, yesterday said that there have been  some contacts recently between China and Britain on the new  airport issue. Some views are getting closer but it is hard to  say if a final agreement can be reached, he added. In addition,  he pointed out that China has never changed in implementing the  "one country, two systems" policy; "one country, two systems" is  a Chinese Government affair and China's policy and has nothing  to do with the British side.    Zhang Junsheng made these remarks when asked by a reporter  during a seminar to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the May  4th Movement yesterday.    Zhang Junsheng said: How will the specific problems  concerning the new airport be resolved? We will know this after  the Provisional Airport Authority holds a meeting. But we can  say that there have been some contacts recently between China  and Britain on questions concerning the airport. Some views are  getting closer to each other but it is still unclear if a final  agreement can be reached. In other words, it is still unclear  whether or not the program proposed by the British side will  completely correspond with the Memorandum of Understanding on  the new airport.    One reporter asked: "During a Legislative Council meeting,  some legislative councilors raised a suggestion urging the  Chinese and British Governments to earnestly implement the 'one  country, two systems' policy. What is your opinion on this?"    Zhang Junsheng answered: "One country, two systems" is a  policy proposed by the Chinese Government to resolve the Hong  Kong issue; the principles and policies contained in the Joint  Declaration and the Basic Law have very explicitly established  "one country, two systems."    He continued: "On China's part, the implementation of the  'one country, two systems' policy has never been a problem. It  has been nine years since the formal signing of the Joint  Declaration and our principles and policies on Hong Kong have  been arranged in accordance with the 'one country, two systems'  formula. 'One country, two systems' is an affair of the Chinese  Government affair and China's policy. How can the British  exercise `one country, two systems'?"</p>

Chen told people  around him that his legs are all right and he can walk now, so  he would like to visit Shenzhen to have a look.    Chen Yun has been in very bad health over the past few  years,  and many people believed that he would not last long. It is  really surprising that this old man has been getting stronger,  and his health has been improving although he is getting older  in age. This is really exceptional for a man over 80.    Chen Yun has never visited Shenzhen. There has been some  speculation that he disagreed with the idea of running special  economic zones. If the hearsay about his visit is true, then  his Shenzhen tour should be a gesture to show his support for  Shenzhen's efforts in building the special economic zone.    Chen Yun is a Shanghai native. When he was young he was a  typesetter at the Shanghai Commercial Press. Speaking with a  heavy Shanghai accent, Chen Yun is regarded as the CPC's chief  financial and economic expert. He used to be ranked fifth among  other leaders within the CPC. Before the Cultural Revolution,  CPC leaders were ranked in this order in terms of their  standing: Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Chen  Yun. Lin Biao and Deng Xiaoping were only ranked immediately  after them. In the CPC political arena, where seniority is a  great asset, Chen Yun enjoys very high prestige, and that is why  Deng Xiaoping has to give much consideration to Chen's opinions.    Given the present political climate in China, if Deng died  it  would be almost certain that Chen would take his place.    Therefore, attention should be paid to Chen's move.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GEBHARD AMONG TOP PADRE GM CANDIDATES  </P> <P> Bob Gebhard, vice president/player personnel of the Minnesota Twins, has been  established as one of the leading candidates to fill the Padres' vacant general  manager position, sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Gebhard, 46, is being interviewed a second time by the Padres in San Francisco,  and was in attendance Tuesday night during the Padres' 3-1 loss to the San  Francisco Giants at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> It's unknown who is conducting the interviews in San Francisco, but Gebhard  told two people that he has been interviewing the past two days. Keith Matson,  one of the general partners, is the only Padre owner who has attended the past  two games, according to Padre officials. Yet, it's possible that other owners  took flights to San Francisco and left before the games.  </P> <P> Gebhard and Dan Duquette, assistant general manager of the Montreal Expos, are  believed to be only the candidates who have twice been interviewed by the  Padres. Gehbard also was interviewed about 2 1/2 weeks ago in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The other candidates who have been interviewed once, according to sources  within and outside the Padre organization, are: Gordon Ash, assistant general  manager of the Toronto Blue Jays; Roger Jongewaard, vice president/scouting and  player development of the Seattle Mariners; and Walt Jocketty, director of  baseball administration of the Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Gebhard, according to several baseball administrators outside the Padre  organization, is the most experienced and perhaps most viable of the candidates  interviewed. A former major league pitcher and pitching coach with the Twins,  Gehbard has been a minor league coordinator, and director of minor league  operations since joining the Twins front-office in November, 1986.  </P> <P> "Cripes, who could be better qualified than Geb?" said Andy MacPhail, Twins  executive vice president/baseball. "It'd be a huge blow to us, but there comes  a time when you know a guy's ready, and I'm telling you, he's ready.  </P> <P> "He's got the ideal background and qualifications for the job, and I'm sure  that's why the Padres are so interested."  </P> <P> In another development Tuesday, right fielder Danny Tartabull of the Kansas  City Royals revealed in a telephone interview that he has requested a trade to  the Padres, Angels or Dodgers.  </P> <P> Tartabull, 27, said Tuesday that he informed Royal General Manager John  Schuerholz of his request two months ago. Dennis Gilbert, Tartabull's agent,  confirmed that he telephoned Schuerhholz, telling him that Tartabull is unhappy  in Kansas City, and will leave as a free agent at the end of the 1991 season if  he is not traded. He also said that the only three teams with which Tartabull  is willing to sign a long-term contract are the three Southern California  teams.  </P> <P> "I'd be the happiest kid in the world if I got traded to San Diego," said  Tartabull, who lives in Malibu in the off-season. "They know I want out of  here, and they know I want to be in San Diego. That'd be ideal for me.  </P> <P> "I know (Padre Manager) Greg Riddoch from my days in Cincinnati, and I'd really  love to play for that guy. It's also a thing where I like the guys on the team  there, I love the ballpark, and I'd be close to home.  </P> <P> "Reggie (Jackson) was talking to me the other day, saying how he's pushing the  Angels to trade for me, which would be nice too. But San Diego, that's my first  choice."  </P> <P> Tartabull, who has been hampered by groin and calf injuries this season, is  hitting .300 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in just 300 at-bats. Jack McKeon, who  was fired Saturday as Padre vice president/baseball operations, attempted  several times in the past three seasons to trade for him, including once this  summer, but failed.  </P> <P> It's unlikely that the Padres will have any trade discussions with the Royals  until they have a general manager in place, but when asked about Tartabull,  Riddoch said: "You'd be crazy not to want a player like that. You just don't  know what it would take to get him."  </P> <P> As for the game Tuesday, well, let's just say the most exciting aspect was the  earthquake that occurred in the fifth inning, registering 3.3 on the richter  scale, and knocking out a bank of lights at Candlestick.  </P> <P> And the loudest ovation generated by the crowd of 10,195, was in response to  the scoreboard notification that the Oakland Athletics had clinched the  American League West title, drawing a loud mixture of boos and cheers.  </P> <P> Otherwise, the Padres lost their seventh consecutive game, with Andy Benes  (10-10) surrendering home runs to rookies Steve Decker, his second, and Mike  Benjamin, his third. Mark Dewey, pitching in relief of Rick Reuschel, won his  first major league game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> The most difficult aspect of Manager Greg Riddoch's daily routine? Just finding  warm players to fill out a lineup. The Padres played Tuesday's game without the  services of third baseman/outfielder Bip Roberts (sore knees), outfielder Fred  Lynn (pulled groin), second baseman Roberto Alomar (strained left elbow) and  outfielder Tony Gwynn (fractured finger), leaving them with 23 able-bodied  players. "It's a skeleton crew right now," Riddoch said. "I wish we had called  up a few more guys from Triple-A. That'll change next year, let me tell you." .  . . One player who was ruled out, but has made a dramatic comeback, is catcher  Tom Lampkin. Lampkin was declared to be out for the season in August when he  suffered strained ligaments in his right thumb, requiring a cast. But the cast  has come off, rehabiliation began, and there he was Tuesday, taking batting  practice, and grounding out to third in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter.  Lampkin is scheduled to even start a game in Cincinnati. "I feel pretty good,  actually," Lampkin said. "I thought I could play maybe a week ago, but the  doctors just gave me clearance today. I'm ready when they're ready." . . . Lynn  said he initially sustained his injury Monday while running in the outfield,  which is torn apart because of Sunday's football game. "It's right there with  the worst conditions I've played on," he said. "When you have sod just thrown  on dirt out there, you're asking for trouble." . . . Giant left fielder Kevin  Mitchell was kept out of the lineup because of extreme pain in his right wrist,  and said Tuesday that he will have surgery once the season ends. "This is just  killing me," said Mitchell, who's in a five-for-38 slump. . . . Giant pitcher  Steve Bedrosian, who has endured a season while his three-year-old son has been  undergoing treatment for leukemia, was selected by his teammates Tuesday as  winner of the Willie Mac Award, signifying him as the Giants' most  inspirational player. Bedrosian, 32, received the plaque from Willie McCovey,  the Giants Hall of Famer, in pre-game ceremonies . . . The Padres will play the  final game of their three-game series against the Giants at 12:35 p.m. today.  Dennis Rasmussen (11-14) and Don Robinson (10-7) are the scheduled starters.  </P></p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Survey of Kansai (1): A beautiful window of diverse pieces - Deregulation, infrastructural developments and its own resourcefulness all contribute to the region's confidence that it can at last compete with Japan's national capital In a recent television advertisement, aired in western Japan, demons that bring poverty in national folklore were shown dressed in rags, stalking the grounds of Osaka castle. On hearing of the convenient new Kansai International Airport, they decide to take advantage of its opening to fly east to Tokyo. The joke, at the expense of the Japanese capital, captures the current mood in Kansai, the region made up of the six prefectures of Osaka, Hyogo, Kyoto, Nara, Wakayama and Shiga that span the western stretch of Japan's main island of Honshu, between the scenic Lake Biwa on the east and the Chugoku mountain range on the west. After years of trying to catch up and compete with Tokyo, and of suffering unflattering comparisons with its more cosmopolitan rival as a result, Kansai has recently begun to feel a greater confidence in what it has to offer as an alternative to the capital. 'The advantage of being in Kansai is that you are less disrupted by political noise,' says Mr Tsuzo Murase, executive vice-president of Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics group, which has its headquarters in Osaka. Businessmen point to the greater openness of Kansai people to new ideas, compared with Tokyo, their ability to make quick decisions and their talent for spotting new business opportunities, as evidence that the region is better suited to the more competitive business environment in the 1990s. Confidence in the region is such that the 21st century is being hailed as the era of Kansai, as opposed to Tokyo. What will make Kansai so special in the years ahead, according to its proponents, is the different opportunities the region offers from Tokyo. For one thing, its relative proximity to the Asian continent and the large number of non-Japanese Asian visitors it receives each year, gives Kansai a better chance than Tokyo of capitalising on the huge potential for growth that the continent holds. The recent momentum behind deregulation in Japan also offers hope that, as the central bureaucracy in Tokyo is forced to loosen its tight hold on economic life, Kansai - birthplace of many unique new businesses, ranging from karaoke and sushi served on conveyor belts to capsule hotels - will be better able to capitalise on its gift for coming up with enterprising ideas. Even the diversity and traditional lack of cohesiveness of the Kansai region  -a curious collection of six prefectures, each with its own distinct cultural and historical identity, which seem to have little in common except their proximity to each other - is beginning to be appreciated as a source of the region's vitality. Mr Masafumi Onishi, chairman of the Osaka chamber of commerce and industry, and of Osaka Gas, likens Kansai to a stained-glass window in which very different parts make up a beautiful whole. But the infectious optimism that pervades the Kansai establishment stems also from a conviction that, with the recent completion of a range of ambitious infrastructural projects, the region is finally coming into its own. For the first time in many years, Kansai people feel they have everything that their compatriots in Tokyo have. From this month, the region will have the impressive new international airport that is slated to offer Japan's first 24-hour air terminal services, and which will be a hub for domestic flights. Osaka Bay, along which lie some of the region's most vibrant cities, such as Osaka itself and Kobe, a famous port, is now the proud home of no fewer than three man-made islands, one of which is the site of the new airport. The narrow corridor of sea that separates the city of Akashi, in Hyogo prefecture, from Awaji island will soon be spanned by a spectacular suspension bridge that, it is claimed, will be the longest in the world. And further south, just off the coast of Wakayama prefecture, another artificial island has been built to accommodate Japan's biggest marina. On land, a vast science, culture and art centre, covering 15,000 hectares in the three prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka and Nara, is taking shape; while the skylines of principal cities in the region have been transformed by the high-rise office buildings and expansive business parks, such as the Osaka business park near the Osaka castle, that have been built in recent years. This frantic investment in infrastructure, which is costing the regional economy dearly, was Kansai's response to a sense of crisis that gripped its economic leaders several years ago. Unless something was done to revitalise the region, they feared, its vitality could be sapped by the growing dominance of Tokyo and its neighbouring prefectures on the Kanto plains. Tokyo, the centre of Japan's political, economic and cultural life since the end of the war, seemed to have everything; while Kansai, which encompasses the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto as well as the merchants' city of Osaka and the port city of Kobe, has long been regarded as a region steeped in history and bubbling with creative ideas, but not quite able to claim the world-class stature of Tokyo. While Kansai's gross regional product is equal approximately to that of Canada, and is forecast to exceed that of the UK by the year 2000, there has been a strong feeling among the business community that the region's economic vitality has not received the recognition it deserves. Osaka, Kansai's economic powerhouse, boasts a stock exchange that is the fourth largest in the world by market capitalisation, global giants such as Matsushita, and the largest concentration of pharmaceuticals companies in the country. Its history as a merchant town has encouraged an entrepreneurial spirit and an openness to new ideas that is unknown in Tokyo; and it has created a distinct culture that gave birth to such national phenomena as Yoshimoto Kogyo, an entertainment company that has provided Japan with most of its famous comedians. Kyoto and Nara, two ancient capitals, are treasure-houses of traditional Japanese culture; while Kyoto is the home of many vibrant new businesses, ranging from the industrial ceramics leader Kyocera to Nintendo, the video games company. Kobe, a famous port renowned for its tender beef, is also a bustling commercial centre. Despite these accomplishments, Kansai has, for much of Japan's post-war history, felt that it has been forced to play second fiddle to Tokyo. Moreover, in recent years the increasing concentration of wealth and information in the capital has led many businesses that originated in Kansai to move their headquarters operations to Tokyo. Kansai's share of Japan's GNP fell from 18.2 per cent in 1980 to 17.2 per cent in 1990, according to the Centre for Revitalising Kansai Industry. Concern among Kansai business leaders about the deteriorating state of the economy had prompted a long period of collective angst, particularly in Osaka, as they jealously watched Tokyo reap what seemed an unequal share of the benefits and the glory of Japan's post-war economic miracle. However, the gradual completion of big infrastructural projects is raising hopes that the region now has the means to compete for both business and recognition. In the next few years, it will have the means to accommodate its expected growth in economic activity. The bigger immediate challenge is to show that, in the aftermath of a prolonged nationwide recession and a regional spending spree, it can still generate that activity.</p>

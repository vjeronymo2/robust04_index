			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / German optimism prompts concern The growing mood of optimism about Germany's economic recovery, fueled by senior ministers campaigning for re-election next month, is causing great concern in the country's business community. Industry fears that, in contrast to the gloomy British, Germans are falling for the 'feelgood factor' too fast. And that could mean that they ease up too soon on the process of drastic cost-cutting and restructuring needed to make German industry competitive once again. On the one hand, leaders of the main business lobbies are delighted at the turnaround in economic fortunes, which has raised the latest growth forecasts of the economics ministry to 2.5 per cent for this year, and 3 per cent in 1995.

'The structural crisis of German industry is not and was not simply a figment of the imagination, but a very real challenge.' The message from the BDI, reflecting similar fears at the German employers' federation (BDA), is clearly to cool it, election or not. But the other big national lobby for the business community, the German chambers of commerce and industry (DIHT), is altogether more sanguine. 'I have been accused of talking the economy up,' Mr Hans-Peter Stihl, the president of the DIHT, said yesterday. 'But the results of our surveys confirmed it.</p>

			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / US places bulk of new Lloyd's capital for 1995 US investors have provided the bulk of new capital committed to Lloyd's of London for next year, partly filling the hole left by exiting Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the insurance market. A total of Pounds 331m has been raised by companies for next year, in addition to Pounds 900m invested this year. More than half of the new money came from the US - in sharp contrast to when UK institutions provided most of the new Lloyd's capital. About 70 per cent of the investment for 1995 has come from the international insurance industry or specialist insurance investment funds. Many investors were put off by Lloyd's continuing difficulties - including outstanding litigation and enormous potential liabilities, particularly from US asbestosis and pollution claims. The poor share performance of listed corporate vehicles launched last year also acted as a deterrent. One US fund, which had pledged Pounds 50m, abandoned its plans at the last moment, apparently worried that Lloyd's was not changing quickly enough from a market that raised funds from individuals, on the basis of unlimited liability, to corporate capital. Swiss Bank Corporation was left with a substantial number of shares in Matheson Lloyd's Investment Trust, which it had agreed to underwrite. Where investors have committed funds for 1995, most have chosen 'dedicated' companies which invest only in syndicates run by one managing agency, unlike most of those who entered this year, which have spread funds across a wide range. Lloyd's four biggest investors in 1995 are: Insurance Partners, a Dollars 540m (Pounds 346.1m) US equity investment fund specialising in the insurance industry. Harvard Private Capital Group, which manages Dollars 1.4bn of private investments and is a subsidiary of the company running the Dollars 7bn endowment fund of Harvard University. Trident, a Bermuda-based company investing in insurance and reinsurance. It was formed a year ago by Marsh &amp; McLennan, the world's biggest insurance broker, JP Morgan, Mid Ocean, a Bermuda reinsurance company, and Byrne Sons, a small investment bank. Liberty Mutual, the big US mutual insurance company which has raised Pounds 40m to invest in a syndicate currently run by the Cater Allen managing agency.</p>

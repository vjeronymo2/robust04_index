			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lonrho and Gencor go for gold in the CIS Lonrho, the London-based international trading combine, and Gencor, the South African mining group, are setting up a joint company to develop gold mines in the former Soviet Union. Mr Joe Platts-Mills, a Lonrho director, said he expected the joint venture to identify within two years big reserves in the Commonwealth of Independent States, probably as much as 2,000 tonnes (64.3m troy ounces) The 50-50 joint venture would draw on his group's contacts in the CIS - developed over the past five years and not just in the mining sector - and its ability to work in unusual places and Gencor's mining know-how, including its Biox technology. This uses bacteria to break down refractory, or difficult, ores to release the gold locked inside instead of employing expensive heat and pressure vessels. Mr Platts-Mills said it was the policy of the former Soviet Union to leave refractory sulphide gold deposits untouched so the technology had a lot to offer the CIS, including the ability to treat ore with a high arsenic content and leave no harmful waste. Mr Adrian Coates of Warrior International, which advised Gencor on the deal, said the South African group concluded from visits to the CIS two years ago that there were many ore bodies there that would lend themselves to the Biox process. Gencor also believed it was several years ahead of its nearest rival in bacterial gold recovery and needed to put this advantage to good use. The obvious partner was Lonrho, which via its 45-per-cent-owned associate Ashanti Goldfields in Ghana was the largest commercial user of the technology and was already well-established in the CIS. Lonrho's access to the Biox technology was primarily responsible a year ago for it winning the right to develop a big gold mine in Uzbekistan, with two Uzbek government-owned companies. Discussions are well advanced with the Uzbek State Committee on Geology for the development of its Ingichki Research Establishment as a centre for the testing ores to see if they are amenable to the Biox process. Lonrho at present was engaged in 36 serious discussions about mining ventures in Uzbekistan, Russia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Kurdistan, said Mr Platts Mills. Most of the contacts were in Russia but the republic had so far not shown itself to be as open to doing deals as some of the central Asian republics.</p>

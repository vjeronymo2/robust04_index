			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Stark choice for white voters: Patti Waldmeir on doomsday threats in S Africa's referendum ARE YOU going to vote for a good future, or a good past? This is the question that over the next three weeks Mr Derek Christophers, a member of parliament for the ruling National party, will put to thousands of his constituents in the conservative Johannesburg suburb of Germiston. He will lunch them, dine them, visit them at home, to plead for their support in South Africa's March 17 referendum. His message is simple: 'Vote for us, or vote for war.' The referendum, the date for which was announced on Monday by President F W de Klerk, will face South Africa's whites with the biggest political choice they have ever been asked to make: whether to abandon their 350-year position of dominance in favour of sharing power with a black majority, or to fight for racial purity in a homeland which would become an international pariah. 'All the (opposition) Conservatives can offer people,' says Mr Christophers, who helped plan the National party's campaign, 'is a good past.' His party's message that a 'yes' vote would lead to a prosperous and secure future. As could be expected, the wording of the question favours the ruling party and is designed to be vague enough to win approval from all but the most committed white supremacist: 'Do you support continuation of the reform process which the State President began on 2nd February, 1990, and which is aimed at a new constitution through negotiation?' February 2, 1990, was the date on which Mr de Klerk legalised black political opposition. On the other hand, the proffered consequences of a 'no' vote are designed to concentrate the mind: Mr de Klerk would resign and call a general election, which the Conservatives would win on a pro-apartheid ticket. Black liberation groups would resume violent struggle, and international sanctions would be applied with a vengeance. Skilled whites would emigrate, international lending would stop, and South Africa's future would be bleaker than ever. Mr de Klerk is clearly hoping that the NP, liberals and everyone to the left of the most hard-line racist will turn out to avoid that outcome. But he knows that his support is based more on fear of the alternative than positive approval of his policies, which are too vague to inspire much confidence. He is, in effect, asking for a blank cheque to negotiate a power-sharing constitution, which amounts to black rule without black domination. While few whites - even in the ruling party - really believe he can achieve that, but the campaign could turn on Mr de Klerk's powers of persuasion as he is called on to defend his policies in detail for preventing domination. On the other hand, many whites will not want to pass up their last chance to keep blacks out of power, knowing they will be given no further opportunity to stop the reform process. If Mr de Klerk wins, he will implement a new constitution without seeking ratification. But the 'no' vote will be diluted by divisions on the right: the ultra-right Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement) has called for a boycott, and other radical groups could follow suit. Moreover, at the national level, every mass circulation daily in the country will push for a 'yes' vote. And though the state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corporation will probably guarantee equal air time for opponents and proponents, its political bias is likely to show through as clearly now as in the past: the SABC supports the ruling party. The Conservatives have a formidable political machine at local level, and are, according to Mr Christophers, 'all prepared to die for their party.' Yet, when the Conservatives launched their campaign yesterday with a live radio broadcast from leader Andries Treurnicht, the effect was far from scintillating. The lacklustre Mr Treurnicht referred several times to the possibility of defeat - he and other top party leaders are understood to have preferred a boycott, but their caucus insisted on a fight - and with his subdued delivery and outdated rhetoric he did little to inspire the troops. Indeed, the urbane and modern Mr de Klerk would win a straight personality contest hands-down. But the question facing South Africa's 3m white voters is more elemental than that: Afrikaners feel their language, their culture, their history are at risk; other whites fear economic penury. Mr de Klerk's performance may be more impressive, but Mr Treurnicht's message - that whites can only survive in a separate homeland loosely federated to neighbouring black states - strikes a powerful chord.</p>

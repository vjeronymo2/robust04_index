			<p>BFN     [Text] On 5 April, the government decided to seek the  international community's positive understanding once again of  Japan's position that it will maintain its "three nonnuclear  principles" [of not producing, possessing, and introducing  nuclear arms] in the future, and that Japan will never be armed  with nuclear weapons in any form. On the same day, the Monju  fast- breeder reactor, which produces plutonium, reached  "criticality." Under this situation, the government made the  aforementioned decision while taking into consideration the  possibility that the "concern over Japan becoming a nuclear  power," which lingers in connection with the suspicions over the  DPRK's (North Korea) nuclear weapons development program, may  crop up again. In concrete terms, the government intends to  make its appeals concerning Japan's position as the "only nation  in the world that has suffered atomic bombings" through various  opportunities such as summit meetings and the public relations  activities of embassies and legations abroad.    Last year, Japan's delayed decision to support the  indefinite  extension of the nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) created  speculation among European nations and the United States that  Japan "might intend to possess nuclear arms." This was the  origin of the prevailing view that Japan "will be armed with  nuclear weapons."    Moreover, in connection with North Korea's suspected nuclear  weapons development, Britain's SUNDAY TIMES newspaper reported  in January, "The British Ministry of Defense has completed a  secret report that says there is a possibility that Japan will  abandon its nonnuclear principles." In the United States,  Defense Secretary (then Deputy Secretary) William Perry  testified at a public hearing of the Senate Armed Services  Committee in February, "If North Korea succeeds in producing  nuclear weapons, the possibility that Japan, Taiwan, and South  Korea will seek to possess nuclear arms will increase greatly."  In this way, there have been statements pointing out the fear  that Japan will arm itself with nuclear weapons.</p>

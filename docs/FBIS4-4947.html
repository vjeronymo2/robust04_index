			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP from New York] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 4 April [New York time] that,  regarding the North Korean nuclear issue, North Korean Foreign  Minsiter Kim Yong-nam threatened in his letter to UN  Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that "a war may take place  again on the Korean peninsula."    In his letter dated 23 March, which was opened to the public  by the United Nations on 4 April, Minister Kim threatened that  the Korean peninsula would again face such unfortunate history  as that of the 1950's if the UN Security Council yields to U.S.  insistence on adopting a resolution unfavorable to North Korea.  In the letter, Minister Kim also said that North Korea would  resume its peaceful nuclear activities and warned that it is  possible for North Korea to adhere to its decision to withdraw  from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which was made last  year.    In March, when the International Atomic Energy Agency  inspection team reported that the recent inspection of North  Korean nuclear facilities was insufficient, the United States  asked member nations of the UN Security Council [UNSC] to adopt  a UNSC resolution urging North Korea to allow additional  inspections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian </F> Liberal-Democratic Party, by Maria Graczyk; place and date not  given: "The Remnants of the Empire"]    [Text] [Graczyk] You support the idea of a Russian-German  border. Across Poland?    [Zhirinovskiy] In Europe, we are mostly interested in good  relations with Germany, and it is in this context that one  should address the Polish question. However, we do not want to  interfere in Poland's internal affairs. Even if Poland wants to  join NATO, that is an internal matter for Poland and NATO.    The creation of a new world order is a long process. Europe  is currently experiencing a stage of profound destruction.  After all, the Soviet Union has collapsed, and it would be hard  to expect its remnants not to hit the neighboring countries.  Poland has never had a permanent border. It has possessed  various shapes at various times of history, and there was a  period when it was divided and formed part of Russia, among  other countries. Until recently, the Russian forces guaranteed  the Polish border. Today, in this matter, one should turn to  NATO and Germany, which play the greatest part in this section  of the continent. For the time being, the Poles can carry on  singing "Poland has not perished yet."    [Graczyk] What would change in Russia if you became prime  minister?    [Zhirinovskiy] There will be a better economy, a strong  state, and better guaranteed rights for all Russians, wherever  they live. Is that too little?    [Graczyk] During the election campaign, you promised you  would double the standard of living of your countrymen. How?    [Zhirinovskiy] We will do this without any help from  outside. Until now, the so-called help from the West has caused  us more harm than good. Russia has been exploited materially  and intellectually. Let them leave us alone, and we will  reestablish Russian power. As prime minister I would make three  basic decisions -- an end to all financial help for foreign  countries, an end to the conversion of the weapons industry to  civilian production, and a sharp struggle against crime.    The adherence to the arms embargo on the Middle East, for  example, is costing us many billions of dollars. Russia could  earn about $50 billion a year from weapons exports. After six  months, not only would people's standard of living increase, but  also their security. I would also bring more militiamen and  soldiers out onto the streets.    [Graczyk] That smells of totalitarianism.    [Zhirinovskiy] The state should not have been allowed to  disintegrate! The Soviet Union might still exist today; one  should have provided greater independence and divided the  country into provinces. Such a variant should also have been  suggested to the Asian and Caucasian regions, plus Belarus,  Ukraine, and the Baltic countries. Then they would have  realized the advantages to be gained from living within one  large state in which all the principles of freedom -- cultural  and economic freedom-- are respected. Look what is happening  right now. Entire settlements are burning, towns are being  bombed, people are perishing.    [Graczyk] Is the return of the USSR still possible?    [Zhirinovskiy] Yes, in a territorial sense. But the law,  ideology, and government will be different. The territory of  the former USSR could become the territory of a reborn Russia.  That will only be possible when a new democratically oriented  authority appears in the Kremlin, one that will work out a model  of a strong state. A reborn and strengthened army is required  for this purpose, together with a nuclear potential that must be  improved so that our possible adversaries know that we are  prepared to use it. Therefore we will develop our nuclear  weapons, create a base in space, and from there we will defend  Russia if the need arises. The ideal scenario calls for the  existence of a Russo-Swedish and Russo-German border, and a  border with China and India in the south.    [Graczyk] How can one describe the present situation in  Russia? Is it democracy, yet another "disturbance" [smuta], or  perhaps something else?    [Zhirinovskiy] I would call it a political cocktail, because  it contains obvious signs of chaos and anarchy from the time of  the Great Disturbance, but also the beginnings of democracy,  fascism, and nationalism. Also possible are potential sources  of future religious wars and conflicts caused by the clash  between two worlds -- the Christian one and the Muslim one.    As a lawyer and expert on human rights, I am an advocate of  democracy, but I do not think democracy is the right medicine  for the state's diseased organism. The only panacea is strong  authority. Only after the organism of the state has recovered  from the crisis and the economy has healed will it be possible  to switch over to a democratic system.    [Graczyk] The communists also promised that democracy would  occur after the period of proletarian dictatorship.    [Zhirinovskiy] That was their mistake. I am opposed to an  ideological state.    [Graczyk] Then why do they call you a fascist?    [Zhirinovskiy] The disease of destruction is very far  advanced in Russia, and the economic crisis has assumed a  particularly acute form. That is why it is essential to apply  drastic measures. Only through fear can one enforce an end to  the civil war, stop the disintegration of the army, and stem the  tide of emigres. Economic structures must be made operational  again. One must reestablish the old links between work places,  factories, and kolkhozes. First we must heal Russia and lift it  off its knees.    [Graczyk] Do you think the Russians expressed their  weariness of democracy by voting for you?    [Zhirinovskiy] They have never lived under democracy! By  voting for me, they have opted for democracy and entrusted me  with it. Democracy is in the right hands now.    [Graczyk] But how can one introduce democracy to a country  that has never had it? First there was the Czarist empire, and  then the Bolsheviks came.    [Zhirinovskiy] The shift to democracy must be suitably  prepared. Democracy needs an economic base, political parties  need varied social strata, and the Army needs an objective and  specific conditions. What is needed today, however, is a  freeze, a political diet. One must not sow seed in a fallow  field -- a tractor has to go over it first. We need a strong  authority.    [Graczyk] Boris Yeltsin's spokesman said recently that he  does not rule out the possibility of cooperation with you.  Under what conditions would it be possible?    [Zhirinovskiy] I am ready to do anything for the good of  Russia. We will cooperate with our president any way he wants.  Together with my staff I am preparing a program that we will  submit to the president soon. I hope that on parliament's first  sitting on 11 January, President Yeltsin will entrust mew with  the task of forming a government. But if he appoints someone  else, I will accept that. We will not even be offended if we do  not obtain any ministerial post. Time is working to our  advantage.    [Graczyk] Until recently you were critical of Boris Yeltsin.  You even called him your worst enemy. And now you want to  cooperate with him.    [Zhirinovskiy] I respect the will of the voters who voted  for him. But I have no doubt that I will win the next  presidential election. Neither the so-called democratic camp  nor the communists will stand a chance. That is a pity, because  I am accustomed to a sharp struggle. I am sad that the victory  will be so easy.</p>

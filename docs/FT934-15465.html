			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / ITV complains over football ban THE ITV Association has lodged a formal complaint with the European Commission against a rule allowing the football associations of Europe to ban at short notice the televising of games. The latest version of the rule adopted by Uefa, the Union of European Football Associations, would prevent ITV broadcasting The Match - live First Division games on Sundays. To protect attendances at live football matches, Uefa is trying to impose a ban on live televised games between noon and 4pm (UK time) at weekends. This would prevent ITV screening The Match, as kick-off is usually at 3pm. ITV executives believe British Sky Broadcasting (in which Pearson, owner of the FT, has a stake) could avoid the ban as its coverage usually starts at 4pm, when their Sunday Premier League games kick off. Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, has written to Mr Karel Van Miert, EC commissioner for competition policy, arguing that the Uefa rule is contrary to the Treaty of Rome. The ITV companies have also referred the new version of Uefa's article 14 to the Office of Fair Trading. Last year the Commission issued a Statement of Objections to Uefa saying that article 14 was illegal, although ITV pleas for interim measures to be taken against the football organisation pending a full decision were rejected. The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the new article 14. But it has in recent months been emphasising the negative impact live transmissions can have on attendance. ITV wants the Commission to declare article 14 inapplicable and unlawful under Community law. It believes it has an adverse effect on broadcasters throughout Europe, and on the sport. The broadcasters argue that they often have to buy rights to televise games years ahead yet transmission can be stopped at short notice on the grounds that a single local professional match is being played at the same time.</p>

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Volatility attributed to options expiry INACTION was expected from the Bundesbank, but the pending expiry of options brought volatility to the German and Swiss equity markets, while France saw a couple of weak profits forecasts, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT rose fractionally on the session but dropped later, after the Bundesbank kept interest rates unchanged and in advance of the expiry of DTB options contracts this morning. The DAX index, up 2.73 to 1,692.29 at the official close, was indicated 10 points lower on the Ibis screen-based trading system after hours. Earlier, a gentle downtrend in most banks, and in Siemens, was offset by strength in carmakers after Daimler's finance director forecast doubled net profits in 1994 following a drop of a third in 1993. In London, brokers James Capel, bearish of the shares, estimated that this put them on a 1992 p/e of 60.7 falling to 37.9 in 1994; more bullish, Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities put the ratios at 60.2, and 24.0 respectively. Daimler moved from a rise of DM7.10 at the close to finish DM3.60 better at DM606 after hours, said Mr Nigel Longley at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, and other carmakers eased accordingly. Siemens was down DM5.70 to DM614.50 in the post bourse, and Deutsche Bank DM5.90 lower at DM692.10. Turnover fell from DM6.2bn to DM5.4bn. Mr Longley noted that the DTB DAX contracts expiry will be measured on the first quoted DAX index of today, and forecast an interesting morning. MILAN was encouraged on news, which came out after Wednesday's close, that Ferruzzi creditor banks had agreed to support the group during its restructuring process. The Comit index closed up 13.95 or 2.75 per cent at 521.96. Ferruzzi and Montedison shares recovered by 14 per cent and 13 per cent respectively, rising L68.00 to L562.80 and by L96 to L846. Commenting on the announcement, one analyst in Milan said that the banks would have a much bigger influence on the group than hitherto, with the Ferruzzi family's responsibilities cut back. An early sale of Fondiaria is to be expected, he said. Among the banks, Mediobanca gained L500 to L15,200 and rose further to L15,375 on the kerb; BCI rose L191 to L5,090 and Credito Italiano by L160 to L2,690. There was strong activity in Fiat, up L330 at L5,720, on a variety of rumours, while the telecoms stocks, strong in recent weeks, eased, Stet losing L85 to L3,180. ZURICH advanced by 1.3 per cent, the SMI index closing 29.1 higher at 2,323.1, a tenth of a point below its all-time high. Nestle, and Roche certificates surged in active late trade. gaining SFr17 to SFr1,123, and SFr110 to SFr4,830 respectively. Dealers said that the late upturn could be related to tomorrow's expiry of contracts on the Soffex options and futures exchange. PARIS came off the day's high but just held the 1,900 level, the CAC-40 index ending 18.50 lower at 1,900.31. Turnover also slipped, to FFr2.8bn from Wednesday's FFr3.3bn. Havas featured with a fall of FFr11.40 to FFr414.10 after Mr Pierre Dauzier, the chairman, downgraded 1993 profit forecasts and warned, in addition, that 1994 may not bring much relief. Further evidence of the worsening economic picture was given by St Gobain, off FFr12.10 to FFr476.70. In a letter to shareholders, the group forecast a bad first half, said that 1993 will be even worse than 1992, and warned that further job cuts might be necessary. Docks de France built on Wednesday's gains following news of an acquisition, rising FFr17 to FFr498. ISTANBUL put on another 2.7 per cent as coalition talks between the True Path party and the Populist Party made progress. The market index gained 261.8 to 9,921.97 in turnover estimated at TL1,000bn. TEL AVIV dropped after two days of gains on renewed fears of a tax on stock market profits. The Mishtanim index lost 3.9 to 200.28. Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said on Tuesday that there would be no capital gains tax imposed on stock profits in the near future; but an influential Israeli newspaper reported yesterday that the finance ministry was still considering this option.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices June 17 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1184.33  1185.33   1184.92  1184.64 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1237.91  1238.64   1238.28  1240.87                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1184.94  1185.07   1183.01  1182.69 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1240.36  1239.09   1238.11  1238.06  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jun 16    Jun 15    Jun 14   June 11   June 10 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1181.17   1173.17   1181.59   1181.85   1181.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1236.97   1229.86   1234.83   1232.37   1230.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1186.48; 200 - 1242.20 Low/day: 100 - 1182.54 200 - 1236.16.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 21 KYODO -- A pro-Seoul Korean  residents' organization in Japan said Thursday [21 April] it has  changed its official Japanese name to delete any suggestion that  members are only temporary residents of Japan.    The Korean Residents Union in Japan (Mindan) said  Wednesday's  regular assembly has decided to drop the word "kyoryu," or  "temporary stay," from its title since the Japanese word  suggests that they are only in Japan for a short time or  temporarily. "We want to make clear our intention that we are  permanent residents of Japan, so the characters for `kyoryu,'  which were a part of our name until today, were deleted,"  newly-elected Mindan Chairman Shin Yong-sang, 69, said at a  press meeting Wednesday following the assembly.    Mindan's Information Office said Thursday that it had not  yet  considered whether the official English name of the group would  be changed.    Shin also said that while Korean residents of Japan pay  taxes, they have no political rights, adding "our rights and  responsibilities are not equal." He added that for the sake of  Japan's internationalization, Mindan planned to campaign  extensively in favor of Japan's foreign residents being given  the right to vote.    Many of Mindan's 450,000 members were born and raised in  Japan but are still considered foreign residents.    At the end of World War II, there were an estimated two  million Koreans in Japan, most forcibly brought in during the  1910 to 1945 colonial period to labor in factories and mines.    Although many were later repatriated, others stayed on and  today some 700,000 Koreans, including descendants of those  forcibly brought in, currently live in Japan.</p>

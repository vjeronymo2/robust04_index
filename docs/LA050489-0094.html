			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH PLEADS GUILTY TO FATALLY STABBING MAN  </P> <P> A Pacoima teen-ager who stabbed a man to death before stealing his truck  pleaded guilty Wednesday in San Fernando Superior Court to second-degree  murder.  </P> <P> Keasuc Napolean Hill, 18, had been charged with first-degree murder and one  count of robbery in the April 16, 1988, slaying of James Zoldseth of Sun  Valley. But those charges will be dismissed in exchange for his plea to the  lesser charge, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Edward Nison.  </P> <P> Hill, who was 17 at the time of the killing, remains in custody without bail at  Sylmar Juvenile Hall and was ordered to return to court on May 26 for  sentencing. As part of the plea agreement, Nison said, Hill will be sentenced  to 15 years to life for the slaying.  </P> <P> Because he was a juvenile at the time of the incident, Hill is eligible to  serve time in the California Youth Authority until he is 25, when he can be  transferred to state prison, Nison said.  </P> <P> Authorities said Zoldseth had given Hill and another youth a ride after Hill  promised to take the victim to an apartment where he could buy drugs.  Authorities said Hill then stabbed Zoldseth 11 times in the chest and back  before taking off in the truck with the other youth, who is still being sought.  </P></p>

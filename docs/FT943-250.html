			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Universities plan business links University vice-chancellors announced yesterday that they would create a new post of chief executive to help build links between higher education and the private sector. Dr Kenneth Edwards, chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals, which ended its annual conference in Birmingham yesterday, said: 'Universities need to become more entrepreneurial than ever. They must find more public and private investment to restructure and re-equip for new teaching and learning techniques.' He added that universities played 'a key role in supporting economic regeneration', and that they were bound to become 'even more central to civic life' as more people entered higher education. The committee had previously resisted creating a chief executive in favour of a more loose organisation. Dr Edwards - the vice-chancellor of Leicester University - also claimed that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, would need to introduce new funding arrangements. Mrs Shephard had told the committee: 'Universities have achieved considerable success in the past decade or so. Now that we are in a period of consolidation, we must not miss the chance to make sure our quality systems are equally good.' But the committee said: 'Those achievements will be short-lived if government does not ensure that the system is adequately funded.' Vice-chancellors said the system of subsidised loans to cover student living costs should be reformed immediately. Repayments should be tied to the National Insurance system, linking them closer to graduates' incomes and reducing collection costs. But the Department for Education ruled out any change to the loans system until 1997 at the earliest. The committee also agreed to review the admissions system to take into account the wider range of entry qualifications now being offered such as General National Vocational Qualifications.</p>

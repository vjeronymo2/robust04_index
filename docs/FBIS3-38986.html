			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Gabrielle Grenz] </F>   [Text] Brussels, Feb 9 (AFP) -- The January 1, 1995  deadline for bringing Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden into  the European Community looked increasingly problematic Wednesday  [9 February] after each nation hit EC negotiators with demands  for aid and protection for key lobbies.    For all but Sweden, the first major problem encountered in  negotiations here Tuesday was the candidates' refusal to  immediately align their heavily subsidised farm sectors with the  EC common agricultural policy (CAP) because they fear prices  will plummet by 50 percent, with income following suit.    Only Sweden agreed to comply on this point here on Tuesday.    Helsinki, Oslo and Vienna have ruled out the idea of a  transition period during which they would pay compensation -- at  their own expense -- to their farmers.    "Never has the European Community agreed to see farm prices  plunge by 50 percent from one day to the next. Even under CAP,  it allowed three years to reduce subsidised beef prices by 15  percent," Norwegian Commerce Minister Grete Knudsen thundered  after the meeting.    Compensation should be financed by the EC budget, to which  Norway and the other three candidates will become net  contributors, she added.    Norwegian farms are mainly small and scattered through the  countryside. They suffer from difficult geographic and  climactic conditions -- summer is very short. "That's why we  want access to Community funds to maintain our long-term aid,  which the Community has rejected," the minister said.    She recalled that Norway offered an "attractive market for  European exporters."    EC Council President Theodore Pangalos, answered for the EC:  "Of course, farmers will be hit by the drop in prices, but for  the consumers it will mean cheaper food products, and a rich  country like Norway can cope with that."    Oslo also wants to use Community aid funds to prevent the  desertification of its polar region, which has a population of  four residents per square kilometer and shares a common border  with Russia, Knudsen said.    Helsinki used the same argument about the need to maintain  security in the far north of Europe to call for part of the EC  structural funds reserved in principle for areas that are  backward in development.    For Brussels, however, the Arctic regions do not qualify as  backward areas because their gross national product per  inhabitant is more than 80 percent of the Community average.    Stockholm also sought generous aid for its Norbotten region  near the polar circle "so as not to be left behind" in case its  two neighbours got their requests satisfied, said Swedish  European Affairs Minister Ulf Dinkelspiel.    "We are investing a lot of money in this region and we're  counting on Community support to recover it," he said.    Austria's problem is with its high level of support for  Alpine agriculture. Vienna wants the Community to accept its  definition of mountain farming as starting at 500 meters (1,625  feet) altitude, compared with the EC's current 800 meters (2,600  feet).    Devoted environmental protectionists, the Austrians also  want  to maintain their current limits on European trucks using their  roads even after joining the Community.    Brussels is ready to allow a three-year transition period,  until 1998, but Vienna wants to continue the limitations up  until the year 2004, in a bid to reach its target of reducing  pollution by 60 percent.    Opposing this effort is the EC's principle of free  circulation.    Another inacceptable demand from Austria is the country's  prohibition on non-Austrians buying holiday homes in the country  on grounds this could cause real estate prices to rocket, as has  been the case in the Tyrol, a favourite holiday spot for Germans.    Meanwhile Norway wants to be allowed to continue hunting  whales. It has asked the EC to cross whales off its list of  endangered species.    The ministers are due to meet again on February 21 and 22 to  continue discussions. A final meeting could be held from  February 25-28, diplomatic sources said.    The negotiations with the four must be concluded by March 1  under an EC timetable fixed to allow membership agreements to be  drawn up before European elections in June.</p>

Prior to this trip  representatives of the German firm Ruhrgas, as well as gas  workers from France and from Iran's national gas company,  visited Yerevan. In the course of all these meetings the  question of the laying of a gas pipeline from Iran to Europe was  examined. It is quite obvious that this question, in addition to  economic, is also of political significance. Today there are  only two options for the laying of a new gas pipeline: through  Armenia and Azerbaijan or through Turkey's territory to Europe.  Both of these projects are approximately equal in cost. However,  it is clear that today the chances of both Armenia and  Azerbaijan for the laying of the gas pipeline on the territory  of these states are much smaller than Turkey's chances, owing to  the fact that an unstable political situation exists in the  region and the confrontation in Nagorno-Karabakh continues.  European countries, which are very interested in getting Iranian  gas, will hardly agree to the laying of this fuel artery, which  is vitally important to them, through a politically unstable  region. Meanwhile, for Armenia and Azerbaijan the laying of the  gas pipeline from Iran to Europe would be of extremely great  importance both economically and politically and would enable  these countries to seriously engage in the restoration of their  economy, which suffers extremely from fuel shortage.    Today the situation is as follows: During approximately one  and a half years countries interested in the passage of the gas  pipeline through their territory, that is, Armenia, Azerbaijan,  and Turkey, will prepare a special feasibility report on behalf  of their countries. The Armenian side has already begun to work  in this direction. In Yerevan there is also the hope that by the  time the projects are submitted for an examination by experts  the problem of Nagornyy Karabakh will be solved to one degree or  another and the political aspect will cease to hamper the  implementation of plans for the republic's economic restoration.</p>

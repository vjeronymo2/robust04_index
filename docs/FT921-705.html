			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Quotes of the day The Tory party have done an unforgiveable wrong to a little girl by their cynical conduct, and everyone knows that now Neil Kinnock It is quite mind-blowing: Labour can say that, having put out the case of a family on peak-time television, on all channels, that they are really concerned the family's name came out Des Wilson, Liberal Democrat campaign director It's bad enough for a child to be ill, but for all of them to use her and her family in this way is very wrong Voter in Bury You keep sending the writs, we shall go on publishing the truth The Sun's message to Neil Kinnock after he issued a libel writ against the paper There is every reason for believing that an independent Scotland would face a long, difficult, costly and unpredictable negotiation with the European Community and its member states Sir Leon Brittan It's a bit like one of those Hammer Horror movies. By the end of the movie the vampire is dead, but by the sequel it has rematerialised. It's got to be a stake through the heart this time. Alex Salmond, SNP leader, on Margaret Thatcher The Labour party has clearly told the union leaders to shut up during the campaign. A Kinnock government would have to pay up the day it was over John Major They are going to be pink - you can't get blue ones John Major, on being presented with a new strain of rose called Norma Major 'Common sense - it doesn't sound much like politics does it?' Paddy Ashdown in last night's election broadcast</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / UK Company News: A&amp;C Black tumbles to Pounds 276,000 The deteriorating economic climate, coupled with the postponement of several important titles, were blamed by A&amp;C Black, the book publisher and distributor, for a marked decline in profits in the year to end-December. Turnover increased from Pounds 5.44m to Pounds 6.32m. However, taxable profits were more than halved to Pounds 276,000 (Pounds 637,000). Earnings per share came out at 14.5p (31.2p) and directors propose to pay a final dividend of 8.75p for an unchanged total of 13p.</p>

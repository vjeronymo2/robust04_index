			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 17 Apr (INA) -- The political editor of the  IRAQI NEWS AGENCY has denied in part and parcel the allegations  published by the Zionist paper THE JERUSALEM POST of 3 April in  which it claimed that contacts, which it described as "secret  and important," are being held between Iraq and "Israel" through  Palestinian and European parties in order to expand what it  called the scope of the Middle East peace process.    The INA political editor commented: The objective of  propagating such lies is to tarnish the reputation of Iraq and  its clear, faithful pan-Arab policy, which is not built on the  basis of rotten corridor deals and narrow interests.    The political editor added: Such things are useless attempts  to peddle exposed lies which no longer fool anybody.</p>

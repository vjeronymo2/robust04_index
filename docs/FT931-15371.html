			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Adequate safety requirements for BR train operators after privatisation PLANS to privatise British Rail will increase the number and severity of railway accidents unless adequate safety requirements are imposed on train operators, the Health and Safety Executive warned in a report published yesterday, John Willman writes. The HSE, the independent, government-funded safety watchdog, said that current safety standards on the UK railways were high but could be raised further. But maintaining current standards depended on the close integration of BR's operations, which privatisation will split between many different organisations. 'Companies with little or no previous experience of operating on the railway and managers with limited experience of railway safety issues will enter the industry,' the HSE said. New controls will be needed to curb the risk of accidents, the HSE said. The list of 38 recommendations - all accepted by the government - includes a mass of new regulations covering matters such as the transport of dangerous substances by rail and the assesment of the competence of train drivers.</p>

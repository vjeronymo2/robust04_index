			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLDSMITH FINDS FRENCH BUYER FOR FARMERS GROUP  </P> <P> British financier Sir James Goldsmith said Wednesday that his investment group  will sell Los Angeles-based Farmers Group Inc. to a French insurance concern if  he succeeds in his hostile bid to buy Farmers' current parent, BAT Industries.  </P> <P> Goldsmith said Hoylake Investments Limited, which he formed with other  investors to make a $21.7-billion bid for London-based BAT, reached a  conditional agreement under which Axa Midi Assurances would buy Farmers for  $4.5 billion. Paris-based Axa Midi, which owns a very small reinsurance company  in the United States, would also invest about $952 million (600 million pounds)  in Hoylake, Goldsmith said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not a 'Fit Parent'  </P> <P> In making the announcement, Hoylake is trying to persuade state insurance  regulators not to veto the sale of BAT. But in London, BAT Chairman Patrick  Sheehy said Hoylake was selling out BAT shareholders. "Hoylake is proposing to  sell Farmers Group on the cheap in a forced sale. BAT Industries shareholders  would be deprived of its real value and future potential," Sheehy said in a  prepared statement.  </P> <P> Farmers, the nation's third-largest home and automobile insurer, reluctantly  became a part of the BAT family last December. Farmers agreed to be acquired  after a bitter, 9-month campaign and only after it forced Batus Inc. -- BAT's  American unit based in Louisville, Ky. -- to raise its bid to $5.2 billion from  $4.35 billion.  </P> <P> Throughout that battle, opponents of the merger insisted that Batus, which owns  Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. as well as the Saks Fifth Avenue and  Marshall Fields department stores, was not a fit parent for an insurance  concern. They argued, for example, that Batus might force Farmers to end  discounts for nonsmokers.  </P> <P> Goldsmith and Hoylake officials renewed those charges Wednesday in their  campaign to persuade state regulators that Hoylake is a responsible guardian  that has found a suitable parent for Farmers. Under British law, Hoylake must  show by Oct. 28 that there are no hurdles to its acquiring BAT. Standing in its  way are the insurance regulators in nine American states who have the authority  to assess whether the acquisition by Hoylake is in the public interest. Hoylake  has challenged the regulators' authority in federal court, arguing that the  reviews are improper because the entire transaction is taking place in Britain.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Voting Trust  </P> <P> The consortium is nevertheless willing to work with the states, Samuel Pisar,  Goldsmith's chief counsel, said in an interview Wednesday. But given the months  that insurance regulators took to review BAT's bid for Farmers, it is not  likely that they would act in time to meet the British deadline, he said. Pisar  said the question of Hoylake's fitness to operate an insurance company is moot  given its announcement. "As of this morning, there has been a sea change. We  have turned BAT's argument on its head," he said.  </P> <P> Pisar said that Goldsmith never intended to operate an insurance company. "Now  that the buyers are known, it has to be reassuring to all of the (state  insurance) commissioners," he said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Hoylake sought to diffuse the issue by setting up a voting trust to  take charge of Farmers until it could find a buyer. Hoylake said the trustees  -- former U.S. Sen. Daniel J. Evans (R-Wash.), Los Angeles attorney Shirley M.  Hufstedler and David Sherwood, former president of Prudential Insurance of  America -- would have the power to sell Farmers on their own if Hoylake had not  found a buyer by a certain period of time.  </P> <P> Goldsmith said in a statement that Axa Midi is "an ideal business partner for  Farmers." He said: "We have demonstrated our resolve to sell Farmers as quickly  as possible to a company of impeccable credentials. . . . Which is the better  custodian of Farmers? A sprawling tobacco based conglomerate -- with its  inherent conflicts of interest -- or a successful and growing insurance group."  </P> <P> Axa Midi's history dates back some 200 years, but the current entity came into  being as a result of hostile merger attempt. Compagnie Du Midi formed an  alliance in 1988 with the Axa insurance group in an attempt to block a takeover  by Italian insurance company Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. Subsequently, Axa  won control of Compagnie du Midi, forcing out its chairman. Meanwhile, Generali  persisted in efforts to form a relationship with Axa and now has about a 20%  stake in the company.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fighting Over Farmers' Fate  </P> <P> Axa Midi owns five insurance concerns in Canada but has only a small presence  in the United States through its Gamma Reinsurance Co. of New York. Although  Gamma is licensed in 43 states, including California, its influence is  "negligible," said an Axa Midi spokeswoman. If Hoylake's scenario is  successful, the merger would guarantee Axa Midi "a significant position" in the  American market, Axa Midi said in a statement. Farmers is the nation's  15th-largest insurance concern.  </P> <P> On Monday, BAT formally defended its rejection of Hoylake's offer, saying that  the bid is nothing more than an attempt to break up a "successful company for  the personal gain of a group of extremely wealthy people." Pisar said BAT  deserved to be broken up because it has moved far beyond its expertise in the  tobacco business, "often making a mess" of companies it acquired. "Had BAT  stayed a tobacco company, it would be like Philip Morris today.  </P></p>

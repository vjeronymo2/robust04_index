			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 AIRLINES MAY JOIN ON RESERVATION SYSTEM  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines said Monday that  they are discussing the formation of a combined computer reservations system.  </P> <P> If the merger takes place, the resulting reservations system would become the  nation's third largest -- after those owned by American Airlines and United  Airlines.  </P> <P> The announcement by the three carriers said such a transaction would join the  PARS system, which has been jointly owned by TWA and Northwest since 1986, and  Delta's DATAS II. However, they said their talks are only in a "preliminary"  stage.  </P> <P> The airlines said the new entity, if it is created, would be independently  operated as an autonomous company with its own management. The action would  eliminate one of the five computer reservations systems in the country.  </P> <P> The CRS operations -- especially the largest ones -- are very profitable for  the airlines that own them. Travel agents use the systems to make airline  reservations for clients, to make hotel and tour reservations and to order  rental cars. The agents can also do much of their own accounting on the  computer terminals that the reservations system companies install in their  offices.  </P> <P> Most travel agents use only one of the systems, paying a fee -- which is  negotiable -- to have the equipment installed. The CRS companies make their  money from fees collected from the airlines, rental car companies and hotels,  etc., for which the tickets are sold. The typical fee is $1.85 per transaction.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Transportation has calculated that 15% of American  Airlines' 1986 revenue and 10% of Delta's resulted from the built-in advantages  of owning their own systems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Merger Hit Snag  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Delta, one of the most profitable U.S. airlines, is at a big  disadvantage because its DATAS II is the nation's smallest computer  reservations system.  </P> <P> "The reason we are pursuing this merger," said Delta spokesman Jim Lundi, "is  to increase the subscriber base for our system, to make the system worthwhile,  to make it competitive. It is important to reach a critical mass."  </P> <P> Besides American's Sabre system, United Airlines' Apollo system, DATAS II and  PARS, Texas Air Corp., parent of Eastern Airlines and Continental Airlines,  owns and operates System One. There are also six other systems in Asia, Canada  and Europe.  </P> <P> Delta had hoped to merge its CRS system into American's in a deal valued at $2  billion announced in February. Delta was to have paid American $650 million to  form the partnership. The two carriers would each have owned 25% of the new  company and the remaining shares would have been sold to other airlines.  </P> <P> But the Justice Department said in June that it planned to block the merger as  anti-competitive and in violation of the antitrust laws. As a result, the two  carriers abandoned their plans.  </P> <P> In August, American said it was talking to two smaller U.S. airlines --  Southwest Airlines and Alaska Air Lines -- and to a European airline consortium  about selling them shares in its Sabre system.  </P> <P> The American reservations system has about 38% of total CRS revenue in this  country. Apollo has about 30% and System One has about 11%. If the PARS and  DATAS II systems are merged, it would have the rest of the U.S. market -- about  21%.  </P> <P> Apollo actually is owned by a company named Covia, half of which is owned by  UAL Corp., United's parent. The other half is owned by USAir and a number of  European carriers.  </P></p>

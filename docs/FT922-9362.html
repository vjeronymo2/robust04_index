			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Tanzania pressed to ban wild bird trade TANZANIA is coming under increasing international pressure to end its trade in wild birds, largely because of the appalling conditions in which many are transported. Tanzania is understood to be the second largest exporter of wild birds in the world, trading up to 2m a year as pets in Europe, the US and Japan. Nine illegal shipments of protected birds have been discovered in Tanzania this year, all using forged documents. Tanzania is desperately short of foreign exchange, and has seen the trade as a valuable source of earnings - about Dollars 15m a year. But following the discovery of abuses, all airlines except the national one has banned the cargo. In March this year, an illegal shipment from Dar es Salaam carrying 11 crowned cranes and eight saddle-billed storks aroused controversy when six of the birds were dead on arrival in Amsterdam. These had been carried by Aeroflot via Moscow, and the Russian airline is being sued by Dutch airport authorities. About 60 airlines worldwide now refuse to transport live birds. But for the Lausanne-based Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species (Cites), most concern is focused on proper enforcement of regulations governing the carriage of live birds, rather than a total ban on the trade. Cites argues that many birds suffer unduly because basic standards to ensure their safety are ignored by airlines. Up to 20m live birds are traded worldwide each year to supply the pet industry, with the EC the largest market, accounting for about 3m birds. Other leading exporters are Indonesia, Senegal and Argentina. Around 10 per cent of birds die either during or shortly after being transported. Local trappers receive only a fraction of the selling prices. They get about 40 cents for a small bird selling on world markets at about Dollars 5, and about Dollars 40 for a larger bird that will sell for around Dollars 150. The Tanzanian Wildlife Exporters' Association concedes that the government has come under increasing pressure to end the trade in wild birds, but blames abuses on 'newcomers who see profit in something which is free in the bush'. The country's Wildlife Conservation Society has called for a two-year moratorium.</p>

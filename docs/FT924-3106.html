			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Survey of Canada (3): Bank governor is hero after fall in inflation - The upturn is expected to be slow MR JOHN CROW, the Bank of Canada's forthright governor, has been transformed over the past two years from national villain to national hero. The villains these days are spendthrift politicians whose inability to contain budget deficits has cast a cloud over Canada's economic prospects. In 1990-91, Mr Crow bore the brunt of complaints from business, trade unions and politicians that high interest rates and a soaring currency were ravaging the Canadian economy. More recently however, the UK-raised, former IMF economist has been showered with compliments for squeezing Canada's inflation rate down to the lowest among G7 countries, forcing business to pay more attention to its productivity, and adroitly steering Canada through the turbulence on world currency markets. Inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, has slowed to an annual rate of little more than 1 per cent, down from 5.6 per cent in 1991 and 4.8 per cent the previous year. This easily beats inflation targets set by the government in early 1991. Local economists have nicknamed the central bank the 'Bundesbank of the North.' Mr Crow insisted in a recent speech that his highest priority remains monetary stability. 'This goal is good for expectations, good for markets, good for savers and investors, and therefore good for sustained recovery in the Canadian economy,' he said. But guiding the economy towards a smooth, non-inflationary recovery will not be easy. The success of monetary policy in recent years masks a disturbing deterioration in the state of Canada's public finances. 'The Bank of Canada has no antidote for fiscal problems in this country,' says Mr Warren Jestin, Bank of Nova Scotia's chief economist. Profligacy during the last boom, especially in Ontario, has been compounded during the recession by a slump in tax revenues and heavier demands for government services, especially social welfare and unemployment insurance. Bank of Nova Scotia estimates that public sector deficits now amount to about 8 per cent of national income, among the highest in the G7. The federal government has missed one deficit reduction target after another and will almost certainly fail to achieve this year's goal of a CDollars 27.5bn shortfall. The final outcome is now expected to be closer to CDollars 33-34bn. Provincial governments have held their fiscal reins even more loosely. According to Burns Fry, the Toronto securities firm, borrowing by the 10 provinces has surged from CDollars 17bn in the fiscal year to March 31 1988 to an estimated CDollars 33bn in 1992-93. The provinces' combined borrowings overtook the federal government's for the first time last year. The public sector deficits have become a painful political headache. Canadians are already heavily taxed. The uproar over the introduction of a 7 per cent Goods and Services Tax two years ago and subsequent revolts against higher municipal rates are signs that taxpayers' tolerance is wearing thin. On the other hand, the scope for paring government spending in the depths of a recession is limited. If anything, pressure is now building on Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister, to loosen the purse-strings, especially with the general election drawing near in 1993. Although interest rates have come down a long way from their mid-1990 peaks, they remain unusually h i g h a f t e r f a c t o r i n g in the slide in inflation. The yield on long-term government bonds stood at 8.6 per cent in mid-November, giving a 'real' interest rate of over 7 per cent. The Bank of Canada has indicated in recent months that it is willing to allow the Canadian dollar to slide a little faster to accommodate a further drop in interest rates. The currency fell below 79 US cents in mid-November for the first time in five years, down from almost 84 cents in early September. Burns Fry predicts that the dollar could slide as low as 75 US cents by the end of 1993. With policymakers having so little room for manoeuvre, economists are virtually unanimous that the upturn will be slow. Real growth in gross domestic product is expected to be around 1.5 per cent this year, compared to the 2.7 per cent forecast by Mr Donald Mazankowski, the finance minister, in his budget last February. Next year's growth rate is unlikely to exceed about 3.5 per cent. The chances are slim that unemployment, currently at over 11 per cent, will return to single digits before late 1993. The main engines for growth are expected to include exports, which will be spurred by the more favourable exchange rate and a recovery in the US; and housing, which will benefit from lower interest rates. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp predicts that housing starts will rise to 179,000 units in 1993, from 166,000 this year. The outlook varies widely from province to province. British Columbia, whose growth is compared by the business community to California in the 1950s and 1960s, is enjoying robust expansion as immigrants and investment stream in, and the forestry industry shows signs of revival. Prospects in neighbouring Alberta depend largely on oil and gas prices, and the international grain market. At the other extreme of the country (and the growth spectrum), Newfoundland is struggling to cope with a moratorium on cod fishing. About one in five Newfoundlanders is out of work, and the province's economy has shrunk by about 2 per cent this year. Ontario and Quebec, the two most industrialised provinces and among those hardest hit by the recession, are expected to mirror the national picture, emerging only slowly and fitfully from the slump of the past three years.</p>

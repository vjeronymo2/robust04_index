			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [UKRINFORM report: ``We Harm Ourselves and Nature''] </F>   [Text] Last year, 282 cases of critical environmental  pollution were recorded in Ukraine. They caused 1.3 billion  karbovantsi [K] of damage. Almost all of these discharges  affected water reservoirs. The greatest number of such  accidents occurred in the following oblasts: 39 in Poltava  Oblast, 27 in Ternopil Oblast, 22 in Khmelnytskyy Oblast, 18 in  Kirovohrad Oblast, and 17 in Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. One of  every nine of the inspected facilities (virtually all those in  Lvov Oblast) exceeded the norms for discharging contaminated  waste. Reporting these figures, the Ministry of Statistics  points out that, last year, inspectors prevented more than 6  million cubic meters of liquid waste from being discharged into  natural water reservoirs and 13,000 tonnes of dry harmful waste  from being released into the atmosphere. Fines totalling K152  million were imposed for violations of the nature conservation  laws and more than 21,000 officials were called to account.</p>

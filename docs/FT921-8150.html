			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / International Company News: Oce rises 20% and lifts payout OCE-van der Grinten, the Dutch photocopier and office equipment group, is to raise its dividend for the first time in seven years after posting a rise of nearly 20 per cent in 1991 net profit. Net profit increased from Fl 85.7m (Dollars 46.3m) in 1990 to Fl 100.9m last year, in line with the company's provisional January forecast of Fl 101m. Oce, which described 1991 as an excellent year, said it would raise the dividend to Fl 2.25 per share from Fl 2.00, the level at which it had been held since 1985. The company predicted that profit would show additional growth in 1992, provided there was no further weakening in the investment climate. Oce's financial year runs from December to November. News of the higher dividend and profit forecast pushed Oce's shares up by Fl 3.10, or 4.4 per cent, to close at a 12-month high of Fl 73.50 on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. Group sales rose 11 per cent to Fl 2.58bn, mainly due to the launch of updated products such as two high-volume copiers. The acquisition in August of Bruning, a US design engineering company, accounted for around 2 percentage points of the sales rise. The Bruning acquisition has given Oce around 20 per cent of the design engineering market in the US. The Dutch company said it expected to reach the break-even point in the US during 1992. Overall sales in the office systems sector rose by 15 per cent last year, outstripping a 6 per cent increase in design engineering. Oce noted that its design engineering activities faced weak economic conditions on most markets except Germany. It said its new 'plain paper' copiers had largely compensated for the market shift away from 'diazo' copiers.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD COASTAL OIL PLAN COULD GET OVERHAUL;  </P> <P> ENERGY: STRONG CRITICISM FROM THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION IS PROMPTING  THE CITY TO RETHINK ITS PLAN TO RESTRICT ONSHORE FACILITIES FOR OFFSHORE  DRILLING.  </P> <P> A Carlsbad plan to tightly restrict onshore facilities for offshore oil  drilling has been sharply criticized by the California Coastal Commission, and  has prompted the city to reconsider its proposal.  </P> <P> In a 15-page report, the commission staff said the Carlsbad plan was so poorly  written it could not be enforced, and it threatened to undermine the  commission's authority to consider energy-producing projects.  </P> <P> The city's so-called Local Coastal Plan "contains extremely subjective and  restrictive criteria," the staff report said.  </P> <P> Last year, the Carlsbad City Council approved the plan, fearing possible damage  from onshore refineries, tanker terminals, pipelines, warehouses and other  facilities to support offshore oil operations.  </P> <P> But, with the commission staff recommending that the plan be rejected, the city  last week indefinitely removed the plan from the commission's agenda.  </P> <P> Gary Wayne, the city's assistant planning director, said Wednesday that the  City Council probably will consider next month whether to defend the plan,  rewrite it, make it weaker, or drop it all together.  </P> <P> "First thing, we've got to buy time," Wayne said. "We feel it's sustainable. I  don't know what we're going to do."  </P> <P> The federal Department of Energy had proposed to lease 76,735 sea-bottom acres  north of Encinitas and including areas off Carlsbad's coast for offshore oil  exploration and drilling.  </P> <P> However, President Bush announced last month that his administration has banned  offshore drilling for the next 10 years, unless there becomes an emergency need  for more domestic oil.  </P> <P> "The entire coast of California was up for leasing," said Mark Delaplaine, a  commission energy analyst. "That's now off for 10 years," including drilling  off Carlsbad.  </P> <P> Still, some Carlsbad city officials and California congressmen are worried that  the Bush Administration's ban might not be honored by future presidents and  have asked the House Appropriations subcommittee on the interior to make the  moratorium into federal law.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said this week, "President Bush's decision to  stop drilling activity until the year 2000 was a victory in our long struggle  to end drilling altogether.  </P> <P> "However, the President's decision does not bind future Democratic or  Republican administrations," Packard said.  </P> <P> Wayne said the ban on drilling leaves Carlsbad wondering what to do with its  plan.  </P> <P> "In light of the Bush moratorium, do you want to withdraw it and resubmit it at  another time?" Wayne said.  </P> <P> But he suggested that it might be wise to have a plan restricting onshore  facilities in case the ban is lifted after Bush leaves office.  </P> <P> "Bush could be in for one term. He's certainly not going to be in for 10  years," Wayne said.  </P> <P> So far, though, the city's plan appears to be going nowhere with the Coastal  Commission staff. The plan would prohibit onshore facilities unless the City  Council found that:  </P> <P> * The facilities would pose no danger to life and property in the city.  </P> <P> * The benefits would clearly outweigh the possible adverse environmental  effects.  </P> <P> * There are no feasible alternatives.  </P> <P> * Allowing the facilities at a particular location clearly outweighs any  potential harm to public health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general  welfare of the people in the community.  </P> <P> Delaplaine said, "What we had concerns about was vagueness. There were  undefinable words in the city's proposal. Who knows what the 'morals of the  people' means?"  </P> <P> The commission's staff suggested the wholesale rewriting of the city's plan. As  an example, the city sought to require that onshore facilities must pose "no  danger to life and property." The staff proposed wording that any threat of  damage or injuries "will be minimized."  </P> <P> The staff also complained the city's standards for onshore facilities were so  hard to understand that the commission couldn't properly consider the appeals  of applicants whose proposed facilities might be rejected by Carlsbad.  </P> <P> With the staff's proposed wording, the city's plan would be "more specific  (but) it could be argued either way whether it's tougher or not," Delaplaine  said.  </P> <P> "It does seem to weaken our position," Wayne said. "It puts more of the burden  on us than industry." He denied that the plan is too restrictive, saying "it  doesn't absolutely close the door to onshore facilities. It's tough, but maybe  it should be tough."  </P> <P> The commission staff said the plan is also flawed because it is inconsistent  with the state Coastal Act that allows the commission to approve energy  development, including proposals that depend on onshore support facilities.  </P> <P> Delaplaine said the commission must have flexibility to balance energy  development and environmental protection.  </P> <P> "Part of our program is recognition of national energy needs," he said. But  Carlsbad "would like to balance things in a more self-protecting way."  </P> <P> City officials hope to decide whether to pursue the plan before the  commission's December meeting in San Diego.  </P> <P> Outright prohibitions on offshore drilling have been adopted by San Diego  County, the city of San Diego and Oceanside.  </P></p>

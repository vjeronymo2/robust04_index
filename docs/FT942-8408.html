			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Candover's Pounds 213m for new fund Candover, the venture capital group, has received commitments of Pounds 213m for a new fund which it will invest in larger management buy-outs and buy-ins. The group expects to raise further capital and close the fund later this year. This is the first sizeable fund since Pounds 319m was raised by the group in 1989. The capital has been raised at a time when many venture capital groups are finding it hard to persuade investors to back them with new money. 'It was easier five years ago,' said Mr Stephen Curran, chief executive. 'We are satisfied with the progress in what is not an easy market and we are confident there will be additional commitments in the second closing.' The figure for the first closing includes a commitment from Candover to invest Pounds 64m. At the last balance sheet date Candover had Pounds 22m of cash. It expects the imminent realisation of investments to produce the balance needed.</p>

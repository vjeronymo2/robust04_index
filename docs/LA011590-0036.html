			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Cable Company Drops MTV: A cable television company in South Dakota has deleted  the MTV music video channel because of complaints about offensive videos, the  company manager said.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it was an organized effort or people just decided to call at  the same time, but we got a large number of requests all of a sudden from these  areas to remove the service," said Doug Bierschbach, manager of Satellite Cable  TV Systems. Last month, the company stopped offering MTV in Parkston or  Freeman, towns of about 1,300 each. MTV was replaced by the Discovery Channel.  Bierschbach said his office has since received about a dozen complaints from  young viewers. SHAUNA SNOW and BETH KLEID  </P></p>

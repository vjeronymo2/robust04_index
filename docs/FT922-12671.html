			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / UK Company News: Send for Corporate Finance Repairman] MR RICHARD Heley and Bernando will be competing today. As the bay horse prances around the dressage ring, his rider will look cool, calm and collected whatever is happening beneath him, writes Maggie Urry. It is a skill Mr Heley, who is head of corporate finance at Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, has perfected over the months since being appointed by Brent Walker in September 1990. He has been the chief architect of the financial side of the group's rescue. His current holiday is only the second he has had since he took on the gargantuan task. The first, in Italy last July, was accompanied by a fax machine which was put out of action for four days by a Tuscan thunderstorm causing considerable frustration back at the office. Mr Heley says his two children still recognise him despite his late nights at work and non-appearance at many school functions. His horse has blossomed, reaching the regional finals last year in both the novice and elementary classes for dressage, even though weekend competitions were often squeezed between Brent Walker meetings in the morning and evening. Unfortunately he cannot say how many hours work was involved in Brent Walker. 'We made a fundamental error at an early stage,' he admits. Hill Samuel agreed to work for a fixed fee rather than an hourly rate. The two hardest periods were the seven weeks running up to the standstill agreement reached with the banks in November 1990 and the weeks between mid-February and June 7 last year when the proposals were put to the banks. Then he was working at least 18 hours a day, seven days a week. The work was even tougher on Hill Samuel's computer. There is nothing more frustrating at 3am, Mr Heley says, than trying to put the next variant into a 10-year cashflow projection model only to find that the computer's capacity has been completely used. Hill Samuel has re-equipped the department though, and is hoping to pick up business from the other corporate restructurings now taking place. 'Brent Walker was the first one that went the full course,' he says, 'so Hill Samuel has developed skills which others will find useful.' One lesson he has learned - next time he will be charging by the hour.</p>

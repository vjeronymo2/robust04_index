			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Last-minute party venue - Appetisers While the hunt is on for the finest ingredients for the Christmas table, the search for the ideal venue for the office Christmas party is almost over. One London restaurant that has opened too recently to avail itself of Christmas bookings, but would make a most original place for a small office lunch or dinner party, is The Heights, on the 15th floor of the St Georges Hotel, Langham Place, London W1 (071-636 1939). The chef is 29-year-old Adam Newell, formerly of Le Poulbot, Cheapside, London EC2, who shows his culinary talent and originality in dishes such as: salad of grill guinea fowl and ratte potatoes; crab and scallop flan; peppered roast monkfish and gateau of aubergine and tomato vinaigrette. Dinner costs around Pounds 20 to Pounds 25 per head without wine (the list is sadly disappointing) and there is a cheaper bar menu next door. Window tables command views across west London. My short cri de coeur about the menace posed by mobile phones in restaurants has struck a chord. Suggestions came in from the UK, Israel and Germany. They ranged from the creation of special areas for mobile phone users, the equivalent of smoking and non-smoking zones, to the commissioning of a new HE Bateman cartoon that shows the fate of 'The man who dared to use a mobile phone in a restaurant.' One reader told the story of a man in a railway carriage interrupted by a fellow traveller using a mobile phone. The man expressed interest in the phone, was given it to look at, and promptly threw it out of the window. But all readers agreed that restaurateurs should display a prominent sign asking mobile phone users to leave their phones with the receptionist during the meal. If they do not, one-liners to be remembered include: 'I'd rather not hear about you and your probation officer]', 'I'll ring your neck' or finally, and most effective if said by a woman to a man: 'Kindly put that thing away]' A light lunch prepared by Rowley Leigh, chef-proprietor of London's popular Kensington Place: scallops with ceps; noisettes of venison with pumpkin puree and tomato and aubergine gratin followed by baked tamarillos and vanilla ice. To drink there were choice wines from the cellars of the London wine merchants Bibendum: a delicious Condrieu; Cabernet from the Waimarama Estate in New Zealand; Recioto di Soave and Niepoort port. Did I say a light lunch? Do that five days a week and you will almost certainly be making an urgent appointment with your doctor. But not according to Jane Clarke, the dietician who designed the menu. Clarke says one may eat good food and remain healthy - and the above meal was one example. Sounds too good to be true? Let us hope it isn't. Sceptics can make inquiries to Jane Clarke on 071-823 5323, fax 071-823 5110. Sotheby's first wine sale in Zurich for many years takes place on Friday, December 9 at the Hotel Baur au Lac and is expected to fetch Pounds 500,000. It coincides with Sotheby's 250th anniversary year and the 25th anniversary of Sotheby's Switzerland. Chateau Cheval Blanc 1945,'62,'64,'82,'85,'86,'88 and '89, La Fleur Petrus '79 and '86, vintages of Margaux, Lafite, Latour, Pichon-Lalande, Cos d'Estournel and Ducru-Beaucaillou are included. There are some interesting estimates: SFr8,000-SFr10,000 for a dozen bottles of Petrus 78 and SFr6,000-SFr7000 for a dozen bottles of '67 Yquem. Sotheby's is hoping a single bottle of the '45 Yquem will fetch SFr1,000-SFr1,300. In addition, cigars will be auctioned, including some Cuban specials chosen for flavour and rarity. A 44cm Havana 'Le jeroboam de Gerard Pere et Fils' is expected to net SFr400-SFr600. No doubt the buyer will either want to share it with friends or smoke it over several uninterrupted days. Seriously, the number of exceptional wines from rare vintages might make a very acceptable Christmas or anniversary gift, especially since there are a number of small lots. Hampton Court Palace still has places available on its Tudor feast lecture tours, running from now until spring next year. Specialist guide-lecturer Sue Jenkins will talk about Tudor food, cooking methods, kitchen equipment and diet. The tour will take place in the palace's royal kitchens, which were designed to feed several hundred. Cost of the tour (on selected Thursdays from 11am to 12.30pm) is Pounds 15. Details on 081-781 9540. A welcome sign that, under energetic chairman Adele Biss, the British Tourist Authority is taking a more active role in promoting British restaurants, is the new Guide to Asian Restaurants in London. Financed by the BTA and Qantas, 70,000 copies of this guide to 39 of London's best Chinese, Thai, Indian and Japanese restaurants are available free from BTA Asia offices and are being distributed to Qantas passengers arriving in the UK.</p>

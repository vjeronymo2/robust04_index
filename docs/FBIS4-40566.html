			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Amanova and Lev Aleynik under the "Self- </F> Determination" rubric: "National Minorities Explain Their  Position to Council of Europe"]    [Text] Representatives of the Congress of Ethnic  Associations of Russia [CEAR] met with Council of Europe experts  in the Department for Human Rights of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The CEAR was represented by the  German, Korean, Moldovan, Ukrainian, Polish, Karaim, Tatar, and  Jewish communities, as well as the Ingush and Ossetian  organizations representing the territorial "autonomous  entities." The Council of Europe was represented by members of  the commissions for human rights and political issues and of the  judicial chamber. The experts were led by the head of the court  department of the Council of Europe's human rights commission,  Prof. Bernard, who said that "the group is here to listen rather  than speak because Russia has started the process of joining the  Council of Europe, and one of our tasks is to find out about the  position of national minorities."    However, a number of participants in the meeting believed,  the experts "were unprepared for it" because "national  minorities are nonexistent as far as Russia and all its parties  and the Council of Europe are concerned." According to  statistics, non-Russians account for 30 percent of Russia's  population. The notion of a "national minority" has not been  defined in legal terms.    The main demands of the CEAR were expounded by, Roman  Spektor, member of the Executive Committee of the World Jewish  Congress. The CEAR is pressing for the right of national  minorities to be "represented in the organs of power or under  their auspices," for which it offers to create a "consultative  structure in the shape of an Assembly of Peoples." The second  demand is the implementation of the right to national-cultural  autonomy, which can be "territorial and ex-territorial." The  CEAR is trying to "hold consultations with parties and  democratic political movements, and it is ready to cooperate  with them not in order to compete for seats in the Duma but  rather in order that the parties whose electorate we are ready  to join should take account of our interests and match them at  the legislative level."    Two days after the meeting with the Council of Europe  experts  there was a meeting with Yegor Gaydar which discussed the 1996  elections and the CEAR stance in them. As Mr. Spektor stated,  "we can become partners as we cooperate on certain questions if  some of the parties become our lobbyist."</p>

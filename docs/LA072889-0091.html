			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A dissident South Korean student trying to return from an unauthorized visit to  North Korea was turned back after marching to the border. Im Su Kyong, 20, and  a dissident South Korean priest led about 500 others in a rally in the truce  village of Panmunjom, about 35 miles north of Seoul, demanding that the  marchers be allowed to cross the border. The village is in the demilitarized  zone separating the two nations. Im and her group of peace marchers finally  turned back and marched north, with Im saying she would not cross the border  unless she is met by relatives and friends, officials said.  </P></p>

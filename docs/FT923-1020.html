			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Paris holds the fort on the franc - William Dawkins wonders how long economic rectitude will be tolerated FEAR and doubt have been part of currency speculators' motives for hammering the French franc in recent days. They appear to doubt that the unpopular French government can maintain the virtuous economic policies of the past decade and fear that the franc's link with the D-Mark will snap as a result - despite assurances from the Bundesbank, the Banque de France and most economic analysts that the franc/D-Mark parity is justified by France's past economic performance. There are, however, questions over French economic policy, even if the risks of deviation are slight by the standards of some of less economically stable neighbours. The national divisions exposed by the Maastricht campaign and the very narrowness of France's 'petit oui' for European union do not just imply popular dislike for the treaty. They also indicate discontent with the human costs of the government's policies of competitive disinflation, which are exactly in line with the treaty's criteria for monetary union. So France's close call over Maastricht invites the question of how much longer its electorate will tolerate rigorous monetary and economic policies and how the government might respond to this pressure. France has for eight years suffered among the highest rates of unemployment  -a record 2.9m or 10.3 per cent in July - in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the main blight on an otherwise resilient economy. This is partly a consequence of successive governments' rigid adherence to competitive disinflation and maintaining the franc/D-Mark parity, policies which leave almost no room for stimulating the domestic economy in hard times. Despite the government's entreaties to industry to show more optimism, output rose by a mere 1.25 per cent in real terms in 1991, according to the OECD, and should rise just 2 per cent this year. Even that will be hard to achieve, given that the latest survey from Insee, the state statistics institute, reports that growth practically ground to a halt in the second quarter of this year. The big reward of French government's monetary and budgetary rigour has been one of Europe's lowest inflation rates. France's annual inflation, currently at 2.7 per cent, dipped below Germany's in June 1991 for the first time since the early 1970s and looks set to hold that advantage. Just how tough has been the control in the money supply is underlined in the latest figures for bank credits, up 4.7 per cent in France in the first six months of the year, as against 11 per cent in Germany over the same period, according to Credit Lyonnais. All this has fed through to significant gains in industrial competitiveness, with hourly wage costs 16 per cent below those in Germany. The reward has been a sharp improvement in the trade balance, with a surplus of FFr19.35bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in the first eight months of this year, against a deficit of FFr29.6bn for the same period in 1991. Some of this has been due to a one-off surge in export demand from German unification, as underlined by the fact that France's trade account swung sharply into a FFr3bn deficit last month from a FFr6bn surplus in June. Even so, the French government is convinced that there is a real improvement in industrial competitiveness which will bring lasting gains on export markets. So far, successive governments have held the line, helped by a more or less solid consensus on economic policy. But last weekend, the political establishment received a slap in the face from the provincial electorate, which complains that the elite - whether in Paris or Brussels - is out of touch with its concerns. The shadow of legislative elections next March and a possible snap presidential election can only increase the temptation for political parties to deviate from the stern economic line of the past. The evidence against this happening, at least on the interest rate front, has been encouraging in the past few days. A U-turn by Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, is the prime example. He hinted last week that a Yes to Maastricht might open the way to lower French interest rates. But he did not hesitate to raise them on Wednesday when needed to defend the franc, even if it meant appearing to go back on his word only three days after the vote. 'As far as French interest rates are concerned, the sky is the limit. France is not like the UK. It will not let itself be beaten by the speculators,' argues Mr Bernard Godement, senior French economist at Nomura Research Institute. On budgetary policy, the outlook is less clear. Here, France is still a good pupil, but the record has slipped fractionally. The government has pledged to keep the budget deficit this year well below the 3 per cent of gross domestic product ceiling set out as a criterion for monetary union in the treaty. The OECD believes the deficit will come out at around 2.3 per cent of GDP this year. But it is on a rising trend, due mainly to the fall in tax revenues caused by the economic slowdown, but also to the government's need to spend on pressing social problems, such as job training for the unemployed and farmers' support. Until two years ago, the Socialist government had trimmed the deficit by FFr10bn or so a year, following the trend of the previous Gaullist administration. Since then, the deficit has crept up again, from 1.4 per cent of GDP in 1990 to 1.9 per cent last year, when it hit FFr131.7bn, well over the government's initial target. It could reach FFr150bn-FFr180bn this year, according to official and market estimates. The final figure will be known when the government tables its 1993 budget on September 30, a week late because of the turmoil in the currency markets. That could well give the markets the information they need to come to a more stable valuation of the franc.</p>

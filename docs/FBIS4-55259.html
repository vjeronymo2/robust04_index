			<p>BFN     [Text] At an expert meeting of the Association of Yugoslav  Engineers and Technicians, held at the Technical Fair in  Belgrade, Dr. Dragoslav Avramovic, governor of the National Bank  of Yugoslavia, stated that the country's taxation system will be  radically changed by the middle of this year at the latest. He  announced that the process of transformation of dinars into  foreign currency in our financial institutions will be  simplified very quickly. According to Professor Avramovic, the  third phase of the program of economic stabilization, that is to  say, the commencement of investments, could be expected in the  fall.    Exclusively for this newscast, the governor of the National  Bank of Yugoslavia also speaks about today's latest decisions of  the Council of Governors of the National Bank of Yugoslavia:    [Begin recording] [Reporter Dusko Petrovic] Mr. Governor,  today's session of the Council of the National Bank of  Yugoslavia was brief and efficient. Several important decisions  aimed at the revitalization of banks, the continued monitoring  of the economy, and the preservation of the growth of economic  activities, were passed. What were these decisions?    [Avramovic] We have reduced the mandatory reserve that the  banks have with the National Bank by a third, which will add to  the credit potential of the banks and thus alleviate or perhaps  even eliminate the shortage of funds that the economy has been  experiencing in its efforts to increase production. One of the  members of the council, Mr. Perucic from Beobanka, today  reiterated how acute this shortage of cash was precisely because  of this lucky circumstance, that is, the increase in production.  We hope that we will overcome this shortage with the measures  that have been taken last week and this week. If need be, we  shall proceed further in the coming week.    [Petrovic] Mr. Governor, please comment on the decision to  form 10 coordinating groups for the recovery of the economy with  the Serbian Government, whose initiator was Minister [without  portfolio] Dragan Tomic?    [Avramovic] Well, this is an extraordinary initiative. We  have been thinking about it, but not in terms of such  concentrated and extensive efforts that he had undertaken. We  expect all the best from it as the key to our future recovery  lies in the reconstruction of our production systems and big  companies. There could not have been a better initiative than  the creation of these coordinating groups, which will take care  of the reanimation of production, the marketing of products,  further investments, and the resolution of all problems that  some of our companies face.    [Petrovic] The Federal Government has recently released  bonds with an 11 percent interest rate onto the financial  market. You have assailed this measure as an attack on the  program.    [Avramovic] Yes. You know, we managed to agree with the  banks to keep the basic interest rate down to 9 percent so that  the economy would be able to obtain relatively cheap credits, I  mean, these are not cheap credits anyway. The situation was  particularly critical in agriculture. Then it came as a  surprise that the Federal Government had appeared on the market  with bonds of the highest value -- as the state bonds always are  -- and with such a high interest rate. However, I have heard  that they have suspended further emissions now. I hope that we  will resolve all this in a satisfactory manner.    [Petrovic] You were also resolute in your demands toward the  Federal Government to release state commodities and corn as soon  as possible. You have even said that the federal state will not  get a single dinar in credits unless it does this.    [Avramovic] Directly or indirectly -- through the federal,  republican, and local authorities -- the state has huge stocks.  All this will be spoiled if it is not put on the market as soon  as possible. The first consequence of this would be a drop in  prices, the second consequence a replenishment of the budget,  and the third consequence the making of an economic space for  the forthcoming harvest, which will be very good, as it seems.    [Petrovic] Thank you very much.    [Avramovic] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

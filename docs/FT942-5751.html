			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Plea for EU to guard against over-regulation: Questions on Europe Mr Percy Barnevik, 53, has been chief executive of the Swedish-Swiss international engineering group ABB Asea Brown Boveri since 1988. He was previously chief executive of Sweden's Asea. Q: Where should the European Union place its top priorities in economic and social policy? A: Priority No 1 is to resist the temptation to over-regulate. Instead, the EU should continue creating conditions for the free play of market forces. This includes the fight against protectionism - particularly involving central and eastern Europe, which badly needs to increase trade. It also includes the completion of the single market and initiatives for joint public and private transeuropean networks in the transport, energy and telecommunications sectors to lead European economies out of the present recession. Q: Do you believe the European parliament should be given greater powers? A: I am a great believer in parliamentary control of governments and therefore favour giving the European parliament the means to exercise this control. However, I realise the parliament's power has been increased through the Maastricht treaty, so we must now guard against too much bureaucracy which could paralyse the European legislation process. Q: What is the earliest date at which EU membership by former communist countries might be practicable? A: We must allow no delays for the target year of 2000 for the EU membership of the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland. Q: Has the single market expanded your business opportunities throughout Europe? A: The single market has clearly started to expand business opportunities through the liberalisation of public procurement and facilitation of cross-border traffic. There is, of course, no guarantee for entrepreneurial success - all these measures have increased competition and thereby tend to decrease margins. . . . to be a winner you have to be even leaner, more efficient and attractive to the customers. The losers will be the ones who cling to remaining protection and who ask for government support. Q: Does the choice of the next president to the European Commission matter to you? Whom would you prefer to see in the job? A: I would wish that the most capable candidate gets the job and not just the politically most opportune one; for example, a 'lowest common denominator' which sometimes happens when people cannot agree. Europe needs a strong leader.</p>

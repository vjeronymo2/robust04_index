			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Romania's President Ion Iliescu has issued a  statement in connection with yesterday's attack in Sarajevo.  [passage omitted]    In press statements, other figures of Romania's political  scene have also reacted to the attack in Sarajevo. Thus, the  president of the Democratic Party (National Salvation Front),  [PD-FSN] Petre Roman, emphasized that, when it comes to human  lives, no effort is too great to save them and nothing can be  viewed as too insignificant when these human lives disappear.  The time has definitely come for the international community  and what is termed will for peace to finally adopt radical  measures based on the law, on the right to life.    Ion Diaconescu, vice president of the National Peasant  Christian Democratic Party, [PNTCD] emphasized in his statement  that it is crazy to kill innocent people and that what happened  in Sarajevo compels world powers to do all they can to halt this  tragedy.    The president of the Agrarian Democratic Party of Romania  [PDAR], Victor Surdu, stressed that the long-standing tragedy  that is taking place not far from Romania's borders concerns and  worries us. The numerous victims in Sarajevo's history testify  to the illogical and absurd nature of this conflict. The time  has come for international organizations to manifest greater  determination and urge the adoption of solutions, which will put  a halt to this tragedy.    Mrs. Ana Blandiana, Civic Alliance president, pointed out in  here statement that the tragedy in Sarajevo has the same roots  and is linked to the tragedy in Tiraspol and Chisinau, and to  all the suffering in the periphery of the former Soviet empire  in which the conservative forces are striving to reestablish  their domination, regardless of the costs. What is terrible,  however, Mrs. Blandiana emphasized, is the fact that everything  is also linked to a general indifference -- from the  indifference of the great powers to that of individuals in  general.</p>

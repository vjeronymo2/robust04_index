			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Stora invests SKr550m in plant upgrades Stora of Sweden, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, yesterday announced new investments worth SKr550m (Dollars 74m) to be spent over the next year on its programme of upgrading processing plants and paper-making machines, writes Hugh Carnegy in Stockholm. Most of the new investments, part of annual development spending totalling almost SKr3.5bn, will go on a new wood processing facility at Gruvon in Sweden. The others include rebuilding a paper machine at Uetersen in Germany. The investments will not add to Stora's overall capacity; a decision is not expected until next year on whether the group's chief project to expand capacity - a SKr2.8bn board-making machine - will go ahead.</p>

			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Football club finds profitable venue Newcastle United Football Club's strip, which costs Pounds 32.99, will be found by thousands of native and adopted Geordies in their Christmas stockings tomorrow. At one time clubs expected fans to trek to their grounds to buy merchandise. But this Christmas more than a score of clubs have discovered the potential of a city-centre retail pitch. This follows a link between Newcastle United and Littlewoods, the chain-store operator. Sales far exceeded United's expectations when it opened a concession in Littlewoods' Northumberland Street branch in Newcastle upon Tyne in August. This prompted concessions by other clubs in their local Littlewoods in time for Christmas. Mr Frank Brettle, general manager of Littlewoods' Newcastle store, said: 'Once it was (Ninja) turtles, now it's Mr Blobby but as far as I'm concerned the great thing in the UK is football merchandise.' Mr Brettle said most retailers would be delighted to achieve Pounds 20 of sales per sq ft a week. His store's Newcastle United shop, however, is turning over Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000 a week - about Pounds 150 per sq ft. Mrs Hazel Hebron, Newcastle United's retail sales manager, said sales of club merchandise in the 1993-94 season would exceed Pounds 2m, well up on 1992-93.</p>

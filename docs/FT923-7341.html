			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Consumers blame banks for credit cards not being fraud-proof CONSUMERS blame the banks for not making credit cards more fraud-proof, according to a Mori survey for Readers' Digest, David Barchard writes. About 2m payment cards are lost or stolen each year in the UK, with losses of around Pounds 166m for the banks. Two out of three people interviewed blamed the banks for failing to do more to make cards fraud-proof, while 69 per cent believed shops should make more rigorous checks. Of 2,049 cardholders interviewed, 58 per cent said they would not pay extra for a photo-card or a thief-proof smart card. Some 27 per cent said they would pay Pounds 2 or more for additional security. A third of cardholders admitted they had written down their personal identification numbers. More than one in 20 kept their PIN number with their card.</p>

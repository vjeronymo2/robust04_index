			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Venture capital boosted THE UK venture capital industry bounced back last year, increasing investments by 15 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn as venture capitalists took advantage of cheaper investment opportunities created by the reces-sion. The annual report of the British Venture Capital Association, published today, says the rise in 1992 compares with a 17 per cent investment fall in 1991. There were no signs of a shift away from the less risky, later-stage investments which accounted for 57 per cent of deals by number and 29 per cent by value. Management buy-outs and buy-ins accounted for 26 per cent of deals by number and 64 per cent by value. Early-stage investments accounted for 17 per cent of deals and just 7 per cent of sums invested. British venture capitalists invested in a total of 1,297 companies around the world last year, with 88 per cent or Pounds 1.2bn of investments in 1,147 companies in the UK. Consumer-related businesses continued to dominate investments by sector, attracting 32 per cent of the amounts invested. The south-east accounted for the largest number of investments by region, attracting Pounds 550m of funds, or 44 per cent of the total, but this was directly proportionate the the region's share of business activity. Across the rest of the UK investment was spread fairly evenly by region. The association said the 1992 figures included for the first time loans directly linked to equity investments by the same venture capital group, so they were not directly comparable with previous years. 1992 Report on Investment Activity.

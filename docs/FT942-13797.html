			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (5): Sales will help balances - Banking is approaching a milestone Next June should be a milestone for Egypt's banking system. If the four public sector banks, National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, Banque du Caire, and Bank of Alexandria stick to the government's stated intentions, by June they should have announced plans to sell their shares in about a dozen joint venture commercial banks to the private sector. These shares constitute the 'jewels in the crown' among the assets on the books of public sector banks. Their sale is intended to strengthen their balance sheets, before they in turn are privatised according to the timetable discussed between the government, the IMF and World Bank. Cairo bankers say that defining the different categories of bank is about as straightforward as local interpretation of the highway code. The four public sector banks dominate national retail and domestic credit with about 70 per cent of deposits and local corporate assets. Apart from these four there are more than 40 commercial banks: a mixture of domestic public and private sector joint ventures; private sector foreign and local joint-ventures; foreign commercial banks which are allowed to deal in local currency - among these some which offer investment banking services; foreign banks which have not met the extra Dollars 15m capital requirement and are therefore restricted to foreign currencies (some of these last also offer investment banking services like private banking). There are also some 15 investment banks which are defined as such, including international Arab banks and off-shore banking units and at least one with special status. Finally there are about 30 domestic regional development banks, some of which are commercial banks, others specialist industrial or agricultural. The central bank, in its latest annual report (for the fiscal year July 1 1992-June 30 1993) notes that the securities' portfolios of all banks in this period amounted to 49.8 per cent of their total loan portfolios, and that T-bill holdings made up 89.7 per cent of these securities. 'In the last year there were limited first-class lending opportunities,' one joint-venture banker said in March. But banks' earnings held up well, because until last autumn all banks could arbitrage on these T-bills, available to foreign investors as well as local banks. All banks could get extra funds at 14-15 per cent from the interbank market, while paying only 9.5-10.5 per cent on customer deposits. The surplus liquidity was going into T-bills. 'It was a good margin and tax-free after all expenses,' said one banker. Then the central bank realised the extent to which commercial banks were 'just playing the market,' and barred private commercial banks from bidding. Now only public sector banks can bid. But there are opportunities from trade financing and short-term corporate lending. Egyptian British Bank increased profits by 270 per cent last fiscal year (to June 30) by improving market share and trade financing, but like most local and joint-venture banks it made little headway in retail or consumer lending. 'The timing is not right to push consumer lending,' says one private sector banker. The appointment last October of Mr Ismail Hassan, the former head of bank of Alexandria, smallest of the four public sector banks, as central bank governor, was generally well-received. He is credited in some quarters with having successfully restructured Misr American International Bank. 'He is not an initiator,' one banker remarked. Another added: 'But everything moves slowly here and that is the natural pace.' Among joint-venture banks Misr International is held up as 'well-run'. It is a fairly typical example of a polyglot public and private sector bank with foreign and domestic shareholdings. Egyptian-American is a joint venture between Bank of Alexandria (which has a stake in no fewer than four joint venture banks) and American Express, which is also a partner in Egyptian-American bank. In addition, Amex in its own right is one of four foreign banks allowed to deal in local currency. The others are Citibank, Jordan's Arab Bank and Credit Lyonnais. Others expected to increase their capital by the required Dollars 15m to get their licence amended so they could deal in local currency, but which have not done so, include Bank of America, Banque Paribas and Credit Suisse. Banca Commerciale Italiana has pulled out altogether. Paribas is counter-guaranteeing the first - Dollars 8.8m - corporate bond issue for the German joint-venture Hoechst Orient. By the end of March, however, after long delays waiting for members of the Capital Markets Authority to be appointed, this had still not received the go-ahead from the CMA. Commercial International Bank (CIB) is an example not only of the polyglot nature of some banks' shareholdings, but also of the strength and weaknesses of the capital markets and the investing public. A year ago it decided to raise about Dollars 115m through a public offering to increase its paid-up capital. Prior to that some shares were held by the staff, but to all intents and purposes, National Bank of Egypt had full control. The issue last October was 50 per cent oversubscribed. Some of the new shares were bought by the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector affiliate; others by two Saudi institutions. More than half the subscribers were individual investors. CIB's earnings in the run-up to the share issue had been very good: 20 per cent annual compound growth based on shares of EPounds 100 par value. However, when CIB floated it was at a share price of EPounds 250. 'It will be very difficult to sustain such a growth based on that share price,' said one foreign banker, 'and too many individuals will not have appreciated this. This market is not an emerging market; it is 'pre-emerging' in the level of investors' understanding and the lack of any stock market.' What worries professional bankers, Arab and western, who remain unconvinced by high-sounding statements of intent from officials about liberalising the economy, is that there is not only less growth and more poverty, but also that the public sector still has a stranglehold: 75 per cent of GDP compared with 80 per cent in 1991. 'Let's see what happens in June; that will be the litmus test,' says one.</p>

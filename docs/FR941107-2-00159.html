			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Applicants see no significant legal impediment to permitting ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding. Nor do Applicants believe that ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding will have any adverse federal income tax consequences. Applicants represent that separate accounts organized as unit investment trusts historically have been employed to accumulate shares of mutual funds which have not been affiliated with the depositor or sponsor of the separate account. Accordingly, Applicants request an order of the Commission exempting the Participating Insurance Companies and their Separate Accounts (and, as necessary, any principal underwriter and depositor of each such Separate Account) from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a), and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, and Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request relief under Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act for the class of insurers and Separate Accounts investing in the Fund (and principal underwriters and depositors of such Separate Accounts). Applicants represent that there is ample precedent, in a variety of contexts, for granting exemptive relief not only to applicants in a given case, but also to members of the class not currently identified that may be similarly situated in the future. Applicants further represent that such class relief has been granted from a number of the provisions of the 1940 Act. Applicants note that the Commission staff will have an opportunity to review the compliance by Participating Insurance Companies with the conditions of the requested order at the time each Separate Account files its registration statement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) provides partial exemptions from Sections 9(a), 13(a), 15(a) and 15(b) of the 1940 Act, only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all of the assets of which consist of the shares of one or more registered investment companies (``underlying fund(s)'') which offer their shares `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exclusively <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to variable life insurance separate accounts of the life insurer or any affiliated life insurance company'' (emphasis supplied). The exemptions are not available to a scheduled premium variable life insurance separate account that owns shares of an underlying fund that also offers its shares to a variable annuity separate account of the same insurance company or any unaffiliated insurance company. Nor is the relief granted by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) available if the underlying fund also offers its shares to separate accounts funding variable contracts of unaffiliated life insurance companies. In short, Rule 6e&hyph;2 permits neither ``mixed'' nor ``shared'' funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Rule 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) provides exemptions similar to those provided by Rule 6e&hyph;2(b)(15), only if the separate account is organized as a unit investment trust, all of the assets of which consist of shares of underlying funds which offer their shares `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> exclusively <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to separate accounts of the life insurer, or of any affiliated life insurance company offering either scheduled contracts or flexible contracts, or both; or which also offer their shares to variable annuity separate accounts of the life insurer or of an affiliated life insurance company, or which offer their shares to any such life insurance company in consideration solely for advances made by the life insurer in connection with the operation of the separate account'' (emphasis supplied). In short, Rule 6e&hyph;3(T) permits mixed funding with respect to a flexible premium variable life insurance separate account, but it does not permit shared funding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Section 9(a) of the 1940 Act provides that it is unlawful for any company to serve as investment adviser or principal underwriter of any registered open&hyph;end investment company if an affiliated person of that company is subject to a disqualification enumerated in Section 9(a) (1) or (2) of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) (i) and (ii) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) (i) and (ii) under the 1940 Act provide exemptions from Section 9(a) under certain circumstances, subject to the limitations on ``mixed'' and ``shared'' funding imposed by the 1940 Act and the rules promulgated thereunder. These exemptions limit the application of the eligibility restrictions to affiliated individuals or companies that participate directly in the management of the underlying registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants state that the partial relief from the requirements of Section 9 of the 1940 Act granted in Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(B)(15), in effect, limits the amount of monitoring necessary to ensure compliance with Section 9 to that which is appropriate in light of the policy and purposes of Section 9. Applicants state that Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) recognize that neither the protection of investors nor the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940 Act requires the application of the provisions of Section 9(a) to the many individuals in a large insurance company complex, most of whom will have no involvement in matters pertaining to investment companies in that organization. Applicants further state that Rules 6e&hyph;2(b)(15) and 6e&hyph;3(T)(b)(15) recognize that it is unnecessary to apply Section 9(a) to individuals in various unaffiliated insurance companies (or affiliated companies of Participating Insurance Companies) that may utilize the Fund as the funding medium for variable contracts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants assert that no regulatory purpose is served by extending the Section 9(a) monitoring requirements in the event of ``mixed'' or ``shared'' funding. In this regard, Applicants note that the Participating Insurance Companies are not expected to play any role in the management or administration of the Fund; those individuals who currently participate in the management or administration of the Fund will remain the same regardless of which Separate Accounts or insurance companies use the Fund. For these reasons, Applicants submit that applying the monitoring requirements of Section 9(a) because of investment by separate accounts of other insurers would be unjustified and would not serve any regulatory purpose. Applicants further submit that increased monitoring costs would reduce the net rates of return realized by contract owners. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

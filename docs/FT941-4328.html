			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf Foods pushes up fourth-quarter earnings Maple Leaf Foods, Canada's biggest food processor which is 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown Holdings overcame a slump in its grocery and food-service businesses to report a 25 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. The improvement reflected a three-year shake-up in Maple Leaf's poultry, pork and other agri-food businesses, where operating profits jumped by 44 per cent for 1993. Aggregate fourth-quarter earnings rose to CDollars 22.4m (Pounds 11m), or 28 cents a share, from CDollars 17.8m, or 22 cents a share. Sales climbed to CDollars 881.6m (Pounds 433m) from CDollars 739.5m. Earnings from continuing operations for the year were virtually unchanged at CDollars 70.1m (CDollars 69.2m), or 87 cents a share (86 cents). Bakery operations produced 'excellent' results last year, partly offset by a disappointing flour-milling performance. Operating earnings of the consumer-foods side fell to CDollars 11.4m from CDollars 32.4m. The prepared meats and grocery businesses were hit by lower volumes and tighter margins in an intensely competitive market. The sale of the lossmaking food-service side should contribute to an improvement in the division's results.</p>

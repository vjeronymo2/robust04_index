			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / The Budget (Analysis): Helping the smallest offenders, but doing little for the big fish - Changes to VAT Rules SOME of the harshest VAT penalties are being softened though the basic rules, which have been much criticised, remain unchanged. Traders who make 'serious misdeclarations' and pay or declare too little VAT are liable to stiff penalties, even if the errors are honest ones. Penalties will now be reduced to 15 per cent of the amount misdeclared, from the current rate of 20 per cent. This follows a reduction last year from 30 per cent. A misdeclaration of Pounds 2,000 will not attract the penalty at all. This will take out many of the current penalties, affecting mainly the smaller company. The penalty has been much criticised by traders, since it applies, for example, to a business which reports VAT in the wrong quarter of the year by mistake. Whether it is charged at 20 per cent or 30 per cent, these criticisms will still be valid. There is also to a cut in the rate of the default surcharge payable by a trader who submits a return late unless there is a 'reasonable excuse'. The rate of the surcharge is to be reduced to 20 per cent from the current 30 per cent, but there are no proposals to change the rules on what constitutes a reasonable excuse. The reduction will be welcome news to the smaller business which finds the quarterly reporting difficult to meet, and regularly submits returns late, but a 20 per cent fine on a delay for traders who have a short term lapse is likely to remain highly unpopular. The proposal will therefore do little to ease the workload of VAT tribunals, which spend much of their time hearing cases of appeal against the default surcharge. There will be a further review of the penalties arrangements, however. A consultative document has been issued. The introduction of the new VAT proposals for the single market, from 1 January 1993, will eliminate import procedures that have been a source of cash flow for the Trea - sury. In October last year Customs announced that they were to introduce a monthly VAT accounting system affecting roughly 200 big companies that accounted for more than Pounds 2m VAT each year. There were two concerns. One that these companies would incur cash flow costs themselves in order to fund the Treasury. Nothing has been done to relieve that cost. The second was that there would be significant disruption and costs involved in accounting on a monthly basis. The costs involved have been estimated at as much as Pounds 1m for some of the larger companies. Companies had asked that at least to avoid these costs they should be able to make payments on account, and this has now been accepted. Payments on account will start in November this year. A number of companies were planning action in the courts to challenge Customs' imposition of the monthly charge. They will be considering their response over the next few days.

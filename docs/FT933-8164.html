			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Copenhagen SE to launch money market future THE FIRST money market future to be launched on the Copenhagen stock exchange will be introduced on September 22, the fifth anniversary of the start of the futures and options market there. The Guarantee Fund for Futures and Options announced that the new future will be based on the three-month Cibor (Copenhagen interbank offer rate), the interest rate at which banks and savings banks are able to deposit kroner uncollateralised for three months with a prime bank. The introduction of a money market future will mean that Copenhagen can offer investors, including foreign investors, a full range of futures and options, which already exist for government bonds, long-term mortgage bonds and the KFX index of most-traded shares. The contract size for the Cibor futures will be DKr5m, with maturities of three and six months. Settlement dates will be two business days before the third Wednesday in March, June, September and December, which are also known as the international money market days. 'When the Cibor futures are successfully launched, we will consider launching options on Cibor futures and maybe also other money market instruments,' said Mr Tyge Vorstrup Rasmussen, chief executive officer of the Guaranteee Fund.</p>

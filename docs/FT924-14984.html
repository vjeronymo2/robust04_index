			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Buying costs clip Manchester United 6% to Pounds 5.06m SPENDING on players reduced pre-tax profit at Manchester United, the Premier League football club, by 6 per cent in its first full year as a quoted company. Although profit before transfer fees went up by 24 per cent to Pounds 7.68m (Pounds 6.18m), net spending of Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 801,000) on players - including defender Paul Parker and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel - cut the pre-tax outcome to Pounds 5.06m (Pounds 5.38m). To draw attention to the fact that the players represent an investment, rather than simply a drain on profits, United said it had commissioned an independent valuation by Touche Ross, the accountants, which estimated that the squad was worth Pounds 24m. Not that this figure was being put on the balance sheet, said Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive and holder of 28 per cent of the shares. Mr Robin Launders, finance director, suggested that the share price, which rose from 282p to 289p yesterday (still 96p below the flotation price), was discounting net spending of at least Pounds 2m on players this year. So far the Pounds 1m paid out for striker Dion Dublin (who has since broken his leg) has been balanced by disposals. With a further Pounds 250,000 added to the transfer reserve, it could support spending of Pounds 3.35m on players. Turnover in the year to July 31 rose 13 per cent to Pounds 20.1m thanks to higher attendances - the average gate for league games at Old Trafford was 45,000 - and higher prices. Gate receipts rose to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds 9.2m). Income from sponsorship, catering and the club shop rose by between 9 and 14 per cent. The only decline came in television revenue, from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds 1.84m. Mr Edwards said that the club had totted up 110 hours of television the previous year, when it won the European Cup Winners Cup. This year the Premier League deal with BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, would bring in about Pounds 1.8m. Other television income might add another Pounds 1m. Operating profit advanced by 8 per cent to Pounds 6.26m (Pounds 5.79m). Interest income rose to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 385,000) and the amount of cash held increased to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.1m). This was after capital spending of nearly Pounds 4m, including the first Pounds 2m of an estimated Pounds 10m on the new Stretford End stand. Mr Launders said that this season building work has reduced capacity from 47,000 to less than 34,000. However, price rises and the reduction in the number of cheaper terrace tickets had raised the average match revenue per person from Pounds 9 to Pounds 13.10. Next season the capacity would rise again to 43,000. A final dividend of 12p makes a total of 18p, compared with 17.4p forecast at flotation. Earnings per share improved from 17.8p to 27.6p after the transfer fund appropriation, or to 29.7p, compared with 37p, before it. See Observer</p>

Steamship Co., Ltd.; Notice of Application for Waiver of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 804(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as Amended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> By application of November 21, 1994, Lykes Bros. Steamship Co., Inc. (Lykes) requests a waiver of the provisions of section 804 of the Act so as to permit it to time charter up to four 2,400 TEU containerships under foreign registry in the trade between ports on the U.S. gulf and east coast and north Europe.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The vessels for which a waiver is sought are now under construction in a German shipyard for a U.S. documentation citizen owner. The first vessel is scheduled for delivery in March 1995 with the remaining vessels to be delivered at three month intervals thereafter. Lykes has committed to time charter these vessels on a long term basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The likely itinerary of the vessels according to Lykes will be Galveston, New Orleans, Miami, Charleston, Norfolk, New York, Boston, Antwerp, Bremerhaven, Felixstowe, and LeHavre.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For quite some time now, Lykes notes that it, just as other subsidized carriers, has been unable to acquire modern efficient subsidy eligible tonnage at world prices. Lykes contends that it is essential for Lykes to upgrade the fleet of vessels available to it in order to maintain its competitive position in the trade and to meet the needs of its customer base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lykes concludes that failure to grant this application would deprive it of the use of these modern vessels and the revenue they will generate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This application may be inspected in the Office of the Secretary, Maritime Administration. Any person, firm, or corporation having any interest in such request within the meaning of section 804 of the Act and desiring to submit comments concerning the application must file written comments in triplicate with the Secretary, Maritime Administration, Room 7210, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, D.C. 20590. Comments must be received no later than 5:00 p.m. on December 19, 1994. This notice is published as a matter of discretion and publication should in no way be considered a favorable or unfavorable decision on the application, as filed or as may be amended. The Maritime Administrator will consider any comments submitted and take such action with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=4 --> (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Program No. 20.804) (Operating-Differential Subsidies)).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Dated: November 30, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> By Order of the Maritime Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=4 --> Joel C.

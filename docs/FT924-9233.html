			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / BP profit beats analysts' forecasts BRITISH Petroleum, the UK oil group, pleasantly surprised the City by disclosing a replacement cost profit of Pounds 172m for the third quarter, up from Pounds 129m in the same period last year. The figures were well above analysts' forecasts of between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m. BP shares rose 2p to 225p. On a historic cost basis, which does not take into account oil price changes, profits fell Pounds 39m to Pounds 117m. 'These are pleasantly surprising results, and it's a long time since you have been able to say that about BP - at least without immediately being able to drive a double-decker bus through the figures,' said Mr Fergus MacLeod, analyst with County NatWest in Edinburgh. Mr David Simon, BP chief executive, said BP was set to achieve the goals he outlined in August, when the company halved its dividend and wrote off Pounds 1bn of restructuring costs and assets. 'We believe we have got the financial position under control,' he said. BP was on target to achieve Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 972m) of disposals this year, and was confident of Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn of disposals next year, he added. The cost-cutting programme was progressing 'satisfactorily', and together with a cut in capital expenditure next year to Dollars 5bn would allow BP to start paying off debt, he added. The company paid back Pounds 351m of debt in the third quarter, although with 85 per cent of BP's debt in dollars, the stronger dollar meant gearing was virtually unchanged at 88 per cent. The third quarter result was helped by lower taxation and interest charges, and currency movements added Pounds 36m to profits, but provision was made for an expected loss of Pounds 85m on the sale of BP's holding in the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia. Earnings per share were down from 2.9p to 2.2p, with the third-quarter dividend at 2.1p. Exploration and production enjoyed a 'resilient' performance, boosted by the UK Miller field and the Kutubu field in Papua New Guinea, which came on stream in June. Refining and marketing increased its profit from the second quarter through improved margins in marketing. However, the chemicals division showed a profit only thanks to Pounds 22m of divestments.

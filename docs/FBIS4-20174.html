			<p>BFN     [Text] Spain and Sweden have called on other countries to  contribute more UN troops to Bosnia. The call came during the  visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana Madariaga to  Sweden.    The two countries have sent around 1,200 troops each to the  UN protection forces in Bosnia. Solana Madariaga and Swedish  Foreign Minister Margaretha af Ugglas say a sizeable UN presence  is necessary in the former Yugoslavia to avoid a spread of  hostilities.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government decided on 14 May its basic policy  for the "ASEAN Regional Forum" scheduled in July. This forum  will be the first ministerial-level meeting on the security  issues of the Asia Pacific region. With the major aim of  building confidence among nations in this region, Japanese  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, who will attend this meeting,  will urge the participating countries to "enhance transparency  of their military capability." Japan particularly intends to  call on Southeast Asian countries and China, which are said not  to be conscious of the importance of transparency, to compile  "white papers" on national defense affairs. However, since this  is the first security conference with China and Russia, Japan  will not hastily seek a conclusion on how to deal with the  Korean peninsula issue at this conference.    This forum will open in Bangkok on 25 July prior to the  Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference. Apart from the six  ASEAN nations, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,  Singapore, and Brunei, Japan, the United States, Australia,  China, and Russia are among the 18 participating nations in the  conference. Foreign ministers from these countries will freely  exchange their views on the security system in the Asia Pacific  region.    Thailand, host country of this conference, proposes to  discuss the "security situation in the Asia Pacific region."  The Japanese Government will dispatch Deputy Vice Foreign  Minister Hiroshi Fukuda to attend a senior working-level meeting  of the Enlarged ASEAN Foreign Ministers Conference scheduled in  Bangkok from 22 to 25 May to discuss details of the agenda,  including Japan's proposal.    At the security forum, Kakizawa will make a speech to  explain  Japan's basic policy to the participating countries. Japan  believes that "the Asia Pacific region needs to form a new  security framework to deal with the situation after the end of  the Cold War. As a prerequisite to this, it is important to  build confidence among the countries in this region." Based on  this idea, he will stress in his speech the need for improving  transparency of military and defense capabilities of each  country. Most participating countries, except Japan, the United  States, and Australia, have not disclosed the actual state of  their military capabilities. Therefore, Japan will request the  countries concerned to work out "white papers" equivalent to  Japan's Defense White Paper.    Behind Japan's proposal is the fact that moves to strengthen  military capabilities are noted in China and Indonesia, and the  ASEAN nations have also begun to engage in a military buildup.    Kakizawa further intends to suggest the following: 1)  exchange of views on various issues, such as how to cooperate in  disaster relief and UN Peacekeeping Operations (PKO); 2)  establishing a system to prevent arms proliferation, including  nuclear weapons, within the region; 3) exchange of views of  private-sector think tanks dealing with security issues. He  also plans to discuss Japan's stance that the international  community should unite in dealing with regional issues, such as  the alleged nuclear arms development by the DPRK (North Korea).</p>

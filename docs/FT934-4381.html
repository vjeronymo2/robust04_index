			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Survey of Japanese Industry (7): GM deal highlights challenges - The Car Industry Late last month, GM and Toyota, the world's largest and second-largest carmakers, signed a deal that highlights some of the big challenges facing the Japanese car industry. The agreement calls for Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, to sell 20,000 GM cars a year in Japan under the Toyota nameplate. While the volume of GM cars Toyota has agreed to sell in Japan is miniscule, compared with the hundreds of thousands of cars Toyota sells in the US, it represents a significant victory for GM in opening up the Japanese car market to US competition. The US carmaker not only won agreement from Toyota to open up its distribution network to sell a competitor's car, it even managed to set a target for average annual sales. Whether they like it or not, Japanese carmakers are going to face greater competition than ever before from the US Big Three carmakers in their own market. And if the recent deal between Toyota and GM is any guide, the competition is likely to be dictated to a growing extent by political pressures that are not directly related to market competitiveness. While GM and Toyota were negotiating their latest deal, US and Japanese government officials were bickering over a possible agreement to prise open the Japanese car and car parts market to greater foreign penetration. One of the most contentious issue in these talks has been the US insistence on setting quantitative indicators which would show progress in opening up the Japanese markets for cars and car parts. Although the Japanese government has refused to agree to such targets in what it calls the interests of free trade, the agreement between GM and Toyota leaves an uneasy feeling that the US side has won a small but significant concession to its aims even though there has been no apparent official prodding of a deal between the two companies. The threat of US carmakers to the Japanese in their own market is by no means critical. But the timing of their onslaught could not have been worse. For the past few years, Japan's car industry has been suffering under the impact of a consumer reaction to the high-spending years of the late 1980s. During those years consumers went on a buying binge that led to overoptimistic assumptions in the industry about demand for cars and the necessary levels of production capacity. Those assumptions in turn led to over-investment in facilities, a proliferation of models and options and bloated corporate structures. Nissan, for example, invested heavily in automation while Mazda built up an ambitious five-channel distribution strategy. As the domestic slump has persisted, it has become apparent that the expansion in domestic demand on which they had based their future strategies, is no longer there. The situation has forced Japanese carmakers to scale back their ambitions, cutting deeply into capital expenditure and other costs and trimming their corporate structures. A moderate consolidation has been taking place as the increasingly crowded Japanese market for passenger cars has begun to put pressure on the weaker players. Isuzu, for example, has decided to pull out of car manufacture and rely on other makers to fill its product line-up. Companies such as Mazda and Honda have conceded that they can no longer expect to do everything themselves and, like Isuzu, are resorting to original equipment manufacture deals, to provide them with products they cannot justify developing on their own. Meanwhile, the domestic market has continued its relentless slide, leading many carmakers to announce a downward revision of production plans. Nissan recently decided to extend the temporary closure of facilities for two more days in order to cut back on production as well as costs. Mazda has decided to introduce a temporary closure period that will affect production levels of all its models. When they announced worsening business results for the half-year period to September last month, the carmakers remained cautious about the prospects for recovery in the near term. Against this background of gloomy prospects at home, pressure on their overseas operations has been just as damaging. The yen's sharp appreciation against other leading currencies this year has undermined profits in overseas markets as well as reducing their competitiveness against local manufacturers. The plunge in demand for cars in Europe's main markets has upset their plans for expansion in that market. Nissan has had to advertise for applicants for a voluntary retirement scheme at its UK plant as market conditions in Europe have failed to improve. In the US, where the economic recovery has helped business improve somewhat, Japanese carmakers face growing competition from their US rivals which have begun to close the gap with them in manufacturing quality. These changes which have created a business environment that is markedly different from the high growth days which Japanese carmakers had long grown accustomed to are forcing these companies to re-think their corporate strategies. In the past, the aim of most Japanese carmakers was quite clearly to increase market share in key markets, and use that growth as the basis for the company's own expansion. Once it has become difficult to expect growth in worldwide markets, companies have gradually been shifting the emphasis to improving profitability. They have been doing so not only through efforts to raise efficiency in both product development and manufacturing, but also through a company-wide review of the performance of white collar workers. Toyota, Nissan and Honda have all introduced programmes aimed at getting better value out of their office workers. While Toyota aims to raise white collar efficiency by about 30 per cent, Nissan and Honda have introduced performance-related pay schemes. Whether or not these initiatives pay off has yet to be seen. What is clear, however, is that the singleness of purpose - growth at all costs - that served Japanese carmakers so well in the past, is looking increasingly inappropriate in the changed market environment. For Japanese carmakers, the US Big Three to which they provided their own manufacturing know-how not so long ago, may not seem likely role models in shaping their future corporate strategies. But given the recently improved performance of the US carmakers, Toyota may yet have something to learn in its part as GM salesman.</p>

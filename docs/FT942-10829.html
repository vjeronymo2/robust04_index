			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Post Office talks to City on sell-off Mr Bill Cockburn, chief executive of the Post Office, has held detailed talks with a senior team from SG Warburg about how best to privatise the corporation. The talks are the furthest the corporation has gone in pursuing privatisation. Senior executives are keen to push ahead with a partial privatisation, even though the government has yet to announce the results of a review of the Post Office's future. Mr Cockburn said: 'If the government decides to privatise the Post Office all the indications are that investors looking at our business find it a very attractive proposition. Warburg is confirming this.' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has said there is a strong case for privatising Royal Mail, a subsidiary of the Post Office, although he has conceded that political issues make it difficult to do so. Mr Cockburn, while careful not to call publicly for privatisation, wants the government to act speedily if it has decided to sell. He said yesterday his preferred method was to float Royal Mail along with the parcels division, which the government is already committed to selling. 'If the government want to privatise the Post Office, it makes best commercial sense to keep the Royal Mail and parcels together as one company. No other post office has hived off its parcels division.' Mr Cockburn feels that the Post Office's public obligation to provide a parcel service through the country, in contrast to its 4,000 privately owned competitors, gives it a natural fit with letters. However, Mr Cockburn warned that the government would have to be careful not to over-regulate a privatised Post Office, which could depress profits and share price. He believes ministers may be encouraged towards privatisation by the strong interest in any UK postal sale shown by institutional shareholders. Hoare Govett has reported similar investor interest in a UK sale. Hoare Govett is the UK stockbroker owned by ABN Amro, the global co-ordinator in the privatisation of Koninklijke PTT Nederland, the state-owned Dutch telecom and postal group. Mr Nick Verey, deputy chairman of Warburg, is expected to explain his proposals for privatising the Post Office at a Westminster and City conference next month. Warburg is the lead UK regional manager in the Dutch postal privatisation due to take place next month.</p>

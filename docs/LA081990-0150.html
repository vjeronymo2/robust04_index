			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSED ON MULL  </P> <P> In our estimation, Bill Gale ("Best Thing to Mull Over in Scotland is Nothing,"  July 29) missed a fine opportunity during his visit to Mull, Scotland.  </P> <P> On a headland directly across from Oban stands the ancient but fully  operational and lived-in-to-this-day Duart Castle.  </P> <P> It's the ancient home of the McLeans of Mull, not to be confused with the  McLains, who are a mainland clan. The McLean, chief of the clan, is in  residence today, or was a few years ago when we had an audience with him on a  visit to Mull.  </P> <P> Coincidentally, the Scottish side of Dexter's family were Rankins who were  pipers for the McLeans, and my McLean blood comes down from a former Supreme  Court Justice of the same name. Gale, of course, may have Campbell or Argyll  antecedents that could account for his laxity or oversight. Believe me, it  would be worth another trip to Mull for him just to fill that apparent void in  his education.  </P> <P> NICHOLAS McLEAN  </P> <P> TRAPNELL JR.  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

"February will soon be over, but wages have not been paid  even for January," writes a worker from a Moscow engineering  works. According to the works manager, "workshops are packed  with ready-made products which are not paid for by customers.  Non-payments topped one billion roubles".    In this connection, the newspaper cites the opinion of  professor Valeriy Vorontsov, adviser to a Russian vice-premier.  The government's economic and social policy, he writes, "should  be conducted in such a way as to permit able-bodied citizens  earn as much as it would be enough for their high living  standards".    In the next few days, the government will discuss, he  continued, "the guidelines of social policy for 1994" where it  will be worded as a concrete programme "for the first time over  the past years".    The TRUD newspaper features a interview with Gavriil Popov,  leader of the Russian Movement of Democratic Reforms, who  spelled out his ideas on how to pull the country out of the  political and economic crisis.    "We have won nothing by destroying the Soviet Union," he  stresses. "All republics thought that they would live well by  separating from Russia. But they were labouring in the wrong.  The West did not help us either. And will not help."    Popov expresses hope that his movement will make a  contribution to a search for a new course of reforms meeting  Russia's conditions. However, "there is no alternative to  reforms," he claims.    The SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA newspaper singles out an article on  forging the poll of December 12, 1993 on the draft Russian  constitution. Facts of forgery were exposed, as a result of  which the number of votes "for" were increased and votes  "against" cut.    Rimma Korelova, a former member of a constituency electoral  commission in the Far East, described these facts in an article  published by the AMURSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper. She expressed  protest in the newspaper and said that she quits the regional  organisation "Democratic Russia".    The same newspaper prints an essay on Russian geopolitics  under the headline "Russia's feat", which is to be continued.  The essay was penned by Gennadiy Zyuganov, leader of the  Russian Communist Party.    Tracing the sources for the growth of Russia's continental  might which, according to the author, seemed "to be eternal and  invincible", Zyuganov writes that, despite evident facts, "the  20th Century was for our country a period of destructive social  cataclysms".    To understand this, he believes it is necessary to turn to  spiritual and conceptual processes which determined the strength  of the Russian power.    The PRAVDA newspaper singles out an article by Valentin  Kuptsov, first deputy chairman of the Russian Communist Party,  where he advocates Russia's return to the socialist way of  development. "Only the socialist locomotive will pull the  country out of the crisis," Kuptsov claims.    The TRUD newspaper comments on a decision by the State Duma  (lower house of the Russian parliament) on the political  amnesty, claiming that "this is a clean victory of factions  opposing the president" in the lower house.    Reporting a visit by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  to Prague where the Russian minister and Czech leaders focused  on a Bosnian settlement, ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI carries his interview.    The newspaper writes that "a chance has emerged to return  from unilateral to joint efforts of the entire world community"  to settle the Bosnian crisis. The Russian president's  initiative gives such a chance.    The IZVESTIYA newspaper singles out a report on the arrest  of  Aldrich Ames, 52, "the most important foreign spy in the system  of American intelligence" who worked for the KGB from 1985 and  then for the Russian intelligence service.    Noting that U.S. experts express indignation at "Russia's  perfidy" in their comments and that the master spy betrayed many  American agents to Moscow, the newspaper writes: Russia "has the  same rights to secret operations in the United States as America  to espionage in Russia".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA notes that the arrest of Ames in the  U.S. "can trigger the biggest spy scandal over the past years".    Writing about the same topic, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  newspaper notes that "his (Ames) recruitment and long-standing  operations can be regarded as a clear success of national  intelligence".</p>

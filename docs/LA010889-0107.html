			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INCUMBENT'S RACE FOR SCHOOL BOARD INCLUDES PLENTY OF BRICKBATS TO DODGE;  </P> <P> KORENSTEIN RUNS A GANTLET OF CRITICISM  </P> <P> Parents picketed outside her Northridge home last summer, opponents launched a  recall campaign in September and critics charge that Los Angeles school board  member Julie Korenstein can't make up her mind on important decisions.  </P> <P> As the filing deadline approaches for candidates seeking Korenstein's seat in  the April 12 election, the west San Fernando Valley representative faces the  challenge of building up her image as an effective board member.  </P> <P> "A scantily clad woman in a combat zone isn't as vulnerable," said one former  high-ranking district official, who asked not to be named. Korenstein's  opponents, encouraged by her recent troubles, seem to agree.  </P> <P> Barbara Romey, who lost to Korenstein in a bitter 1987 race, started raising  money two months ago for a rematch and already has sent former supporters her  own version of Korenstein's record in office. Two other candidates announced  intentions to run last month. The filing deadline for the $24,000-a-year office  is Saturday.  </P> <P> Korenstein, 45, said she does not believe her chances for reelection have been  hurt in past months. For every critic, several others have telephoned to lend  support, she said.  </P> <P> "It's not been negative at all," Korenstein said in a recent interview. "I  could have not stimulated more interest in my campaign."  </P> <P> Most political observers expect Korenstein to maintain her advantage as  incumbent over the challengers. But there are several factors contributing to  her vulnerability, say teachers, board members and administrators:  </P> <P> * Korenstein has served only 18 months in an office that board colleagues say  takes at least two years to fully learn. Without a four-year term to build a  constituency, Korenstein's support may be weak, her opponents say.  </P> <P> * Proposition 73, a voter-approved initiative, will probably block United  Teachers-Los Angeles from repeating a $70,000 contribution that the union gave  Korenstein for the last election. That money, the lion's share of the $108,000  that she raised in her 1987 campaign, was of great help to Korenstein, who  entered the race as a politically inexperienced and relatively unknown  Chatsworth High School program administrator.  </P> <P> * Korenstein has angered several groups of constituents by abstaining from a  key board vote in May that resulted in an increased number of students being  bused to Valley schools, by being seen as responsible for the transfer of a  popular junior high school principal and by failing to win the board votes  necessary to block changes in a district child-care program. Two of those  issues have drawn potential challengers.  </P> <P> But Korenstein, a divorced parent with three children, said she has done plenty  to earn the support of voters in her region, which is roughly the part of the  Valley west of the San Diego Freeway. She won office after defeating Romey in a  June, 1987, runoff election to fill the two years remaining in the term of  former board member David Armor, who resigned to take a government job in  Washington.  </P> <P> Most of her accomplishments have come from her chairmanship of the school  district's business operations committee. Ironically, a seat on that committee  was Korenstein's last choice when she took office. "I thought I was being  punished," she said. "Now I find it fascinating." She later sought  reappointment to the committee.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food Program  </P> <P> The business operations committee has overseen the creation last year of a  surplus-food giveaway program that provides 15 nonprofit agencies each day with  about 400 leftover meals from 50 schools in the district. "I am most proud of  this contribution," she said.  </P> <P> District business services administrators say the idea has been around for  years. Korenstein said that may be true, but that she was the one who pushed  the program through.  </P> <P> Korenstein also takes credit for a districtwide recycling program, due to begin  this month, that will return the profits from recycled paper to participating  schools to be used for student activities. The committee she chairs also  oversees an award-winning energy-conservation program that saved the Los  Angeles Unified School district nearly $500,000 last year, by reminding  teachers and administrators to turn off lights and heaters in empty classrooms,  for example.  </P> <P> "I know that these things are not monumental issues in other people's eyes,"  said board member Warren Furutani, who also received substantial contributions  from the teachers' union in the 1987 campaign. "But those are the kind of  common-sense solutions that Julie has come up with."  </P> <P> Furutani was the most vocal among those on the board in his support of  Korenstein. Board president and East Valley representative Roberta Weintraub  gave Korenstein credit for being a hard worker, but said she has not decided  whether she will endorse her in the April election. Weintraub said she  supported Romey in the last election.  </P> <P> Board member Jackie Goldberg declined comment on Korenstein's performance, and  several other board members did not answer messages asking for comments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lack of Support  </P> <P> Much of the criticism centers on Korenstein's failure to consistently win three  other board votes needed to approve proposals, such as funding for a popular  ROTC program at Granada Hills High School.  </P> <P> In another case, some parents were angered when the district last spring  decided to limit the number of transfer permits to mostly white schools for  before- and after-school child care near those schools.  </P> <P> Attorneys for the district said they believed that the transfer policy could be  abused by parents seeking to segregate their children at 10 mostly white  schools scattered throughout the district. A group of West Valley parents sued  the district and was granted a temporary injunction against the limit later in  the summer.  </P> <P> When the issue returned to the seven-member board in the fall, Korenstein  failed to persuade her colleagues to back her proposal to allow all students  now holding transfer permits to be exempted from the new limits.  </P> <P> Dauna Packer, one parent who is part of a group still fighting the permit  limits, said Korenstein's failure to resolve the issue has prompted her to run  for the office herself.  </P> <P> "I don't think that she has an effective voice on the board," said Packer, a  Woodland Hills mother of three.  </P> <P> Even worse, say critics, was Korenstein's failure to take a position during a  board vote in May to lower enrollment at crowded year-round schools. Board  members had learned before the meeting that the number of students bused to the  Valley from other parts of Los Angeles might increase by about 2,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'I Was Concerned'  </P> <P> "The big stink was that I abstained," Korenstein said. "I was concerned about  packing in kids like sardines, . . . and bringing in children by bus is  educationally unsound."  </P> <P> Only about 860 more students ended up being bused because of the board's  action. But, Korenstein said, if she could do it over, she would vote against  the change.  </P> <P> Another group of parents staged protests in late summer over the transfer of  Gerald Horowitz, then-principal of Robert Frost Junior High School in Granada  Hills, to a school in Sun Valley. Horowitz maintained that Korenstein sought  the transfer to punish him for supporting Romey in the 1987 race.  </P> <P> Korenstein denied having anything to do with the transfer. But parents with  children at the school nonetheless served her with a notice of recall in  September. The recall campaign was called off three weeks later, but the  organizers are now backing Horowitz, who last month said he will run against  Korenstein.  </P> <P> Horowitz said his bid for office is not in retaliation for the transfer but  because "we have an inexperienced and indecisive board member."  </P> <P> Korenstein said she is not worried about Horowitz's supporters. "If they were  that powerful, they would have continued the recall," she said.  </P> <P> With the threat of recall behind her, Korenstein said she expects to raise and  spend about $100,000 in her reelection bid. She said that even with the $5,000  donation limit set by Proposition 73, support from the teachers' union will be  indispensable.  </P> <P> "To run for the board and not have support of teachers, you don't have a chance  in hell of winning," Korenstein said. "With their support, you have teachers  walking precincts, on the telephones. . . . There are 4,000 to 5,000 teachers  in the West Valley alone."  </P> <P> Korenstein meets once a month with about 20 teachers who she has picked to  serve on an informal committee to keep her informed about programs and problems  in West Valley schools.  </P> <P> She and Furutani recently broke with other board members and called for  face-to-face talks to settle the deadlock between the district and union  negotiators over increases in teacher salaries.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, the president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, Wayne Johnson,  said he is very happy with Korenstein's performance. Meanwhile, Romey said  Korenstein has been "bought and paid for by the union."  </P> <P> Steeling herself for what will almost certainly be a campaign loaded with that  kind of accusation, Korenstein said: "It won't stop me from continuing to push  forward and do what I need to do as a board member."  </P></p>

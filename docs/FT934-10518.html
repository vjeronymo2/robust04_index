			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Fears grow over tainted blood UB Plasma, based in Koblenz on the banks of the Rhine, has suddenly become Germany's most hated company. Since it was closed down on Thursday last week, newspapers and television programmes have been carrying pictures of deserted rooms where donors used to give blood. Police have arrested four UB Plasma workers, including its chief executive, and charged them with fraud and negligent killing in an affair that has set millions of Germans wondering if they may have caught Aids from a routine hospital operation. Prosecutors yesterday said they were investigating allegations that the company knew it was distributing plasma containing HIV, the Aids virus. Public prosecutor Norbert Weise said an employee of Koblenz-based UB Plasma had told investigators the company passed on blood supplies and products despite tests showing some to be HIV-positive. The company employed 10 people and is believed to have imported plasma from abroad before mixing it into 'pools' with blood from up to 7,000 of its own donors. It supplied at least 54 hospitals in Germany with plasma, as well as clinics in other countries. Five of the intermediaries have so far been identified. First reports of irregularities date back to 1986 when a former employee complained to authorities in the state of Rheinland-Pfalz, where the company is based, that it had been selling contaminated products. There were further complaints in 1991 and in summer this year the Bonn Health Ministry told authorities in Rheinland-Pfalz about fresh suspicions. The State Prosecutor for Koblenz city told German newspapers this week the company was heavily indebted, one reason why it may not have implemented adequate tests.</p>

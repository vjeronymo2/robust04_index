			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Istanbul, Mar.22 (A.A.) -- Democracy Party (DEP)  members Mahmut Kilinc and Zubeyir Aydar flew to the United  States today to meet with the UN Human Rights Commission and  congressional members.    Before their departure, Aydar and Kilinc, both from  southeast  Turkey, said that their objective was not to complain about  Turkey.    They said that they were to appear before the commission so  that their friends, currently in prison, will receive a just  trial.    The DEP, which has 13 seats in the 450-seat parliament, has  been the focus of angry public reaction in Turkey, especially  because its members refused to condemn or criticize the bloody  attacks of the separatist terror organization PKK [Workers Party  of Kurdistan]. The PKK has been waging a bloody campaign against  the Turkish state which has claimed nearly 11,000 lives over the  last 10 years. [passage omitted]</p>

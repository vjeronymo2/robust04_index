			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: Nokia posts FM154m recovery NOKIA, the Finnish electronics and telecommunications group, recovered to a pre-tax profit of FM154m (Dollars 28.5m) in the first four months from a loss of FM280m at the same stage last year, following rapid sales growth in telecommunications and mobile telephones. A near 80 per cent rise in telecommunications sales to FM125bn and a 109 per cent increase in mobile phone sales to FM184bn pushed group sales to FM7.09bn from FM4.86bn. Europe and eastern Asia accounted for much of the growth with new orders during the period, including cable TV transmission systems in Britain and China, a digital cellular telephone network to Germany, and strong demand for mobile handsets in Germany and Britain. There was also strong sales growth - 51 per cent - in consumer electronics, which showed turnover of FM2.38bn due to increased sales of computer monitors. But home electronics continued to suffer from weak demand and low prices, producing what Nokia called a heavy loss for the consumer electronics division. The cables and machinery business was also hit by continued recession in Finland and the slow pace of economic development in central Europe. Sales in this division fell slightly to FM1.36bn. Mr Jorma Ollila, chief executive, said technological changes, coupled with strong demand, should sustain sales growth in telecommunications through the present economic slowdown in Europe. But he said internal cost reductions were not compensating for the slump in consumer electronics. Nevertheless, he expected a better full-year return than last year's pre-tax FM158m loss. 'We are very confident the result will be a significant improvement this year - but it is very difficult to be more specific in view of the uncertainties (in the market).'</p>

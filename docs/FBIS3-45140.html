In the market economy, private enterprises should pay attention  to studying the market law and the state's industrial policies,  submit themselves to the state marcoeconomic regulation and  control and make new contributions to building a developed  border province near the sea.    This morning, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party  committee; Zhang Yueqi, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and vice governor; Wang Guofa, vice governor; and  Zhang Tienan, vice chairman of the provincial committee of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and  director of the United Front Work Department of the provincial  party committee, invited representatives from the nonpublic  economic sector to a forum to hear their opinions and  suggestions on further developing the province's private economy.    Zhang Yueqi, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and vice governor, presided over the forum and gave a  report on the province's political and economic situations.  [passage omitted]    After listening to the representatives' views, He Zhukang  gave a speech. He said, "Most of the participants at this forum  are deputies and CPPCC members and representatives with great  influence in our province's nonpublic economic sector. Your  suggestions are very important and will play a great role in  developing our province's private economy. At the same time,  let me extend heartfelt thanks to you for your efforts and  contributions to Jilin's economic construction."    In referring to how to rapidly develop our province's  private  economy and enable it to attain a certain scale and level, He  Zhukang pointed out that it is necessary to conscientiously  study and implement the decision of the CPC Central Committee on  the issues concerning the establishment of the market economic  system, manage things in line with market economic law, give a  free hand in the development of the nonpublic economic sector,  treat it equally without discrimination, create conditions for  various economic sectors and all sorts of enterprises to  participate in market competition, protect the business and  property of the legal persons and the individuals in line with  law and further strengthen scientific management. He encouraged  private enterprises to cooperate with state enterprises,  participate in the purchase of shares, merge with them, or buy  them, and develop the private economy by carrying out  transdepartmental and transcountry cooperation.    In his speech, He Zhukang expressed hopes that entrepreneurs  in the private economic sector will pay simultaneous attention  to the building of the two civilizations; do business in line  with law; pay taxes according to regulations; be honest and keep  their promises; give strict supervision, inspection and  management; rely on the masses of workers; strengthen democratic  management; place themselves among the workers; pay attention to  self-cultivation and professional ethics; form a good social  image; make due efforts to further expand our province's private  economy; and bring along a sound development in the whole  province's private economy.</p>

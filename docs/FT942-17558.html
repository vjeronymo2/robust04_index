			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / End of BR as we know it Nearly half a century of centralised railway operations ended yesterday when British Rail handed control of its network to a host of newly-created businesses, writes Charles Batchelor. Responsibility for nearly 10,000 miles of track and 2,500 stations has been given to Railtrack, while more than 50 independent businesses have started taking over passenger and freight train operations, railway maintenance and rolling stock finance. BR will continue in a much slimmed-down form, easing businesses still nominally under its control into the private sector before it finally closes. In the early stages, the privatisation will lead to a doubling of subsidies, though these are expected to fall in later years. The government foresees pressure on its finances falling eventually. The public fears higher fares and cuts in services. 'Train set' costs Pounds 10m, Page 8</p>

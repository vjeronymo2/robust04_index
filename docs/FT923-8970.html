			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / BP cuts payout and axes 11,500 jobs after loss BRITISH Petroleum had its darkest day for decades yesterday as it cut its dividend for the first time since the first world war, reported a substantial first-half loss and said it was eliminating 11,500 jobs worldwide. About 1,500 jobs will go in the UK, as the group's research and engineering divisions, which employ 3,600 people, are merged. The BP engineering site at Uxbridge, west London, will close, with its workload transferred to the site at Sunbury, Surrey. The loss and the redundancies were the result of an aggressive cost-cutting and assets sales programme, for which the company made an exceptional charge of Pounds 1bn. The charge transformed a second-quarter net profit of Pounds 107m - slightly better than expected - into an unprecedented Pounds 812m net loss. The first-half loss was Pounds 717m, compared with a Pounds 834m profit in same period last year. The second-quarter dividend was halved to 2.1p and BP reported a loss per share of 12.1p, compared with earnings of 4.5p in the second quarter of last year. BP's shares fell 10p to 196 1/2 p yesterday. Mr David Simon, who replaced Mr Robert Horton as chief executive after a boardroom coup in June, said the results were 'clearly unsatisfactory'. He outlined an accelerated programme of cost-cutting and asset disposals to reduce BP's Pounds 8.4bn (Dollars 16bn) debt. The 11,500 job losses include some that have already gone since the beginning of the year. Some 80 per cent of the losses will be in Europe, where BP is 'Europeanising' its refining and marketing business by integrating 23 different national managements into one office in Brussels. Although Mr Simon said BP faced an 'extremely uncertain economic outlook', analysts said that without the exceptional charge, the first-half profit of Pounds 202m on a replacement cost basis (which does not take into account changes in stock values) was better than expected. It was helped by a strong performance from the exploration and production arm despite weak oil prices. The refining and marketing and chemicals businesses suffered sharp drops in profits, however, which BP blamed on the impact of recession and overcapacity in the industry. Debt had also reached Dollars 16bn, taking gearing - the debt-to-equity ratio - to 87 per cent. Mr Steve Ahearne, BP's chief financial officer, said this was the 'limit of prudence'. Mr Ahearne said debt could rise to Dollars 16.5bn or Dollars 17bn by the end of the year, taking gearing to about 90 per cent. He said the company had no plans for a rights issue. This made it essential to cut the dividend and to continue slashing costs and selling assets to allow debt to be paid off. Shareholder reaction to the dividend cut ranged from resignation to disbelief. British institutional shareholders had been expecting a cut of 30 per cent to 50 per cent in the dividend, with most opinion centred on the lower end of that range. 'I hope they live to regret it,' said one fund manager, adding that management should have done more to cut costs to salvage the dividend. 'It's a disappointing admission of management expectations of the company,' he said. Several institutions, however, felt the company had little choice in the matter and that the dismissal of Mr Horton as chairman and chief executive offered BP its best opportunity for aggressive write-downs and a dividend cut. 'They have had a manic obsession with maintaining the dividend. Essentially they would have been selling assets to maintain it,' said one pension fund manager.

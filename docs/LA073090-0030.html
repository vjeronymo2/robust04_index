			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  FILL 'ER UP -- GAS PRICES RISE 5 WEDNESDAY;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: THE VOTER-APPROVED TAX HIKE WILL PAY FOR STATE HIGHWAY  PROJECTS. ONE-CENT INCREASES WILL FOLLOW IN EACH OF THE NEXT FOUR YEARS.  </P> <P> California's gasoline price, a slave in recent years to fluctuations in crude  oil markets and bottlenecks at the nation's refineries, on Wednesday is going a  nickel-a-gallon higher.  </P> <P> But this time neither flighty markets nor overburdened refineries will shoulder  the blame. We did it to ourselves.  </P> <P> The increase comes from a voter decision June 5 to approve Proposition 111, a  ballot measure that triggered a 9-cent-per-gallon hike in gasoline taxes. Five  cents of that increase will go into effect Wednesday. The rest of the increase  will be phased in over the next four years with 1-cent tax hikes becoming  effective every Jan. 1.  </P> <P> To those who harbor hopes that petroleum retailers or wholesalers will soften  the financial blow by absorbing some or all of the increase, the answer from  gasoline dealers is emphatic.  </P> <P> "No way," said John DeWitt, owner of J. E. DeWitt Inc., a gasoline wholesaler  in South El Monte who also owns some retail stations. "The delivery costs from  the refinery to the station, trucking costs and overhead, so many government  rules, regulations and fees make that impossible."  </P> <P> Jim Gigoux, executive director of the California Independent Oil Marketers  Assn., said a few stations may introduce the tax hike gradually but "you can  bet in a very short time everybody's going to be up 5 cents a gallon."  </P> <P> So on Wednesday most California motorists will see new prices at their corner  gas stations. Where the night before self-serve unleaded gas may have sold for  $1.08 a gallon, or regular for a bargain 99 cents a gallon, prices will be  $1.13 for unleaded and $1.04 for regular.  </P> <P> "You tell me one other industry that has it prices out there in three-foot-high  letters on the street," complained Gigoux. "People complain about $1 a gallon  for gasoline but they think nothing of going into the grocery and spending a  lot more than that for water in a fancy bottle."  </P> <P> The tax hike was designed by the Legislature and Gov. George Deukmejian to help  finance a 10-year, $18.5-billion transportation program that they hope will  ease traffic congestion, repair crumbling highways and bridges and provide  better access to rail transit.  </P> <P> For consumers, it means the total federal and state taxes paid on a gallon of  gasoline in California will be about 30 cents.  </P> <P> It works out this way: Customers already pay a 9-cent federal tax and a 9-cent  state tax. Then there will be the extra nickel as of Wednesday. But California  motorists actually pay a tax on a tax in the form of a sales tax, ranging from  6 1/4% to 7 1/4% depending on the area of the state, that is added on top of  the state and federal gas taxes.  </P> <P> So in addition to the $5.3 billion in new revenue the state expects to garner  from the gas tax hike in the next five years, it will also collect $220 million  from its share of the sales tax that is levied on that tax.  </P> <P> While the new tax is expected to produce some grumbling from customers, Gigoux  said the real complaints are coming from gasoline distributors who must forward  the tax to the State Board of Equalization, the agency responsible for  collecting it.  </P> <P> He said the new tax contributes to cash flow concerns because distributors pay  the tax before they deliver gasoline, but they may not be paid by the  commercial account that receives the delivery for another 10 to 30 days. An  additional tax, he said, means that much more they have to carry until payment  is made.  </P> <P> "It is an additional strain on an already strained cash flow," said DeWitt.  "The industry is already operating with a lot of trusses and unfortunately when  you get another injury, sometimes there aren't enough trusses to hold it in."  </P> <P> But neither DeWitt nor Gigoux expect the tax hike to have any effect on the  habits of the buying public. "Mom is still going to go play bridge, pop's going  to take the kid to Little League and he's still going to go to his Saturday  golf game," said Gigoux.  </P> <P> By now, both say, California customers are accustomed to price changes prompted  by the rise and fall of crude oil costs and a shortage of refinery capacity  that often makes the petroleum processing plants unable to keep pace with  demand. While prices have fluctuated over the last few years, American  Automobile Assn. surveys show a slight rise in California since Memorial Day.  </P> <P> At the Board of Equalization, officials do not expect any major problems to  develop with collections as the new tax increase goes into effect.  </P> <P> "Based on our past experience, we expect it all to go smoothly," said Delena  Bratton, tax service specialist for the board.  </P> <P> The last time the state increased the gas tax was in 1983 when it went up 2  cents, from 7 to 9 cents a gallon.  </P></p>

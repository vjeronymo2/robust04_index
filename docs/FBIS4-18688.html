			<p>BFN     [Text] President Glavkos Kliridhis' meeting with Robert  Lamb, the U.S. State Department special coordinator on Cyprus,  concluded a short time ago. Lamb described the meeting as  constructive. Replying to a relevant question, he said we should  not get involved with what he called artificial timeframes. We  should proceed, he noted, toward the implementation of the  confidence-building measures. Lamb also said he would leave  Cyprus tomorrow.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said Lamb sought to  bring changes to the UN document so that the talks can continue.  Even if there are changes, Kasoulidhis said, [Turkish Cypriot  leader] Rauf Denktas will ask for more, since he does not have  the will for a Cyprus solution. The government spokesman said  that during the meeting, President Kliridhis repeated that the  Greek Cypriot side showed the highest possible degree of  constructive willingness to accept the UN document. The Greek  Cypriot side, he added, will accept no amendments to the  document and no new document from the United Nations.  Kasoulidhis said that our side did not ask for timeframes but  stressed that since they exist they should be followed. The  spokesman also said that anyone who tries to change the UN  document will find himself in front of Denktas' policy of  differing. Kasoulidhis then said that with the changes to the  document, Lamb appears to hope that an agreement will be  reached. This is a view, he said, with which the Greek Cypriot  side disagrees.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Fed reforms foreign exchange trading THE Federal Reserve Bank of New York has said that securities firms which meet its capital standards will be allowed to trade directly with its foreign exchange desk. Until now, the New York Fed has only bought and sold dollars through commercial banks when intervening in the currency market. The move mirrors similar reforms in the US Treasury market, where the primary dealer network has been opened up to allow a wider range of financial companies to trade government securities directly with the Fed. Mr Gerald Corrigan, announcing the changes in Phoenix, Arizona, on Friday said the Fed was trying 'to bring our relationships with foreign exchange counterparties into broad alignment with the new procedures for primary dealers.' The decision to widen the Fed's trading relationships is an implicit recognition that big securities houses such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman, Sachs, have become significant players in the foreign exchange market. Becoming a member of the Fed's inner circle of trading partners is a big step for the securities firms. From now on they will know exactly when the Fed is intervening in the market, an important piece of information for currency dealers.</p>

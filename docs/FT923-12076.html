			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Money supply figures indicate weak demand FEEBLE June growth figures for money supply yesterday added to evidence that underlying demand is still weak. The figures from the Bank of England showed that narrow money, or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation, fell 0.8 per cent last month, which is the sharpest monthly drop since late 1981. The fall brought the year-on-year rate of growth of M0 - a good indication of underlying consumer demand - to 1.3 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with 2.5 per cent in May. Broad money - M4 - rose 0.1 per cent on the month, leaving the year-on-year rate unchanged at 5.2 per cent. Figures for lending by banks and building societies were slightly more encouraging. They showed that lending to the private and corporate sectors - M4 lending - continued to grow, but only sluggishly. Lending increased by Pounds 2.5bn last month on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with earlier estimates of Pounds 2.3bn growth and actual average growth of Pounds 2.2bn over the previous six months. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'Neither broad money nor credit indicate that the economy is moving downwards again . . . rather the monetary indicators suggest economic stagnation, and that only a very slow recovery in growth is in prospect during the rest of this year.' The Bank's figures were backed up by the British Bankers' Association, the trade body for Britain's nine biggest banking groups. The association's figures showed that lending by its members to the private sector grew by Pounds 1.3bn last month. Although that was lower than the rises in April and May - Pounds 2.6bn and Pounds 2.2bn respectively - it was the third consecutive monthly rise. Lord Inchyra, secretary-general of the association, said: 'If one looks at longer-term trends there does seem to be some recovery in bank lending from the low point in March. It is, however, very patchy.' The association's figures also showed that lending for house purchases continued to grow modestly but that the consumer credit market remained inert. Lending for mortgages rose by Pounds 837m last month, compared with Pounds 596m in March, while lending to consumers rose by Pounds 189m compared with Pounds 374m in June last year. Consumer confidence continued to fall during the first two weeks of this month, according to a survey by Gallup, the market research company. A total of 31 per cent of the respondents said that they thought the general economic situation in the country would worsen against 30 per cent who thought it would improve. The minus 1 per cent balance of pessimists was the lowest since February this year, when it was minus 4 per cent. The latest figure compares with plus 13 per cent only last month. The survey showed that 70 per cent of respondents expect unemployment to increase over the next 12 months against only 12 per cent who expect it to come down. Those who expect that their household's financial situation will improve over the next 12 months - 23 per cent - are equally matched by those who expect it to worsen.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Tories threaten de-regulation revolt A group of Conservative backbenchers is threatening to deny the government greater powers to repeal legislation. The threat emerged as the de-regulation bill last night gained its second reading. The bill would allow the government to repeal primary legislation by statutory order. A Liberal Democrat amendment depriving ministers of the proposed new powers was defeated by 320 votes to 287, a government majority of 37. However, a number of Tories said they were likely to vote against the government when the bill reached the committee stage. Mr Richard Shepherd, MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, said he was concerned about the constitutional implications: 'One day we may form the Opposition. I urge a very cautious rethink of this measure.' Mr Edward Garnier, Tory MP for Harborough, said he had 'constitutional concerns' over the bill's provisions relating to ministers' powers. He said such concerns 'are well meant and sincere'. Government whips fear difficulty in overturning any Lords amendment aimed at diluting the powers ministers seek. Mr Neil Hamilton, the industry minister responsible for de-regulation, last night said the powers were mainly designed to repeal uncontroversial legislation. He made it clear that 'every regulation in place is under review'. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, played on Conservative fears that the government was trying to weaken parliamentary procedure by suspending acts of parliament using statutory instruments which only need a 90-minute debate. This was 'a Henry VIII clause', he said, because of 'that monarch's tendency to absolutism'. He went on to say that of 3,500 regulations being examined by the government, 71 per cent had been introduced since the Tories came to office in 1979. 'It is not our regulations they are complaining about, it is their regulations,' he said. Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, said he recognised the case for shedding regulations that were 'a genuine barrier to efficiency and understanding'. He added: 'But there are clear concerns as to how this can be done, what the mechanisms should be and how we can ensure that this is properly addressed and properly debated.'</p>

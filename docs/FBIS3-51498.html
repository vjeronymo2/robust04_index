Thus the first objective of the  military operation "has been achieved."    In its Communique No. 14, Sedena states that by achieving  this first objective, the Mexican Army has taken territorial  control of the area in general and that civilian authorities  have already begun exercising their responsibilities.    The text of the Sedena communique follows:    "In accordance with the planned operations as drafted by the  7th Military Region Command based in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas,  we have achieved the first objective of the operation, which is  the recovery of the most important towns taken over by the  transgressors, with the exception of Guadalupe Tepeyac, which  should take place as soon as a large number of installations  destroyed by the assailants on the various roads are repaired.    "In achieving this first objective, the Mexican Army has  recovered territorial control of the area in general. Civilian  authorities are exercising their responsibilities in all  municipal capitals taken over by the assailants. No area of  significance in the region is being occupied by these armed  people, even though some isolated groups may still be operating."</p>

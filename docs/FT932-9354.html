			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Dunkel warns on Uruguay Round MR Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, yesterday warned that escalation of trade frictions could poison the Uruguay Round negotiations due to conclude this year. In a report to Gatt's 110 members on developments in the trading system, he said bringing the round to a successful conclusion in 1993 was the only way to end the uncertainty surrounding trade relations since the failure to conclude the negotiations on schedule in December 1990. Mr Dunkel's report highlights a growing number of bilateral disagreements including disputes involving anti-dumping and anti-subsidy action which is increasingly seen as protectionist in both intent and effect. Gatt's main worries relate to non-implementation of dispute panel reports and unilateral measures by those involved in disputes, notably the US. These put the multilateral trading system at risk and damage its credibility, the report says. Other disturbing policy developments include a sharp increase in anti-dumping actions, especially by developing countries, and the continued maintenance of quantitative restrictions outside Gatt rules. In addition to 127 restraints affecting trade in textiles and clothing, Gatt lists 79 'voluntary export restraints' and other bilaterally agreed or unilaterally imposed measures. On the positive side, 18 countries have joined Gatt since the Uruguay Round began in 1986, with more in the queue, while 72 countries have announced unilateral trade liberalisation measures over the period. Mr Balkrishan Zutshi, chairman of Gatt's members, said yesterday he hoped for a decision on the successor to Mr Dunkel, who retires at the end of June, 'as soon as possible or at least by the end of the month'. Officials say Mr Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner nominated by Dublin with EC support, remains the front-runner.</p>

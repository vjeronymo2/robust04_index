			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> SENIORS IN 12 OF 15 O.C. SCHOOLS WRITE ABOVE STATE AVERAGE  </P> <P> Seniors in 12 out of 15 Orange County high school districts demonstrated  above-average writing skills last year in a new state test to determine writing  proficiency, state education officials announced Monday.  </P> <P> Statewide, 79% of last year's senior class showed adequate to above-average  writing skills, while 19% showed minimal ability, according to test results.  </P> <P> In Orange County, all but three of the 15 high school districts scored above  the state average. Santa Ana Unified, Anaheim Union High and Garden Grove  Unified school districts -- all with large concentrations of  limited-English-speaking students -- scored below the statewide average.  </P> <P> The highest-scoring district in the state was San Marino Unified in Los Angeles  County. In Los Angeles Unified School District, last year's seniors scored well  below the state average.  </P> <P> The state average score on the California Assessment Program test was 250. The  highest possible score was 400. Orange County high school seniors scored an  average of 281 on the test. The highest-scoring district was Laguna Beach  Unified, with 319.  </P> <P> Last year was the first time that the state gave high school seniors the  writing test, called the Direct Writing Assessment. Unlike earlier measures of  writing ability, which emphasized multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank  exercises, the new exam requires students to actually write sentences and  paragraphs. The test covered four types of essays, including autobiographical,  evaluative, interpretive and reflective writing.  </P></p>

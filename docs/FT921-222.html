			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / EC unveils curbs on drugs advertising RESTRICTIONS on direct advertising of pharmaceuticals to the public will be announced today by EC ministers, meeting as the Internal Market Council. The restrictions are part of a larger package of measures to break down barriers to the free trade of pharmaceuticals within the EC. The package, a compromise worked out with the industry since the first proposals last July, includes measures prohibiting misleading or unclear advertising for non-prescription over-the-counter drugs. Pharmaceuticals groups will also have to provide consistent and detailed information about the contents on packaging. Labels or inserts will have to describe ingredients and warn of possible side effects. In addition, drugs companies will be forbidden to offer free samples to healthcare professionals. However, proposals to ban the sponsorship of doctors' conferences have been dropped following intensive lobbying. Wholesalers will also be obliged to keep adequate records of stocks and set up emergency plans to withdraw products from the market. The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Associations, which represents the industry, was unavailable for comment. Uniform technical standards for cars will be introduced across the European Community from January 1, 1993, under legislation to be approved by member states today, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. Internal market ministers will give the formal go-ahead to the remaining three measures out of a series of 44 on technical standards, and agree a final framework measure to implement 'whole-vehicle-type approval' in the Community. This means that from the end of this year new cars will only have to conform to one set of standards, checked by one government, instead of having to seek technical approval under 12 systems. There will be transitional arrangements for cars which have already been approved by at least one country.</p>

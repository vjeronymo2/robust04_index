			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roundup by reporters Hsieh Lung-tien and Lin Hsin-hui] </F>   [Text] Two 400-ton-class patrol boats of the Seventh  Security Police Group set sail on 16 April for a patrol of the  Spratly waters and a landing on Taiping Island there. This is  the first time that our country has extended its police  authority to the South China Sea to reassert our sovereignty  over the South China Sea. The police patrol boats were to link  up at Taiping Island with Yu-hsun No.2 boat and naval warships  which went there by separate routes. Their operations have so  far been kept secret. The patrol boats are on their way home  and will arrive in Kaohsiung today or tomorrow.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its No. 2  and  No. 3 patrol boats, led by Chang Chen-chung, chief secretary of  the police group, set out from the No. 2 harbor at Kaohsiung at  1930 on 16 April with a dozen or so high-ranking police officers  on board, including Hou Chin-tsung, commander of the second  battalion of the Seventh Security Police Group. Besides a dozen  or so crew members, each boat also has on board more than a  dozen policemen from the Fourth Company of the Seventh Security  Police Group, armed with machineguns and Uzi submachineguns.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, our fishing  boats have frequently been detained by the Philippines and  Vietnam and piracy has been a serious threat to the lives and  property of our fishermen operating in the South China Sea in  recent years. Our country's South China Sea policy clearly  calls for strengthened police patrols to protect our fishermen.  For this reason, our first police patrol there serves to signal  to the international community our reassertion of sovereignty  over the South China Sea. Since the high level [of government]  attaches considerable importance to this police patrol, it has  been carried out after six months of prudent planning.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, its patrol  boats are performing duties around Taiping Island for the first  time. The main purpose is to test navigational safety between  Taiwan and Taiping Island and to survey the waters around the  island to prepare for stationing a police company on the island  in the future.    According to the Seventh Security Police Group, the No. 2  and  No. 3 patrol boats are on their way home, expected to arrive in  Kaohsiung harbor today or tomorrow. Its Fourth Company,  stationed in Kaohsiung, has four patrol boats -- the  800-ton-class No. 1 boat, the 400-ton-class No. 2 and No. 3  boats, and the 200-ton-class No. 5 boat. Some of the boats may  be diverted to perform duties around Taiping Island in the  future.</p>

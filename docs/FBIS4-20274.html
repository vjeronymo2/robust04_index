			<p>BFN     [Text] The last-minute effort by the UN representatives to  achieve agreement on the confidence-building measures has ended  with no results. Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special  representative, said after his meeting today with Rauf Denktas:  I have no agreement to announce.    Mr. Clark added that after this meeting he does not think  there is any reason for further consultations. Mr. Clark  further noted that he wants to think about what he has discussed  here as well as about his meetings with the representatives of  Greece and Turkey before he proceeds with any recommendations.    In a statement after his meeting with Joe Clark, Rauf  Denktas  said that he expects responsibility for the deadlock in the  talks will be attributed to the Turkish Cypriot side. According  to REUTER, Rauf Denktas said that he foresees that the Turkish  Cypriot side will be accused of refusing to accept the demands  of the Greek Cypriot side which, as he put it, have been added  to the initial package of measures proposed by the United  Nations. Denktas noted: We will be accused again because we do  not give in to anything that the Greek Cypriots demand. At this  point, REUTER points out that Joe Clark denied repeatedly that  the confidence-building measures package had been changed  considerably in favor of the Greek Cypriot side. At the same  time, revealing once again the Turkish Cypriot side's true  intentions, the Turkish Cypriot leader said that the Cyprus  issue cannot be solved so long as the international community  recognizes the Government of the Republic of Cyprus as the only  legal government in Cyprus. Denktas added: The price that we  will pay for not accepting this situation is much smaller than  the one we would pay if we accept it.    Earlier today, Mr. Clark had a meeting with President  Glavkos  Kliridhis, who reiterated to Joe Clark that, if Rauf Denktas  does not accept the document within the framework of the time  limit set by the Security Council, he sees no reason to continue  discussion on the confidence-building measures nor does he  intend to continue. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis  briefed the journalists in this connection and said that our  side is now awaiting the UN secretary general's report to be  submitted; it will record the facts and should attribute  responsibility where they should be.    Joe Clark and Gustave Feissel are now briefing the  ambassadors of the five permanent members of the Security  Council.    A senior government source has told the Cyprus Broadcasting  Corporation that now the UN secretary general's representatives  also attribute responsibility to the Turkish side for the  failure of the proximity talks. According to the same source,  at least two countries of the European Union [EU]--Britain and  Germany--now agree with the Cyprus Government's position that  the process for Cypriot accession to the EU should be expedited,  and this is something that would work to put pressure on the  Turkish side. The government source made this statement after  the meeting President Glavkos Kliridhis had this morning with  the UN officials and after a meeting the president also had with  the German ambassador to Cyprus.</p>

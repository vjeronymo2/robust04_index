			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Milosevic attacks motives of west MR Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, yesterday accused the international community of trying to bring Serbia to its knees and to 'tear Yugoslavia apart'. Mr Milosevic, in a rare public appearance, said the political motives behind international sanctions were 'to force Serbia . . . to accept humiliating terms and give up the chance to show solidarity with Serbs in other republics'. Speaking to politicians in Leskovac, south-eastern Serbia, a region of traditional support, he blamed the international community for 'foisting a war on the former Yugoslav republics in order to break up Yugoslavia'. He warned that it was 'most important to eliminate the danger of war in Serbia' and lashed out at Serbia's opposition parties for 'serving the interests of the rich and mighty' - a reference to the international community. While he denied that Serbia was aiding Serb fighters in Bosnia, he said: 'We are supporting the war, but in the sense of . . . the just battle of the Serbian people in the former Yugoslavia . . . for an equal position in every aspect'. His comments came after Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the president of Bosnia, formalised an agreement with Mr Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, to fight together against Serbian-backed forces if international efforts to end the bloodshed fail. The two leaders urged the UN, the US and the EC to undertake real and effective measures to stop the aggression. Mr Izetbegovic has pressed for foreign military intervention to aid the mostly Moslem forces loyal to the Bosnian government. His agreement with Mr Tudjman appears partly to reflect his loss of faith in international efforts to end the war, a western diplomat said. 'Izetbegovic is over a barrel. Although he has serious cause to wonder what Croatia's long-term plans are, he depends on support from Croatian forces in Bosnia,' he said. UN officials in Sarajevo yesterday warned that the escalated fighting could jeopardise the international relief effort. 'The thread is getting very thin that's holding this together,' said Canadian General Lewis MacKenzie after an encampment of 350 Canadian peacekeepers came under mortar and gun fire. Sarajevo radio reported fighting in Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo near the airport. It said one person was killed and buildings were ablaze in central Sarajevo and Dobrinja.</p>

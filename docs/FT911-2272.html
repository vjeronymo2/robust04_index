			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Letter: Coincidences Sir, Isn't it rather ironic that on Monday, the Bank of England launched an initiative, spearheaded by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, to identify areas of legal uncertainty that might harm London's standing as an international financial centre? Is this the same Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton who refuses to answer Parliamentary questions under oath regarding the Harrods takeover by the Al-Fayed brothers? It must be an uncanny coincidence. May I suggest that one of the Al-Fayeds spearheads the campaign, as this might attach more weight to it] Jonothan Sultan, 75 Leicester Street, Wolverhampton, West Midlands</p>

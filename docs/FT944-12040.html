			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Technology: Bang up to date - Bernard Gray reviews two books which show that the story of how the Bomb was born has lessons for today The agreement that North Korea is currently preparing to sign with the US to limit its nuclear programme may avert a potentially dangerous proliferation of atomic weapons material in Asia. It also has ramifications for the handling of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, due to be renewed next year. How the west handles its own nuclear disarmament, and how it deals with developing countries' nuclear ambitions are central in the debate about nuclear proliferation. But the story of the North Korean nuclear programme has a more disturbing resonance from the west's recent past. Two books published recently about the British and Soviet atomic bombs show just how closely the Koreans were following the path which the second world war allies trod 50 years ago. The kind of nuclear reactors Korea built recently, and the purpose for which they were intended, are almost identical to those constructed by the US, the UK and the Soviet Union during the 1940s. Those interested in the science and engineering of how an aspiring weapons state might go about building a nuclear bomb can learn much from either of these books. David Holloway's* is the more serious, and is an important addition to the history of the Bomb. Brian Cathcart's account** is lighter, and sadly misses out much of the detail that gives Holloway his authority. Yet the scientific detective story, the romance, and ultimately the horror of the original development and use of the atomic bomb is still best set out in Richard Rhodes's award-winning and definitive story first published in 1986***. As well as technical detail, Rhodes picks out the human side of the story: the struggles of physicists, many Jewish fugitives, against technical challenges and political obstacles makes compelling reading. His account of Hiroshima is harrowing. The two more recent books lack the thrill of the initial chase and its sickening conclusion, but they throw fascinating light on the similarities and differences between the US, Britain and the Soviet Union. Cathcart's book is written in a less academic style, but both books tell parallel stories about the same period and inevitably view the same incidents through different lenses. In all three countries bureaucratic bungling held back development. It was more than two years after Einstein wrote to Roosevelt, warning the president of the possibility of the Bomb, that there was a significant US effort to produce atomic weapons. In the Soviet Union Stalin had received excellent intelligence from Britain and the US on the critical issues in bomb development, but Russia in the early part of the war was thinking of survival in terms of weeks, rather than the years that the new superbomb would take. Even when the USSR regained the initiative, Molotov, the foreign secretary, did not trust his own scientists and believed the reports could be a plot by the west to make Russia waste resources on a pointless scheme. Only Hiroshima finally shifted official Russian attitudes. Britain had more mundane concerns. Having been ahead in 1940, thanks largely to a brilliant analysis of the main problems by Frisch and Peierls at Birmingham University - leaked wholesale to the Russians - Britain refused to share its work equally with the US. The Americans soon pulled ahead and it was not until 1943 that the US readmitted the UK to the project. Despite the UK effort to help develop the Bomb, the US cut Britain off from atomic research after the war. Attlee then determined that Britain must have at least the capacity to build nuclear weapons. William Penney was encouraged to head the project but he ran headlong into Whitehall. Other departments were so jealous of resources that they refused to supply half a dozen draughtsmen for a project the prime minister had given the highest priority. There are many such vignettes in both books. Beria, the secret police chief in charge of the Russian Bomb, made a list of those to be shot or deported to Siberia if the project failed. When it worked, he used the same list: those who would have been shot were made Heroes of Soviet Labour; those to have been deported received lesser honours; those who would merely have been sacked got commendations. In the UK, Penney got a knighthood. The Americans, once persuaded of the viability of the Bomb, were typically thorough and threw enormous effort and scientific skill at it. By 1945 the project had cost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn). The British were typically proud of the fact that they built their Bomb on a shoestring. The Russians poured in the full resources of the command economy and had no idea how much they spent. 'Give them what they want,' Stalin told Beria, 'we can always shoot them later.' Neither the British nor the Russians made much of the fact that their first atomic bombs were direct copies of the original US design. Chillingly, given how much technology has progressed since, that design is nearly the one that would be used by a nascent weapons state today. Those trying to learn the lessons of 50 years ago can see clearly that once the physics had been established, getting plutonium or enriched uranium was the hardest problem. Producing it requires enormous, expensive sites, which are relatively easy to spot, as in Korea. Controlling the production and flow of plutonium is the only way to keep the nuclear genie even half way in the bottle. The destructive power of the Bomb, vividly described in these books, makes that an urgent task for the negotiators to take on. *Stalin and the Bomb: the Soviet Union and Atomic Energy 1939-1956.

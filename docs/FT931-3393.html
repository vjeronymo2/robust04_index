			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nestle seeks direct milk supply from UK farmers NESTLE, THE UK subsidiary of the Swiss food group, yesterday offered contracts to 8,000 dairy farmers near its factories for direct supplies of milk when the Milk Marketing Board statutory monopoly ends some time next year. The move follows the announcement last month by Northern Foods of plans to set up the Northern Milk Partnership, a co-operative venture which hopes to recruit more than 5,000 farmers to supply the company with up to 2bn litres of milk a year worth Pounds 500m. Nestle, which buys nearly 5 per cent of UK milk, aims to attract enough farmers to supply 700m litres a year, worth about Pounds 150m, to factories in Ashbourne, Derbyshire; Girvan, Ayrshire; Dalston, Cumbria; and Omagh, Co Tyrone. The contracts would not require regular renewal, but would guarantee producers a market for three years ahead, while allowing them to sell elsewhere without penalty by giving three months notice. The Milk Marketing Board, which is reforming itself into a co-operative to be known as Milk Marque, yesterday urged dairy farmers to sign nothing, but to keep their options open. Milk Marque hopes to supply 80 per cent of the UK's Pounds 3bn annual milk market, a share some observers believe it will need to cover costs.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Six days after the civilian-military operation in  Raboteau, the working class neighborhood of Gonaives is still  deserted. According to the Haitian Press Agency correspondent in  Upper Artibonite, most of the youths seen at the time ran away  when strangers came. According to rare testimonies collected on  the spot, the bodies of those killed on 22 April while trying to  escape by sea continue to surface, increasing the total number  of dead, which had been assessed at over 23 on 25 April.  According to the same witnesses, the body of a well known local  soccer player is reputed to have been among those buried by the  military.    By the way, according to the Interpress Agency, Bouter  Mtayer, brother of Arnault Mtayer, who was also known as "The  Cuban," and whose pursuit by the Army was the origin of the  slaughter, was spotted by the military in the area of Sedren, 5  km from Gonaives, and has been reported missing since then.    Observers note that apart from a communique issued by the  resigning government of Prime Minister Robert Malval, condemning  the Raboteau slaughter, none of the political class -- except  for Aristide's spokesman -- has reacted to this situation so far.    In its communique published on the night of 26 April, the  Army talked about a police operation carried out in Raboteau to  find the individuals who authored reprehensible actions  committed throughout the country, which according to the Haitian  Armed Forces is a destabilization plan conceived in Washington  by the legitimate Haitian authorities. President Aristide's  spokesman has denied this.</p>

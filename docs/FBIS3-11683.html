Luis Donaldo Colosio is being  transferred at this moment to the (?Schlips) Clinic in La Joya,  California, where he will be treated by doctors who  approximately 45 minutes ago were alerted to receive Mr. Colosio  in order to give him proper treatment.    Regarding the attackers, two persons are under arrest. One  is between 20 and 25 years of age. The young man has curly  hair. He was arrested by the PRI presidential candidate's  security agents.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Alfredo Cristiani with </F> unidentified reporters on 17 May; place not given; from the "YSU  Radio News" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Cristiani] As long as compliance with parts of the  peace agreements is pending, and because Onusal [UN Observers  for El Salvador] is in charge of verifying compliance; it is  only logical that it continue its work until the process is  over, gradually reducing its activities in the final phase, as  the UN secretary general has said. We believe the extension is  normal in view of pending matters such as public security, the  PNC [National Civilian Police], and the land transfer process,  which will continue after 31 May. I believe the extension is  necessary.    [Reporter] We understand that the Onusal head will hold a  high-level meeting on public security this week with the FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] and the government.  What specific public security issues will be discussed? Has  that meeting taken place?    [Cristiani] No, no, there has been no meeting. A  preparatory process in under way to discuss preliminary issues.  The most difficult points are discussed at the highest level.  We are trying to redesign the PNC deployment --at least that is  the government's position -- to avoid the vacuum of authority  that could result from expediting one aspect of a joint process;  that is, the deployment of one force and the demobilization of  another. This was originally planned one way, so we must try to  modify the plan so the next government [words indistinct] the  deployment would take place differently. The objective is to  provide security for citizens.    [Reporter] How are the kidnapping investigations going,  particularly in the western region?    [Cristiani] The kidnappings have not been just in the  western  region. Recently three [words indistinct] have been involved in  this type of activity in the eastern region, and there have also  been cases in other parts of the country. The western region  has been the most affected recently. We hope to continue [words  indistinct].    [Reporter] Yesterday [word indistinct] said this could  affect  the financial [words indistinct]. Our country is reportedly  among those which represent the highest risk for investors.    [Cristiani] We are not among the countries with the highest  investment risks. We are no longer in that category. We are  now among countries where investment is not so risky. This is a  problem of common crime that is not unique to El Salvador.  Crime is a problem everywhere. We could say it is worse in  Guatemala, and even Costa Rica is facing serious crime problems.  The modus operandi of these extortions and kidnappings indicate  that it is not a band of criminals specializing in such crimes  but common criminals who think it is easy to blackmail a family  by asking for large sums of money in exchange for the release of  one of its members. I believe that as we increase the number of  PNC agents, we will be able to fight crime more efficiently.    [Reporter] [Words indistinct] involved in kidnappings?    [Cristiani] There have been two cases.    [Reporter] The UN secretary general said international aid  is vital to the consolidation of the peace process. Do you  agree that international aid is fundamental to the process in  respect to public security and land transfers?    [Cristiani] It is fundamental in the sense that the country  lacks funds. Those programs can be implemented more quickly and  without problems when the international community supports them.  As for the land transfers, we think we have the necessary funds  to complete that program. The PNC is responsible for public  security, therefore the state is willing to continue providing  the necessary funds for a public security body that meets our  needs.    [Reporter] Would you say that those who gave financial  support to El Salvador [word indistinct] have abandoned the  country in peacetime ?    [Cristiani] I would not say that. Each country has its own  problems. New needs are arising in the world so resources must  be shared. East Europe, which has given up communism and is  trying promote development, has received a great deal of support  from industrialized nations.</p>

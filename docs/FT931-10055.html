			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Japanese venture for Stefanel STEFANEL, the Italian casual clothing group, has become the first European apparel maker to set up a manufacturing joint venture in Japan. The new company, Onward Stefanel, marks an extension of the Italian group's clothes retailing joint venture, signed in 1989, with the Onward Kashiyama group, which has led to the opening of 40 Stefanel stores in Japan. Mr Giorgio Stefanel, chairman of the Italian company, said the new company would produce between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of Stefanel's sales in Japan. The remainder would continue to be made in Italy. Stefanel intended to extend its Japanese retail coverage, and open more stores in China and Korea, where it already has a presence, he said. Elsag Bailey, the Italian precision engineering group which is part of the IRI state holding company, has won a L35bn (Dollars 23.7m) order from the Spanish postal authorities for automatic letter-sorting equipment for Madrid and Barcelona. The equipment includes electronic address recognition systems which will enable fully automatic letter sorting, as well as manual coding where necessary. Elsag Bailey has already supplied letter sorting equipment to the six automated letter sorting centres on which the Spanish postal system is currently based.</p>

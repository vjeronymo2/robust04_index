The Foreign Ministry of this ex-Soviet republic accused the  command of the 14th Russian Army deployed in the Moldovan  breakaway Dniester Province of "crude interference into the  affairs of the republic" and said in a statement issued on  Friday the Russian Army was "the main destabilising factor in  the Dniester region".    However, ealier this week, the Russian Army Command warned  all sides against "the illusion that the conflict can be solved  by force". It did say though that it would not stand on the  sidelines if anything untowards happened and promised that "the  organizers of armed provocations from either bank (of the  Dniester River) will get severe punishment for any attempt to  unleash a new conflict".    The Foreign Ministry said that such statements "undermine  bilateral negotiations on the future of the 14th Army" and  reiterated that the Moldovan leadership "insists on an  unconditional pullout of the army".    The statement then switched away from the Russian Army and  blasted the leadership of the Dniester region for "blocking any  constructive effort of Kishinev aiming to ensure peace in the  region" and for not allowing the area residents to participate  in Moldova's parliamentary elections scheduled for February 27.  The tone for the criticism must have been set by Moldovan  Presdient Mircea Snegur, who, still earlier in the week, accused  Tiraspol, the Dniester area administrative centre, of attempting  to further aggravate the social and political situation in the  republic.    The situation is evidently hotting up in the Dniester  Province. Already on Wednesday, the parliament of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic responded to verbal attacks by  calling on the United Nations, the Conference on Security and  Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and the heads of the CIS states to  send observers for "the objective assessment of the situation".    "The presence of international observers may prevent an  economic siege and a new military conflict in the region", the  appeal of the Dniester parliament said. The call was prompted  by the sense of an impending strike. "A single act of  provocation will be enough to have a military conflict  unleashed", Valeriy Prudnikov, chief of police in the Dniester  town of Bendery told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday.    To complicate the matter, the Russian Army and the Dniester  area are not the only pains in the back for Kishinev. The  leaders of the self-proclaimed Gagauz Republic in southern  Moldova poured oil in the fire by insisting that the 14th  Russian Army deployed in the former Soviet republic must be  granted the status of a peace-keeping force. This will prevent  Kishinev's possible attempts at solving by force the problem of  Moldova's two provinces - Dniester and Gagauz, said a statement  signed by Gagauz leaders.    Rather mollifying sounded the Friday statement of a CSCE  official Slavomir Dabrova, a Pole working for the CSCE mission  in Moldova. He predicted there would be no new military  conflicts since "the 1992 conflict with no winner was a good  lesson for politicians in Kishinev and Tiraspol".    "However, it is still a long way to the complete settlement  of the Moldovan conflicts, and international organisations  should work hard to untie this knot", he added.</p>

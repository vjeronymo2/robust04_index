			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Sema sells stake in subsidiary SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company which is quoted in London, has sold a 24.5 per cent interest in Sema Group Facilities Management, its UK-based outsourcing arm, to FT LIS - a wholly owned subsidiary of France Telecom - for Pounds 8.77m. The sale is being arranged through the creation of a UK joint venture company in which Sema and FT LIS will have equal shares and which will own 49 per cent of SGFM. Sema, which has built up a strong position in the fast expanding UK market for facilities management, will retain ownership of 75.5 per cent of the subsidiary. The facilities management operations made pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.7m in the year to end-December and had net assets of Pounds 2.61m. The move was welcomed in the market yesterday where Sema's share price gained 10p to close at 371p. Sema said it will use the proceeds of the sale for further development of its activities. The UK joint venture represents the latest in a growing number of links between Sema, which wants to expand its communications related operations, and the French telecommunications group, which is eager to develop its international business. In October FT LIS acquired an indirect stake in Sema after it established a joint venture company with Paribas to hold the French bank's 39 per cent shareholding in Sema. France Telecom owns a 49.9 per cent stake in the holding company. Following that agreement Mr Charles Rozmaryn, head of France Telecom, and Mr Michel Huet, head of FT LIS, joined the Sema board.</p>

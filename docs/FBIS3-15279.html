The President Is Looking for a Fulcrum"]    [Text] The role of the Security Council may increase  substantially in the near future. Observers do not rule out  that this year already this consultative presidential body may  rank next to the government and parliament or in some respects  even rise above them. That the Security Council is preparing  for a new role can be seen from the purge under way there: a  special commission is studying cases of leaks, as a result of  which the security regime will obviously be tightened.  Yesterday, meanwhile, the reorganization of the council  apparatus began.    The reorganization itself is a purely apparatus action aimed  at limiting the independence of the numerous interdepartmental  commissions. To this end the Security Council sectors that  ensure its activity are to be placed under the control of Oleg  Lobov's deputies. One of the three deputies -- General Valeriy  Manilov, responsible for preparing council sessions -- will  apparently become first deputy. Reshuffles in the apparatus  deck appear routine only at first sight: This is the Security  Council's fifth reorganization over the relatively short time of  its existence. Everything depends on who will decide to use the  apparatus, how, and for what purpose.    According to information in possession of KOMMERSANT-DAILY,  Security Council secretary Oleg Lobov, who has failed to  overpower the inveterate economic manager within himself,  although he has been close to Boris Yeltsin ever since the  Sverdlovsk days, will apparently leave his post and go on a  prolonged business trip abroad. According to one version, he  will replace Ivan Silayev as Russia's representative to the EC.    Yuriy Baturin, the president's national security adviser, is  tipped to be the next Security Council secretary. His confusion  in the amnesty situation may have diminished his chances in the  public eye. Yet the main criterion for Boris Yeltsin is  personal loyalty, and judging by Mr. Baturin's breathtaking  career, everything is quite all right here.    Naturally the new Security Council secretary will need some  time to establish contacts with the power ministries. But  having asserted himself in this post, Mr. Baturin will head an  organization more structured than before, cleared of people  responsible for information leaks, and permeating practically  all spheres of the country's life -- from protecting the  population's health to defense and security.    Given that the government, which cannot be called  pro-presidential by any stretch, is headed by Viktor  Chernomyrdin -- a man capable of independent moves -- while in  parliament the president's supporters are in the minority, it  becomes clear that Boris Yeltsin urgently needs a structure he  can lean on.    A renewed Security Council appears to be the best support  with whose assistance Boris Yeltsin can regain his slipping  grasp on power without any anti-constitutional moves. Under  certain circumstances (it is enough to recall Vladimir  Shumeyko's recent slip of the tongue about the need to introduce  a state of emergency to fight crime) the Security Council can be  placed above the government and parliament as a body  coordinating the activity of all branches of power for the sake  of national security interests.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Knitwear makers hit at Nafta US knitwear and sportswear makers have expressed opposition to the North American free trade agreement, saying it will spur unemployment and damage US companies and communities, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington. While praising negotiators for putting into place 'sound' rules of origin, designed to create a competitive North American textile and apparel industry, the board of the National Knitwear and Sportswear Association said approval of the agreement would 'tell our industry and its workers they should not count on the federal government's interest in maintaining apparel manufacturing operations in the US. 'We cannot understand where our people will find new work, for what jobs they will be re-educated and/or retrained, where those jobs are expected to be located, or who will bear the burden of the huge piece of social engineering in the name of free trade. 'Without domestic workers, there are no domestic buyers.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guy Rogers] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg March 25 SAPA -- If international  mediation to break the current constitutional impasse takes  place, as has now been agreed, one of the first and most  difficult issues will be procedural rather than substantive:  The timescale for mediation and the date of the April election.    This according to SA [South African] Institute of Race  Relations researcher Anthea Jeffrey, who notes the Inkatha  Freedom Party's [IFP] position that mediation "will not achieve  anything while the election process and its timetables outstrip  steps that can be taken to find a comprehensive solution".    However, African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson  Mandela has said the election cannot be postponed, a position  endorsed by the National Party [NP].    Ms Jeffrey says that if mediators get the antagonists past  this obstacle then two key constitutional issues, plus the  demand made by King Goodwill Zwelithini for Zulu  self-determination, still need to be resolved.    February amendments to the constitution, reflecting the  viewpoint of the ANC and the NP, included an increase in the  areas of jurisdiction -- although not the legislative powers --  of provinces, and the provision for two ballots in the election.  Another amendment enables provinces to determine their own  "structures", although not their legislative or fiscal  capabilities.    Central to the issues which still need to be resolved by  mediation is the IFP's position that it will make further  concessions -- accepting wide powers of central override in  relation to provincial legislative powers -- only if the Freedom  Alliance's December 19 "yellow paper" is accepted as a package.    The two key issues at the heart of the yellow paper and  which  require international mediation are:     -  the current two-phase process for constitution-making; and,    -  the entrenched devolution of substantial power to provinces.       The ANC insists on the former, Ms Jeffrey Notes, but refuses  the latter. The IFP insists on the latter but rejects the  former. It has said it will concede a two-phase process at  national level only if substantial power is given to provinces  in the transitional constitution and also entrenched in the  final constitution.    Substantive, entrenched provincial powers, in the IFP's  view,  require:     -  more legislative competance for provinces;    -  an independent tax base for provinces;    -  substantial autonomy for provinces in drawing up their own  constitutions; and,    -  entrenchment of provincial autonomy.       The ANC, Ms Jeffrey notes, says it and the NP have gone "a  long way" towards addressing the Freedom Alliance's concerns,  much further than they believed they ought to have gone. The  IFP has said the election timetable might need to be revised to  give the mediation process enough time and to enable all parties  to compete on an equal footing. But, according to ANC Secretary  General Cyril Ramaphosa, "the election date is engrave in stone.  It cannot be changed."    If mediation goes ahead despite the repercussions of the  recent events in the homelands, Ms Jeffrey concludes, "one of  the first and most difficult issues to face international  mediators, accordingly, will be procedural rather than  substantive: the timescale for mediation and the date for the  April election".    It was announced in a joint statment this week that the ANC  and the IFP had agreed to international mediation "to seek a  constitutional settlement between the two parties" and that this  should begin as soon as possible.    Senior negotiation sources have revealed that former U.S.  secretary of state and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Henry  Kissinger will head the mediation commission and British Foreign  Secretary Lord Carrington will be one of three other men under  him.    The sources told SAPA the two parties had agreed to abide by  the commission's decision.</p>

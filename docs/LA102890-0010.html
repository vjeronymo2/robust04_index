			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> THIS YEAR'S MODEL: Remember all the publicity George Michael got when he  announced he wouldn't be doing any videos for his new album (because he wanted  us to focus on his song lyrics)? Let's say that was . . . half-true. Michael  isn't appearing in any videos, but that doesn't mean he isn't making any  videos.  </P> <P> In fact, hot-shot director David Fincher (who's scheduled to shoot "Aliens  III") has just finished a five-day shoot in London of Michael's upcoming  single, "Freedom 90." Instead of spotlighting George, the clip showcases a  quintet of world-class fashion models, including Cindy Crawford, Christy  Turlington and Tatiana, who lip-sync the song (you could say it's like Robert  Palmer's "Addicted to Love" clip, except without Palmer). . . . And from our  Wish We'd Been There Dept.: When Tom Petty celebrated his 40th birthday at his  San Fernando Valley home last weekend, the music room got quite a workout.  Celebrants included Bruce Springsteen, Roger McGuinn, Jeff Lynne and most of  the Heartbreakers, who launched into a spontaneous jam, featuring such  favorites as "Little Red Rooster," "Roll Over Beethoven," "Mr. Tambourine Man"  and "Great Balls of Fire." Spectators included Elvis Costello, Gary Shandling,  Carlene Carter and Howie Epstein (who are a couple these days) and Kathy  Valentine.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, May 30 (AFP) -- Rival Iraqi Kurdish factions  met in Silopi, southeast Turkey, on Monday [30 May] but failed  to agree on an end to their month-long clashes in northern Iraq,  Kurdish sources said.    Officials from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) emerged from the meeting near  the Iraqi border, organised by Turkey, without making any  comment to journalists.    But Kurdish sources said the officials failed to make any  progress in efforts to halt the fighting which has claimed more  than 100 lives since the start of May and split northern Iraq  into PUK and KDP-controlled zones.    Tehran Radio said Monday that thousands of Kurds had fled  their homes amid renewed fighting in Qal'at Dizah,  al-Sulaymaniyah, the Hajj 'Umran region of Halabjah, near the  Iranian border, and in Irbil.    Northern Iraq has been under Kurdish control since it was  established with the help of the U.S.-led coalition which drove  Iraqi occupying forces out of Kuwait in February 1991.</p>

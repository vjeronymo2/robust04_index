			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charities lose out on dividend decision Sir, BAT Industries on Thursday announced that its dividend will be paid as foreign income dividend, which means that it is now effectively a gross amount. In order to protect the position of both taxpayers and non-taxpayers, the rate has been increased from 12.2p to 15.25p. Although this will make no difference to the vast majority of holders, charities, all of which benefit from transitional relief in respect of the change in advance corporation tax rate, will suffer. I understand the Treasury has insisted that only one rate be paid; consequently, charities will lose out, as they will be unable to claim this relief. Surely the authorities should give further consideration to this problem. A W Behrens, director - charities fund management, Capel-Cure Myers Capital Management, The Registry, Royal Mint Court, London EC3</p>

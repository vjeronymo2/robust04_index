			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Matt Clark buys Freetraders - Pounds 12.9m rights enables expansion without hurting balance sheet MATTHEW CLARK, the British wines and mineral water group, yesterday announced a Pounds 12.9m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Freetraders Group, a leading drinks wholesaler. Freetraders, which recorded a 45 per cent increase in sales last year, mainly to independent pubs, restaurants and hotels in southern England, will complement Matthew Clark's wholesaling operations in the take-home trade. Clark, which yesterday also announced a 16 per cent increase to Pounds 5.3m in profits for the year to April 30, will pay Pounds 12.8m for 74.9 per cent of Freetraders, including Devenish's 30 per cent stake and Swiss Bank Corporation's 20 per cent holding. It will provide an additional Pounds 5.8m towards repayment of the company's existing debts from a new Pounds 7m bank facility. The 4-for-9 rights issue, fully underwritten by BZW, will be at 320p a share, a 185p discount to yesterday's close of 405p, unchanged. The remaining 25.1 per cent of Freetraders, owned by its management, and a 49.9 per cent minority interest in its Francis of Guildford subsidiary, will be acquired over the next two years. The price will depend on the company's performance but will be subject to a maximum aggregate of Pounds 16m. Freetraders, reported an operating profit of Pounds 2.3m on turnover of Pounds 39.4m in the year to September 30 1992. Mr Peter Aikens, Matthew Clark's chief executive, said the rights issue would enable the group to continue to expand its business without weakening a strong balance sheet. 'The group is well positioned for further development,' he said. In 'another year of difficult trading conditions,' earnings per share expanded 8 per cent to 36.2p. A final dividend of 10p lifts the total to 16.75p, an increase of 6 per cent. Operating profits rose from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 5.36m on turnover, net of duty, 5 per cent higher at Pounds 42m. The group's share of the expanding British sherry market, in which it owns the brand leader, Old England, continued to grow, and Stone's ginger wine performed strongly. Strathmore bottled water, acquired in May last year, expanded distribution outside Scotland and contributed Pounds 460,000 to operating profits. COMMENT The Freetraders acquisition looks a sound move for the group. It will bring some balance to the present overdependence of the wholesaling operations on multiple grocers and other take-home outlets. The free on-licensed trade is a fragmented and fast-growing sector which offers considerable opportunities; though as number two in the business, Matthew Clark will have to work harder to seize them. Having successfully restructured over the past three years as a producer of drinks brands, the strengthening of its wholesaling operations continues a coherent strategy of making the most of its limited resources.</p>

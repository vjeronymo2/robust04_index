			<p><P> December 3, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VASQUEZ CAUGHT IN MIDDLE OF NORTH-SOUTH JAIL ISSUE  </P> <P> Amid the arid hills and sprawling ranch-style homes near Gypsum Canyon,  residents boast that their community is as safe as it is quiet and pleasant.  And they passionately insist that it's no place for a jail.  </P> <P> "The idea of a maximum-minimum security jail here is obscene," said Carol  Cantwell, a member of the local parks and recreation commission. "It's the  safety of everybody's daughter and not just mine that we're worried about. And  it's sons, too."  </P> <P> About 25 miles south in Lake Forest, another tidy neighborhood inhabited by a  not-so-different group of young families strikes a similar chord: In their  case, they've spent years living a few hundreds yards from the minimum-security  James A. Musick Branch Jail, and they're tired of it.  </P> <P> "Darn right we'd like to get rid of it," said Pam Russell-Ogden, who moved into  a new home in Lake Forest four months ago. On her front lawn, a pair of signs  warn visitors that the house is guarded by a security system that promises an  "armed response."  </P> <P> "We just bought this home, and we installed the security system," Russell-Ogden  said from behind a partially open front door. "They tell us there are people in  there who do drugs, and they periodically walk away. Well, where are they going  to come? Right here. We're the next street over."  </P> <P> Caught between these two communities and their fears is one elected official:  Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. On Dec. 18, the interests of these  South County and North County residents will clash head on, and Vasquez, who  represents both areas, will face a moment that no politician would envy.  </P> <P> That day, the Board of Supervisors is expected to consider a staff  recommendation to move ahead with building the Gypsum Canyon jail, which is  slated for a site just outside of Anaheim and Yorba Linda. Vasquez has long  opposed that, but the county staff now is suggesting that the government raise  some of the money for the $1 billion-plus project by closing the Musick jail  and selling the land there for development.  </P> <P> So Vasquez has a choice: He can reverse his longstanding opposition to Gypsum  Canyon and vote to build a new county jail there. If he does that, some Anaheim  and Yorba Linda residents say they will never forgive him. Alternatively,  Vasquez can stay the course, and in the process dash the hopes of Lake Forest  and El Toro residents who see Gypsum Canyon as the key to ridding themselves of  their unwelcome neighbor, the Musick facility. Those constituents will not soon  forget Vasquez's vote either.  </P> <P> "Gaddi is caught in the middle," Yorba Linda Councilman Henry W. Wedaa said in  an interview last week. "Now we'll see what kind of politician he is because we  don't want it here and they don't want it there."  </P> <P> At the other end of Vasquez's district, Bill Krause, general manager of the  Lake Forest II Master Homeowners' Assn., agrees. "The supervisor is going to  have to acknowledge what his constituency role is here and what it is in the  North County, and he's going to have to make a decision," Krause said.  </P> <P> For his part, Vasquez calls the talk of closing Musick to fund Gypsum "highly  speculative" and says he refuses to raise false hopes in Lake Forest by  suggesting that the Musick jail might soon close.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the supervisor remains steadfast in opposing Gypsum Canyon.  </P> <P> "My opposition to Gypsum Canyon is well-documented and unchanged," Vasquez said  in one of several interviews last week.  </P> <P> Vasquez joined with Supervisor Don R. Roth in voting against selecting the  canyon as the county's new jail site in 1987, and their two votes were enough  to block acquiring the property through condemnation, a procedure that requires  four votes of the board. They've held to that position ever since, and progress  on the Gypsum jail has stalled.  </P> <P> But with the county's jail overcrowding problems mounting and a federal judge  poised to consider imposing strict new limits on the county jails, pressure is  building for the supervisors to move ahead with plans for a new facility. The  Dec. 18 session will give them a chance to demonstrate progress when they take  up a recommendation to reaffirm their support for Gypsum Canyon and to direct  their staff to draw up plans for financing construction of that facility.  </P> <P> It won't be easy. The county is in deep financial trouble, and planners concede  that they have no way to pay for Gypsum. Selling Musick would help, but Vasquez  and others note that it may be a more complicated transaction than it appears  on the surface. The Musick jail sits on the edge of the El Toro Marine Corps  Air Station, so selling the property for new homes probably is not realistic.  It could, however, be transformed into office space, as could the land it abuts  to the west.  </P> <P> The Musick facility covers 100 acres, and turning it into an office park could  bring the county upward of $100 million, hardly enough to cover the cost of  building Gypsum Canyon, but enough to make a sizable down payment.  </P> <P> More troublesome is how the county would deal with the 1,200 prisoners that  Musick can house on a typical night. It would presumably be years between  Musick's closure and the opening of Gypsum Canyon, and during that period the  county would have no place to house those inmates.  </P> <P> But even with some questions unresolved, news of the staff report recommending  that Musick be shut down has already reached Lake Forest. And residents there  are eager to know whether Vasquez will represent their interests when the  matter comes before the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> "I hope they close this jail," said Eugenia Rios, a Lake Forest resident who  has lived near the Musick jail for 13 years. "It worries me all the time. Why  should (Vasquez) keep this open near us if he can close it?"  </P> <P> Across the street, Carol Barlow agreed. "They say that when they escape, they  leave the area," she said. "But you never know. What if my car was sitting  right out here, and one of them needed to get away?"  </P> <P> Neighbor after neighbor agreed, almost without exception citing the nagging  uncertainty that comes with living near a jail. Moreover, as long as the Musick  facility exists, the residents worry that the county might someday enlarge it  or turn it into a maximum-security facility. Only with the jail gone will they  finally rest easy, residents said.  </P> <P> But if there is concern in Lake Forest, it hardly compares with the virulent  public opposition that exists in and around Gypsum Canyon. Residents of that  area live farther from the proposed jail than the distance between Lake Forest  homeowners and the Musick facility. But in the Anaheim canyons, they are faced  with the prospect of a 6,720-bed maximum-security jail moving in just up the  road. That jail would house accused killers, rapists and other prisoners  accused of serious crimes and awaiting trial.  </P> <P> The thought of it has residents of Anaheim and Yorba Linda seeing red.  </P> <P> "There's more breakouts than we really hear about," said Craig S. Miller, who  chairs Citizens Against Gypsum Canyon Jail and who is building a home a little  more than a mile from the proposed jail site. "I have three children. I worry  about the type of transients that are going to be in the area."  </P> <P> Like his neighbors, Miller is watching Vasquez.  </P> <P> "I hope Gaddi keeps his commitment to us," he said. "He promised to keep the  Gypsum Canyon jail from happening. I don't think he can change his vote at this  late date."  </P> <P> But, Miller, who currently lives in Yorba Linda, added later: "Lots of  politicians make a lot of promises that they don't keep."  </P> <P> Anaheim city officials are for the most part confident that Vasquez will stand  by them, but they too are aware of the pressure that the supervisor's South  County constituents might bring to bear. To protect itself, the city has moved  to incorporate Gypsum Canyon so that it can control the development of the  area, preferring to let the Irvine Co. build thousands of homes on the land.  </P> <P> And though city leaders are sympathetic to the pleas of Lake Forest residents,  they echo the views of their constituents when they declare that Gypsum Canyon  is the wrong place for a jail.  </P> <P> "I cringe when I think about this," said Anaheim Mayor Fred Hunter, whose home  is a few miles from the site and who has long opposed it. "The whole area on  both sides of the freeway is single-family homes. Why would you want to put a  jail in middle of single-family homes? It's mind-boggling."  </P> <P> This issue is simple, Hunter adds, uttering a refrain that haunts the jail  issue generally and Vasquez in particular: "I'm not against a jail. I'm just  against a jail here."  </P></p>

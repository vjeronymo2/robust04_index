			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable discussion as part of political magazine program </F> `News 2001' with Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international  trade and industry (MITI), Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi of Keio  University, columnist Minoru Omori, and commentator Kenichi  Takemura attending, moderated by newscasters Yuri Kuroiwa and  Kaori Matsuyama]    [Excerpts] [Kuroiwa] In describing the [Washington]  summit meeting, people are using the expression failure, but it  could be a start of mature relationship. What is your frank  view of this?    [Kumagai] I feel exactly the same way. I would prefer to  use the expression damage control rather than failure. As the  President says, let's cool our head down, and then take up the  issues once again. This attitude was clearly revealed in the  joint news conference of the two top leaders. The talks started  last July. There were problems from the beginning, and it can be  said those problems surfaced prominently only recently. But I  am relieved very much to see from the joint news conference that  there is a common recognition that bilteral relations between  Japan and the United States are one of the most important of  bilteral relations.    While the economy is a very important matter, and even  though  there remain unresolved issues between the two countries, there  is a common recognition that these issues must be resolved. If  I may compare it to mountain climbing, the two countries agree  which mountain top to climb, but disagree on which routes to  take. As long as both countries can discuss and agree on which  route to take, I do not think Japan-U.S. relations will rupture.    There may be some minor tremors. Basically, I can see the  strong relations of trust between the top leaders of the  countries. As such, I think we need not be worried even though  there are problems.    [Kobayashi] Regarding the setting of numerical targets --  for example, in use of U.S.-made semiconductors -- do you as the  minister of international trade and industry think this is a  sort of managed trade and is against the spirit of the GATT?    [Kumagai] I would like to set the issue of semiconductors  aside. There is a long history to it. But doing something like  that in other areas is unacceptable. We cannot accept it. That  is going completely contrary to the direction aimed at by the  Hosokawa government. That is going against the basic thinking  of deciding things based on the functioning of open markets. I  think we can never accept it -- even in the future. [passage on  Omori's comment omitted]    [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori says the U.S. Congress may agree on  taking retaliatory actions against Japan. Minister Kumagai, how  do you intend to respond to that?    [Kumagai] It will not come just from the U.S. Congress, but  also from the administration. Naturally, it is possible to  think that they will do something with the exchange rate or make  verbal threats. The U.S. Congress in particular has been very  aggressive in this regard. That is why I used the expression  damage control. What is important is that whether it be the  exchange rate or reinstituting the 301 provisions, I think there  are ways to respond to them. In the case of the exchange rate,  I think there are limits to what it can do. Eventually, the  rate will come to change by the logic of the market. There is  no doubt that the Japan's surplus has peaked and is coming down.  The rate might fluctuate for the time being, but I think we can  cope with it in a calm manner.    As regards the 301 provisions, I think we can take care of  them in the multilateral arena of negotiations. What is  important is for Japan to not act emotionally as they do. What  is most important is for Japan to open an arena of talks and to  resume negotiations soon -- since it is true that there is the  trade gap between the two countries and we have this problem of  the gap needing to be narrowed and removed.    [Kuroiwa] If the retaliations come to be enforced in fact,  will you appeal this to the GATT?    [Kumagai] Of course, I will if the retaliations have no  legal grounds. For instance, if they abolish taxes on parts or  if the 301 provisions are reinstituted, I think we can act  against it based on pertinent rules. [passage on Takeuchi's and  Omori's comments omitted]    [Matsuyama] Mr. Kumagai, the United States is saying it will  decide on retaliation before the Napoli summit in July. That  means Japan will have to do something before July? [Kumagai]  Yes, in fact way before that. In areas other than numerical  targets, the talks were making smooth very progress -- with  respect to procedures, deregulation, and so forth. Hence, if  the issue of numerical targets is resolved in a way that those  things are not necessary... [changes thought] We need to recall  why the issue of the numerical targets was raised to begin with.  There was the following line of thinking: If regulations are  eased and trade is allowed to be conducted in a freer manner,  things normally improve automatically, but in the case of Japan,  it is not going well. Hence, the most effective way to deal  with Japan is to assign numbers -- shares or growth rates -- to  it. This is the rationale given by those who say Japan is  different from other countries.    It is important to deal with this problem of the U.S.  mistrust in Japan. For instance, to take negotiations on the  construction market, there is an agreement on the score report  system under which when there is no improvement over the past,  both parties will get together and think up new ways of making  improvement possible. Under the agreement, what the governments  will do and what the private sectors should do are  distinguished. In this manner, much progress has already been  made in this area.    I think the same degree of result can be achieved in other  areas. Right now the United States is distrustful of Japan. If  Japan can present leads that can remove this mistrust, I am sure  we can bring the talks to a conclusion.    Mr. Omori gave a pessimistic view. But as far as we -- the  people at the front of the negotiations -- are concerned, we  feel we were only a short way away from the goal.    [Kuroiwa] Mr. Omori mentioned the possibility of the United  States inciting yen value to rise in the exchange market. Do  you see that possibility?    [Kumagai] To talk about inciting the yen rate, it is  unthinkable that they would intervene in the market and pump in  a huge amount of money. In other words, inciting will come  verbally. Oral intervention is effective when the market is  already flowing toward that way. But Japan's surplus is heading  for the direction of being eased, and it is losing its  competitiveness very fast. Changes are taking place in Japan.  Supermarkets want to buy cheap foreign products, and the  Japanese consumers have become price- conscious, too. They are  no longer sticklers for Japanese products. When taking these  conditions into account, I think it is possible that the high  yen will impact the Japanese economy, as Mr. Omori has said, but  it will be for a short while and will not last long. That is  what I think. [passage omitted on Omori's comment on U.S.  mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats]    [Kuroiwa] Mr. Kumagai, what is your view on the question of  U.S. mistrust of Japanese bureaucrats?    [Kumagai] They are very emotional. That is why such  criticism is fired against us. To take the auto issue for  instance, Japan's purchases of auto parts from the United States  have grown drastically. But they do not want to confirm this  fact. I am sure the auto part companies and auto manufacturers  of the United States are aware of this very well. I feel the  warriors of Washington are firing verbal barrages at us without  confirming this. After all, we are talking about economic  negotiations. Judgments should be based, based on given facts.  What is important is that we are not saying that existing  conditions are desirable. Japan must make it clear it will take  concrete actions to resolve this trade surplus issue. But there  are things that cannot be done, and about those things we have  no choice but to abide by our stand. [passage omitted on  Kobayashi's comments on Japan's problems]    [Kumagai] We explained to them about plans on deregulation  to liberalize and open up the market further and progress has  been made in the negotiations. After hearing what Mr. Omori  said to me a little while ago, I feel I must make clear to the  people of the United States one point -- that framework talks  are not an arena of negotiations where only Japan talks but both  countries do talk. If sales of autos or medical supplies to  Japan are to be raised, both countries must make efforts. To  take autos for instance, Neon is said to be a very good car with  steering wheels on right hand side. But that car is not coming  to Japan. They don't want to sell it in Japan until two years  pass. I would like to say sales can be made only with both  sides agreeing.    The summit meeting ended only just now. Verbal barrages may  not be inevitable for now. But both countries' economy is  dependent on each other. Where economy is concerned, Japan is  not a country that can be ignored by the United States -- more  so if the political and security issues are added to it. So is  the United States to Japan. I think we need to think coolly and  calmly in this respect. [passage omitted on comments by Takemura  and writer Susume Nishibe]    [Kuroiwa] Minister Kumagai, what is most important to make  the Japan-U.S. relationship the real adults' relationship?    [Kumagai] That is to make clear Japan's resolve to redress  the problem of the conspicuous current-account surplus. The way  of doing is to depart from the past bureaucratic ways and to do  it through basic reforming of economy. To see from statistical  numbers, the current-account surplus ran to 3.8 percent of the  gross domestic product at the peak point. Germany's record  topped 4.0 percent once, and at that time it came under heavy  attack from all over the world. At present, that percentage for  Japan has come to below 3 percent. It will go down to 2.8  percent next year, and will go on down further. I am sure the  problem is being resolved. It is not desirable to get excited  [words indistinct]. The Hosokawa government should return to  the starting point, and should become a government which is  friendly to the world -- by carrying out economic,  administrative, and political reforms.</p>

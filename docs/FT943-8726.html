			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Life assurers warm to policy of tougher training: William Lewis and Alison Smith on radical changes that have shaken up a financial sales industry Three years ago life assurance regulator Lautro held a 250,000-strong register of people permitted to sell regulated financial products. Today that figures stands at 90,000 and is shrinking at the rate of 2,000 a month. Mr Martin Tuckwell, a senior official at Lautro and its successor as industry watchdog - the Personal Investment Authority - said: 'It will probably go on dropping to 70,000.' The reason for the sharp fall, Mr Tuckwell said, had a lot to do with the regulator's initiative to shake up training and management standards in the industry. Termed the Training and Competence Scheme, it has laid down strict guidelines for standards that new recruits must meet, including examination details. It has also sought to implement higher standards of management by firms of sales staff, encouraging the development of a new line of supervisors whose job is to watch over those that sell. With similar changes being introduced by the other main financial services regulators, including Fimbra, the watchdog for independent financial advisers, the T&amp;C programme has acted as a catalyst for fundamental change in the industry. Mr Tuckwell said a new PIA scheme, to be introduced next year, would be little different from Lautro's, which he said had forced companies to implement changes they had spent years resisting. 'The T&amp;C scheme has been responsible for pushing radical changes forward,' he said. It has not been without its price for life assurance companies, however. Thousands of pounds in fines have been levied by Lautro after training and competence audits, including Pounds 300,000 on Norwich Union after breakdowns in management controls and concern over recruitment procedures. Other companies, which have not been fined, have often been forced to take dramatic measures to meet Lautro's demands. In July Nationwide Building Society suspended all its 1,300 sales staff and sent half of them to an intensive retraining programme. All this has been done amid great publicity which some senior industry executives, including Sir Simon Hornby, chairman of Lloyds Abbey Life, blame for a sharp fall in the sales of pensions and other financial products since the beginning of the year. Figures for the second quarter of this year from the Association of British Insurers, due out this week, are expected to confirm the trend already apparent from the new business figures for the first half of the year from some of the largest life companies. Some are sceptical about the difference the T&amp;C scheme has made. Mr Philip Scott, life and pensions general manager at Norwich Union, said: 'I cannot point to anything and say that's better because of it.' However, Norwich Union has shed a large number of sales staff, as have several other life companies which are being forced to amend their training regimes. As disclosed in yesterday's Financial Times, Nationwide has decided to cut the number of its sales staff permitted to sell regulated products from 1,300 to 650. This is due in part to the cost of fully training a life assurance salesman. Mr Stephen Maran, of Lloyds Abbey Life, estimates that compliance costs for the company are seven or eight times the costs of compliance four or five years ago. The public face of the T&amp;C initiative, at least in the short term, is likely to be limited. Cold calling - where sales staff phone or knock on doors without an introduction in an attempt to make a sale - is already coming to an end. It is no longer done at Sun Life, which has 240 direct sales people, and has been banned at Norwich Union. Fact finds - the industry term for the information-gathering process sales staff go through with all prospective clients - are likely to take longer because the regulator insists on rigorous checking by managers. Important changes are also taking place behind the scenes at life companies. For the first time managers are being employed to supervise sales staff rather than act as super salesmen. Mr Tuckwell said: 'The main hidden agenda within the Lautro scheme is making supervision the key element in all this.' Managers are likely to be paid a salary rather than have their pay based on the commission that sales staff are earning. This change is also taking root in sales forces, with Sun Life planning to move away from commission-only staff to a combination of salary plus commission - in line with Barclays Life and others. For Mr Don Shore, deputy managing director of Royal Life, the main effect of the T&amp;C scheme will be on sales staff themselves. Uniform training standards 'means there is no longer any hiding place in the industry', he said.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Emergency legislation to amend ruling on insolvency The government is to bring in emergency retrospective legislation to reverse an Appeal Court ruling which threatened tens of thousands of jobs at companies in receivership or administration. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the House of Commons yesterday that a bill would be introduced 'as a matter of urgency' to remove uncertainty caused by the court ruling. Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said: 'If Mr Heseltine had not stepped in with the promise of immediate legislation, hundreds more companies would have gone out of business, and thousands of their workers would have lost their jobs.' The statement follows two weeks of intensive lobbying by insolvency practitioners, who had already begun to lay off staff at insolvent companies rather than risk incurring additional employment costs. Their action was triggered by a controversial ruling involving Paramount Airways, the charter airline which is in administration under the 1986 Insolvency Act. The court ruled that where administrators or receivers continue for more than 14 days after their appointment to employ staff and pay them, they are in effect liable for employees' holiday entitlements, pay in lieu of notice, and other responsibilities under their existing contracts. Under the new legislation, administrators and receivers will be able to adopt restricted contracts of employment, excluding employment costs other than wages, salaries and pension contributions. Other liabilities arising from employees' original contracts will remain, but would be treated as an unsecured claim against the company. However, the legislation will do nothing to reduce the impact of the Appeal Court's ruling on companies which are already in receivership or administration, including Paramount itself. The creditors of the company met yesterday. They are believed to have tentatively agreed to take their case to the House of Lords, on condition that most of the legal costs are paid by the insolvency profession. Mr Heseltine said that the practice of administration had been 'placed in jeopardy' by the court judgment, 'with all that that means for jobs, commercial activity and business confidence'. The bill will go through all its stages in both houses in 24 hours and will take effect retrospectively from midnight last night Administrators who are in the first two weeks of their appointment will benefit from the new rules if they delay their acceptance of contracts until today Mr Mark Homan, president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency, welcomed the new legislation but admitted that before clarification no new payments would be made to the creditors to many companies already in receivership or administration. The government statement may be too late to save 140 jobs at Michael Mayes, the insolvent Yorkshire textile manufacturer which was the first company threatened with large-scale redundancies as a result of the Paramount ruling.

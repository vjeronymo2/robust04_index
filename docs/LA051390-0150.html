			<p><P> May 13, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: WOODY STEPHENS STILL ON THE CRITICAL LIST  </P> <P> Hall of Fame trainer Woody Stephens remained in critical but stable condition  Saturday at a Louisville, Ky., hospital, one day after undergoing open-heart  surgery.  </P> <P> Stephens, 76, who was connected to a respirator, was alert and resting  comfortably, said Pam Greer-Ullrich, a spokeswoman for Norton Hospital.  </P> <P> "The doctor thinks he's doing as well as can be expected for someone who has  undergone a quadruple bypass," she said.  </P> <P> Stephens underwent the surgery for complications that arose while he was  hospitalized for emphysema, she said.  </P> <P> Stephens is the only trainer to win five consecutive Belmont Stakes. He won the  Kentucky Derby twice -- in 1974 with Cannonade and in 1984 with Swale.  </P></p>

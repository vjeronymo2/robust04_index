This action is authorized by the regulations implementing the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The trip limits are designed to keep landings within the 1994 harvest guidelines for these species while extending the fishery as long as possible during the year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective from 0001 hours (local time) July, 1, 1994, until December 31, 1994.

Trip landing and frequency limits for the DTS complex are among those management measures that have been designated as routine at 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1). Implementation and further adjustment of those measures may occur after consideration at a single Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council) meeting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A trip limit is defined at 50 CFR 663.2 as: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> the total allowable amount of a groundfish species or species complex by weight, or by percentage of weight of fish on board, that may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed from a single fishing trip. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A cumulative trip limit is the maximum amount that may be taken and retained, possessed or landed per vessel in a specified period of time, without a limit on the number of landings or trips. Cumulative trip limits for 1994 apply to calendar months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 1, 1994, the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex was set at 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) per month, including no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) of thornyheads and 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) of trawl-caught sablefish. In any landing of the DTS complex, the trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish was set at 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 25 percent of the DTS complex, whichever was greater, and applied to each trip. In any landing, no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) could be trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) (59 FR 685, January 6, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to simplify the percentage portion of the trip limit, on May 6, 1994, NMFS restated it in equivalent terms that are easier to calculate_25 percent of the DTS complex (including sablefish) is equivalent to 33.333 percent (approximately one third) of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole (i.e., the DTS complex excluding sablefish) (59 FR 23638, May 6, 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DTS are managed collectively as the DTS complex because they are often caught together in the trawl fishery. Information on DTS complex landings indicated that at the current rate of harvest, the harvest guidelines for thornyheads and trawl-caught sablefish would be achieved well before the end of the year. The Council, therefore, convened an emergency tele-conference Council meeting to consider the issue on June 17, 1994. The best available information presented at the June 17, 1994, teleconference Council meeting indicated that the trawl catch of sablefish through May 28, 1994, was 1,803 mt or 51 percent of the 1994 trawl allocation, and that the catch rate for trawl-caught sablefish during April-May 1994 was 112 percent of the catch rate average for this period in 1992 and 1993. The data also indicated that the catch of thornyheads through May 28, 1994, was 3,829 mt or 55 percent of the 1994 harvest guideline for thornyheads. High thornyhead prices to the fishers have attracted much greater effort, and the recent rate of thornyhead landings was 78 percent above the 1992&hyph;1993 catch rate average. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, if landing rates are not curtailed, the harvest guideline for trawl-caught sablefish (3,521 mt) would be taken near August 26, 1994, and the harvest guideline for thornyheads (7,000 mt) would be taken near August 7, 1994. In order to delay the achievement of the harvest guidelines, the Council recommended imposing an immediate reduction in the cumulative trip limit for the DTS complex from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) per calendar month. Within this limit, no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) may be thornyheads (down from 30,000 lb (13,608 kg)) and no more than 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish (down from 12,000 lb (5,443 kg)). The individual trip limit for trawl-caught sablefish of 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater, and the 5,000 pound (2,268 kg) limit on trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length) remain unchanged. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The sharp increase in monthly catch of thornyheads and sablefish has been associated with a decrease in the monthly catch of Dover sole. The reduction in the thornyhead cumulative limit is expected to greatly reduce the magnitude and frequency of trips in deep water. The shift in effort to shallow water should increase the catch of Dover sole and decrease the catch of thornyheads, but sablefish are caught in association with both species. Because the sablefish limit has been reduced to 6,000 lb (2,721 kg), the reduction in the DTS complex limit from 50,000 lb (22,680 kg) to 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) is designed to prevent increases in sablefish discard as vessels increase targeting on Dover sole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Secretarial Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS hereby announces the following change to the management measures announced at 59 FR 685, January 6, 1994, pursuant to 50 CFR 663.23(c)(1): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Coastwide, no more than 30,000 lb (13,608 kg) cumulative of the DTS complex may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a calendar month, of which no more than 8,000 lb (3,629 kg) cumulative of thornyheads and 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) cumulative of trawl-caught sablefish may be taken and retained, possessed, or landed per vessel in a calendar month. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In any trip, no more than 1,000 lb (454 kg) or 33.333 percent of the legal thornyheads and Dover sole, whichever is greater, may be trawl-caught sablefish; and no more than 5,000 lb (2,268 kg) may be trawl-caught sablefish smaller than 22 inches (56 cm) (total length). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The determination to take this action is based on the most recent data available. The aggregate data upon which the determination is based are available for public inspection at the Office of the Regional Director, Northwest Region, (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) during business hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Classification <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Delay in the implementation of this action could result in exceeding the trawl-caught sablefish allocation and/or exceeding the thornyhead limited entry harvest guideline. Furthermore, there was an opportunity for public comment at the June 17 Council meeting. The Secretary therefore finds good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) to waive the requirements for publication of a general notice of proposed rulemaking and a 30-day delay in effectiveness for this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is taken under the authority of 50 CFR 663.23(c) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> David S.

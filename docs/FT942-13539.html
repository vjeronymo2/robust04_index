			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / UK prepares for Chinese import licence scramble The UK Department of Trade and Industry's import licensing branch in Billingham will open at 11pm today to receive what it expects to be a flood of applications to beat EU import quotas on a range of Chinese goods. Import licensing offices across Europe are set for three days of intense activity as importers scramble for licences to allow them to import Chinese products such as leather gloves, car radios, crockery and glassware. The rush of applications has been triggered by the EU's decision in February to harmonise national restrictions and impose stiff quotas on selected Chinese exports. The first tranche of applications from traditional importers of goods varying from leather gloves to toys has already been processed. Tonight's applications, from importers who do not regularly trade with China, are expected to come through fax machines and be delivered by hand by a swarm of small traders. The Department of Trade said it expected long queues of traders eager to have their applications considered. The EU has introduced a three-day period for processing licence applications, which will run until Thursday afternoon. Applications will be dealt with on a first come, first served basis and traders who fail to get their applications in by Thursday's deadline may not be able to import goods covered by the quotas. UK retailers fear that the import restraints are so harsh that they may force some businesses to go under. British silk and toy importers have raised some of the strongest protests, claiming the quotas have left them with goods worth millions of pounds in Asia which they may be unable to import. The initial imposition of quotas last month led to an oversubscription for licences to import products from existing licence-holders who wanted to be sure of obtaining a large enough number of products. Toy importers say the EU quota, of just under Ecu628m (Pounds 494m), represents a cut of about 25 per cent in Chinese toy imports into Europe. The other six quotas are: Leather or composition leather gloves, limited to just under Ecu76m; Footwear, limited to just over 76m pairs; Porcelain and china crockery, limited to 30,875 tonnes; Ceramic crockery, limited to 23,513 tonnes; Domestic glassware, limited to 8,708 tonnes; and, Plug-in and car radios, including radio-telephony or radio-telegraphy receivers, limited to about 1.79m units. A number of sports goods have been excluded from the quotas, notably sporting gloves, ski boots and some sports shoes, to the relief of companies such as Reebok and Nike, which make training shoes in China.

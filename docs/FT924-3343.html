			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: France gives formal notice of its veto threat FRANCE formally notified the other 11 European Community states yesterday it might veto a key farm trade deal with Washington which defused the threat of a transatlantic trade war and paved the way for a global free-trade accord, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, entered in the minutes of a meeting of EC ministers a declaration saying France would defend its 'very important interests'. The statement implicitly recognised that EC governments were likely to have to decide on the farm trade deal alone. 'France considers the draft farm agreement struck on November 20 1992 by the (European) Commission representatives (with US negotiators) goes beyond the mandate set by the Council (of EC ministers). . . and would have unacceptable consequences for France's agricultural economy,' the statement said. France considered the draft to be 'incompatible' with the Common Agricultural Policy and said that if the Council of Ministers had to take a position on such arrangements, Paris would oppose it to safeguard domestic interests.</p>

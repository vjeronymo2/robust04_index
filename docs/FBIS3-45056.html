			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yong: "Steel Imports To Tumble"] </F>   [Text] Demand for steel will remain constant this year but  imports will plummet, partly because of high domestic stocks,  said a top manager last week.    Excessive imports last year inflated inventories to around  25  million tons by the end of last month, which was 7-8 million  more than normal, estimated Zhen Yongdian, Vice-President of  China National Metals and Minerals Import &amp; Export  Corporation  (Minmetals).    "China needs at least three months to clear the stock," Zhen  said.    He predicted a recovery of steel consumption in the second  half of the year as the country's GDP keeps growing by 8-9  percent.    And he sought to dispel widespread speculation that China's  steel imports would continue to tumble or even stop, arguing  that the fall is only a reasonable response to the abnormalities  of last year.    "China imported 25.8 million tons of steel in the first 11  months of last year, which was an all-time record," he said.    He estimated the nation's steel imports for all of 1993 at  27  million tons.    And he attributed last year's brisk demand to the country's  rapid economic development fueled by senior leader Deng  Xiaoping's reform- boosting trip to south China in early 1992.    But he pointed to an unsettling factor that had brought  about  a glut of steel imports in home markets.    "There were too many speculators fiddling with steel imports  and State controls had failed," he said.    Huge amounts of steel were imported through barter and  border  trade and overseas=funded ventures, besides licensed companies  like Minmetals.    "These chaotic imports, which cropped up during China's  transition from a planned economy to a market one, were  abnormal," Zhen said.    The steel imports boom came to a halt last July after the  central government moved to slow the pace of economic  development.    "But in the longer term, China will remain one of the  world's  largest consumers of steel," Zhen said.    "Despite a steady growth in domestic production, china will  still need to import steel in the future," he predicted. For,  as the economy develops, the growth rate of domestic production  has to keep up with the growth in the country's gross domestic  product, he explained. However, it is unlikely to do so for now.    "And even if the domestic production and demands are  balanced, our steel imports would continue, especially in  certain high-quality categories like tin plate, special plates,  petroleum pipes and silicon steel," he added.    However, he said that although the State had dropped the  tariffs on certain steel items, the devaluation of the renminbi,  brought about by a uniform foreign exchange rate, would raise  the price of steel imports.    Minmetals, China's largest steel trader, accounts for more  than half of the country's import orders, despite growing  competition from mushrooming domestic rivals.    The company has formed world-wide import channels over the  past decades.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: IBM plans 2,000 job cuts in PC overhaul International Business Machines is expected to announce plans to consolidate its personal computer operations with the loss of about 2,000 jobs, or 20 per cent of the division's workforce. Many of the remaining workers will be asked to move from sites in Florida and New York state to North Carolina. The US group will also begin to simplify its PC product line, which includes about 500 models which differ only slightly. Management changes are also expected. The reorganisation is designed to cut costs and boost IBM's flagging performance in the highly competitive PC market. During the past nine months the company has lost its leadership in PC sales, according to analysts. While Compaq Computer's revenues jumped 53 per cent in the latest quarter, IBM's PC sales were up only about 5 per cent and the company said its US sales had declined slightly. The 2,000 job losses are part of IBM's plans to reduce its total workforce from about 235,000 to 215,000 by the end of the year. It also said it would close one of its mainframe computer production plants, in Kingston, New York, next year and relocate 1,500 workers to a similar plant. The closure reflects the phasing out of IBM's water-cooled mainframe technology which is being replaced with less expensive air-cooled models based on complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology.</p>

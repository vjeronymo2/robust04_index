			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Wolfgang Georgi commentary: "Commodity Human Rights"] </F>   [Text] President Clinton is once again caught in a  difficult dilemma: His human rights representative, John  Shattuck, had just reported "constructive discussions" with the  government in Beijing, and the next moment the old men in China  hit out at their dissidents. It was "significant progress" in  the field of human rights that Clinton had expressly made the  precondition for extending the most-favored-nation clause in  trade with China.    But this demonstration of U.S. determination does not seem  to  have impressed Beijing very much. China knows very well that a  market of 1.2 billion potential buyers magically attracts  industrial nations suffering from recession. And so far, the  West has always given in as soon as Beijing made some vague  indications of willingness to improve.    What has become a major slap in the face of the U.S.  President may have been Beijing's unsuitable attempt to maintain  stability, to get to grips with the social tensions. These are  permanently aggravated by corruption, rural exodus, horrendous  inflation and crime rates -- the other side of a booming economy.    During the weekend, U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher is expected in the Chinese capital. He may severely  criticize China's human rights policy, but afterwards they will  come to an arrangement again. There is too much at stake for  both sides: It is a matter of economic interests. And in this  case, moral principles do not stand much chance in the first  place.</p>

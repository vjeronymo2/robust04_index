			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  pledged Friday [13 May] that his government will adopt "perfect  measures" to defend Japan's security if military conflict broke  out on the Korean peninsula.    "If a serious contingency broke out, the government will  counteract it with intragovernment solidarity and adopt perfect  measures," he said in reply to an opposition query on a security  threat from Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program.    Hata was fielding a Diet interpellation from Takushi Hirai,  a  Liberal Democratic Party member, who pressed Hata to clarify  Japan's response to U.S. requests to halt banking and cash  remittance to North Korea from pro-Pyongyang Korean residents in  Japan.    Hirai also pressed Hata to clarify whether the government  would deploy Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force in times of a  possible U.N. resolution to impose a naval blockade against  North Korea to penalize it for its refusal to accept unimpeded  inspection of its nuclear facilities.    Hata refused to rule out possible Japanese participation  into  these sanction measures.    "Now that the international community is quietly pressing  North Korea to open its window (to the inspection demand), I  would like to avoid specifying (Japan's possible response to the  contingency)," Hata said.    Hata later straddled the fence in the face of persistent  opposition questions on whether Japan is ready to use forces to  help its allies impose sanctions against North Korea if the  international community moved to slap sanctions.    He said, "Although Japan is endowed by international laws  with the right to use force to block a military offensive to a  foreign country with a close tie with Japan, Japan's exercise of  (its right to) collective security would overstep the boundary  of the Constitution."    The premier rejected the allegation that his administration  is trying to alter postwar governments' longtime constitutional  interpretation that the Constitution bans Japan's involvement in  collective security.    The coalition government "will firmly stick to the longtime  interpretation that Japan is authorized to use only minimum  necessary forces under the Article 9 of the Constitution," he  said.    He made the remarks in response to questions from Social  Democratic Party elder Koken Nosaka and new party Sakigake  [Harbinger] leader Masayoshi Takemura.    Takemura pressed Hata to clarify the definition of the  controversial phrase "universal security" that was incorporated  into coalition parties' common policy document, inked by their  leaders April 22 as a prerequisite for initiating the fresh  coalition government.    The policy platform document says coalition parties  "recognize the fact that the Japanese Constitution adopts as its  ideal universal security to be ensured by the United Nations."    Hata replied, "universal security implies...U.N. actions for  ensuring security that include measures provided for by the  chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, taken in solidarity by the  international community to counteract an invasion by a destroyer  of peace."    The chapter 7 has been under Diet scrutiny, as it  authorizes,  among others, military actions including a blockade by military  forces to restore peace in conflict-marred regions.    The SDP's Nosaka blasted Hata for defending former Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano who resigned last Saturday after calling  the 1937 Nanjing massacre a "fabrication."    Nosaka was taking issue with Hata's remark that "Mr. Nagano  is a man of excellent character and profound knowledge."    Hata said, "although Japan has sincerely dealt with the war  reparation issue in the San Francisco treaty and bilateral  treaties...I will consider how Japan can demonstrate its  feelings of repentance and reflection (on Japan's World War II  campaign.)"</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Germany's winter of discontent FT-SE Index: 2522.0 (-21.4) The Bundesbank's willingness to incur international unpopularity last December by raising interest rates suggests that the looming threat of a domestic steel strike will leave it unperturbed. Ultimately, its readiness to take its foot off the monetary brake will depend on the outcome of the wage round, not on the degree to which economic activity is disrupted in the meantime. From that perspective, the breakdown in the steel talks has a positive element which may explain the calm response of German financial markets yesterday. It at least means the employers are not prepared to cave in. The steel workers are in a relatively weak situation, since over-supply and depressed prices in Europe make their claim hard to press. A strike which the unions lost would set a tough precedent for the much more important engineering industry talks which have yet to start. Thus, even as the industrial situation hots up, it is becoming possible to perceive an outcome which would enable the Bundesbank to start cutting rates. The problem is one of timing, as it looks as though the wage round will be lengthy. The steel workers' contract actually expired last October. That of the engineering workers does not expire until the end of March. If their negotiations work to the same timetable, it could be well into the third quarter before German rates fall. That would be far too late to influence the timing of the UK election and so distant as to render forlorn any hope of Germany agreeing to participate in concerted monetary easing at this weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven.</p>

			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOSEPH N. BELL: HARDENED TRADITIONS AREN'T WORTH KEEPING  </P> <P> I have just returned from my annual pre-Christmas week with my grandchildren in  Boulder, Colo. We have followed a regular routine during this week for many  years. The day after I arrive, we shop for a Christmas tree which I am allowed  to buy. Then, the following night, we decorate the tree together. I'm in charge  of the lights, then I sit back with a libation or two and act as social and art  critic on the rest of the decorating. Over the years, this has grown from  ritual to tradition -- one I think my two grandsons look forward to as much as  I do.  </P> <P> But this year, the tradition was upended. My grandchildren had spent the  weekend previous to my arrival with their other grandparents in Wyoming, and  the centerpiece of that visit was an afternoon of traipsing nearby woods --  with permission, of course -- to find a live Christmas tree. One was duly  found, cut down and hauled back to Boulder. And by the time I arrived, it had  been set up and decorated.  </P> <P> While I was outwardly effusive, I was inwardly critical of the tree. It was too  thin on top and too fat in its lower extremities. There were clearly some  sparse areas. The lights were unevenly distributed.  </P> <P> Then I realized what I was doing. Tradition had been violated, and my role had  been preempted. My evergreen nose had been cut off.  </P> <P> This foolishness didn't last very long, but it lasted long enough for me to  relearn a lesson that surely applies year-round but is especially appropriate  at Christmas: that tradition and change aren't mutually exclusive. There is  enormous merit in both, and it is quite possible for them to live together in  harmony. But sometimes tradition can be a mote in the eye of change; and that,  it seems to me, is when tradition becomes counterproductive.  </P> <P> It's a fine line, indeed. Every family and every country has its own set of  traditions. They are the stable reference points which prevent our lives from  being in a constant state of tilt, and they are tampered with only at some  risk. But when tradition hardens into rigidity -- into a kind of mental rigor  mortis -- the joy is squeezed out of it. And, by then, it may be too late to  change -- or too painful. This happens most often to religious institutions,  where many of the precepts on which the church was founded are violated to  defend the institution against change. It happens in families, too.  </P> <P> There's no comfortable way of knowing when that time comes, beyond our own  instincts -- and generally they can and should be trusted. Each generation  looks at its own traditions and decides which ones to carry forward and pass  along to their children, and that's the way it should be. But one of the  oddities of this process is that the group most likely to resist change are the  children themselves. To children, the familiar -- even when it isn't altogether  satisfying -- is infinitely preferable to the unknown.  </P> <P> When my children were growing up, there was a tradition of going to church on  Christmas Eve and opening gifts on Christmas morning. When the children were  small, the tree wasn't brought in and decorated until Christmas Eve. As each  child grew older, he or she was allowed to participate in the activity until  the Santa Claus myth ran its course. Celebrating Christmas now with their own  families, they have carried on some of these traditions and discarded others.  And their children will, in turn, do the same.  </P> <P> There's a risk that as we grow older, we will revert to the child in us that  suffers change badly and builds high defenses around tradition. That's what I  did for a few minutes in Colorado last week -- but only for a few minutes. My  daughter and son-in-law sensed this -- not because any of us would have wanted  to see my grandchildren denied the experience of cutting their own tree but  because they, too, respect tradition.  </P> <P> I think the one thing that those who fear change need to understand most is  that change need not be -- and usually isn't -- disrespectful of tradition. For  half a dozen years when my children were in school, we drove away from the  traditional Midwestern white Christmas to Florida, where we spent the holidays.  But we took all our other Christmas traditions with us.  </P> <P> I suppose traditions die hardest at Christmastime because the holiday is built  around the most hallowed tradition of all: the birth of a man who changed the  whole course of human history. But perhaps the operative word here is change.  In his brief ministry, Jesus attacked many of the traditions of the system into  which he was born. While his spiritual precepts were inviolate, he had no  hesitation about changing the human environment -- and its traditions -- in  which he put the spiritual precepts to work. And he had no problem knowing  which was which -- a difficulty the rest of us deal with constantly.  </P> <P> If these seem like heavy thoughts to grow out of the cutting of a Christmas  tree, they were neither heavy nor new. They've been gestating for a lot of  years and are surfaced periodically by small events. I suppose that's why just  before I left Boulder to come home, I checked out my grandchildren's Christmas  tree one last time. It's a beautiful tree.  </P></p>

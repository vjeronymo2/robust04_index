			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League Secretary Umberto </F> Bossi by Francesco M. Bei in Rome; date not given: "Bossi:  `Berlusconi Is the Lesser Evil'" -- first two paragraphs are  L'INDIPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] "You know something, the real risk in this election  is that if the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and the Left win,  Italy will go bankrupt. With a 5 billion lire public deficit,  we cannot afford to go back to the old system of handouts. That  is why we are sticking with Silvio Berlusconi; he is the lesser  evil."    Umberto Bossi is tired but confident about the result of the  election: "It will be a landslide victory, the League will  double its parliamentary seats." Regardless of whether the  Freedom Pole wins or loses, "It will be the League that decides  who will govern the country, as it is the force with the most  clout." This is why he appeals to the voters to "vote League on  the gray form, the one for the proportional quota."    [Bei] Did you see that the DIGOS [Division for General  Investigations and Special Operations of the State Police] is  visiting Forza Italia?    [Bossi] Yes, giving it a lot of publicity in the process. It  looks like a ploy to pass Berlusconi off as a victim of  persecution.    [Bei] And Luciano Violante resigning ...    [Bossi] That was consistent for him. He backed a lie, and he  has acknowledged that he went too far.    [Bei] Gianfranco Miglio says: "Berlusconi is our opponent  and Fini is our enemy." Is that how it will be after the  election as well?    [Bossi] It will all depend on the figures. If we have a  governing quorum, we shall stick with Berlusconi, but not with  Gianfranco Fini. The time is not yet ripe for us to be able to  use Fini's votes. It is impracticable at the national level:  It would be as if the neo-Nazis got into government in Germany.    [Bei] Has the alliance with Berlusconi been a mistake, as  Miglio says, or a skillful political operation, as Roberto  Maroni claims?    [Bossi] Miglio is wrong because he is suffering from  preelection nerves. If the League had not done the deal with  Berlusconi, we should have found ourselves without television  time. Berlusconi would have lined up with the DC and Mario  Segni, and we should have had the Left on the other side: We  would have been cut off and in a bad way.    [Bei] Some League supporters would have preferred to go to  the front on their own ...    [Bossi] That is true, but I cannot send my troops off to  take  the hill under machinegun fire. It would have been a massacre.  This time we had to resort to realpolitik.    [Bei] Do you believe you will be able to "straitjacket"  Berlusconi?    [Bossi] We already have got him in a straitjacket with the  election deal! Forza Italia will gain few votes in the north,  and it will only gain those few because Berlusconi is the  chairman of Milan [soccer club].    [Bei] Was it necessary to straitjacket him?    [Bossi] Of course it was, otherwise people might have voted  for those who brainwash them every day, those who get into their  homes with advertising spots on television.    [Bei] Might it not be that, by way of criticizing him, you  will side with the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] after the  election, albeit under the cover of a "caretaker government"?    [Bossi] We cannot take up with Achille Occhetto for two  reasons. The first is a matter of principle: The Left  continues to oppose reliance on the free market, and the League  is the sole true liberalist force.    [Bei] And the second reason?    [Bossi] Well, if people see us side with the Left, we shall  be caught with our pants down, and within a fortnight the doors  of the north will inevitably be open to the fascists, the ethnic  party of the south, created to steal the keys to the vaults of  the north.    [Bei] Maroni has said that if Berlusconi loses to Spaventa,  he cannot be prime minister. Does that mean that if he wins he  can be?    [Bossi] No, I think that Berlusconi is intelligent and will  not even ask to be. He has too many private interests to be  able to act as head of government.    [Bei] The first step after the poll will be the election of  the speakers in the two houses. Some people would even like to  elect a new president of the republic ...    [Bossi] And quite right too, because President Scalfaro  himself announced that he would resign once there was a new  parliament. That being said, however, I do not believe that it  is a matter of fundamental importance at the present stage.</p>

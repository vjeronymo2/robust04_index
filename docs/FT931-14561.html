			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / Pit strike ballot to be considered THE EXECUTIVE of the National Union of Mineworkers will decide on Wednesday whether to back a strike ballot for a day of action against pit closure on February 18. On the same day the new leader of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, Mr Neil Greatrex, who is far less sympathetic to the government than his predecessor Mr Roy Lynk, will have his first meeting with Mr John Major, the prime minister. There has been some informal division of labour between the two main mining unions on legal challenges to the government, arranged through Nacods, the pit supervisors union. The election of Mr Greatrex means both unions will take a similarly hostile stance towards privatisation. The NUM has not resorted to industrial action in the campaign against closures for fear of antagonising popular support. But activists are pressing for some action, if only to give focus to a day of action. A delegate conference in October gave the NUM executive the authority to call a ballot whenever it wished. February 18 might be the day on which unemployment officially exceeds 3m and has been named by the TUC as Jobs Action Day. The TUC last week backed away from encouraging public-sector workers to take industrial action. It wants 'broad-based action to demand change'. NUM lawyers are expected back in the High Court today arguing that British Coal is in contempt of last month's ruling that the fabric of pits should be maintained while the government reviews the future of the 31 pits originally scheduled for closure.</p>

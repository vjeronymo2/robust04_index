			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Martin Freeman] </F>   [Text] Canadian officials have steered clear of clashing  with Beijing over democratic development in Hong Kong.    The highest-level delegation from Ottawa since the 1989  Tiananmen massacre avoided details of the Governor's political  plans during talks in China, according to senior Canadian  officials.    The subject of Hong Kong was brought up three times by the  Canadian Governor-General, Ramon Hnatyshyn, but he went no  further than expressing to Lu Ping, the top Chinese official in  charge of affairs, the hope that the 1984 Sino-British Joint  Declaration on the territory's future "would be respected".    In talks with the Governor, Chris Patten, in Hong Kong the  Governor-General talked of the need for both the "letter and the  spirit" of the Joint Declaration to be adhered to and said he  hoped for negotiations between London and Beijing.    "We all very much hope for the resumption of dialogue and  co-operation between China and Britain to give Hong Kong the  future it deserves," one senior Canadian official said.    The message contrasts with that given to the Legislative  Council last Friday when Hnatyshyn emphasised the need for  "fairly contested and free elections" to buttress the rule of  law.    But Ottawa officials denied that Canada was saying one thing  to Hong Kong and giving a different message to Beijing.    While the Canadian delegation "did not specifically make the  same comments to China" the message was the same, one official  said.    The visit -- which concludes in Guangzhou today -- aimed to  raise the profile of Canada, and discuss and develop economic  and agricultural links.    Beijing was told of Canada's "concern" about human rights  but  was assured the issue would be kept separate from trade, the  official said.</p>

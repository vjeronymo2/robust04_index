An obituary, published in London's Daily  Telegraph, said Rutherford won the medal Aug. 26, 1918, when the Canadian  platoon he was commanding captured a French village giving observers a view of  the defenses of the German Hindenberg Line. Only 18 days earlier, Rutherford  had won the coveted Military Cross for bravery by capturing another village on  Aug. 8, when the Allied offensive that would end the war began that day in  front of Amiens. Rutherford rejoined the army in World War II and took part in  protecting the Duke of Windsor in the Bahamas and guarding prisoner-of-war  camps in Canada. Before retirement he was postmaster at Colborne, Ontario. The  Victoria Cross, the highest British honor for battlefield courage, was awarded  to 633 people during World War I.

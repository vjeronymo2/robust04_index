			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tory hopeless - Ballot Box David Owen's old seat of Plymouth Devonport is widely expected to revert to Labour after Owen's stewardship for the Social Democratic party. Even if they are conceding defeat in advance, however, the Tories could hardly have put up a more unlikely challenger. Keith Simpson's CV includes 'married (wife's name Pepita), considerable experience in public speaking and working with the media: recently appeared on Channel 4's After Dark with Oliver Reed'. He lists his hobbies as 'patronising restaurants, walking dogs, growing cacti and carnivorous plants, and collecting and consuming malt whiskies'. But at least he is honest: the release highlights Simpson's role as special adviser to the defence secretary from 1988 to 1990 - surely a bold move in a constituency where defence cuts have caused thousands of job losses. 'It reads like a suicide note,' says a local reporter.</p>

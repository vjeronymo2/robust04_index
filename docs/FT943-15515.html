			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Bell Atlantic cleared to compete with cable TV Bell Atlantic, the Baby Bell telephone company, has become the first US telecommunications group to win regulatory approval to provide an interactive television service over its wires in competition with local cable television monopolies. The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates both industries, approved an application by Bell Atlantic to provide the so-called 'video dialtone' service to 38,000 households in a New Jersey township. The move is a significant precedent, since many other telephone companies have similar applications pending before the FCC, which now seem likely to be approved. Mr Reed Hundt, the FCC chairman, said: 'The telephone companies are knocking on the cable door and we want to let them in.' However, while the FCC action allows Bell Atlantic to transmit television programming, telephone companies are still forbidden in general from owning the content of those programmes or packaging them. Bell Atlantic has therefore teamed up with an independent programmer called FutureVision of America, which will provide the television service in New Jersey. It plans to undercut significantly the prices charged by local cable companies. Bell Atlantic said that in addition to traditional video entertainment products, such as movies-on-demand, its New Jersey service would potentially allow hundreds of information providers to use the network as a platform for their products and services. These providers could include schools, newspapers and hospitals. However, the National Cable Television Association said that it intended to fight the FCC's decision in court. It complained that the FCC had not yet issued comprehensive rules preventing telephone companies from subsidising construction of their networks on the backs of telephone rate payers. Congress is currently considering a bill which would allow telephone companies to compete freely in the cable television industry as programme providers, which they are forbidden from doing under 1984 cable legislation.</p>

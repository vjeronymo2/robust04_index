			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Inmos plans closure of Welsh superchip plant INMOS, the semiconductor company which invented the transputer microprocessor - the 'computer on a chip' - plans to close its fabrication plant in Newport, south Wales, unless it receives government aid. The move by Inmos, now owned by SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor manufacturer, follows prolonged speculation about the plant's future. Closure may end a controversial and often politically charged chapter in the history of the UK semiconductor industry. It would also mean the end of UK manufacture of the transputer, which is one of the few successful semiconductor inventions to come out of Britain - and one that had been hailed as a key to regaining British leadership in the computer industry. The plant's planned closure in a year to 18 months is likely to rekindle debate about UK industrial policy and its failure to keep strategic technologies in home ownership. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour trade and industry spokesman, said the closure of the plant would mean 'yet more high technology redundancies and yet another British invention lost to British manufacturing for good'. Inmos said that because of the response to its decision it would now apply for aid to the Welsh Office. It said it had not applied before because several months of discussion had led it to believe that aid was unlikely. The result of its application could alter the decision to close the plant, Inmos said. Inmos was set up in 1978 by the Labour government in an effort to win a leadership position for Britain in microelectronics. The government invested huge sums in the company to enable it to develop the transputer, a semi-conductor which can process a large amount of data concurrently at very high speeds. While Labour looked to the transputer as a revolutionary device which could help Britain gain leadership in semiconductors, the succeeding Conservative government delayed funding and then sold Inmos to Thorn EMI in 1984. Thorn sold Inmos to SGS-Thomson in 1989. The transputer recently won a significant endorsement when IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, decided to use the device as a control mechanism. Inmos said, however, that it did not make economic sense for SGS-Thomson to invest the Pounds 50m or so needed to upgrade the Newport plant in order to satisfy volume production. The financially pressed group has recently made huge investments in other semiconductor fabrication plants. Production at Newport will be gradually wound down and transferred to SGS-Thomson plants at Rousset, in southern France, Agrate in Italy and Carrollton, Texas. There will be a limited number of redundancies among the 450-strong workforce in the next month, but there are no detailed plans for overall redundancies when the plant finally closes.</p>

			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS comments raise D-Mark THE D-MARK appreciated sharply against European currencies yesterday morning after the President of the German Bundesbank said that a realignment of the European Monetary System was not impossible, writes James Blitz. Although the D-Mark rally petered out later in the day, the German currency still closed in London maintaining the gains it has made against sterling and the Italian lira in recent days. The French franc and the Spanish peseta ended the day slightly stronger overall, but only after senior financial officials had made comments in their support. The London market remained convinced that the troubles over European Monetary Union (Emu) triggered by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last week have not played themselves out. Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, casting doubt on the 1999 deadline for Emu as too optimistic, forced the D-Mark sharply upwards against sterling in the first hours of London trading. The pound hit a low of DM2.9077, but was propped up by better-than-expected May producer prices figures showing a rise of 0.1 per cent. Sterling ended the day unchanged on its previous close at DM2.9150 The Italian lira looked more anaemic, finishing at Lira757.40 to the D-Mark, compared to a previous close of Lira756.80. The currency also ended at the bottom of the EMS grid, just below sterling. The French franc recovered against the D-Mark after the French Finance Minister made a strong appeal for a franc fort. The D-Mark closed at FFr3.367, slightly down on a previous close of FFr 3.370. The Spanish peseta also held its ground, helped by a statement from the EC Finance Ministers supporting Spain's current effort to meet the Maastricht concvergence criteria. It closed the day at Pta62.98 against a previous close of Pta63.12. The dollar finished the day barely changed on its previous close against the D-Mark, after the markets had tested the US currency's downside at Dollars 1.5890. It finished in Europe at DM1.5900 compared to a previous close of DM1.5895. The dollar's fortunes will now be determined by US inflation and retail sales figures for May due out on Thursday. If the retail sales figure emerges lower than the expected 0.5 per cent rise, the market may test the dollar's downside again, expecting that the Federal Reserve might reduce interest rates. But some are bullish about the US currency's longer term prospects. 'Once the post Maastricht blues are out of the way, the D-Mark will weaken,' said one analyst.' Anticipation that the Bundesbank will ease rates will also undermine the D-Mark.'</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> OAKLAND;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS HUDDLE WITH DAVIS ON POSSIBLE MOVE BY RAIDERS  </P> <P> Oakland authorities, led by Mayor Lionel Wilson, met for two hours with Los  Angeles Raiders owner Al Davis on Friday to discuss that city's bid for the  football team to return to its former home in Oakland. Afterward, Davis called  it "a good meeting" but gave no indication when he might decide between  competing bids from Oakland, Sacramento and Los Angeles -- all vying to be the  future home for the Raiders.  </P> <P> "The most crucial thing for me is the future and the greatness of the Raiders,"  Davis said. "I'm going to do what is best for the team." Wilson said Oakland  expected to hear something in two weeks, but such optimism has been standard  among officials meeting with Davis in a bidding process that has been going on  for 2 1/2 years.  </P></p>

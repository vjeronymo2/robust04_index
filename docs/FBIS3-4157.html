The protocol on cooperation in peaceful use of and research  into space was signed by visiting Deputy Director of the China  National Space Administration Wang Liheng and director of the  Russian Space Administration U. Koptev.    Wang told a press conference after the signing ceremony that  a joint working committee with seven people from each side will  be set up to work out the details of cooperation projects.    Noting the good cooperation the two countries have enjoyed  in  the past, Wang said the document is a frame agreement to lay a  basis for extensive Sino-Russian space cooperation.    Koptev pointed out that under the protocol, Russia and China  will cooperate in virtually all fields of space science,  including communication satellite, satellite television  broadcast and space technology application.    He said that although both countries have collaborated in  space science for years, the potential for such cooperation are  far from being fully tapped.    Sino-Russian space cooperation is faced with difficulties in  terms of law, finance and economy, Koptev said, but normal  cooperation will not be affected.    On Russia's plan to build a new space rocket launching  center  in the Far East, which is only 100 kilometers away from the  Chinese border, Koptev said this will create more favorable  conditions for close Russian-Chinese cooperation in this field.    Wang, who led a delegation of China National Space  Administration, arrived here on Monday [21 March] for a  week-long visit.</p>

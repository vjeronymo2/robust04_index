			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Capital Markets: Ghana sells stakes in seven companies The government of Ghana sold stakes in seven Ghanaian companies to international investors yesterday in a deal worth Dollars 25m - equivalent to nearly one-quarter of the total market capitalisation of the Ghana stock market. The government has stressed its determination to forge ahead with its privatisation programme, encourage foreign direct and portfolio investment in Ghana, and improve trading and liquidity on the stock market. Next month, it is due to sell up to 25 per cent of Ashanti Goldfields Corporation, the country's biggest gold producer, jointly owned by UK-based Lonrho group and the government. The sale would reduce the government stake from 55 per cent to 30 per cent, in a deal which analysts believe could raise Pounds 250m (Dollars 369m). However, a group of Ghanaians oppose the sale, and are taking legal action in an attempt to block the offering. Their high court hearing was adjourned yesterday. Some investment bankers believe the action is unlikely to pose much of a threat to the offering. The government yesterday sold its entire holdings in seven companies listed on the Ghana stock exchange - Accra Brewery, Equity Insurance, Guinness Ghana, Kumasi Brewery, Pioneer Tobacco, Standard &amp; Chartered Ghana, and Unilever Ghana. The shares were placed with international fund management groups by Databank Brokerage, a Ghanaian investment bank, and Blakeney Management, a London-based adviser to emerging market funds. Mr Miles Morland, of Blakeney Management, said the Ghanaian government had sold stakes varying in size from 18 per cent to 40 per cent. Most of these companies have key foreign shareholders (for example, Unilever in the case of Unilever Ghana), while the remaining shares are in public hands. Yesterday's transaction, combined with the forthcoming Ashanti Goldfields deal, should 'act as a catalyst to get the privatisation process going,' said Mr Morland. There are 15 companies listed on the Ghana stock exchange. The volume of trading is expected to increase dramatically once Ashanti Goldfields is floated.</p>

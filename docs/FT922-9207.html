			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Campaign for safer roof work launched THE HEALTH and Safety Executive warned the construction industry yesterday that it was mounting a safety drive on construction involving roof work, Diane Summers writes. Inspectors will order building sites to halt work and will take legal action in serious cases where safety rules are being breached, the HSE said. Dr Paul Davis, head of the HSE's construction group, said at the launch of its campaign: 'Cowboy roofers, like their namesakes . . . often die young.' Almost every roof work death could be prevented by simple precautions and the use of proper equipment. Roofers' deaths in building accidents make them the largest single occupational group for fatalities. Construction itself is the most dangerous of all industry sectors. Most roof work is done by about 7,000 contractors who provide work for 30,000 roofers. The sector is difficult to regulate because three quarters of the workers are self-employed and working for companies of three people or fewer.</p>

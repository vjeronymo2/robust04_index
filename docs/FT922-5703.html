			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Ripples from Docklands There is an obvious temptation for the stock market to see the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Canary Wharf as something which principally affects the banking and property sectors. In fact, the travails of the property market, of which Canary Wharf is a symptom, may turn out to be a drag on the entire economy, even if the direct effects are difficult to quantify. The government's reluctance to assist, for example by financing the extension of the Jubilee line, says more about the degree to which its finances are already stretched than about the gravity of the problem. Unfortunately for Mr Major, his government's inability to bail out the property sector may even end up making public finances worse. It will force the banks to take the hit on the chin. There is no immediate threat to their capital ratios, but provisions are likely to remain high for at least the next two or three years. So they will not generate nearly enough retained earnings to meet the level of loan demand generated by even a fairly modest recovery. Indeed, there is hardly any prospect of banks disposing of sufficient capital to finance the growth of over 3 per cent which the government has factored into its budget projections from next year onwards. The consequence will be continuing deflationary pressure on public spending. The best palliative would be a sharp cut in short-term interest rates. This would not only alleviate the burden for cash-strapped property companies. Lower rates would also create room for banks to increase their lending margins, thus providing them with income with which to build up provisions. As the ERM precludes this route, the prospect is that the pain now emanating from Docklands will spread widely through the economy for a long time to come.</p>

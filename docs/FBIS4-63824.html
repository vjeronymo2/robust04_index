			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow is to hold talks with the Paris Club of  creditor states of the former USSR on the deferment of payments  to service Russia's foreign debt this year at the beginning of  June.    In a letter to the chairman of the Paris Club May 24,  Russian  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin agreed on behalf of Russia  to hold the talks on rescheduling Russian foreign debt in Paris  on June 2-3. The minister told a press conference the same day  that Moscow was prepared to pay 4.1 billion dollars (the sum set  aside by the draft federal budget) in 1994 towards servicing the  debt.    Shokhin stressed that Russia was concerned above all about  the servicing of the Russian debt (which accounted for around 10  pct of the 80 billion dollar debt). He said that the "creditors  of the former USSR had to view the situation realistically and  be patient for the time being."    Shokhin stressed that the repayment of the debts to members  of the Paris Club depended largely on the position of Italy.  Moscow and Rome, he said, had not yet been able to agree the  terms for repaying Italian loans from 1993.    As far as the London Club (which incorporates western banks  to which Russia owes money), Shokhin said that talks were  continuing. However, he admitted that no firm decisions had yet  been made regarding that part of the foreign debt.    President Yeltsin's senior economic adviser Alexander  Livshitz has reported that the first package of 6 presidential  economic decrees issued on May 23 may be extended to other  documents.    Speaking at an economic reform congress in Moscow on  Tuesday,  he suggested that new decrees may touch upon foreign investment,  social security, and bankruptcy legislation.    By some evidence, up to 30 such presidential decrees are to  be issued by the end of this year.    At the same time, Lifshitz voiced confidence that for  furthering economic reforms, such documents should be worked out  in a civilized way through the Duma and other representative  bodies.    "The presidential administration hopes that next steps to  adopt necessary economic laws will be taken by Duma members  themselves," Livshitz said.</p>

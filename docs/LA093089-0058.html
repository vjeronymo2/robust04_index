			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STEREOTYPES AND HEROES  </P> <P> Regarding Nancy Churnin's article, "Actors Weary of Typecasting, Create 'Latins  Anonymous,' " Sept. 19, I agree with Luisa Leschin that "Hollywood writers are  seeing their image of Mexicans as their maids and gardeners." Leschin is one of  the four members of "Latins Anonymous," a show now being staged in the Los  Angeles Theatre Center.  </P> <P> I don't know if this typecasting is based on prejudice or ignorance, but I do  know it has been going on since time immemorial.  </P> <P> Curiously, every night I watch attractive and well-dressed Hispanic actors and  actresses playing professional, educated people and living in beautiful homes  and going to glamorous parties and restaurants. No, not in Hollywood films but  on the Spanish-language television screens.  </P> <P> The locales are not Los Angeles nor New York, but Caracas, Buenos Aires and  Mexico City. These series or films are shown not only in the Western Hemisphere  but in Spain, Italy, China and even in the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> But Hollywood writers and producers care little or nothing about all this. It  is a sad and deplorable situation.  </P> <P> JOHN F. MENDEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

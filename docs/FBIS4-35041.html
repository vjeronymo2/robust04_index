			<p>BFN     [Text] This morning, the Senate approved articles of a bill  to punish active-duty military and police personnel who become  involved in partisan politics. Punishment ranges between six  months and two years of imprisonment. Two opinions, one raised  by the Legislative Committee and another by the Constitutional  Affairs Committee, were considered.    The first paragraph of Article No. 1 states that violations  include "opinions, remarks, or expressions on partisan politics  or proselytizing acts." There was a long discussion on the  possibility of applying this provision to public or private  activities. As we went to press, some congressmen were asking  for a reconsideration of this paragraph.    The senators also described as a violation "any presence at  meetings organized by political, partisan, movement, municipal,  departmental, or national authorities that are not of an  official, professional, or merely social nature."    Another violation of the bill approved by the plenary  session  involves "the presence of military or police personnel at  meetings of political parties, movements, or factions, even if  said meetings are held at buildings that do not belong to any  party or movement." In addition, "efforts to raise funds and  resources for any type of political activity, their donation, or  their management by military or police personnel or any  intermediary" will be considered a violation. In its last  paragraph, the bill describes "political party or movement  membership" by military or police personnel as a serious  violation.    Article No. 2 establishes that ordinary criminal courts will  hear the appropriate proceedings, which may be filed through an  official petition or through a petition by any qualified person.  Article No. 3 establishes that an arrest warrant against  military or police personnel involved in these violations will  automatically entail the suspension of their duties and that  they will serve their arrest at a unit established by the office  of the Armed Forces commander-in-chief or the national police.  The last article of the approved bill states that those who  violate the current bill will be liable to a prison term ranging  between six months and two years.</p>

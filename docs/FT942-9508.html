			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / Reform chief quits in Warsaw The minister in charge of revamping Poland's state administration resigned yesterday, saying the left-wing government was blocking the reforms, Reuter reports from Warsaw. Mr Michal Kulesza accused the government of rebuilding a communist-style power structure in the state administration. 'Within a few months, the government has rebuilt the (communist) nomenklatura, which had been dismantled over the past four years,' he told PAP news agency. Mr Kulesza, a professor who is a non-party expert on state administration, said the ruling ex-communists and their Polish Peasant party allies were replacing officials at lower and lower local administrative posts with their own members. He said the government's policies were threatening Poland's future membership of the European Union and could lead to the elimination of genuine local self-government.</p>

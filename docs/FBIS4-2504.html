			<p>BFN     [Text] On the morning of 11 April, the work team of the  State Council, which comes to Liaoning to conduct mass  inspection over commodity prices, listened to the province's  work briefing on price inspection. Wen Shizhen, member of the  provincial party standing committee and executive vice governor  of the province, briefed the State Council's price inspection  team on the province's economic situation and price inspection  work on behalf of the provincial people's government. Vice  Governor Wen Shizhen said: The province's present level of  general commodity prices is fine. However, prices for the means  of production show a faster increase and the rise and fall of  prices for products turned out by the state-owned enterprises is  relatively large. Enterprises are being heavily affected by the  prices of material supplies. If we fail to improve the  situation in a timely manner, it will adversely affect the  social stability and the improvement of the people's lives. He  said: The market economy has set forth new demands for shifting  the governmental function. Departments in charge of commodity  prices at all levels should enhance the market calculation while  grasping the macroeconomic readjustment and control in a timely  manner, report on time the fluctuation in commodity prices, and  perform their bound duties to make the economy prosperous and  improve people's lives.    During the briefing Hao Dechun, deputy director of the  provincial price bureau, also delivered a speech in which he  said: After the telephone conference sponsored by the State  Council and the provincial people's government on making work  arrangements for price mass inspection on 7 March, the people's  governments of various cities have attached great importance on  the arrangements; gone into action rapidly; and earnestly  implemented the arrangements. Thus, a certain momentum and  scope in the price inspection work have been built up. We will  conduct concentrated inspection in a shorter period to correct  the prominent price violations throughout the province and to  ensure the mass inspection work to score periodical results in  June this year. The work team of the State Council, which comes  to the province to conduct price mass inspection, will spend  more than 10 days on carrying out practical inspections.</p>

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Pentland pays Pounds 7m for outdoor clothing company PENTLAND, the cash-rich sporting and consumer goods company, has paid Pounds 7m for Berghaus, the outdoor clothing and equipment group. The acquisition was Pent-land's first since it pulled out of talks last October to buy Adidas, the sports-shoe maker. Pentland has about Pounds 350m net cash and further small to medium-sized acquisitions are expected. Berghaus, which operates from two factories near Newcastle upon Tyne, is the UK market leader for specialist mountaineering and hiking clothing and last year reported sales of about Pounds 20m. Its products are expensive, with some jackets retailing at more than Pounds 350. Mr Frank Farrant, Pent-land's finance director, said Berghaus' brand name would be developed and popularised. 'We intend to make it more accessible to the general outdoor enthusiast without detracting from the brand.' The Newcastle factories, which employ about 500 people, will be retained while Pent-land hopes to use its sourcing experience in the Far East to lower costs. Pentland, which owns the Speedo swimwear brand, also acts as sourcing agent in the Far East for LA Gear, the US sports shoe maker. Mr Peter Lockey and Mr Gordon Davison, who founded Berghaus about 20 years ago, are leaving the company, although Mr Davison will remain as a consultant. Mr Farrant said: 'They think they've taken it as far as they can. The next stage will take more money and a more structured organisation behind it'. The purchase price includes Pounds 3m of bank borrowings. Berg-haus has net assets of Pounds 2m. The company is profitable after interest costs and should slightly enhance Pentland's earnings. Mr Farrant said he hoped Berghaus' operating profit margin, currently about 5 per cent, would improve towards 10 per cent as turnover grew. The company's main market is the UK, although it has subsidiaries in Germany and Italy and is hopeful about growth from Scandinavia. Pentland, which earned its cash holdings from an investment in Reebok, the US sports shoe maker, is understood to be looking at several other potential acquisitions, both in the US and UK. But none of the potential targets are equivalent in size to Adidas, which earlier this week was sold to a consortium of investors by Mr Bernard Tapie, the French businessman.</p>

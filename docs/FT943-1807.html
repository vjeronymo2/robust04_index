			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Observer: Clubbable and bankable? The Gresham Club, tucked away in Abchurch Lane in the heart of the City, used to be an excellent place for an afternoon nap. But the price of sardines-on-toast was raised to 6d, and things slid relentlessly downhill thereafter. Today, after a Pounds 5m-odd makeover, the seven-story Grade II listed building reopens as the London Capital Club - a very different sort of establishment indeed. It admits women and foreigners; it allows, nay encourages, the conduct of business within its hallowed portals; and promises to serve upmarket grub. It even has a boardroom members can hire out - marked Boardroom in big gold letters on the door. Owned by the affable German-born Dieter Klostermann, it is the first European addition to his network of Asian clubs. The Pounds 1,250 'entrance' fee is a snip, compared at least with the affiliated City Club in Tokyo, which will set you back some Y4m (Pounds 25,000) to join. So far 500 souls have signed up. The unstuffy but recognisably 'British' club is a formula that has worked well in the Far East. Klostermann's CCA Group is currently pulling in Pounds 70m in annual revenues from its 32,000 members. Klostermann's tilt at Clubland in its own backyard, meanwhile, will probably be admired and scorned in equal measure. What he principally needs is for his joint to be patronised.</p>

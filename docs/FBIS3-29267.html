			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The moderate daily HANGUK ILBO in  Korean on 16 February publishes on page 5 a 1,500-word article  by reporter Yun Sun-hwan, entitled "U.S.-Japan Trade Friction  and Its Affect on ROK--Yen Value Is Soaring...`A Green Signal'  for ROK Export."    Explaining that the skyrocketing of the value of the yen in  foreign exchange markets in Tokyo and in New York is an  "aftereffect" of the U.S.-Japan "trade war," the article says  that the trade conflict between the two nations increases  "tension" and thus people pay attention to what "aftereffects"  will be brought to our country's exports to the United States  and to our "overall economy." Predicting that the United States  will maintain the current high-yen-value foreign exchange policy  until Japan guarantees its policy to reduce its "black figures"  in trade with the United States, the article says that the "high  value of the yen" will likely give "benefits" to our enterprises  in the export of their products to the United States. The  article points out that with a high yen value, the sale of  Japanese automobiles in U.S. markets has been "reduced" and  taking advantage of this, the ROK automobiles are "encroaching  upon" Japan's markets to "a considerable extent." When the  United States actually takes "concrete trade retaliation"  against Japan, exports of our "major export items" including  automobiles, semiconductors and computers, to the United States  are expected to "expand."    The article stresses that U.S.-Japan trade conflict may also  result in "great burdens" that our country can hardly endure  because the United States regards the ROK as "a second Japan,"  and points to "differences" claimed by the United States and our  country in calculating black figures in trade last year between  the two countries.    The article adds that our enterprises pay the "keenest  attention" to whether the U.S. Trade Law Super 301, which makes  "indiscriminate trade retaliation" possible, will be "revived"  or not, noting that if this is revived, not only Japan but also  our country will suffer "great damages." The article notes that  if our country is designated as an "unfair trade state," the  United States will "drastically increase" tariffs on automobiles  and other items manufactured by our country and, thus, will take  "retaliatory action" as freely as it wants.    The article notes that major domestic business groups and  relevant organizations began to analyze the "effects" resulting  from U.S. "sanctions" against Japan and from the "skyrocketing  yen value" to our "export front," believing that the U.S. trade  retaliation against Japan is "imminent."</p>

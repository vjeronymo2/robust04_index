			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sharp cut in Denver flights by Continental Continental Airlines, the fifth biggest US carrier, yesterday said it was axeing nearly all its remaining flights out of Denver, Colorado, from the end of October, including all but one of its six transatlantic flights a week between Denver and London Heathrow. The airline said it was dropping the routes because it had lost Dollars 500m on them in the past three years and believed it could deploy its assets more profitably in the east coast market. Continental has been cutting its services in and out of Denver for several months. At the beginning of the year it had nearly 150 departures a day. From October 30 the number will fall to 22 a day, serving just four destinations. The cuts will be seen as a setback for Denver. The city has spent Dollars 3.2bn on a new airport, which has yet to open because its British-built automatic baggage handling system cannot be made to work.</p>

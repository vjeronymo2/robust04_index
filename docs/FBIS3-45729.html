			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Fanny Wong] </F>   [Text] An attempt by China to block legislators' approval  of another $1.67 billion for airport projects appeared to have  failed last night, with councillors still pledging support for  construction to proceed full speed without China's blessing.  The crucial vote will be taken at today's Legislative Council  Finance Committee meeting.    Forty legislators last night vowed to vote for the  Government's request for cash to cover the Provisional Airport  Authority's running costs and three urgent airport-related  contracts to keep up the momentum of construction. The  legislators include 13 from the United Democrats, 15 from  Liberal Party, four from the Meeting Point and eight  independents.    They met separately to decide their position last night,  while China was launching a fresh bout of criticism at Britain's  handling of the projects in an effort to undermine the  Government's case for pressing ahead with an attempt to meet the  completion date of mid- 1997. Director of the Chinese State  Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, said  Governor Chris Patten was solely to blame for the delay of the  airport projects. Mr. Lu and Foreign Ministry spokesman, Wu  Jianmin, insisted that the British Hong Kong administration  should observe the Memorandum of Understanding on the new  airport projects.    And a lengthy commentary issued by the Hong Kong China News  Agency last night warned that before any financial accord was  reached between the two sides, any unilateral action by the  British side would not be conducive to finding a solution to the  financing problems.    In response, a Government spokesman said: "We are surprised  to see suggestions that we are breaching the memorandum and  taking unilateral action." The spokesman stressed that what the  Government was doing was totally in line with the airport  memorandum to complete the projects to the maximum extent  possible by 1997.    But in Shenzhen, Mr. Lu blasted the Governor, rejecting Mr.  Patten's remarks that China was held responsible for the delay  of the airport plan. "Mr. Patten said that the responsibility  rested with the Chinese side, it was the Chinese side who  delayed the projects. Would you please go and tell him that  Britain is solely responsible for the delay," he said. "The  airport problem can be resolved immediately, by Britain  returning to the track of the memorandum as soon as possible.  The problem now is with Mr. Patten. He is completely violating  the memorandum. Therefore the responsibility should lie with  the British side. Please tell him that."    In Beijing, Mr. Wu said in compliance with the airport  memorandum, China had already put forward a whole set of  proposals for settling the debt burden of the future Hong Kong  Special Administrative Region (SAR), increasing the  cost-effectiveness of the airport project and intensifying  necessary supervisory mechanism. Mr. Wu added that China now  hoped to see a favourable response from the British side.</p>

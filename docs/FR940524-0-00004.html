The action was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), a cooperative association that represents dairy farmers whose milk is pooled under the order. The suspension will give supply organizations, like AMPI, the flexibility they need to market their milk supplies efficiently under today's marketing conditions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  May 24, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Clifford M.

Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule lessens the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and tends to ensure that dairy farmers will have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department is issuing this final rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform.

Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Texas marketing area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 13, 1994 (59 FR 17498) concerning a proposed suspension of certain provisions (or sections) of the order.

By suspending these provisions, the milk of dairy farmers who were not associated with the Texas market in September-November could be used to supply Order 126 distributing plants during the following months of February&hyph;July.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its letter requesting the suspension, Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), stated that in some instances these provisions prevent the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficiently. Because of the limitation on which dairy farmers can be producers under the Texas order during the months of February&hyph;July, AMPI was unable to pool more than two million pounds of milk it supplied to an Order 126 distributing plant in Little Rock, Arkansas, during February 1994. The milk of these dairy farmers, who are more favorably located with respect to the Little Rock plant than are the cooperative's Texas producers, was not eligible for pool status because the dairy farmers had not been associated with the Texas market to the extent necessary during the preceding months of September-November. Also, if AMPI supplies the Arkansas plant with milk of eligible Texas producers, the cooperative suffers an economic pooling loss because the Little Rock plant is subject to a minus 39-cent location adjustment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The market's supply/demand relationship has changed dramatically since these provisions were adopted. Because of these circumstances, as proponent requested, the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions should be suspended indefinitely.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

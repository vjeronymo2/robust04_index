			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Labour launches poll tax offensive LABOUR yesterday highlighted what it called the 'government incompetence surcharge' on the poll tax. The jibe was made as Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, published figures showing that Labour councils had issued more than double the number of summonses for non-payment issued by Tory councils. Labour's offensive is intended to undermine Tory assertions that the extra sums people will have to pay to make up for non-payment - the 'other adjustments' figures on poll tax bills - derive from Labour councils' failure to pursue non-payers. The analysis, giving the numbers of summonses and liability orders for non-payment for each authority since April 1990, shows that the London borough of Haringey had issued summonses to 99 per cent of its entire poll tax register. 'Even allowing that some people have received more than one summons, this is an astonishing total,' Mr Gould said. 'It is hard to think what more Haringey could have done to collect the tax.' The average number of summonses even for shire districts, the class of authority where the percentage is lowest, amounted to more than a fifth of the total poll tax register. The number of summonses in England and Wales now totalled about 11m, Mr Gould added. He had written to the Guinness Book of Records seeking inclusion for the poll tax as 'the greatest debt-collection exercise in world history'. The Tories say Labour councillors who supported non-payment of the poll tax have contributed to collection difficulties, and that those councils which have high non-payment surcharges are those which have traditionally been inefficient at collecting charges.</p>

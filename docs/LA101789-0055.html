			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT 102, IT'S HIGH TIME TO TAKE THE OATH  </P> <P> After nearly four decades in the United States, Kazimieras Bandzevicius decided  he had enough time on his hands to become an American citizen. On Monday, he  took the oath of allegiance -- at age 102.  </P> <P> Officials from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service believe  Bandzevicius, a native of Lithuania who immigrated to the United States in  1950, is the oldest person ever naturalized in Los Angeles. But because of the  way statistics are kept, officials say they do not know whether he is the  oldest ever naturalized in the United States.  </P> <P> The Hollywood resident grinned as he walked slowly down the halls of the U.S.  District Courthouse in Los Angeles on Monday. One hand held a wooden cane and  the other clung to the arm of his granddaughter, Olga Goodman of Beverly Hills.  A small American flag stuck out of his vest pocket.  </P> <P> He had just left the chambers of U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr., where  he and a 10-year-old boy from the Philippines, John Michael Cruz Cortes,  pledged to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.  </P> <P> Hatter administered the oath to them in chambers, ahead of the 34 others who  later took the oath as a group in the courtroom because of the media attention  shown Bandzevicius, court officials said. The boy, son of U.S. District Court  Deputy Clerk Jose Cortes, was added to the private ceremony because he was the  youngest in the group.  </P> <P> "It's never too late to become a citizen of this great nation, and it's  certainly never too soon," Hatter said as he congratulated both.  </P> <P> "I feel like a newly born little baby," Bandzevicius said in Russian, with  Goodman translating.  </P> <P> "I feel really good, and I'm planning to live a long time," added Bandzevicius,  his gray hair framing a bald pate and his blue eyes shining behind thick-lensed  glasses.  </P> <P> Why had he waited so long to apply for citizenship?  </P> <P> "I worked so hard it seemed like there was no time," he said. "Now there is  time, and I want to help the Republican Party."  </P> <P> After Bandzevicius came to America at age 63, he said, he worked as a machinist  for various companies and did not retire until he was 92. "He wouldn't have  retired then," Goodman said, "except that he had to have cataract surgery."  </P> <P> Not long after that, his wife died, and he developed various circulatory  ailments. After he had vascular surgery on one leg late last year, Goodman said  he told her, " 'I want to die an American.' "  </P> <P> His attorney, Kaye Evans, said he passed his oral and written examination April  12, his 102nd birthday.  </P> <P> For his family, which includes his two daughters, four grandchildren and one  great-grandchild, the citizenship effort was the latest in a lifelong pattern  of strength and determination, Goodman said.  </P> <P> Bandzevicius was born in a family of 12 children in 1887 in rural Lithuania,  then under the control of czarist Russia. He wanted to be a pharmacist, he  said, because "in a rural town if you were a pharmacist you were a big person."  </P> <P> But since his family did not have money for his education, he struck out on his  own at age 13. Eventually he made his way to what was then called St.  Petersburg, now Leningrad. There, he stayed with Roman Catholic priests, and  through scholarships and tutoring jobs he eventually graduated -- with honors,  Goodman said -- from the University of St. Petersburg.  </P> <P> But he never became a pharmacist because the Russian Revolution broke out and  changed his life. A friend of his was executed by the Bolsheviks. Bandzevicius  promised this friend, who was actually Goodman's grandfather, that he would  care for the man's wife and children. He married the widow in 1920, adopted the  children and took them to Lithuania, believing life would be safer for them  there.  </P> <P> There, he worked as both a banker and as a Buick car dealer. But in 1940 he  moved the family to Germany, Goodman said, because of the impending Soviet  occupation of Lithuania. In 1950 he moved to Chicago and then Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "I love the freedom," Bandzevicius said when asked what he liked best about the  United States.  </P> <P> Bandzevicius, who lives in a two-story Hollywood house, still takes care of  himself.  </P> <P> "He did his own taxes this year. He calls me up to tell me when he wants to  move his money to another account for interest," Goodman said. But, she added,  "the family cooks for him."  </P> <P> "I wanted him to wear new clothes for today," Goodman said, looking at the  outfit Bandzevicius had chosen for the day -- a jacket, tie, vest, trousers and  shoes, all in brown, with white socks. "But he said, 'I'm an old man. I'll wear  my old outfit.' "  </P></p>

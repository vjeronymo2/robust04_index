It won 25 of the 48 state assembly seats contested  to retain the reign of government in the state. It got the  simple majority after the results of 44 seats were declared at  1030 PM [1430 GMT] last night. Newspapers described the PBS's  victory as a slim one, as it defeated the Barisan Nasional  [National Front] by only two seats.    Reports from Kota Kinabalu this morning said the swearing in  of the new Sabah State Government before the governor, Tun  Mohamed Said Keruak, was scheduled to be held at 0830 this  morning.    Meanwhile, in a press conference in Kuala Lumpur this  morning, Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed said he  has been informed that many of the PBS state assemblymen have  been held in confinement for fear that they would cross over to  Barisan Nasional. He said Barisan Nasional has received the  messages that some PBS state assemblymen have expressed their  intention to join Barisan Nasional. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said  he was prepared to receive them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 12 Mar (MENA)--The newspaper AL-AHRAM has  asked the big powers to stop leveling accusations at the Arab  countries, especially under the current circumstances, or to  control them, particularly since there are some sides who are  committing crimes in broad daylight and no one is taking any  measures against them.    The paper said in its comment for tomorrow, Sunday, that  most  of these accusations come from one big power with interests in  the region. It has some relationship to the issue at which  accusations are being leveled. The paper added that these  accusations are not based on anything other than reports  containing unconfirmed information or guesswork.    It added that these accusations are linked to some kind of  violation of international peace and security, which means that  the road is now open for taking the necessary resolutions  accompanied by certain sanctions on the part of the Security  Council.    The paper said that Iraq was previously accused of using gas  against the Shiites in the marshlands. After investigations, it  was proven that this had not taken place. Libya was also  accused of setting up installations for producing chemical  weapons -- an accusation for which there is no evidence to back  it up. Similar accusations have been leveled at other Arab  countries.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 12 Apr (TASS) -- Russia will never be  reconciled to the role of "a younger partner", who is informed  after the event about such vital decisions as the use of armed  force. Grigoriy Karasin, the director of the Information and  Press Department of the RF Ministry of Foreign Affairs, made  this statement today at a briefing for Russian and foreign  journalists.    "We are opposed to the practice of Russia being consulted  only in order to get an affirmative `yes' from us," the diplomat  said. "We have naturally reached the appropriate conclusions  from what occurred on 10th and 11th April in the region of  Gorazde."</p>

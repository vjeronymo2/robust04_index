			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / International Company News: Nova takes control of methanol producer Nova, the Alberta natural gas pipeline and petrochemicals group, is acquiring 24 per cent of Methanex, the Vancouver-based methanol producer, in a series of cash and stock deals. Nova estimated the total value of the transactions, including the eventual public offer of part of Fletcher Challenge's Methanex holding, as CDollars 1.14bn (USDollars 861m). It will finish with effective control of Methanex, whose total annual capacity is 4.2m tonnes. Methanex will be the world's largest producer, with 14 per cent of total capacity. Nova is acquiring its stake from Germany's Metallgesellschaft and from New Zealand's Fletcher Challenge resource and construction group. In the deal, Nova will put its own methanol assets into Methanex for Methanex stock, and subscribe for new Methanex shares. It will buy 6.4m Methanex shares from Metalgesellschaft and 15.5m shares from Fletcher Challenge. The balance of Fletcher's holding will be sold later via a public offer. Nova, which has been restructured into a pipeline and petrochemicals group, last month sold its gas production unit in western Canada to Seagull Energy of the US for CDollars 275m. 'The Methanex deal gives Nova the opportunity to participate in one of the world's leading suppliers of methanol,' said Mr Terry Poole, Nova's senior vice-president. Nova already has a strong methanol marketing presence in North America and Asia. Methanol, derived from natural gas, is used widely as a clean-burning fuel and in making additives for petrol.</p>

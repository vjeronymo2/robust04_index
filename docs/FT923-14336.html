			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / The Munich Summit: International co-operation sought LEADERS of the world's seven biggest industrial democracies yesterday adopted a political declaration proclaiming a new non-confrontational partnership between east and west, including the Asia-Pacific region, and expressing strong support for an enhanced peacekeeping and peace-making role for the United Nations. Emphasising that the need for international co-operation had been underlined by the instability and conflicts provoked by resurgent nationalism and inter-ethnic tensions, as in Yugoslavia, the declaration also gave a ringing endorsement of the European Community's Maastricht treaty as 'a historic step on the way to European union'. 'Its implementation will enhance political stability on the European continent and open up new opportunities for co-operation,' the declaration said, in a clear attempt to counter the growing public hostility in several EC countries about ratifying the treaty, in the wake of its rejection by the Danish electorate. Noting that the tasks and responsibilities of the UN had increased dramatically since last year's G7 summit in London, particularly in the field of crisis prevention, conflict management and the protection of minorities, the seven leaders expressed firm support for the efforts of Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, to strengthen the world organisation's role in preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. But though the declaration described Mr Boutros Ghali's 'Agenda for peace' proposals, published last week, as 'a valuable contribution' to the work of the UN, British officials said G7 governments were still studying his plan for permanent UN standby forces, ready to intervene in conflicts at 24 hours' notice. Stressing the importance of improved co-operation between the UN and regional organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, the leaders called on the CSCE summit in Helsinki later this week to establish a special security forum and to strengthen the organisation's capabilities for conflict prevention, crisis management and peaceful resolution of disputes. The declaration stressed the need to curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction and the missiles capable of delivering them. The leaders expressed their firm conviction that 'the indefinite extension' of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) when it comes up for review in 1995 would be an essential contribution to this process. Countries not yet party to the NPT were urged to join as soon as possible by the leaders. In particular, they looked forward to early adherence to the treaty, as non-nuclear weapons states, by Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus, as well as the other non-Russian states of the former Soviet Union, and said they attached the highest importance to the establishment in the former Soviet Union of effective export controls on nuclear materials and weapons. Underlining the need for the most effective possible action to safeguard nuclear materials and to prevent the transfer or the clandestine production of nuclear weapons, the declaration warned that the offer of nuclear co-operation by the western industrialised countries would, in future, be conditional on adherence to the NPT and the adoption of full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. A separate statement issued by the German chairman of the conference said the leaders had also adopted positions on the following subjects: Nagorno-Karabakh: they deplored the continued fighting in this region and urged the parties to cease hostilities immediately and to participate in negotiations. 'We emphasise that we shall, on no account, recognise faits accomplis brought about by force.' Iraq: the leaders noted that Iraq still refused to comply with all resolutions of the Security Council without reservation. They said they would continue to demand elimination of all Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and release of all prisoners. It was essential for Baghdad to comply with Security Council resolutions so that food and medical supplies could be distributed on an equitable basis. South Africa: the leaders called on all sides to resume negotiations as soon as possible and to make greater efforts to prevent violence. Sustainable economic growth was essential for an enduring solution of the country's problems.</p>

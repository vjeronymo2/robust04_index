			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / German spending cuts 'dash hopes of upturn': Economic institute attacks budget savings package THE German government's budget proposals have killed any hope of an economic upturn next year, and left the Bundesbank little room for interest rate reductions, according to the influential German Institute for Economic Research (DIW). In a scathing attack, the Berlin institute warned in its latest report that Bonn's economic and finance policies would lead to nil economic growth in 1994, compared with consensus forecasts of 1 per cent GDP growth. The report was released as the German stock market surged to a year's high yesterday. The DIW is one of the five leading independent economic institutes in western Germany, and was one of the first to warn of the dangers of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's decision to press ahead with early monetary union with the former East Germany. Its report also poured cold water on optimism within the government and the Bundesbank that recovery will start at the end of this year and heaped scorn on claims that the economy is imperilled by structural crisis. Prof Lutz Hoffmann, DIW president, yesterday denounced the government's finance policy as 'short-term juggling'. He said suggestions that structural problems could be solved by people working longer hours - strongly backed by Mr Kohl - were 'tomfoolery of the first order'. The institute, which based its forecast on the assumption of early and 'radical' cuts in European short-term interest rates, claimed that, due in part to planned increases in fuel taxes, west German inflation would average 3.5 per cent next year. 'This does not suggest. . . there will be great scope for interest rate cuts.' While the government was counting on a DM35bn (Pounds 13.7bn) improvement in its revenues next year 'four fifths of these measures directly reduce incomes, one fifth increases prices'. Bonn's savings, dependent on benefit cuts, would lead to a real fall in private disposable incomes of 2 per cent next year and a drop of 1.5 per cent in private consumption, it claimed. Reducing unemployment benefits and payments to the poorest divided the community. Publication of the report coincided with corrections to recent monetary indicators which showed money supply growth and inflation exceeding earlier estimates. Annualised growth in the M3 measure of money supply in May was 6.9 per cent, not 6.7 per cent, the Bundesbank said. The figure for western German inflation in June was also revised up from 4.1 per cent to 4.2 per cent, unchanged. German markets, Page 2 World stocks, Page 37</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Washington urged to act on global warming US POLICY-MAKERS have seriously underestimated the economic costs of global warming and should support an 'aggressive programme of international abatement.' The warning was delivered by Mr William Cline, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think-tank, at the annual meeting of the American Economics Association in New Orleans last weekend. Most analyses of global warming have focused on the effects of a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations, which on unchanged policies is expected by 2025. The consensus among scientists is that this would raise average global temperatures by between 1.5 and 4.5 degrees centigrade, with a 'best guess' of 2.5 degrees. Many economists believe this much warming would cause only limited economic damage, equivalent to perhaps 1 per cent of gross national product. The World Bank, for example, is expected to play down the economic risks of warming in the World Development Report this year, which will be devoted to the environment. At the conference, Mr Lawrence Summers, the bank's chief economist, said global warming, even on 'very pessimistic assumptions', would offset 'less than six months' GNP growth over the next 40 years.' It would not be 'civilisation-threatening.' Mr Cline, soon to publish a book on global warming, says the conventional benchmark of a doubling of carbon dioxide levels by 2025 is misleading: 'Because global warming is cumulative and irreversible, a much longer time horizon should be considered.' Warming is set to continue at least until 2300. He calculates that global emissions of carbon could rise from 6bn tonnes today to 20bn tonnes by 2100 and more than 50bn late in the 23rd century. This would cause global temperatures to rise by a central estimate of 10 degrees centigrade and perhaps as much as 18 degrees. Over this longer time horizon, the damage from warming could amount to 6 per cent of GNP, or six times the conventional estimate. But the effects are not easily predicted. With 10 degrees of warming, for example, the western Antartic ice sheet could disintegrate, causing a substantial rise in the sea-level. Mr Cline analyses the costs of cutting carbon emissions to Dollars 4bn tonnes annually and holding there for three centuries. Abatement costs would peak at about 3.5 per cent of GNP by about 2040 and stay thereafter at 2.5 per cent. Assuming that policy-makers should be risk-averse (assigning higher probabilities to bad rather than to good outcomes), he estimates the benefits from reducing carbon emissions would outweigh the abatement costs. The implication of his analysis is that the Bush administration's passive attitude to global warming is economically mistaken. The US, unlike most European countries and Japan, has not yet even agreed targets for carbon emissions, on grounds of 'scientific uncertainty.' Mr Cline says the US should support an international carbon tax, with mild initial rates, some of the revenue being channelled to developing countries so as to back environmentally friendly policies. Over the longer term, the risks from warming are great enough to justify international carbon quotas, backed if necessary by trade sanctions.</p>

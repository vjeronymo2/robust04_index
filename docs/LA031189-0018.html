			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHBISHOP'S JET HELICOPTER  </P> <P> While we are fully aware of the good works, and donations, made by Richard  Riordan and his contemporaries, we feel compelled to make a comment on the gift  of a helicopter to Archbishop Mahony.  </P> <P> Assuming that the archbishop will use it to "avoid traffic congestion," we find  it ironic that just last month the parents of students in one of the poorest  parish schools in Los Angeles were told that their monthly tuition needs to be  raised by $15 a month next school year. The parents, many of whom work two and  three jobs now, were told that we all need to make sacrifices for the sake of  education. Where is the sacrifice on the part of the church leadership?  </P> <P> SISTER CAROL BURCHARDS, S.M.  </P> <P> SISTER CRISTINA CABALLERO, S.M.  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

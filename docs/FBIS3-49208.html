			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, Jan 5 (TANJUG) -- Sales in Yugoslav stores  have plunged steeply as the result of monetary chaos and a  dramatic decline in living standards caused by the U.N.  sanctions imposed against Yugoslavia in May 1992.    Retailers are finding it increasingly hard to obtain goods  as  production has virtually ground to a halt. Many of the 70,000  shop assistants in Belgrade go to work out of habit. Downtown  supermarkets, once full of domestic and imported delicacies, are  now empty of both goods and customers and in many shops the only  items offered for sale are a few bottles of mineral water or  cans of sardines.    For a majority of Belgrade stores, Wednesday was the ninth  consecutive day on which they stayed closed. Because of the  runaway inflation, which reached one million percent in  December, they are loathe to accept the national currency in  payment for their wares. The value of their takings is  completely eroded within a matter of hours and is not enough for  even a fraction of the stocks they need.    Since cash money is increasingly in short supply, people  have  to pay for many things with checks. And more and more cashiers  in socially-owned as well as private stores are refusing to  accept checks or any kind of plastic money. Even farmers at the  open-air markets take dinars unwillingly.    For months now, the German mark has been in use as a  currency  and a basis for formation of prices. Even the value of the mark  has declined in Yugoslavia. A liter of milk which sold at 0.25  marks before the new year holiday now costs one German mark,  while the average wage amounts to about 10 marks and pensions  less than five.    The crisis has led to the disappearance of the middle class.  Sociologists say 95 percent of the population is poor, while the  remainder is very wealthy, mainly from illegal gains from crime  or the black market.    Many economists are surprised that the monetary and  financial  systems have not caved in completely by now.    The federal government announced implementation of a program  to rehabilitate the monetary system and curb hyperinflation for  January. However, it underlined that easing of the sanctions  and unblocking of Yugoslav assets abroad were prerequisites for  the program's success.</p>

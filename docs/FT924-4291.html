			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / Rise in reserves surprises City THE UK'S official gold and foreign currency reserves rose an underlying Dollars 86m last month. The figures, released by the Treasury yesterday, surprised City economists, who had forecast another fall. In September and October the reserves fell quite sharply, reflecting heavy spending by the Bank of England on September 16 in a vain attempt to prop up the pound. The official reserve figures are not necessarily a good guide to official intervention on the foreign exchanges. The Bank is able to shroud intervention levels by borrowing on the foreign exchange forward market. Those loans can be rolled over indefin-itely. The Bank also made borrowings from other European central banks before Black Wednesday, which do not have to be paid back until the middle of December. Mr John Shepperd, economist at SG Warburgs Securities, said: 'The rise of Dollars 86m tells us nothing about what has been going on in terms of intervention. To look to the official reserves for guidance is a lost cause.' The underlying change excludes a number of factors, such as Ecu Treasury bill proceeds. The Treasury figures showed that the overall level of the reserves fell by Dollars 51m, bringing the total to Dollars 42.09bn at the end of November, compared with Dollars 42.14bn at the end of October. Analysts believe that the full amount spent by the Bank in mid September may not be known until the middle of next year.</p>

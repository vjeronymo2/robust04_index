			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mr. Yi Pok-hon (33, from Sinam 1-tong, Taegu), who  was arrested on 8 March by the Agency for National Security  Planning [NSP] on espionage charges and who was transferred to  the prosecutor's office on 25 March, stated while being  investigated: "It seems North Korea has succeeded in  manufacturing nuclear bombs." This draws our attention as there  is current suspicion regarding North Korea's nuclear weapons  development.    The NSP disclosed this on 26 March when it transferred Mr.  Yi  Pok-hon to the prosecutor's office. Since he left the country  in 1990, Mr. Yi has been engaged in spy activities overseas, in  regions such as Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and  China. Mr. Yi reportedly stated during the NSP investigation:  When I went to North Korea in March 1993, a Mr. Ho, a senior  North Korean Workers' Party cadre, asked me directly if it would  be tactically advantageous to North Korea to announce openly its  possession of a nuclear bomb or would it be better to keep it  secret after the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty.    The NSP also disclosed that Mr. Yi said that the said Ho had  told him that North Korea intends to deliver an atomic bomb,  whose performance had not been tested, to a certain country in  the Middle East sometime during 1994.</p>

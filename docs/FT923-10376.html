			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Israel links Jewish settlements policy to economic growth ISRAEL'S new government has warned that a freeze on new building in Jewish settlements in the occupied territories will also curb economic growth in the short term and delay a fall in unemployment, currently running at a record 11.5 per cent, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. The Labour-led coalition which took power this month is committed to shifting resources from the territories to Israel 'proper' and increasing infrastructural investment in an attempt to generate high growth sufficient to cope with mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. A freeze on 6,000 settlement housing units, and restrictions on construction within Israel, are a first step towards implementing this policy. This week, the government has also taken steps to rescind government incentives from industrial plants in Jewish settlements. The actions are expected to help secure Dollars 10bn in US loan guarantees Israel wants to finance immigration absorption. But Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister, and Mr Avraham Shochat, the finance minister, have both warned that a short-term effect will be to limit growth. Mr Shochat told parliament's finance committee that gross national product in 1993 was unlikely to grow significantly. 'The fruits in employment and investment will be seen in 1994-95,' he said. The Vatican and Israel yesterday pledged to work towards diplomatic ties in an historic first step that could end decades of chilly relations between the Roman Catholic Church and the Jewish state, Reuter reports from Vatican City. The Vatican said it did not expect negative reaction to the move from Palestinians and other Arabs because Middle East peace talks had made it easier to take the step. The Vatican has set up a high-level permanent commission with Israel aimed at establishing diplomatic ties with the Jewish state, which was born in 1948.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, March 8 (XINHUA) -- The development of  rural industry in Northeast China's Liaoning Province has  absorbed half of the labor force in its rural areas.    The rural labor force in Liaoning Province totals 8.5  million. But the province only has 0.5 hectare of farmland per  capita.    In the past, most of the surplus labor in rural areas could  do nothing but rely on farm production.    Experts estimated that about half of the rural labor force  is  enough for the province's agriculture.    Since the mid-1980s, the province has attached importance to  the development of rural industry so as to absorb more surplus  rural labor.    Last year, the number of rural enterprises in Liaoning  increased to about 700,000 from 300,000 in 1990.    The output value of the rural industry in the province  reached more than 16 million yuan, accounting for 80 percent of  the total output value in agriculture, and the profit of the  rural industry was 10.6 billion yuan.    Now about 4.5 million rural laborers have turned to the  rural  industry in the province.    Statistics show that over the past 14 years, about 110  million of the labor force in China's rural areas have shifted  to non- agricultural services.</p>

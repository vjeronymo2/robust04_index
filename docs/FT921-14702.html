			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / World Trade News: Rover plants in Russia seen as long-term vision ROVER, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, said yesterday it was prepared in principle to involve itself in car manufacturing in Russia, including the possible transfer of production equipment for its Montego range after UK production finishes in around two years' time. But it said the subject had been raised only in passing, during talks over the sale of an initial 5,000 built-up Montegos this year, which it is hoped will increase to up to 50,000 Rover models of all kinds from 1993 onwards. Reports that Rover was actually negotiating on a manufacturing plant, joint venture or other initiatives were 'hopelessly premature', a Rover spokesman declared. Speculation over a possible involvement by Rover in a Russian vehicle manufacturing venture has been spurred by the arrival in the UK this week of a delegation from NAMI, the former Soviet, now Russian, state-controlled entity responsible for controlling the standards of imported cars and the conditions of their sale. However, Rover insisted yesterday that its only contacts with the NAMI delegation will take place tomorrow and Friday, when Rover is scheduled to undertake a series of 'teach-ins' for the Russians. These entail the setting up sales and service facilities for the Montegos, which are being sold to Russia under a Pounds 50m deal arranged through Orbicom, an Anglo-Soviet trading company based in Shrewsbury. Orbicom is forming a joint venture company with NAMI which provides for the establishment of a Rover test centre in Moscow and the setting up of a dealer network for Rover vehicles in Russia. The first outlets, in Moscow and St Petersburg, are to open in the Spring. Rover itself plans to have no equity stake or other direct participation in the sales and distribution venture. Mr Mark Jones, Orbicom's chairman, said last night that both Orbicom and NAMI had held outline discussions with Rover about the possibilities of eventual manufacture. However, this was very much a long-term issue. 'It has very much to be market driven', said Mr Jones. Unlike some transferred car manufacturing ventures, Orbicom insists that the Montego is viewed as a high quality vehicle in Russia 'which is sold up against perceived rivals like the Mercedes 190.'</p>

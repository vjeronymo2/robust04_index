			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LANDFILL FIRM HELPED FUND CITY, COUNTY CAMPAIGNS  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris Industries, which is seeking approval to expand its Sunshine  Canyon Landfill above Granada Hills to allow dumping there for another 50  years, has contributed more than $100,000 since 1985 to campaign committees of  the Los Angeles County supervisors, City Council and mayor, a Times review of  campaign records shows.  </P> <P> In addition to the $106,212 donated by the waste disposal company, law firms,  lobbyists and consultants working for BFI gave an additional $193,610 to the  elected officials -- for a total of $299,822 from 1985 through 1989.  </P> <P> BFI's lawyers and consultants have other clients with business before the city  and county, so their donations aren't connected solely with the Sunshine Canyon  expansion. Even so, the nearly $300,000 given by BFI and the others represents  literally hundreds of separate contributions by more than a dozen firms  promoting expansion of the Sunshine dump.  </P> <P> In addition, during 1989, BFI consultants organized small, private fund-raising  breakfasts and dinners for four City Council members, each of whom received  campaign contributions from seven to 10 members of the BFI team.  </P> <P> "They've been throwing a lot of money around," said Mary Edwards of the North  Valley Coalition, a homeowner group that has fought expansion of the dump. "It  seems every place we go" at City Hall, BFI has "been there first with money,"  she said.  </P> <P> BFI has a vast stake in the proposed expansion, which could generate billions  of dollars in revenue for the firm over the next half-century. The expansion  has been opposed by neighborhood groups, because it would destroy thousands of  trees and extend the life of a dump they say has created dust and blowing  trash.  </P> <P> The landfill operates within the city, but county and city approval are needed  because BFI's property straddles the city-county boundary and the firm wants to  expand on both sides of the line. Some elected officials have said they support  the expansion because of dwindling space in existing landfills.  </P> <P> The county expansion is to be considered today by the Los Angeles County  Regional Planning Commission and will be taken up later by the Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> The leading recipient of BFI contributions has been County Supervisor Mike  Antonovich, whose district encompasses the landfill. Antonovich received  $21,250 from BFI, or one-fifth of all contributions from the waste disposal  firm and its officials. An aide said Antonovich's contributors "are buying his  program and philosophy of government, he is not buying theirs."  </P> <P> Supervisor Pete Schabarum, whose district includes BFI's other big Los Angeles  County dump, the Azusa Western Landfill, was the second leading beneficiary,  receiving $15,650 in contributions from BFI. Schabarum, whose district gets the  bulk of the county's trash, has opposed expansion of the Azusa dump due to  concern about ground water pollution, while supporting landfill expansions in  other areas, including Sunshine Canyon.  </P> <P> Campaign contributions have "nothing to do with how he . . . votes," said  Schabarum senior deputy Judy Hammond. She said Schabarum has been a "driving  force . . . to establish new landfills throughout L.A. County."  </P> <P> Supervisor Deane Dana got $12,500 from BFI, and Mayor Tom Bradley, $6,262.  </P> <P> By contrast, City Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents Granada Hills and has  opposed expansion of the dump, received no money from BFI.  </P> <P> The impact of contributions on specific decisions is a matter of debate. At a  minimum, critics say, campaign giving builds good will, giving well-heeled  contributors a political advantage over ordinary citizens. Contributors and  officeholders generally say the impact is minimal, since a large contributor  still accounts for a tiny percentage of campaign receipts.  </P> <P> "There are only so many spots on an elected official's calendar," and campaign  giving merely assures access to decision-makers, said Mark Ryavec of Delphi  Associates, a BFI consultant.  </P> <P> And with the existing dump at Sunshine Canyon "hanging on by its fingernails,"  Ryavec said, it is "just ludicrous to suggest that Browning-Ferris . . . has  any impact on what's occurred in the decision-making process."  </P> <P> BFI has taken its lumps from neighborhood activists and Bernson, and its  treatment by the City Council has been mixed. Still, BFI won two key political  victories in 1989, a year of stepped-up campaign giving in which more than a  dozen firms involved in the proposed expansion made campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Last summer, the City Council granted BFI relief from a previous decision by  zoning officials that would have virtually closed the dump at the end of 1989  because of zoning violations. The council instead gave BFI the right to  continue using the current disposal area through June, 1990, by which time the  firm is supposed to be dumping in an area farther from nearby homes. The action  followed a sophisticated phone bank and direct mail campaign in support of the  landfill.  </P> <P> And of greater long-term importance for BFI, the supervisors and City Council  endorsed the expansion in principle through language inserted in a "memorandum  of cooperation" on development of a city-county landfill at nearby Elsmere  Canyon.  </P> <P> In the memorandum, the city and county agreed not only to develop Elsmere but  to work toward permitting expansion of Sunshine on both sides of the  city-county line that divides the BFI property. At the county's insistence, the  city agreed to a clause that could temporarily bar city trucks from the new  county area of the dump if the city failed to approve expansion on its side of  the line.  </P> <P> The endorsement raised eyebrows among opponents because officials usually avoid  endorsing controversial projects before public hearings and environmental  review. In the case of Sunshine Canyon, a public hearing on the proposed county  expansion had not been held, and the application for city-side expansion had  not even been filed.  </P> <P> In interviews since, county and city officials have said they are trying to  head off a "trash crisis," rather than help BFI.  </P> <P> "It has nothing to do with running interference for BFI," said Dennis  Morefield, an aide to Dana. "It has strictly to do with the . . . need for  adequate landfill capacity to serve Los Angeles County throughout for the next  several decades."  </P> <P> The 230-acre landfill takes about 6,000 tons of trash per day, or nearly  one-seventh of the solid waste in Los Angeles County. Space is expected to be  exhausted by September, 1991. If county and city expansions are approved, BFI  will be able to fill additional canyon areas with an additional 215 million  tons of trash.  </P> <P> Dump fees are almost certain to rise, but if BFI continued to charge its  disposal rates of between $24 and $31 per ton, the 215 million tons translates  into more than $5 billion in revenue over the life of the dump. BFI has  declined to provide a revenue estimate.  </P> <P> Of the $106,212 contributed by BFI alone, $63,400 went to the five supervisors,  and $42,812 to Mayor Tom Bradley and members of the City Council. Donations to  city officeholders included $7,500 to Citizens for a Livable Los Angeles, a  committee controlled by Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Marvin Braude that  fought Occidental Petroleum's plan to drill for oil in the Pacific Palisades.  </P> <P> The BFI team includes an array of influential law firms, lobbyists and land-use  consultants. The lawyers and law firms -- led by Latham &amp; Watkins; Jones,  Day, Reavis &amp; Pogue; and Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker -- gave  $135,002 to city and county officials from 1985 through 1989, with half of that  coming from Latham &amp; Watkins.  </P> <P> The land-use and community relations consulting firm of Handelman &amp;  Katherman and its partners Ira Handelman and Rob Katherman gave $21,391.  </P> <P> Maureen Kindel, former president of the city Board of Public Works and a key  Bradley fund-raiser, is one of BFI's lobbyists. Kindel and others at her firm,  Rose &amp; Kindel Inc., contributed $14,125.  </P> <P> Other contributors included Ryavec and Delphi Associates, $6,722, and political  consultant Lynn Wessell, $4,600.  </P> <P> These firms have been political fixtures, with long-standing relationships with  supervisors and council members that predate the proposed dump expansion.  </P> <P> But other contributors in the BFI group got into the act last year as the  project approached a critical stage.  </P> <P> BFI's geotechnical consultant, Purcell, Rhoades &amp; Associates, which is  based in Hayward in Northern California, had not contributed before last year  to Los Angeles officeholders, a review of campaign records shows.  </P> <P> But in 1989, Purcell, Rhoades made seven contributions totaling $3,500.  Antonovich and Supervisor Deane Dana each got $1,000, and five council members  got $500 apiece -- the most a single contributor can give in county and city  elections.  </P> <P> Similarly, Irvine-based Ultrasystems Engineers, which prepared the  environmental impact report on the proposed dump expansion, before last year  had made a single contribution of $200 to a council member, campaign reports  show. But in 1989, Ultrasystems donated $2,500 -- $1,000 to Dana, $500 to  Antonovich, $500 to Supervisor Ed Edelman, and $500 to Councilman Michael Woo.  </P> <P> "I don't think it affects the outcome of what happens in any respect," said H.  Randall Stoke of Latham &amp; Watkins, a lobbyist for BFI, referring to  campaign giving.  </P> <P> Stoke said he did not know if it would hurt not to give, but added, "I'm scared  to find out."  </P> <P> One BFI consultant, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said  campaign giving "is the only way you can do business in this town." Another  said council members all "have their hand out at one time or another . . . , so  you give . . . and remain their friend, it's as simple as that."  </P> <P> But the BFI team last year did more than just respond to appeals for money. It  also put together small fund-raisers for council members.  </P> <P> Last Feb. 24, for example, Ryavec organized a fund-raising breakfast for Woo at  which Woo raised $3,250 from seven contributors involved with the Sunshine  Canyon project. Six separate contributors -- BFI; BFI Vice President Michael  Lawlor; Delphi Associates; Ultrasystems; Purcell, Rhoades; and Paul, Hastings  -- gave the legal maximum of $500, and Stoke of Latham &amp; Watkins gave $250.  Maureen Kindel also gave Woo $500 three days earlier, according to campaign  records.  </P> <P> Last March 23, Handelman &amp; Katherman organized a fund-raising breakfast for  Yaroslavsky that brought eight contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI;  Handelman &amp; Katherman; Delphi Associates; Jones, Day; Purcell, Rhoades; and  Paul, Hastings. Later last spring was when BFI donated the $7,500 to Citizens  for a Livable Los Angeles, the Yaroslavsky-Braude committee fighting oil  development in the Pacific Palisades. A BFI official said the contribution was  made at the suggestion of Ryavec, who was active in the anti-oil fight.  </P> <P> Last April 4, Ryavec organized a dinner for Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores that  brought nine contributions totaling $4,000 from BFI; Ryavec; Rose &amp; Kindel;  Handelman &amp; Katherman; Paul, Hastings; Jones, Day; and Purcell, Rhoades.  </P> <P> And on Dec. 20, Kindel put together a fund-raising breakfast for Councilman  Richard Alatorre that brought in $5,000 -- 10 donations of $500 each from the  BFI team. Even BFI's consulting forester, Ralph Osterling Consultants Inc. of  San Mateo, chipped in $500. And Ryavec made a small donation to Alatorre's  "Feliz Navidad" program of Christmas parties in his district.  </P> <P> Ryavec said these events were organized largely as alternatives to big  fund-raisers to which some of the contributors were invited. "I would much  rather sit down in a small group setting as opposed to being part of some big  cattle herd," Ryavec said.  </P> <P> "If you're going to give a donation, you might as well get something out of it  besides a bad piece of chicken," another BFI consultant said.  </P> <P> Flores and Alatorre said through aides that they decide issues on their merits  and not because of campaign contributions.  </P> <P> Woo told The Times: "I was running for reelection. They offered to put on this  breakfast, and I am aware of that fact, . . . but that's only one of the facts  that I have to consider." The other facts are "the position of the councilman  of the district and the position of the neighbors who live near the landfill  and the pressing need" to deal with "the garbage created by the city."  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky said BFI has "known pretty much from the start that my views have  been for neighborhood and community protection, not for the expansion of that  dump. And that's where I stand, whether or not they host a breakfast for me."  </P> <P> Political contributions "do not always achieve the desired result," but  "citizens have to ask why is this being done," said Tony Cosby-Rossmann,  attorney for the anti-dump North Valley Coalition.  </P> <P> "I certainly feel uncomfortable knowing that the three law firms opposing me  and their client are contributing so much."  </P> <P> Times researchers Cecilia Rasmussen and Laine Courtney contributed to this  report.  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> Chart shows 1985-89 contributions made to public officials by BFI and others.

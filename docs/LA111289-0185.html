			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MIRALESTE PLAYOFF HOPES DWINDLE  </P> <P> Miraleste High School's football team lost, 41-21, to visiting Whittier  Christian on Saturday and saw its hope of an at-large berth in the Southern  Section Division IX playoffs fade.  </P> <P> "I don't think we'll be in the playoffs," Coach Todd DeAngelis said of his  Marauders, who finished the season 5-4 (3-3 in the Olympic League).  </P> <P> Injured Miraleste tailback Dan Sarner rushed for 130 yards in 11 carries,  including an 80-yard TD run, and caught two passes for 78 more yards.  </P> <P> The Marauders held Whittier Christian fullback Ron Papazian to 77 yards, but  tailback Scott Jordan had 200 yards in 31 carries and two touchdowns.  Quarterback Nick Sanchez hit flanker Alex Davila for 109 yards and three  touchdowns.  </P> <P> The Olympic League is guaranteed only two playoff berths in Division IX, and  those are going to Whittier Christian (10-0, 6-0) and Valley Christian (9-1,  5-1). For Miraleste to get in, Southern Section officials would have to tag  both the league's third-place team, Santa Margarita (7-3, 6-2), and Miraleste  as at-large selections. STUART MATTHEWS  </P></p>

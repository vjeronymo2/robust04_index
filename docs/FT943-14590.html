			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / UK and France press Serbs The foreign ministers of Britain and France yesterday tried to tighten the screws on Serb leaders and warned of a wider war if rival communities failed to endorse the plan for Bosnia's partition along ethnic lines. Bosnian Serb leaders told the foreign ministers of Britain and France yesterday they would neither endorse nor reject the 'last-chance' plan. In meetings with Bosnian Serb leaders, Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, and Mr Alain Juppe, his French counterpart, said earlier the international community expected Serb forces to hand over one-third of the 70 per cent of Bosnian territory they hold. Under the plan, the new Moslem-Croat federation would gain control over 51 per cent of the war-torn country leaving 49 per cent to the Bosnian Serbs. Mr Hurd warned that if the plan was rejected, the five-nation 'contact group' - comprising the US, Russia, Germany, the UK and France - have considered lifting the arms embargo against the Moslem-Croat federation, further tightening of UN sanctions and withdrawal of the 18,000-strong UN force from Bosnia. The ministers were later due to meet President Slobodan Milosevic, who they hope will join them in persuading Bosnian Serbs to accept partition. The Serb assembly - far more radical than its leadership - has rejected previous peace plans despite intense international pressure.</p>

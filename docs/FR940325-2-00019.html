			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that certain reported flux shipments made in October 1992 pursuant to a contract claimed to be effective prior to the POI, but the price terms of which were modified in November 1992, should not be included in our final dumping analysis. Respondent claims that the date of the November 1992 price modification notice should be used as the date of sale for subsequent sales made to this customer during the POI. Therefore, respondent asserts that all shipments made after the November price modification should be included in the Department's final dumping calculations, while those POI shipments made prior to the November price modification should be excluded from the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree. Respondent reported all sales/shipments of flux to the customer in question pursuant to purchase orders issued during the POI, because (1) it was unable to locate the original master order for that customer allegedly dated prior to the POI and (2) the original price terms changed in November 1992. At verification, although we were unable to locate the original master agreement or blanket purchase order for the subject customer, we did find a ``change order'' dated November 2, 1992, which stipulated a change in price terms effective on that date. We also examined invoices issued to this customer shortly before and after the November 2 change order date. Based on our examination of these invoices, we found that the invoices confirmed LCA's acceptance of the November 2 change order, because the price per ton LCA charged the customer changed after that date. In accordance with these verification findings, we have included in our final dumping analysis only those shipments made after the November 1992 price modification, using the November 2, 1992, change order date as the date of sale for these shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 11  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that CV should be the basis for FMV because including home market bagging costs in variable COM would cause the difmer adjustment to exceed 20 percent. Respondent states that the bags used in the home market are not merely packing for shipment, but rather consumer required packaging; therefore, their costs must be treated as part of COM. Respondent argues that it would be contrary to the Department's past practice to classify these bags as packing ``incidental'' to the shipment of the merchandise. To support its arguments, respondent cites the FMV Calculations performed pursuant to the 1992 Suspension Agreement in the antidumping duty investigation on gray portland cement and clinker from Venezuela; Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value: Porcelain-on-Steel Cooking Ware from Taiwan (51 FR 36425, October 10, 1986) (Porcelain-on-Steel Cooking Ware from Taiwan); Final Determination of Sales At Less Than Fair Value: Certain Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from the Republic of Korea (51 FR 42873, November 26, 1986) (Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from Korea); and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Washington Red Raspberry Commission  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (859 F.2nd. 898, 905 (Fed. Cir. 1988)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, respondent argues that the bags used for home market packing have a number of special features unrelated to shipment: (1) they have built-in handles that facilitate use of a crane to lift the bag into the ladle or furnace of a steel mill; (2) they are constructed of non-permeable polymer material that protects the flux from contaminants in the steel mill environment and can vaporize in the steel melt without toxic emissions or undesirable residues; and (3) they come in varying sizes which allows the customer to control the amount of flux introduced into the steel melt. Respondent claims that its home market customers specifically order the bagged product, and they willingly pay more for it because they perceive that it provides additional value.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, respondent maintains that, because the bags are part of the merchandise purchased by home market customers and their costs are significant relative to the overall manufacturing costs of the product, it must set prices taking into account the SG&amp;A and profit attributable to the bagging which are also significant. However, because the Department does not normally include SG&amp;A and profit in packing or difmer adjustments, respondent contends that the Department's comparison of prices for bagged flux sold in the home market and bulk flux exported to the United States will not account for these factors and will therefore be distortive. Therefore, respondent argues that CV should be used instead of home market prices for purposes of calculating FMV for flux sales.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): DAX closes at highest level since August 1990 WITH pressure on the French franc subsiding yesterday attention remained fixed on Thursday's crucial Buba meeting, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was lifted by a growing conviction among certain sections of traders that the Bundesbank will cut interest rates at Thursday's council meeting. The DAX index gained 23.69 or 1.3 per cent to 1,854.52, its highest level since August 2, 1990. Some analysts noted that given that some of the market's strength has been coming from second and third line issues a period of consolidation may be approaching. In spite of the widespread rate cut optimism there is a conflicting view among some analysts that recent poor economic data - with more expected during the week - leaves the Bundesbank no alternative but to leave rates alone until its return from the summer recess. As Nikko Europe comments in a newsletter released on Friday, 'the money supply figures showing M3 up 7.1 per cent and this week's inflation figures, expected to show a year-on-year increase from 4.2 per cent to 4.4 per cent, further emphasise that, on domestic grounds, an interest rate cut on Thursday cannot be justified'. Earlier yesterday some published west German regional CPI figures came in much as expected. Viag continued to appreciate following Friday's late news that it could take a majority stake in Bayernwerk at what is considered to be a 'bargain price'. The shares gained DM35.00 or 8.5 per cent to DM445.50. Schering was another stock on the move, up 1.8 per cent on the day, after the US authorities gave approval for its multiple sclerosis drug. The shares rose DM15.50 to DM850.00. PARIS breached the 2,000 level as had been expected, having come close towards the end of last week on devaluation hopes. With the currency markets quieter yesterday, the CAC-40 index ended the session 11.18 higher at 2,006.22 in turnover of some FFr2.5bn. Paribas was one of the day's most active issues, advancing to a day and year's high of FFr465 before slipping back slightly to close up FFr13.30 at FFr453.20. Traders could ci te no specific reason for the gain. LVMH lost FFr55 to FFr3,990, but off the day's low of FFr3,970, after disappointing first half figures. ZURICH gained support from a firm dollar and expectations of good half-yearly results from the banks during the current reporting season and the SMI index rose 38.3 or 1.6 per cent to 2,388.8. Nestle, actively traded, rose SFr7 to SFr1,033, while among the banks, UBS bearers rose SFr32 to SFr1,187, CS Holding added SFr85 to SFr2,850 and SBC bearers were SFr5 ahead at a year's high of SFr457. Continued strong demand for cyclicals took Alusuisse registered shares SFr3 higher to a year's peak of SFr533 while Holderbank advanced SFr27 to a 1993 high of SFr764. MILAN edged lower in turnover that shrank to an estimated L250bn from Friday's L300bn, and the Comit index dipped 0.84 to 549.33. However, the slightly firmer tone of the lira and a modest easing of rates at the Bank of Italy's repurchase tender helped shares to pick up from their day's lows. Montedison, the most heavily traded stock, fell L24.3 to L678 ahead of today's meeting of creditors. BRUSSELS finished flat after some late index related selling erased modest gains as currency concerns, high short-term interest rates and worries about budget talks weighed on the market. The Bel-20 index edged 0.16 higher at 1,307.18. GIB, the retailer, representing almost one-seventh of the market's BFr940m turnover, dipped BFr10 to BFr1,256. Clabecq, the steel stock, rose BFr110 or 15.9 per cent to BFr800 after Friday's 16.9 per cent surge. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index gained 1.3 to 119.2 helped by good rises in index heavyweights, Royal Dutch, up Fl 1.90 to Fl 180.30 and Unilever, up Fl 1.80 to Fl 189.90. STOCKHOLM rose on optimism over lower interest rates in the near future which spilled over into the banking sector. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 16.7 or 1.4 per cent to 1,171.2. VIENNA advanced 2.7 per cent to just below its 1993 peak, prompting expectations that the 19-share index could breach the 1,000-level this week, in the absence of profit-taking. The ATX index finished 25.52 ahead at 962.42. ISTANBUL fell almost 4 per cent amid heavy selling in the absence of fresh news to brighten the mood. The composite index shed 388.96 to 9,370.30, after last week's 8.08 per cent decline. Carnegie International notes that the beginning of the first half results season is beginning to produce reasonable outperformance in individual stocks; but with money continuing to tighten and no good news appearing on the political or economic front, the basic direction of the index is likely to remain downwards. TEL AVIV recouped early losses to close strongly ahead as the market reacted to a 2.1 per cent devaluation of the shekel against the dollar. The Mishtanim index gained 2.93 or 1.6 per cent to 186.14, in turnover of Shk185m.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                       FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- July 26                                             THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1236.02    1236.88     1237.16    1238.19 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1291.97    1294.04     1293.60    1295.96  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1238.64    1238.83     1239.12    1240.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1295.26    1293.92     1294.62    1294.91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Jul 23    Jul 22    Jul 21    Jul 20    Jul 19  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1224.42   1217.14   1212.75   1224.85   1235.43 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1279.96   1275.93   1266.97   1275.46   1283.54  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1240.21; 200 - 1295.96 Low/day: 100 - 1236.02 200 - 1291.97  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

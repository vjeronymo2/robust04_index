Here is Defense Minister Cesare Previti:    [Begin Previti recording] We can take part in international  humanitarian and peace operations. If we reach agreement to do  something, we are ready and we have already said so. Reaching  the agreement is the problem. We have tried to speed things up  through the WEU [Western European Union]; there will be another  meeting on Tuesday [21 June]. The French are insisting on a  unilateral operation in which we have no intention of taking  part, I believe. [end recording]</p>

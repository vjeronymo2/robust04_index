			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by VLADIVOSTOK correspondent Vladimir Rozanov: "The </F> Mayor Wants the City To Live by a Charter"]    [Text] The head of the Vladivostok administration,  Viktor Cherepkov, announced in a television address on 9 March  that on 27 March, simultaneously with the elections, he intends  to hold a citywide referendum on two issues: Whether city  residents think it necessary to shift to a single system of  managing the city economy, liquidating rayon structures, and  whether they approve the draft of the Vladivostok Charter,  written by Cherepkov personally. The text of the charter has not  yet been made available to city residents, however.    The city mayor explained the need for a general referendum  on  these two issues by such an important factor as Vladivostok  entering market relations at a time when the city administration  system has outlived itself and is no longer relevant. Viktor  Cherepkov especially emphasized that introducing a centralized  system in such matters as allocation of apartments and tax  collection will allow, as he put it, correct justice to be  achieved.    The Vladivostok Charter also is extremely important in the  new economic conditions and political realities. Viktor  Cherepkov said that city soviet deputies had worked on the  charter earlier, and he continued what they had started,  reducing the deputies' version to five pages. The mayor did not  describe in detail the contents of the draft city charter, only  saying that the charter will delineate the functions of the  executive and representative branches of power in Vladivostok  and the city's relations with kray and republic authorities.  Viktor Cherepkov also said that he refused to put in the draft  charter a provision that the city mayor serves at the same time  as head of the city duma.    State law specialists, commenting on Viktor Cherepkov's  address, told our VLADIVOSTOK correspondent that the city mayor  is most likely attempting to widen his power base, protect  himself in advance from duma interference in the mayoralty's  affairs, and acquire maximum powers. Blessed by a popular vote,  the charter may make the mayor practically absolutely  invulnerable in his confrontation with kray authorities.</p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Candidates take out cover AT LEAST 500 parliamentary candidates are taking out insurance to cover the cost of any legal battles arising from the election campaign. Legal Protection Group, a subsidiary of Sun Alliance, and Careassist, which is owned by Royal Insurance, provide legal expense policies tailored to the needs of candidates. These cover costs arising from libel or defamation claims as well as actions under the Representation of the People Act. So far, LPG - which is selling a policy valid for the period of the campaign  -has received requests from 242 candidates. Careassist, which sells a policy covering all local and parliamentary elections over a 12-month period, says that it has sold a block scheme covering all Liberal Democrat candidates. It also has 300 Conservative and a handful of Labour candidates on its books. LPG is set to pay a Pounds 50,000 claim to finance legal action by Labour candidates who sued Liberal Democrat opponents over a bogus Labour council by-election document in Tower Hamlets, London. The Court of Appeal found in favour of the Liberal Democrats last week. Mr Reg Brown, whose syndicate at Lloyd's has underwritten the LPG policy for 1983 and 1987 general elections, says there have been 45 claims on the policy, most of which are for a few hundred pounds. Mr Stephen Manton, at Careassist, says his company has paid 15 claims since 1986. Most claims arise from actions under the Representation of the People Act, when political parties breach the limits on electoral spending. Premiums are standard for all candidates. LPG is charging a flat Pounds 55 which provides Pounds 50,000 of cover. Careassist's annual policy costs between Pounds 108 and Pounds 130, depending on the size of the excess.</p>

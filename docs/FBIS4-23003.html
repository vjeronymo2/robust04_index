Sergeyeva, Novosibirsk Bioorganic Chemistry Institute at  the Siberian Department of Russia's Academy of Sciences and  Novosibirsk State University; UDC  547.963.32.07:577.113.6+577.113.4]    [Abstract] The use of oligonucleotide receptors containing  alkylating groups in their structure for sequence-specific  nucleic acid modification, usually attached to the terminal  phosphate or 2',3'-cis-diol group and the use of oligonucleotide  derivatives with modifying groups attached to the heterocyclic  base (which may be spatially close to the nucleic acid target)  are discussed, synthesis of  4-(N-methyl-N-2-chlorethylamino)benzyl heptanucleotides  derivatives is described for the first time, and their affine  modification of pentadecanucleotide is investigated. The  heptanucleotides containing an aliphatic amino group at the  5'-terminal attached in the desoxyuridine 5-position through  L-spacers of various length were synthesized according to  Zarytova, Komarova, et al. The phase conjugation  chromatography (OFKh) pattern of the reaction products after the  derivative synthesis and an electrophoresis pattern of the  target alkylation products are plotted. The  4-(N-methyl-N-2-chlorethylamino)benzyl radical (RCl) was added  with the help of a derivative benzaldehyde reaction with the  heptanucleotide amino group. A new type of alkylating  derivatives of oligonucleotides which carry the RCl group in the  C-5 desoxyuridine radical and ensure a high degree of DNA target  modification is produced. U[.sup]LNHRCl[/]CCACTT reagents  (L is -CH[.sub]2[/]-,  -CH[.sub]2[/]OCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-, or  -CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-) are  synthesized and then used to modify the target with an  80-90%  effectiveness. The findings show that the third reagent with the  L=-CH[.sub]2[/]NHCOCH[.sub]2[/]CH[.sub]2[/]-spacer  ensures an almost quantitative modification of the target at one  particular point which is usually not observed for  oligonucleotide derivatives with the RCl radical attached to the  terminal phosphate of ribose's 2',3'-cis-diol group.

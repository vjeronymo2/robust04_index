			<p>BFN     [Text] In a lengthy report to the UN Security Council dated  30 May that was finally circulated early this morning, UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali makes the Security Council  responsible for any decision on the procedure and substance of  the effort to resolve the Cyprus issue. Despite the fact that  Butrus-Ghali clearly blames the lack of an agreement on [Turkish  Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas, the secretary general calls on the  Security Council to study five choices that he proposes to deal  with the situation in Cyprus.    Specifically, the secretary general, who considers the  situation in Cyprus unsatisfactory, noted as the first  alternative the withdrawal of the UN peacekeeping force from the  island and its use elsewhere, because during the past 30 years  it has been proven that there is no political will for a  solution to the Cyprus problem.    The second alternative deals with the change of his mandate  and the assumption of mandatory measures by the international  community to force the intransigent side, as he put it, to be  more flexible and cooperative in the negotiations on the  confidence-building measures.    The third alternative suggests a return to the substance of  the Cyprus issue, specifically to the secretary general's Set of  Ideas.    In his fourth alternative, Butrus-Ghali asks for time to  consult with the Security Council members, the guarantor powers,  the two leaders in Cyprus, and others so that he will have the  flexibility to examine alternatives with significant  consequences.    Finally, the fifth alternative is based on the fact that the  two sides have accepted the package of confidence-building  measures in principle and calls on the international community  to repeat its efforts to achieve an agreement on the  implementation of the measures.    Furthermore, Butrus-Ghali proposes various ways to approach  the issue, including an international conference, a visit by a  Security Council delegation to Cyprus and the region, or new  visits by his special representative. However, the UN secretary  general notes that the process thus far has convinced him that  it is possible to achieve an agreement if there are new changes  to the confidence-building measures. At the same time, he  reaffirms his support for the measures.    In his report, Butrus-Ghali notes that the Security Council  is again faced with a familiar scenario, that is, no agreement  mainly because of the lack of political will on the Turkish  Cypriot side and warns that its way of thinking will have  serious consequences for the Turkish Cypriot community's  prosperity.    The report also says that the UN secretary general  categorically denies the Turkish claim that the original  document on the confidence-building measures of 1 July has been  improved for the benefit of the Greek Cypriots. The secretary  general proceeds with an analytical comparison of each aspect of  the two documents of 1 July and 21 March. In addition, he  submits the two maps of Nicosia Airport and Famagusta.    According to the CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation]  correspondent in New York, the Security Council is expected to  begin deliberations by the end of the week so it can issue a  resolution.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gabi Brunn, Arye Kiesel, Roni Shaqed, and Yuval </F> Peleg]    [Excerpts] Israel is negotiating the PLO demand to release  20 Israeli Arabs sentenced to life terms for terrorism. Among  these prisoners are the murderers of the three soldiers killed  in an IDF [Israel Defense Forces] encampment near Kibbutz Gil'ad  in the attack later called "the night of the pitchforks."  [passage omitted]    Also on the list of candidates for release is Muhammad  Sarawi, a resident of the village of Ibtin near Haifa, who in  1987 hurled a grenade in Haifa's Nordau pedestrian mall,  wounding 25 people, including the child Dan Me'ir, whose leg was  amputated.    PLO representatives to talks with Israel are basing  themselves on the precedent of the "Jibril deal" in 1985, when  Israeli Arabs involved in terrorism were also freed. Senior  politicians in Jerusalem tend to accept the demand to free the  Israeli Arabs. Among them is at least one cabinet minister, as  well as Foreign Ministry officials. As far as is known, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin has still not made up his mind on the  issue.    Knesset Member David Mena' yesterday cabled Rabin warning  against releasing Israeli Arabs who murdered for nationalist  motives. The Shin Bet is also opposed to the release of Israeli  Arabs sentenced to life terms. This opposition was forcefully  expressed in discussions held at the defense establishment and  at government forums. Defense sources said that such a release  would cause a sharp deterioration in the security situation and  create a dangerous precedent.    YEDI'OT AHARONOT has nevertheless learned that parallel to  the tendency to respond partially to the PLO demand on Israeli  Arabs, the possibility of recommending pardoning Jews who  murdered for nationalist reasons and who have already spent many  years in prison has also been raised. The names of David  Ben-Shimol and Yona Avrushmi have come up in this context.</p>

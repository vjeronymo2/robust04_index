This announcement consists of five parts: Part I. Background/Description, Part II. Application Process, Part III. Evaluation Criteria for Award, Part IV. Meetings and Part V. Reporting Requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Part I. Background/Description <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American workers confront an economy in continuous transition. Young people and other first time job seekers must try to find their place in a shifting labor market. Job holders find they must constantly learn new skills. Fewer workers can except to be with a single firm throughout their work life. Employers find it harder to find new workers with up-to-date skills. There is a confusing patchwork of job training/retraining and benefit programs which do not efficiently address work force security and career requirements. There is a clear need for a streamlined One-Stop Career Center system which puts customers first by providing them with the information and access to services they need to make sound career decisions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is committed to improving the quality and delivery of services to its ultimate customers_American workers and their employers. The One-Stop Career Center system is the vehicle for transforming this fragmented training and employment system into a coordinated information and service delivery system for all Americans seeking new jobs, better jobs or first jobs. An essential component within the One-Stop system is an enhanced labor market information system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In fiscal year 1994, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) is using the $50 million Congress appropriated under the Wagner-Peyser Act to begin implementation of a voluntary, national One-Step Career Center system and for first year funding of the American Labor Market Information System (ALMIS). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Ignatenko said  that the number of emergencies caused by human error also  decreased sharply from 14 in 1992 to six in 1993.    He believes this is the result of the implementation of the  state programme of modernisation of nuclear power plants in  Russia and re- training their personnel. However, the lack of  funds to buy necessary spare parts and introduce new  technologies still remains a serious problem.    Ignatenko stressed that last year was very difficult for the  industry. Nuclear power stations are owed by the consumers  about 260 billion roubles for 1993. This forces nuclear plants  to take credits to buy fuel and equipment and pay salaries.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VERDUGO HILLS BOGS DOWN IN SECOND HALF OF 28-7 LOSS  </P> <P> The Dons moved into scoring position on their second possession, but Robert  Servellon's field-goal attempt from 33 yards was blocked.  </P> <P> Mancilla tied the score, 7-7, with 3:13 left in the first half, taking a pitch  from quarterback Eddie Espinoza and running 23 yards for a touchdown.  </P> <P> He scored on a pair of three-yard runs in the second half as Eagle Rock  improved to 4-3, 4-1.  </P> <P> Verdugo Hills managed only 14 yards in the second half and was penalized five  times for 55 yards.  </P> <P> After Alvarado suffered his injury shortly before halftime, "we lost our  momentum," Verdugo Hills Coach Charley Mack said. "He couldn't throw the ball  and that limited our options on offense."  </P> <P> Mack also objected to some of the officials' calls, including the ejection of  offensive lineman Eric McDonagh, who was in a shoving match with opposing  players after an illegal-procedure penalty.  </P> <P> "I don't know what game they (referees) were watching, but it wasn't ours,"  Mack said.  </P></p>

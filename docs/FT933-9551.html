			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Northwest Air settles terms for restructure NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth-largest US carrier, announced it has reached final agreement over the restructuring of its finances and established new labour contracts. The arrangements are effective after August 1. On the financial side, Northwest's bankers have revised the repayment terms on a Dollars 1.3bn term loan. Northwest must now repay Dollars 77m in 1994, Dollars 131m in 1995, and Dollars 185m in 1996. Repayment terms on a second, special term loan of Dollars 250m, provided last winter, have also been adjusted. The new schedule requires the carrier to repay Dollars 15m in 1993, Dollars 14m in 1994, Dollars 24m in 1995, and Dollars 34m in 1996. Owners of Northwest's series A and series B preferred stock have agreed to a permanent dividend reduction from 14 to 8 per cent, while redemption dates have been extended to the years 2002 and 2003. In addition, three suppliers to the airline - Airbus, General Electric and United Technologies - are accepting revised repayment schedules. On the labour side, the airline's employees have agreed to make wage and benefit concessions worth Dollars 886m over three years, and will receive units of preferred stock in return. The size of the stock grant will be determined by the extent of wage reduction. In aggregate, the employees' preferred stock can be converted for a 37.5 per cent interest in the company's ordinary equity, or redeemed for an amount equal to the cost reductions at the end of 10 years. Finally, Northwest's board will be expanded from 13 to 15 members, and new directors representing the three largest labour groups - the pilots, machinists and the flight attendants - will be appointed 'in the near future'.</p>

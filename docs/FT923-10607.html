			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: New perspectives for Algerian gas - Francis Ghiles explains how capacity may yet rise to meet demand THE RUSH of international oil companies signing exploration deals with Sonatrach could not have come at a better time for Algeria's state hydrocarbons monopoly. So high is the chance of any company finding gas rather than oil that it was only recently, when exploration terms for gas were improved to an acceptable level, that major oil companies decided the risk was worth taking. Sonatrach is faced with demands for gas beyond its present capacity. In the words of a senior Sonatrach executive: 'We are sold out, but people are asking for more'. The new hydrocarbons law passed last December was the personal achievement of Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the former Minister of Energy, who has now left the government. The exploration companies, which have yet to spend any money as a result of their new licences, will no doubt want to be reassured that Mr Laoussine's policies will be endorsed by Mr Hassan Mufti, the recently appointed minister of energy, and by Mr Belaid Abdesslam, the new prime minister. Nor is the political uncertainty limited to cabinet level. The blowing up of the telephone cable linking the eastern town of Constantine to Algeria's second most important oil and gas terminal at Skikda could be an ominous event for the country's energy revenues. The damaging of gas pipelines and facilities by Islamic dissidents would be significantly more costly. Over the past 12 months Sonatrach has signed exploration agreements with Occidental Petroleum, Total, Arco, Mobil, BP and Phillips Petroleum. Apart from the political factor - and this is the big conditional - nearly everything else about Algeria is attractive. Conditions have changed for the better on two fronts simultaneously. Algerian terms for exploration have become more rewarding for gas and external demand for Algerian gas has grown beyond Sonatrach's current ability to supply it. Companies searching for oil and finding gas now have a realistic chance of getting a return on their exploration investment. As a result some companies might be willing specifically to look for gas. Another dimension of the new law is that it creates investment opportunities for foreign companies able to enhance production from Algeria's existing oil and gas fields. Rates of recovery had fallen below 20 per cent because Sonatrach lacked the same degree of international experience gained by global operators. Like many countries in the 1970s Algeria's drive to assert its own sovereignty over all oil and gas production excluded it from the advanced technology that less closed third world countries such as Indonesia were able to enjoy. Since the departure of the hardline Mr Belkacem Nabi, successive Algerian oil ministers have increasingly recognised the mutual benefit to be gained from working together with international oil companies and sharing the benefits of their combined resources. Sonatrach is also lucky in one other respect. Mr James Ball, director of Gas Matters, points out that in a world where greenfield liquefied natural gas projects cost Dollars 4bn for a couple of trains of LNG able to produce 5bn cubic metres of gas a year, the prospect of increasing capacity by 10bn cu m a year for half this outlay 'must be as frightening to competitors as it is comforting to potential customers'. Through a renovation and upgrading project being carried out by the same three companies that built the LNG plants in the late 1960s and 1970s, MW Kellogg and Bechtel of the US and Sofregaz of France will increase capacity at LNG plants in Arzew and Skikda from 19bn cu m to 32bn cu m a year. Meanwhile, the capacity of the nine-year-old trans-Mediterranean pipeline which bring gas to the Italian mainland through Tunisia and the Straits of Sicily is being doubled. After the work is completed in 1995, Sonatrach is set to double its exports to Italy to 26bn cu m a year by the turn of the century. Further sales to traditional Italian clients such as Snam, the state gas pipeline company, and the more recent customer Enel, the state electricity generating authority, could push the figure up to 30bn cu m a year by the year 2000. Italy is the most exciting but not the only market. Agreements have already been signed to supply LNG to Turkey and Greece, while newcomers such as Portugal and Germany have expressed interest in buying Algerian gas. The collapse of the US market for LNG will free some extra supply for such customers and potential central European buyers. Exports to Spain are also set to increase and supplies are to reach Morocco for the first time. Spain, a long established buyer of Algerian LNG, recently committed itself to continuing imports at the current level once the gas pipeline scheduled to be built through Morocco and across the Straits of Gibraltar is completed. It is to supply Spain with 6bn-7bn cu m a year from 1997. The dramatic rise in Spain's gas requirement is largely driven by a policy decision to freeze the nuclear programme in favour of gas-fired power. A further 1bn cu m will be bought by Morocco. In addition to traditional oil and gas sales, a significant number of spin-offs have produced new joint venture opportunities. One of the first such ventures, formed after the shift in Algerian investment policy began, was that between L'Air Liquide, Air Products and Sonatrach to extract helium from the gas stream going into the LNG plants. A much larger joint venture is the expansion of liquid petroleum gas export facilities at Arzew. It encompasses the expansion of the existing 'Jumbo' LPG plant and the increasing of production as a result of an upstream field enhancement project in which Total is playing a key role. The political uncertainty which besets Algeria today comes at a most inopportune time for its gas industry. Its major competitor in European gas markets was the Soviet Union, which in its new fragmented state, is not the most reassuring and attractive prospect to western buyers. It is beset by political and commercial problems that could raise far greater obstacles than those faced and threatened in Algeria. Europe's other major gas suppliers, Norway and the Netherlands, are not aggressively selling. The only impediment to Algeria climbing through the window of opportunity would now appear to be one of Algerian making.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            ALGERIAN GAS EXPORT COMMITMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES                    (BILLON CUBIC METRES A YEAR)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Buyer                          LNG                   Pipeline                                now   possible    firm     possible                               firm     1995      1995       1997  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Gaz de France                 10.4     10.4 Enagas                         3.8      3.8                   6-7 Distrigaz (Belgium)            4.5      4.5 Distrigas (US)                1.25      1.3 Trunkline (US)                 1.0 Shell Cove Point (US)          1.8 Botas (Turkey)                 2.0      3-4 DEPA (Greece)                  0.7      0.7 Portugal                                2.0 Italy                                 1.4-3     25.25       26-29 Germany                                 4-5 Slovenia                                         0.6          1.0 Tunisia                                          0.5          1.0 Morocco                                                       1.0 Others                                  3-9 Total                        25.89  34.1-44     26.35   35.5-39.5  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Gas Matters  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

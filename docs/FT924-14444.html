			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Merivale Moore dives Pounds 13m into the red MR GRENVILLE Dean, chair-man of Merivale Moore, the property group, attributed the 'debility of the company' - of which he controls 'about 20 per cent' - to 'the fraught and failing UK economy'. The company plunged from pre-tax profits of Pounds 615,000 to losses of Pounds 13m in the year to June 30 and its net asset value fell from 245.5p to 77p. No final dividend is being paid (7.75p), leaving the total at just 1p (10.5p) for the year. The greater part of the losses - Pounds 9.63m (Pounds 1.23m) - were exceptional write-downs in respect of property values. He said that net debt was about Pounds 50m, roughly the same as last time, although in September 1991 the company bought 130 luxury residential flats in London's St John's Wood from Norwich Union for Pounds 20m. So far 50 had been sold. This represented a dilemma for the company - repay the debt or trade out of the recession. Mr Dean said his policy was a mixture of both, but that purchases were likely to be one-off and only if they were of very good value. Otherwise, the priority was to reduce the debt and, to this end, some low-yielding residential 'family silver' had been sold. Mr Dean suspected that there had been some 'technical breaches' in its banking facilities as cover had weakened, but that its banks were 'quite happy'. Turnover was halved to Pounds 30.3m (Pounds 78.8m) and net rental income was almost halved to Pounds 2.51m (Pounds 4.13m) after asset disposals. Total income emerged at Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 14.1m). Operating losses were Pounds 3.35m (profits Pounds 1.84m). Below the line there was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 7.74m (Pounds 148,000) relating to write-downs on long-term investment properties. This resulted in retained losses of Pounds 19.7m (profits Pounds 169,000). Losses per share totalled 144p (earnings 12.7p).</p>

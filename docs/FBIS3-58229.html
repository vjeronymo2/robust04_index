Bill Clinton was very  firm: The United States is ready to support NATO air strikes in  Bosnia if the situation in Sarajevo among Muslim enclaves  besieged by the Serbs does not improve. However, the United  Nations must give the go-ahead. The issue will probably be  discussed in detail this evening.    The famous Partnership for Peace initiative was the main  topic of talks this afternoon. It was signed by 22 countries,  including Russia and the former East Bloc countries. Willy van  der Vort has just spoken to Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who  talked about the two pillars of this Partnership for Peace,  security and economy:    [Begin recording] [Dehaene] I believe that the future of the  East European countries as democracies will depend much more on  economic evolution than on military alliances. Indeed, I  believe that if the new democratic structures cannot bring about  economic welfare, which means a step backwards economically,  these democracies will never make it. It is clear that  partnership with the European Union, which is first and foremost  an economic partnership, is as important as partnership with  NATO.    [Van der Vort] Are you saying that it is as important, or  rather, do you have the feeling that you have added an extra  card to your game, but that what is important will be done by  the European Union?    [Dehaene] I think that the answer is both: Partnership with  the European Union, with the prospect of the countries of East  Europe participating in the European Union, also carries  consequences concerning defense solidarity.    [Van der Vort] But the Partnership includes some conditions  which may slow down the process enabling these Central European  countries to join the Atlantic alliance. Are you not under the  impression that this will displease Central European countries?    [Dehaene] I do not believe that the Partnership contains  conditions which may slow down the process. On the contrary, I  think that the Partnership for Peace contains conditions and an  organization which should facilitate evolution toward the  participation of these countries in NATO. Collaboration on the  military and strategic levels, which is included in this  Partnership for Peace, goes further than some may think, and I  believe that it will be very important, during the meeting in  Prague between President Clinton and [words indistinct] with the  countries of the [word indistinct], that he should clearly  explain the contents of the concrete proposal.

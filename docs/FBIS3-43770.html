			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Garcia Bires, Angolan ambassador to </F> Namibia, by Graham Hopwood; place and date not given]    [Text] [Hopwood] The present Lusaka talks are taking a  long time to produce results. Doe you think that real progress  is being made and will the talks lead to a lasting peace?    [Bires] The talks have now restarted and according to the  agenda are going to discuss the political spectrum. I believe  that the discussions will take some more time. If there is good  faith from UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] the results will be favourable. We don't have a set  time to end the negotiations. We want to discuss in a very  serious way as we don't want misinterpretations of the agreement  we eventually reach. So it will take time -- it's not a problem  for us. We want the peace to be lasting of course and that will  benefit the Frontline States and the SADC [South African  Development Coordination] countries.    [Hopwood] The UN special representative has appealed to both  sides not to launch attacks while the talks are ongoing. What  is the government's position on this?    [Bires] We are on the defensive (militarily) to facilitate  humanitarian aid to different parts of the country. There is no  need for Angolans to die while we are discussing a lasting  peace. It's very unfortunate that UNITA launched some attacks in  Bengo, Cuando Cubango and both north and south Lunda provinces  and at Malanje and Cabinda. Naturally the government has the  right to defend itself.    [Hopwood] It has been claimed that the Angolan government  has  requested a South African company to supply former SADF [South  African Defense Force] soldiers to help the army? As far as you  know is there any truth in the company (Executive Outcomes)  claims?    [Bires] It's not true -- because the Angolan armed forces  were formed according to the principles in the Bicesse agreement  (the 1991 Angolan peace accord). There are former UNITA  elements in the army, even commanders who were UNITA. If we had  foreigners in the army we would be denounced. Today we are  capable of forming an army without foreign support -- except in  the fields of logistics, the navy and the air force.    [Hopwood] Is any aid to UNITA in the form of material goods  and personnel passing through Namibia on its way to the UNITA  strongholds?    [Bires] I don't believe that. I don't think that Namibian  soil is being used as a transition place for aid to UNITA. The  Namibian government is taking measures to avoid weapons being  directed to Angola and is enforcing the sanctions adopted by the  UN Security Council.    It is true that UNITA is receiving support from the  extremist  rightwing in South Africa via Zaire -- there is evidence of  that. That is why UNITA is putting its vehicles and weapons in  the north of the country and on the eastern border. They cannot  gain such aid through the South. It was after the independence  of Namibia that Savimbi chose Zaire to launch atrocities inside  the country. As you can see Malanje, Lunda north and south and  Zaire province itself are near Zaire. Further south in Cuando  Cubango and Bie provinces there is not a lot of pressure  compared to the areas near Zaire.    [Hopwood] Is there concrete evidence of South African  support?    [Bires] There are some coordinated rightwing groups in  South Africa supplying aid -- those extremists who were fighting  the ANC are the same who are continuing to give support to  UNITA. There is hard evidence for instance of the violations of  airspace and the presence of heavy artillery, armoured cars and  other war material in the north.    Material that was in south-eastern Angola is now  concentrated  in the north of Angola. All of this cannot go through by land.  It is being transferred by air. Airspace violations have been  confirmed by Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia.    [Hopwood] Is there evidence of mercenaries assisting UNITA?    [Bires] In the past we captured whites working with UNITA.  Today there are still whites assisting UNITA in strategic  areas. There is evidence that there are mercenaries -- there  are reports from local people that they were attacked by whites.  There are also Zairean mercenaries -- Lingala and French  speakers among UNITA forces -- according to local people.    [Hopwood] Presuming there is a settlement could the  government accept Jonas Savimbi taking up a position in a new  coalition government?    [Bires] Let me clarify some things. There have been  negotiations with UNITA for the government which came out of the  multi-party elections. UNITA participated in multi-party  meetings before the election took place. UNITA contributed to  the constitution and the electoral law. So a coalition existed.  UNITA won seventy seats in the National Assembly.    The discussions that are taking place now are seeking to  create the necessary conditions for the second round of  Presidential elections. That is the immediate objective.    According to the constitution and other laws if Mr. Savimbi  is to be given a status he may be deserves, then it should be a  compromise according to the legal system of the country and the  wish of the Angolan government.    [Hopwood] How has the present war affected the embassy's  efforts to promote economic, cultural and other ties between  Namibians and Angolans?    [Bires] Of course war brings destabilisation to economic and  cultural ties. Unfortunately the war is affecting the country  -- reducing the economy and there is not much opportunity for  both peoples to promote economic and cultural links.    Nevertheless there are very positive ongoing relations in  some areas -- fisheries, public works and the Epupa project for  example. These are some of the efforts being made by both  governments. Once we get a relative peace there will be a  qualitative jump forward in relations.    [Hopwood] How many Angolans are living in Namibia? Does the  Embassy experience any problems with divisions in the Angolan  community here, i.e. between UNITA and government supporters?    [Bires] There are many Angolans here -- hundreds and  hundreds. It's not a phenomenen that results from the war, but  from the movement of people between the south of Angola and the  north of Namibia.    At the moment there are four different groups in the Angolan  community here. The first group are those who voluntarily  decided to stay in Namibia before Angolan independence. The  second group is here through family connections. The third are  those who came here in 1975 (after Angola's independence). And  the fourth are those who are coming in from the 1980s until now.    We don't distinguish Angolans by political affiliation -- we  simply treat all Angolans as Angolans. If they have a political  role it is with their own parties and not with the Embassy.    In 1978 the then Angolan government opted for a policy of  national reconciliation. After ten years elements belonging to  the FNLA [Front for the National Liberation of Angola] became  involved in the structures of government and other institutions.  Some Angolans from different parties were offered posts in  government as ministers and so on. And the there was the full  opening after the Bicesse Accords. So that's why I emphasise  there is no difference in being Angolans of UNITA, MPLA [Popular  Movement for the Liberation of Angola] or FNLA.    Of course there are fears. As an example UNITA has been  refusing to transfer Angolan citizens from Jamba to Namibia for  medical treatment. But we represent the Angolan government and  are here to defend all Angolans.    [Hopwood] Do you think that the situation in Angola is  getting enough international attention, especially compared with  other world trouble spots such as Bosnia and Somalia.    [Bires] I don't think so -- what is going on in Angola is  sometimes forgotten. The Bicesse agreements were reached  because of the efforts of the UN and OAU. We have a special  representative of UN Secretary General for Angola. Yet there  was a lack of personnel, material and other aspects to direct a  stable transition process. Our country is big -- some 1,246,000  sq km. But the assistance programme that was prepared by the UN  for Angola was ten times less than the assistance sent to  Cambodia for instance. The humanitarian assistance for Angola  is twenty times less than what is being sent to  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The UN was supposed to play an important role, but nothing  is  being done at all. One thousand are dying daily -- the  assistance is not sufficient. I do not think the international  community has assumed its responsibility for Angola.    [Hopwood] Are you satisfied with the Namibian government's  stance of neutrality on the Angolan conflict?    [Bires] Namibia has not taken a neutral attitude in  classical terms. Until very recently Namibian soil was being  used to send humanitarian aid to the Angolan people. In Namibia  there have been a lot of workshops and conferences looking at  Angolan issues. Blondin Beye (the UN special representative) was  here to inform President Nujoma of the Angolan situation. I  think the Namibian government is giving all moral and diplomatic  support to the Angolan government -- which we appreciate very  much.    Namibia is party to the efforts of the Frontline States. Our  President was here recently to discuss Angola with President  Nujoma and we asked for continued diplomatic and moral support.  Namibia is being active in the application of sanctions against  UNITA.    [Hopwood] Finally, there many obvious links which tie  Namibians and Angolans together. What is your vision for future  Angolan-Namibian cooperation?    [Bires] I think it will be a very dynamic cooperation. In  terms of communications and road transport -- these are suitable  areas for cooperation. We have a common coastline which is rich  for fishing. We think the fishing industry can be an area for  mutual cooperation between our two countries. Angola and  Namibia can exchange experience in the mining of diamonds and  copper. We have rivers bordering our two countries where  various joint projects can be undertaken. The EC and the Nordic  countries have expressed interest in using the Kunene river  basin for various projects. In a time of peace we can change  the physical spectrum of the sub-region.</p>

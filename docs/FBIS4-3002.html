			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 15 (CNA) -- A ranking police official  on Friday [15 April] denied the US accusation that Taiwan has  become a drug transit center.    Lu Yu-chun, director-general of the National Police  Administration, said that from 1990 through 1993, police here  seized a total of 1,092 kilograms of heroin and 3,566 kilograms  of amphetamines worth a combined street value of billions of US  dollars. "Without the police crackdown, those drugs would have  been circulated either in Taiwan or re-exported to other  countries," he said.    The US State Department submitted the 1993 International  Narcotics Control Strategy Report to Congress earlier in the  month, accusing Taiwan of allowing the production of illicit  amphetamines and of increasingly playing a role in the  laundering of drug money.    According to the report, Taiwan has become an important  Southeast Asian transit center for heroin. It said movement of  the drugs is difficult to detect because of Taiwan's heavy  merchant marine traffic.    Wang Chun, director of the Bureau of Criminal Investigation,  admitted that more efforts need to be taken in the fight against  drug smuggling and more money budgeted for the purpose. Only  NT$2.8 million [new Taiwan dollars] (US$106,060) is used by  Taiwan police to combat drug trafficking each year, as compared  with US$12 billion appropriated by the United States.    He also said Taiwan needs to change the law that treats drug  addicts as criminals rather than as patients so that they can  get help to kick their habits.    Local police seized an average of three or four kilograms of  drugs each year before 1989. But the figure rose to 154  kilograms in 1991 and a stunning 810 kilograms in 1993.    Police in the central Taiwan County of Chiayi in a raid on  May 11 [date as received] seized 336 kilograms of high-grade  heroin, prompting Premier Lien Chan to announce a nationwide  campaign against drug smuggling.</p>

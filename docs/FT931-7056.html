			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers talk on the radio Japanese manufacturer Sharp has launched the first personal organiser with a touch screen and the ability to communicate with another organiser by radio. By touching icons on the screen of the IQ-9000 different functions can be carried out - calculations, filing or word processing. And sketches drawn on the screen can be used to annotate written text - a map could accompany an address, for example. The infra-red link enables data to be transferred between one IQ and another up to 80cm away. The proprietary software also enables the gadget, which sells for Pounds 349.99, to send data to a fax machine or modem. Sharp: Japan, 06 621 1221; UK, 071 493 8258.</p>

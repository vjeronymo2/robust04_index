			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Increased flexibility in the selection of a reporting currency may raise significant issues with respect to how the foreign private issuer's underlying transactions should be measured. The Commission invites comment on two measurement approaches, which are described below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Approach A, the issuer would measure separately its own transactions, and those of each of its material operations (for example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) that is included in the issuer's consolidated financial statements and located in a non-hyperinflationary environment, using the particular currency of the primary economic environment in which the issuer or the operation conducts its business. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Financial statement amounts so determined would be translated to the reporting currency using the methodology that is prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting currency. Under that method, (a) all balance sheet amounts are translated into the reporting currency at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date, (b) all revenues, expenses, gains, and losses are translated at the exchange rate existing at the time of the transaction or, if appropriate, a weighted average of the exchange rates during the period or year, and (c) all the translation effects of exchange rate changes are included as a separate component (``cumulative translation adjustment'') of shareholders' equity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An issuer with a material operation in a hyperinflationary environment would measure the transactions of the operation in the reporting currency pursuant to SFAS 52, except that no reconciliation to that method would be required in some circumstances if the proposal relating to issuers with operations in hyperinflationary environments, discussed in Section III of this release, is adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Approach B, all transactions of the issuer and its subsidiaries would be measured (or remeasured if not so measured initially) using the reporting currency, except that transactions of each of its material foreign operations (for example, branch, division, subsidiary, or joint venture) included in the consolidated financial statements and located in a non-hyperinflationary environment would be measured using the particular currency of the primary economic environment in which the foreign operation conducts its business. Financial statement amounts determined for the material foreign operations of the issuer would be translated using the methodology prescribed by SFAS 52 for translation of financial statements from a functional currency to a reporting currency, as described above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under both approaches, the effects of exchange rate changes between transaction date and settlement date of transactions denominated in a currency other than the currency of measurement would be included in income. Monetary assets and liabilities of the issuer and its operations that are not denominated in the currency of measurement would be translated at the exchange rate at the balance sheet date with the effects of exchange rate changes included in income. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Neither approach A nor B affects accounting for foreign currency transactions as defined in SFAS 52. The Commission is not proposing to revise, and is not considering revision of the requirements with respect to, accounting for foreign currency transactions under SFAS 52.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Approach A, the reporting currency is treated as a currency of display, with no currency exchange gains or losses recognized in income solely as a result of the selection of a particular reporting currency. A hypothetical issuer with operations in each of three (non-hyperinflationary) countries would depict the same relationships ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> return on assets or equity, debt to equity ratio, gross profit margin, turnover ratios) in its annual financial statements, regardless of where its parent company is domiciled or which reporting currency that it selects. Determinations of ``lower of cost or market'' and ``net realizable value'' which are necessary under GAAP with respect to assets of the issuer and its component operations will be made in the currency of that operation's primary economic environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Approach B, the effects of changing exchange rates between the reporting currency and any other currency in which monetary assets and liabilities of the issuer's parent company and of its similarly domiciled subsidiaries are denominated would be reflected as a component of income (``transaction gain or loss''). Determinations of ``lower of cost or market'' and ``net realizable value'' which are necessary under GAAP with respect to assets of the issuer's parent company and similarly domiciled subsidiaries will be made in the reporting currency, while these determinations with respect to foreign operations will be made in the currency of that operation's primary economic environment. A hypothetical issuer with operations in each of three countries could depict different financial statement relationships ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> return on assets or equity, debt to equity ratio, gross profit margin, turnover ratios), depending on both factors_the country in which its parent company is domiciled and the reporting currency that it selects, unless the issuer has an immaterial amount of nonmonetary assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment is requested as to which approach would better meet the needs of issuers and investors. Commenters should indicate whether one approach or the other should be mandated or prohibited under particular circumstances; and whether particular disclosures, in addition to an explanation of the accounting policy followed, should be required. Commenters should consider whether an issuer that distributes financial statements stated in more than one currency in different markets, either by election or mandate of particular jurisdictions, should be required to use one method or the other in those financial statements; or whether additional disclosures should be required. Commenters should consider whether additional guidance concerning translation to the selected reporting currency is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

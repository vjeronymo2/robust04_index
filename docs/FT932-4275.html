			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Analysts cool on independent bank suggestion CITY ANALYSTS were less than impressed by Mr Norman Lamont's call for an independent central bank. Although many are in favour of rescuing control of monetary policy from politicians' hands, the response to yesterday's speech was that once again the UK was searching for a panacea to its enduring problem of inflation. 'Nigel Lawson made a similar plea when he resigned, but I am afraid it misses the point,' said Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist at Kleinwort Benson. 'What you really need is not so much a constitutional change which allows for an independent central bank, but an aversion to inflation on behalf of the population.' One fear was that an independent central bank would become to the 1990s, what entry to the European exchange rate was to the 1980s. 'In the late 1980s, everyone thought that ERM entry would be the answer to inflation,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. 'I think it is rather depressing that we are again looking for a holy grail. In the end it all boils down to whether we have the right policies or not, and an independent central bank isn't going to change that.' This view was echoed by Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburgs. 'I am not sure that an institutional change will solve the UK's underlying macroeconomic problems,' he said. 'An independent central bank would help, but it isn't necessarily the panacea for inflation that people think it is.' Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Global Markets said it was remarkable how retired chancellors appeared to see the attraction of handing over monetary control to an independent body as soon as they left office. 'It probably would be an advantage,' he said. 'But I think the advantages are grossly over done.' Even an independent central bank would have to earn its own credibility, said Ms Ruth Lea, chief economist at Mitsubishi Bank. 'Just having one does not automatically prove your credibility as a low inflation country.' Analysts are still unsure about how to assess the views of the new chancellor, Mr Kenneth Clarke. 'He is still an enigma,' said Mr Bill Martin, chief economist at UBS. 'I think he will control public spending, tax areas that are not politically sensitive, fiddle the PSBR figures, and hope that growth does the rest of the work for him.'</p>

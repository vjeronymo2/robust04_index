			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Labour left seeks ways to block election of Blair Mr Tony Blair's runaway lead in Labour's leadership election has prompted an attempt to forge a broad-left coalition against the party's dominant modernisers. The hard-left Campaign group and leftwing members of the largely moderate Tribune group have called a meeting to discuss ways of blocking Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary. Leftwing MPs said the weekend meeting, organised by the Tribune newspaper, would be the 'biggest and most ecumenical' gathering of the Labour left for years. The meeting will be attended by senior trade unionists, including critics of the modernisers such as Mr John Edmonds, leader of the GMB general union, and Ms Margaret Prosser, national organiser of the TGWU. Speakers will include Mr John Prescott, who is contesting both the leadership and deputy leadership on a traditional socialist platform, and prominent supporters of Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader. Mrs Beckett, whose support is mainly on the hard left, will be attending a conference of European socialist leaders in Corfu. A moderate leftwinger said: 'There is a feeling that the left has been very weak, and that it needs to get together and discuss its policies and organise together. The leadership contest has provided a trigger for that.' Serious contacts between Campaign and leftwing Tribunites started in November, when modernist supporters of Mr Blair blocked the election of two leftwingers as officers of the Tribune group. The contacts were accelerated after the publication of nominations for the leadership, which showed that three-quarters of Tribune mem-bers and five of the group's six officers backed Mr Blair. Leftwing members of Tribune, who until recently formed a majority, say the group has abandoned its traditional role as the main guardian of the party's socialist values. They have also been encouraged to seek an alliance with the hard left by the election of two younger MPs - Mr Malcolm Chisholm and Mr Alan Simpson - as Campaign's chairman and secretary. The change of leadership is said to have freed Campaign from the ideological baggage bequeathed by influential older MPs such as Mr Tony Benn and Mr Dennis Skinner.</p>

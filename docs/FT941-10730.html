			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Observer: Fat tome One big problem faces Finland's new president, Martti Ahtisaari - will he be able to use the recently built library in the new official presidential residence in Helsinki? The library's architect obviously subscribes to the myth that all Finns are slimline, thanks to their predilection for winter sports. The spiral stairway to the library's top floor is correspondingly narrow. But the amply proportioned Ahtisaari admits that the only form of sport he enjoys is taking a sauna. Will he be able to squeeze his way up the stairs? Ahtisaari thinks he will - so as long as he takes a deep breath. But which state president has time for reading anyway?</p>

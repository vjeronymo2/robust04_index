			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Sauce of inflation Sir, Recent Royal Mint adverts reminding punters that the anniversary Pounds 2 coin issue will cease at the end of September prompts the suggestion that the issue of a permanent Pounds 2 piece is long overdue. On the other side of the Channel, French FFr20 and German DM5 coins have been in circulation for more than two years. Bottom-line inflation may be 'only' 2.5 per cent, but Pounds 1 is now a paltry sum compared with its purchasing power when sterling was first decimalised in 1971. Then, many urged a basic unit based on 10 old shillings, complaining that a Pounds 1 unit was too large. There are still those who complain of the non-availability of a Pounds 1 note south of the border (Hadrian's Wall not the Rio Grande). This is notwithstanding that it will not even buy two units of my regular measure of inflation - a 228g bottle of HP Sauce which remains unaltered in size, shape and nature of contents since the end of the first world war. What cost 4d (Pounds 0.0167) in 1934 now retails, 60 years on, for about Pounds 0.58, a 35 times price increase, approximately. David Levaggi, 4 Grosvenor Street, Bury, Lancs BL9 9BJ</p>

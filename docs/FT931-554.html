			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: French majority is opposition too SO LARGE is France's conservative majority that it threatens to provide the country with both its government and its effective opposition. That is the private fear behind the public calls for unity-in-victory by Mr Jacques Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, respectively the leaders of the RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF. Mathematically, the conservative majority can withstand some centrifugal tendences without endangering the new government's life. The RPR now has 247 seats, the UDF 213 and there are 24 independent right-wingers in the National Assembly. Some of the latter will join one or other group. The National Front's loss of its one deputy removes the only potential thorn in the government's right flank from outside. In all, the centre-right will have 484 deputies nominally in its camp when the new parliament opens on Friday, nearly 200 more than it needs for an absolute majority. That is precisely the problem. There is no prospect of a parliamentary defeat to keep the majority in line, while there is no shortage of issues on which it can divide - uncomfortably high interest rates, unpalatable spending cuts, policy on Europe, and even the position of President Francois Mitterrand himself. The factiousness is greatest inside the UDF, which for convenience is usually described as a single party when it is in fact a federation of five parties. Sunday's vote was a sweet and sour experience for Mr Giscard d'Estaing. Sweet, because never before had the UDF gone over the 200-seat mark in its 15-year history. Sour, because the RPR did even better, thereby dashing Mr Giscard d'Estaing's openly-expressed hope that the UDF would match the RPR and so shake the latter's image as the senior partner in French conservative politics. If the UDF had beaten the RPR in seats and provided the new prime minister from within its ranks, the perquisites of power would have probably been enough to weld it into a single parliamentary party. As it is, Mr Giscard d'Estaing yesterday reluctantly had to endorse Mr Edouard Balladur, the RPR dauphin, as the natural candidate for prime minister. Today the UDF leader faces the difficult task of trying to persuade the disparate factions which make up the federation's 213 new deputies to function as one group in the Palais Bourbon, the classical structure which houses the national assembly. In the last parliament, the CDS centrists had their own whip and operated as a separate group. Now that they have gained an extra 10 seats, pushing their strength up to 60, it will be hard to dissuade the CDS to abandon its relative autonomy. If the CDS stays separate, the UDF's largest member, the Republican party - which has seen its strength nearly double from 58 to 106 deputies - may also break away. But on key economic and foreign issues, the RPR has deeper policy fissures than the UDF, even though administratively it functions as a single machine. The mischievous Mr Philippe Seguin, one of the leading Gaullist campaigners against Maastricht, underlined this yesterday, saying he planned to 'contribute as much as possible to the diversity' of the new government majority. So, the new majority may prove a more effective opposition to its own government than the much-depleted Socialists.  -------------------------------------------------------- THE RIGHT ROMPS TO POWER: FINAL RESULTS  -------------------------------------------------------- The Left Party                   % National Vote*            seats  -------------------------------------------------------- Socialists                    28.25                    54 Communists                     4.61                    23  --------------------------------------------------------                             **36.18                    93  -------------------------------------------------------- The Right Party                   % National Vote*            seats  -------------------------------------------------------- RPR: Rassemblement pour la Republique (Gaullists)                   28.27                   247 UDF: Union pour la Democratie Francaise (Center-Right)                25.84                   213 Other Right                    3.56                    24 National Front                 5.66                     0  --------------------------------------------------------                             **63.33                   484  -------------------------------------------------------- Total number of seats: 577 Electorate: 37.5m * Second round (March 28) ** Omits minimal vote for ecologists and fring candidates  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

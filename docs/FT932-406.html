			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Velcro tap-dancing - June in Buffalo The city of Buffalo, at the western edge of New York state, has a distinguished recent history as a centre for new music. Morton Feldman taught at the university, and established short summer courses for composers that now go on as 'June in Buffalo'. Student composers come from around the US and beyond, to learn from senior colleagues - David Felder (Feldman's successor), Donald Erb, Bernard Rands and Charles Wuorinen this year - and to have the rare chance of working with an ensemble of highly skilled musicians. One part-concert conducted by Harvey Sollberger was exemplary. Badly composed music didn't work; good pieces - his own hair-raising 'The Advancing Moment', or a string nonet by Jason Uenchi - did. Erb was a particularly heartening, if also a monitory presence. He played tapes of his two most recent orchestral pieces, 'Ritual Observances' and his Violin Concerto, and talked freely about his musical loves (Mozart, romanticism, jazz) and methods - about how 'Ritual Observances' grew as a four-movement symphony out of motivic cells from the interrupted 'Lacrimosa' that was Mozart's last creative effort, or how the concerto was similarly rivetted on a four-note pattern. But he is no Webern. The thrust, the boldness, the freedom and the colour are all American: his own description of himself as an abstract expressionist was close to the mark. Now how, he wondered, were these eager students he was talking to going to get on in a world increasingly set on instant gratification? Where was the place for the robust individual in, as he put it, the age of sleaze? One answer is simple: safe in the ivory tower. The problem that faces such events as 'June in Buffalo' is that, while ostensibly helping to train the next generation of composers, their real function is to bring on the next generation of professors of composition. This is sad for the world outside, but probably not so damaging to those within university composition departments if, as at Buffalo, there is room for the oddball not only among students but on the staff. Paul Elwood, a member of the Buffalo faculty, presented himself as 'velcro tap-dance soloist' in his 'Edgard Varese in the Gobi Desert', a piece that managed to be funny, touching and atmospheric. Velcro tap-dancing creates noise when the velcro-soled shoe lifts off the carpet ground: with amplification the expert soloist is able, through executing hectic stomps and slow turns in Tai Chi style, to create vicious tears and exquisitely protracted squeezings. These were accompanied by piano and percussion sextet, the latter doubling as chanters, clappers and bird-whistlers in what was a deeply serious dada ceremony, by no means unfitting for the composer held in homage. One wonders what size Varese took in shoes. The principal concert was devoted to just two 20-minute orchestral pieces, Felder's percussion concerto 'Between' and Wuorinen's 'Bamboula Squared', for orchestra with tape interventions suggesting some hybrid of honky-tonk piano, cymbalum and a few dozen stretched rubber bands. It was a typically spry piece, with late Stravinsky in the background. Felder's music (a duet for flautist and computer, descending from piccolo screams to the cool dark of the bass flute, was also played during the festival) is more in the Carter area, though with an unashamed, zestful seize on simple intervals. Both pieces gave the Buffalo Philharmonic difficulties, but the eventual performances were compelling and often beautiful. Now the orchestra ought to take these works into their regular season, and develop the relationships formed with the two composers. But that is not the way we are going.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS GOVERNOR;  </P> <P> WILSON IN SHADOWS AS DEMOCRATS SLUG IT OUT  </P> <P> Pete Wilson travels through the sweet rural towns and congested urban  monstrosities of California as effortlessly as a torpedo slices through calm  waters. Traveling north and south with precision, the expected Republican  nominee for governor glides across territory made familiar by his successful  bids for U.S. Senate: Pasadena to Marysville, Costa Mesa to El Cajon.  </P> <P> But with attentions riveted for now on the down-to-the-wire Democratic contest  between Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp, Pete Wilson has been  relegated to the shadows. Earlier this week, he finally got some notice -- but  he had to harshly criticize the real news makers, Feinstein and Van de Kamp --  to get it.  </P> <P> Wilson, shaking hands with a few Republican loyalists in a Northern California  park the other day, professed not to be bothered.  </P> <P> "Plenty of time for that," Wilson says about public attention, adding a wry  observation about the Democratic race: "There's some attention you'd rather not  have."  </P> <P> But tellingly, Wilson felt compelled to send biographical commercials onto the  airwaves two weeks ago to remind voters who he is -- and that he is running. An  aide said later that the campaign could not afford not to issue the reminder.  </P> <P> It is the stuff of a politician's dreams and nightmares, to be left unblemished  by the mayhem of a primary yet to be denied the free publicity that has come  Feinstein's and Van de Kamp's way.  </P> <P> There are no illusions that Wilson, 56, will stay quiet for long. A campaign  operative for an opponent physically shudders at the bombardment Wilson is  expected to loose against the winning Democrat the day after the election.  </P> <P> "Hiroshima," he said, describing the expected blast in nuclear terms.  </P> <P> But for now, Wilson has bounded about freely, raising money to add to the $3  million he has on hand and -- when time and events permit -- making occasional  stabs at his rivals. In the process the senator has sought to press anew the  image he crafted during the last eight years in Washington, that of a pragmatic  and moderate Republican unfettered by the more hard-line positions espoused by  others in his party.  </P> <P> Standing Tuesday in front of an El Cajon home that houses drug-addicted mothers  and their children, Wilson sounded more like a Democratic outsider than a man  who has spent years climbing the Republican political ladder. The federal  government -- controlled for the last 10 years by Republican administrations --  has done an "abysmal" job of preventing drug abuse, he said. He added that  federal health projects involving pregnant addicts had been "minor league" in  their funding.  </P> <P> "These women need help," he said. "What we should have done in the first place  as a society is to prevent their becoming addicted. Having failed to do that,  the next step is to prevent them from having another addicted newborn."  </P> <P> Wilson was touting a $300-million proposal he has authored to increase  treatment facilities for pregnant drug abusers, teach doctors and nurses how to  spot addicted babies, and increase foster care placements for babies born  addicted.  </P> <P> The appearance was technically billed as a senatorial press conference -- not  one paid for by his campaign for governor -- but it was illustrative of the  techniques he will use in the fall.  </P> <P> Talking to young and apprehensive mothers, days and weeks into drug abuse  recovery, he listened almost awkwardly as they told their stories. He asked few  questions, and seemed to connect more personally with the babies than with  their mothers.  </P> <P> "She won't do anything at all for a while besides sleep," he chuckled nervously  to a mother who apologized that her 5-day-old daughter slept through Wilson's  visit.  </P> <P> Minutes later, when the television camera rolled, Wilson repeated the mothers'  stories almost word for word -- personalizing a pitch that could have glazed  the eyes had it dwelt on abuse statistics and federally funded training  programs.  </P> <P> But Wilson admitted that the money he was proposing was minuscule compared to  the demand for treatment programs.  </P> <P> "Realistically, I don't think I could get more," he said.  </P> <P> Not all events run so smoothly or draw the television and radio coverage of the  El Cajon appearance. On Sunday in Marysville, Wilson drove up to a Republican  Party picnic to find a dozen adults and two little girls in party finery eating  chicken and macaroni salad.  </P> <P> An hour before he arrived, with the size of the crowd even smaller, two of the  picnickers grabbed the microphone and speakers set up for Wilson's speech and  bundled them into a car. Wilson ultimately shook hands with the attendees and  left without making any formal remarks.  </P> <P> The anonymity disappeared the next morning, when Wilson slammed Feinstein --  and to a lesser extent Van de Kamp -- in a speech to the California Peace  Officers Assn. in Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> Responding to Feinstein advertisements in which she is billed as the "only  Democratic candidate for governor who is for the death penalty," Wilson accused  her of being a campaign convert to the cause.  </P> <P> "What I am saying is that if this (Feinstein's death penalty posture) has been  a long-held passion, it has been well-concealed," Wilson declared.  </P> <P> "I'm rather surprised by the senator's hyperbole," Feinstein snapped back. "I  think he must be getting a little frightened."  </P> <P> Recent polls, including a state survey conducted by The Times, show Wilson in a  virtual dead heat with either Feinstein or Van de Kamp. Political experts have  long suggested that the senator might have a tougher time beating back a  challenge by Feinstein, whose positions are closer to Wilson's than are Van de  Kamp's.  </P> <P> Wilson's current campaign commercial covers essentially the same themes that  the two Democrats have battled over in their primary -- the environment,  growth, the death penalty, education.  </P> <P> "The purpose is to remind people of the visionary leadership we think Wilson  has demonstrated over 24 years of public life," said campaign director Otto  Bos.  </P> <P> Bos denies that campaign officials are concerned about Wilson's relatively low  profile throughout the primary campaign. Rather, they say the ads are necessary  because Californians need to be reminded of the candidate's positions.  </P> <P> "When you're living in a state of 30 million people, you're obliged to tell it  again and again," he said.  </P> <P> Wilson plans to return to Washington for two weeks during the close of the  primary campaign, when attention will be drawn to two Democratic debates and  the last-ditch exchanges between Feinstein and Van de Kamp. Then he will be  back in California with what is expected to be a fierce assault on the winner.  </P> <P> "Until the primary is over, we're still a third force," said Bos. "Their jig is  up in four weeks."  </P></p>

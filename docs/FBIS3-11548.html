Hector Luna Troccoli, the general secretary of the  Presidency, was called upon to swear in new Government Minister  Parinello Blanco, who then swore in Colonel Mario Alfredo Merica  Gonzalez as the new government vice minister.    The government also announced the removal of Mario Rene  Cifuentes Echeverria as general director of the National Police.  Salvador Figueroa, who took his oath of office before Minister  Parinello, replaces Cifuentes.    In an interview with reporters, the minister admitted he was  lacking experience in public security, but he said he is  assuming his post with the greatest commitment to fighting  crime. He also noted that there is close friendship between him  and the president.  <H5>  Contents of Emergency Plan </H5>   The emergency plan announced last night comprises six  phases,  all of which will be implemented in the near future. The first  is the Holy Week Plan, which is designed to provide security  during Holy Week and Easter festivities in urban areas and along  highways. A large number of policemen have been assigned to  this task.    Another phase is the creation of an Immediate Reaction Team  that will include a specialized 300-man mobile force trained in  fighting crime head-on. A new investigative and seizure unit  also will begin operations.    The plan includes cataloguing and repairing internal police  radio communications equipment. Meanwhile, Phase 6 deals with  police force vehicles, all of which will be dedicated to civil  order patrols.    The plan, according to Parinello Blanco, will be launched  immediately. The Immediate Reaction Team will not be a  repressive force, but a preventive force. We will aggressively  crack down on crime wherever it occurs.</p>

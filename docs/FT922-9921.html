			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Envy at Korean climb up the financial ladder OVER the past few days the world has viewed scenes of violence in Los Angeles, recorded by helicopter television crews. Also shown over and over have been the horrific images, captured by an amateur photographer, of the beating of Mr Rodney King, a black motorist, at the hands of four white Los Angeles policemen. But there is another videotape, less widely broadcast, that tells much more about the complexity of racial tensions that violently erupted in California last week. This camera was mounted in a Los Angeles grocery store, and it recorded the shooting of Latasha Harlins, a 15-year-old black girl, who got into an argument with a Korean grocer over paying for a Dollars 1.79 (Pounds 1.01) bottle of orange juice. Within Los Angeles' black community, Latasha is as well known as Rodney King. The probation sentence given to her killer, Soon Ja Du, a Korean business owner, convinced many blacks that the judicial system holds double standards based upon racial discrimination. On any day of the week in this city, including the day last November when Latasha Harlins' killer was sentenced, black men are sent to jail for far lesser crimes. It was no coincidence that in last week's violence, businesses owned by Korean immigrants were targeted for destruction. More than 850 shops and businesses owned by Korean immigrants were set alight or looted. According to preliminary estimates, the Korean community suffered more than half of the total losses of about Dollars 550m. Tensions between black Los Angelenos and Korean immigrants have been simmering for some time. Last year, blacks in South-Central Los Angeles staged a summer-long boycott of a liquor store where a black man had been shot by the Korean owner. Resentment toward Korean and other Asian immigrants stems from their apparent ability rapidly to rise above the poverty of black and Hispanic neighbours in America's inner-city ghettos. This is especially true in South-Central Los Angeles, which 10 years ago was predominantly black. Since then it has drawn in new Latino and Asian immigrants, including some 300,000 Koreans. Now blacks find themselves a minority, even within traditionally black neighbourhoods. Asian immigrants, many of them better educated than poor Americans, own most of the grocery stores and laundries in this section of the city. The key to the ability of Korean immigrants to climb the economic ladder is their system of mutual financial support, called keh, through which friends and family members provide what westerners would term venture capital for new businesses. Typically, some 50 or so Asian immigrants pool their savings to give one of their members the opportunity to open a grocery store or a laudromat. Ultimately, each member of the group is financed. Others arrive in the US with substantial funds, or spend years working long hours to save money to open their own business. According to the US Census Bureau, 10 per cent of all Korean immigrants own their own businesses and 75 per cent work in a company they partially own, or work for another Korean business. In contrast, black entrepreneurs find it almost impossible to raise capital for inner-city businesses. While blacks make up more than 12 per cent of the US population, they own only 3 per cent of businesses. Last week some rioters  - not all of them black  - seemed intent on redressing the balance of opportunity. In the wake of the violence there have been some signs of hope. Whites and blacks joined weekend clean-up efforts in Koreatown and thousands of Koreans, calling for reconciliation, marched the streets. Yet this conflict demonstrates that the problems of Los Angeles are not simply 'black versus white'. The city has complex racial and cultural tensions, sharpened by economic pressures that can set them alight.</p>

			<p><P> January 1, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIFTING THROUGH YEAR'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> During 1988, various Orange County residents wrote about their feelings and  thoughts in articles submitted to our Sunday commentary columns. As we look  back, some of those thoughts are recalled:  </P> <P> Donald A. Sizemore on the homeless:  </P> <P> For all our concern with morality we are confronted daily with an immense evil  that few seem to care about and fewer still seek to halt. That evil is  homelessness in Orange County, and its companions: poverty, illness and hunger.  For most, accustomed to our county's image of prosperity, it is virtually  impossible to believe that thousands of Orange County residents are living in  conditions reminiscent of the Appalachia of 3 decades ago. For the few who  become aware of this issue there is always the comfortable lie that the poor  deserve their rags, malnutrition and loss of dignity. The truth is a horrifying  indictment of Orange County's values and priorities -- both public and private.  It takes only $4 a day to shelter, feed and assist the homeless. The issue is  seldom a lack of resources -- it is usually lack of concern, leadership or, in  a very real sense, a lack of morality when it comes to the poor.  </P></p>

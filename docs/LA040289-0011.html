			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: 'OZ'-SOME  </P> <P> Fans of "The Wizard of Oz" will be able to see 15 minutes of previously  unreleased footage from the classic film when MGM re-releases the video in  August. According to Herb Fischer, MGM-UA Home Video veep, the special 50th  anniversary commemorative video package will have a new re-recorded sound  track, a 24-page booklet on the making of the movie and a special feature with  the rare footage at the end.  </P> <P> You'll see Ray Bolger (the Scarecrow) singing "If I Only Had A Brain"; the  original Tin Man, Buddy Ebsen -- who became allergic to his makeup and was  replaced by Jack Haley two weeks into shooting -- singing "If I Only Had A  Heart" over a montage of stills of him in costume; and Ebsen jitterbugging with  Bolger, Judy Garland, Bert Lahr and in a dance sequence.  </P> <P> "The jitterbug footage was destroyed in a studio fire years ago, but the  vocal's intact," Fischer told us. "So we included home movies done by 'Oz'  composer Harold Arlen on the set of the film (with) the vocal."  </P> <P> More goodies: The original "Oz" coming attractions trailer, the 1939 Oscar  ceremony (Garland got a special Oscar) and footage of Houston Post newspaper  contest winners visiting the stars on the set.  </P> <P> Since its 1980 release on video, "The Wizard of Oz" has sold more than 1  million units at $40 retail. No price has been set for the new "Oz" package,  Fischer said. Craig Modderno  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / German wages pact raises rate cut hopes GERMANY'S banking unions yesterday agreed to a 3.3 per cent wage settlement with their employers, effectively completing this year's west German wages round and prompting speculation that the Bundesbank might ease monetary policy next week. News of the wage agreement, which was below the projected rate of German inflation, triggered a surge on European stockmarkets and helped to depress the D-Mark against most other European currencies. The London stock market gained 39.3 points to close within 6 points of its previous all-time closing high, at 2,868. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index closed 25.44 points higher at 1,684.35 and the CAC-40 index in Paris gained 39.07 points to finish at 1,983.71. The dollar also rose against the D-Mark as dealers contemplated the possibility that the Bundesbank would ease rates at its council meeting next Thursday. Officials have said that moderate wage deals are an important requirement if it is to cut rates. The negotiations over wages in the German banking sector followed the pattern of most earlier agreements, completed quickly and without industrial action. Most forecasts for German inflation suggest that there will be an annual rate of price increases between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent. Most unions started out with claims for increases of more than 6 per cent, but the recent rapid onset of recession and announcements of sweeping job losses have had a dramatic effect on expectations. A 3 per cent wage deal for Germany's 3m public sector employees came the day after the Bundesbank cut the discount rate by  1/4 percentage point to 8 per cent and the Lombard rate by  1/2 point to 9 per cent.</p>

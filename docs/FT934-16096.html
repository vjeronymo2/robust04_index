			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Irish satellite bandits enjoy roaring trade: BSkyB downplays decoders - EC urged to impose a ban / Smart card fights microchips BALLYEGAN is a hamlet in County Offaly in Ireland's agricultural heartland so small that it does not even have a sub-post office. Apart from the tractors on the lanes and cows grazing in the fields, the only sign of economic activity is the local pub, 0'Meara's Black Bull - except, that is, for a two-storey house called The Lodge. The house is an important staging post for unauthorised decoders that unscramble the satellite channels of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television network in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake. The decoders are not just supplying the Irish market but are now being exported in large numbers to the UK. Advertisements placed by the Ballyegan company in Ireland promise smart cards to decode all the BSkyB channels which normally cost subscribers Pounds 19.99 a month. 'Save hundreds of pounds in fees you have to pay each month,' says the advertisement, which also adds: 'Agents wanted for all parts of Eire.' Mr Jack Malloy who lives at The Lodge said he helped out with the business of distributing the cards. His niece, he added, was married to Mr David Lyons, who runs the UK arm of the business. The company that placed the advertisement is registered in Dublin and called Satellite Decoding Systems. It has a UK branch in a semi-detached house in Dingle Avenue, Appleton, near Warrington in Cheshire. Advertisements have also been placed in Cheshire offering to decode all the BSkyB channels. The company charges Pounds 220 for a card to unscramble the BSkyB channels - not, on the surface, a good deal. All 18 channels including three film channels and Sky Sports can be legitimately obtained for Pounds 240 a year. But the pirate card promises to work forever. The company says its service is almost a parallel subscription service - if BSkyB changes its codes or sends out new official cards, Satellite Decoding Systems offers to provide a new card for Pounds 30. Mr Lyons, a tall Irishman, answered the door at his Warrington home yesterday and denied that he was doing anything illegal. 'The only thing we are doing in this country is advertising,' he said. 'If I thought we were doing anything to damage Sky TV to the point where it was unacceptable we would pack it in,' he added. He said his solicitors had been instructed to fight a writ from BSkyB at the beginning of the month issuing a restraining order against his company for breaking UK copyright laws. Mr Lyons said he had written to BSkyB about his system. He said: 'They know about us. I don't suppose they are very enthralled about it all.' Mr Gary Davey, deputy managing director of BSkyB, was dismissive yesterday about the activities of the pirates. 'You find one that works? People have been trying to crack the system since its first month,' said Mr Davey, who conceded that a number of serious attempts had been made by pirates. 'At least once a month there is an attempt,' he added. The company monitors the pirates closely, Mr Davey said, and sometimes lets them spend a lot of money on a system before changing the codes or the information sent over the satellite to decoder boxes in individual homes. 'Then they lose their shirts,' Mr Davey said. 'Our system has been cracked. But we control it over the air. It can't be permanently cracked,' he added, claiming that the information sent over the satellite could be changed 50 times a second. It is not an argument that much impresses Mr Lyons who was yesterday demonstrating one of his cards in Ireland. He declined to demonstrate his system in the UK, he said for legal reasons. He said of BSkyB: 'They tried to turn our cards off a month ago and succeeded in putting out of action 10 per cent of their own cards. Their switchboards were jammed. All the satellite operators across Europe have had their codes cracked. Nobody has produced a foolproof system.' Mr Lyons said the cards were being mailed over to the UK from Ireland then remailed in the UK by an assistant who did not know the contents of the packages. He claimed this device would escape the restrictions on importing unauthorised decoders. Cheshire Trading Standards department is taking an interest in the activities of Satellite Decoding Systems and may take action although the department has not had any complaints from customers of the company. According to a woman answering telephone inquiries at the Warrington address, the company is swamped with applications. 'We have sold 2,000 cards in the past six weeks,' she said. The Ballyegan-Warrington connection looks like a tiny part of the growing trade in unauthorised decoders. Satellite magazines all over Europe carry advertisements for the unauthorised cards. The Ballyegan company says it acts as an agent for a supplier based in Bochum in Germany. Mega-Sat in Bochum advertises in a German trade magazine called Infosat and offers not just cards to crack BSkyB but also the film service of FilmNet which operates in the Low Countries. Industry specialists on piracy believe Mega-Sat is an important source of the unauthorised cards. BSkyB only buys the UK rights to the movies it shows and although the channels are distributed on the Astra satellite all over Europe they should not be legitimately available there. In the UK the potential problem for BSkyB is loss of revenue. In Ireland, satellite dealers make it clear that pirate decoders are available in the marketplace and are already big business. Mr Paul McKenna of Electroplus, a satellite specialist in Dublin, said yesterday that BSkyB's VideoCrypt system was 'a relatively simple code and can be broken easily'. Mr McKenna said that a week ago BSkyB had changed its signal to render the pirate cards useless. 'Within two or three days the pirate cards were replaced with new ones,' he said. He added that the pirates had significant financial backing and said that specialists from San Francisco had been involved. A UK television executive who asked not to be named said yesterday that he had pirate cards which had been decoding BSkyB channels for the past six months. However, he added that BSkyB had successfully damaged the picture last week and now the picture slipped in and out of its scrambled form every two to three seconds and was virtually unwatchable. He has not tried to get a replacement card. When VideoCrypt was first introduced, BSkyB executives said it was a system that could not be beaten, mainly because a new card could be sent out every three months if the codes were cracked. One senior BSkyB director said yesterday that they could send out a new card every week if necessary. In fact BSkyB viewers are being signed up on 12-month contracts and it seems that one card is meant to last throughout that time. That is perhaps an indication of the confidence of BSkyB that the pirates can be held at bay - or a measure of the complacency of the satellite venture.</p>

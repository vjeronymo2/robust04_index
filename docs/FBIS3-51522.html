			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Harare, 18 Jan (AFP) -- Cuban Foreign Relations  Minister Roberto Robaina stated Tuesday in Zimbabwe during an  AFP interview that Cuban diplomacy must be "up to date" and that  it requires "proficiency to adapt to a world with very  significant and different conditions." Robaina is expected to  depart Zimbabwe on Tuesday and go to Zambia on the penultimate  leg of an African tour that took him to Ghana and Angola and is  expected to conclude in Namibia.    Robaina, who was appointed foreign relations minister in  April 1993, indicated that Cuba will not compromise with respect  to positions of principle, such as Cuba's independence and  sovereignty, which, according to him, "are nonnegotiable. Our  independence and sovereignty is not a matter for discussion,  neither is our capability to speak for ourselves," Robaina  stated. Cuba cannot "revert regarding those sectors that are  sacred to us, sectors such as education and health, with which  my people and no one in the world would forgive us if we decided  to retrogress," he added.    However, he explained, Cuba "is inclined to exchange, adapt,  and trade with anyone who is willing. In order to adapt to this  economic world we must trade with capitalists whether we like it  or not," he acknowledged. "I am not one of those who believes  that all capitalists are bad," but "to trade under the pressure  my country is undergoing is extremely difficult," he pointed  out.    In reference to the U.S. blockade and the fall of the Soviet  Union, Robaina explained that "conditions" in Cuba "are  abnormal. My country cannot trade as it wishes and with whom it  wishes. We would first have to disclose who are investing and  how they are doing it. But we cannot do that. If we did," there  would be, "pressure ... blackmail and persecution against anyone  who decides to do business with us."    Nevertheless, Robaina expressed optimism with respect to  future relations between Cuba and the United States. "I do not  believe that the new generation of Americans is injected with  that virus of aggression against a country that does not  represent a threat to the United States," he pointed out. "I  cannot believe," he stated, "that now that we are about to begin  a new century, countries such as Cuba and the United States,  which are merely 90 miles apart, can continue to live as we are  currently living." I am "convinced that there must be a  solution, but the solution must not imply that my country ceases  to exist as a country. If it means that we have to revert to  being the United States' back door, then we prefer that the  solution never be found."    Robaina indicated that during his visit to New York last  September he noticed that "the American people are becoming more  aware of the senselessness of this relationship. Our message is  being heard and more people are now aware that Cuba is not the  hell it is depicted as being." Robaina explained that "at the  government level there is no contact whatsoever, except with the  Coast Guard -- border guard contacts with some joint action  against drug trafficking. In addition, we are discussing a  telecommunications project, but there are many differences and  many stumbling blocks."    In recalling his experiences in Angola from 1988 to 1989  when  he was a member of an "internationalist" contingent, the Cuban  foreign minister stated that "there has been no greater  experience in my personal life." It "was the most important  stage of my life," he reiterated. "In Angola we were able to  modestly contribute to Namibia being what it is today, to its  independence." He added that "the pages my country wrote in  Angola were written most of all for Angola, not for Cuba."    Robaina, who at 37 is the youngest member of the Cuban  Government, expressed his "amazement" at the interest caused by  his appointment. "I am simply a visible face, maybe one of the  most visible," he insisted. The Cuban minister added, "I don't  see why the appointment of a minister my age should be a  surprise when there are 5 million Cubans who are younger than  30."    Our "fundamental priority lies in the surroundings we  inhabit," he pointed out before proceeding to explain that  Cuba's priority is in the "Caribbean and Latin American" region,  but that Cuba must maintain "special relations" with Africa.    "My country is what it is because of Africa. Cuba is a mix  of Spanish and African," he explained and added that Cuba, "has  much to contribute in some fields, such as education, health,  medicine, and human resources."    In addition, the minister declared that he is "passionately  mad about human rights, because of the human aspect of my job,"  but believes that Cuba is being unjustly accused when "we are  one of the countries where more human beings know that they have  rights. Ten million Cubans know they have rights because they  know they are humans," he indicated. "The reality for millions  of human beings who inhabit this earth is much more tragic  because they are not recognized as human beings and they neither  know how to read or write. Who speaks about child prostitution  and who is organizing it? Who speaks about the sale of  children's organs? Who speaks about xenophobia," the minister  asked before concluding.</p>

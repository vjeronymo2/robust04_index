			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANATOMY OF A BULLET WOUND;  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE SHOT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EVERY DAY. BUT, EXPERTS SAY, FEW OF US  COMPREHEND A BULLET'S IMPACT. HERE, THE LAST 58 SECONDS IN THE LIFE OF A  GUNSHOT VICTIM.  </P> <P> Juan Antonio Mendez never felt what hit him. A bullet does that. The small lead  plug moving close to the speed of sound shocks and deadens the tissue and  organs it crushes. Fear and confusion heighten the torpor of a gunshot wound.  And at this point in his armed robbery of an electronics store in Koreatown,  Juan Mendez is in full panic.  </P> <P> The plan has come apart. A young Brinks guard, Ramiro Garcia, isn't showing  scared. Mendez's partner was able to grab the canvas cash sack from Garcia's  left hand. But the guard isn't flinching, and that could mean he is ready to  shoot it out.  </P> <P> Mendez has no time to change moves, to control the next moments of his life, to  run, to yelp, to back down or cancel his commitment to violence.  </P> <P> He does have one moment to cock the hammer of his own gun, a museum piece -- a  rusted, single-action, frontier-style .44 six-gun made by Remington in the  1890s.  </P> <P> But the guard is faster. Garcia's left hand sweeps the barrel of Mendez's  handgun aside. His own revolver, a Brinks-issue Smith &amp; Wesson with a  four-inch barrel and a full load of six .38 Special rounds, clears its black  leather holster.  </P> <P> Boom! Garcia's first shot hits Mendez high in the left chest. The range is so  close that flakes of unburned gunpowder are forced through Mendez's brown  sweater. They tattoo the edges of the chest wound.  </P> <P> Boom! Mendez fires, but it is more of a reflex. The shot goes wild and slaps  sideways into a store wall.  </P> <P> Boom! A second bullet hits Mendez's chest, dead center. He stumbles, turning.  Boom! A bullet in the right arm, from triceps through biceps and into the left  knee. Mendez falls.  </P> <P> Flat on his back, eyes fading, Mendez's dirty sneakers twitch against a display  case of home security systems. "Double Entry Security" promises the sign.  "Because Your Security And Peace of Mind Are Important."  </P> <P> Mendez flops an arm across his bleeding chest.  </P> <P> It is three days before Christmas.  </P> <P> Juan Mendez has just 58 seconds to live.  </P> <P>  Massad Ayoob is a former police officer and, as founder / director of Lethal  Force Institute of Concord, N.H., a guru of combat competition shooters.  </P> <P>  From South Africa to Long Beach, police departments seeking to improve their  effectiveness -- and ordinary civilians afraid that police will never be able  to do enough -- pay up to $500 per person for Ayoob's courses in self-defense  by pistol and shotgun, knife, night stick and Kubotan baton.  </P> <P>  He blames the media -- from George Peppard's fully automatic "A-Team" on  television to Mel Gibson in gun-toting newspaper advertisements for "Lethal  Weapon II" -- for fitting America with a "an insulating, subconscious callous  that keeps us from recognizing the horror of it.  </P> <P>  "The guy (on television) gets hit in the head with a club and he passes out.  He never retches, never vomits, never sees double, never goes into grand mal  seizures . . . all of which occurs with people who have been struck in the head  with blunt instruments. If they don't die.  </P> <P>  "With gunshot wounds, the guy swoons and falls to the ground. There is no  blood. Probably the height of the bull was the old Mannix series. At one point,  Mannix is shot in the shoulder with a .458 elephant rifle by the millionaire  villain. In the next scene, Mannix has got his arm in a little black sling and  is hugging his new girlfriend.  </P> <P>  "In real life, nobody has been shot with a .458 elephant rifle. But we have  one case where a subject with a 45/70 (hunting) rifle shot a police officer  wearing a bulletproof vest.  </P> <P>  "The rifle was so powerful that it carried the vest into the wound channel,  halfway through the body. The bullet struck at the right nipple, and there were  ruptured blood vessels in the brain just from the backed up shock waves through  the cardiovascular system.  </P> <P>  "Of course, death was instantaneous. This is a whole lot more in line with  what happens when you get shot."  </P> <P>  After Juan Mendez falls, there is a second of silence at ITC Electronics, 2772  W. Olympic Blvd. Minds respond in the pause, trying to understand and deciding  what might be next. The stench of gunpowder is everywhere. Then shouts and  movement.  </P> <P> Garcia is crawling and sliding toward the store's counter. His bravery has been  expensive. While rapid-firing against Mendez, the armored car guard put one  round through his own knee. Garcia desperately needs cover and time to reload.  </P> <P> Mendez's partner, however, isn't waiting for a rematch. He has the sack holding  more than $20,000 in cash and checks. He sprints and shoves through shocked  shoppers to an open door and the crowded street.  </P> <P> By this time, even the flutter of Mendez's breathing has stopped.  </P> <P> The first bullet, a flat-nosed lead slug weighing 10.2 grams, or less than 1/2  ounce, went into his chest angling down. It fractured the fifth rib on the way  in, bored through both lobes of the left lung, and fractured the seventh rib on  the way out.  </P> <P> Not always a fatal wound. Not if the round avoids larger blood vessels. Not if  the bullet hole seals itself and air doesn't enter the chest cavity and the  lung does not collapse.  </P> <P> The killer was the second shot.  </P> <P> It hit the bone and cartilage of the sternum. That flattened the round a  little, increasing its diameter and widening the wound channel it punched  through the left ventricle chamber of Mendez's heart. The bullet left the  heart, went into the left lung and exited Mendez's back.  </P> <P> In its passage, the slug stretched and displaced for milliseconds the heart  muscles, valves and chambers, forming what trauma surgeons know as the  "temporary cavity." It created a temporary space the size of a baseball in  Mendez's heart.  </P> <P> But the heart continued to pump.  </P> <P> Now it is squirting blood from the bullet holes in the heart wall, filling the  pericardium and pouring into the chest cavity itself. At a rate of about five  quarts a minute.  </P> <P> But there is no pressure to carry blood through the aorta and a network of  arteries to Mendez's brain. Not even to the blood vessels near the gunshot  wounds in his right arm and left knee. So there is no bleeding there.  </P> <P> No blood, no oxygen. No oxygen, no working body cells. Then veins collapse.  Electricity and neuromuscular activities stop.  </P> <P> Barely a minute after the first shot, the only movement connected to Mendez is  a puddle of blood creeping from two exit wounds in his back.  </P> <P> It shines like maroon glue on the store floor.  </P> <P> As life finally leaves Juan Mendez.  </P> <P>  Jim Monaghan is full of holes. He can close his eyes, point to arms, legs and  chest, and finger-count 11 wounds from bullets and shrapnel. A former Green  Beret captain and veteran of five combat tours of Vietnam, Monaghan, 51, now a  technical consultant and scriptwriter to movie studios, has survived four  gunshot wounds.  </P> <P>  The worst, he says, was in 1966.  </P> <P>  A Viet Cong soldier shot him in the left shoulder with an AK-47 assault rifle.  </P> <P>  "Then I killed him," Monaghan says. "But his shot hit my M-16, blew the upper  hand guard apart and pieces of the weapon were flying everywhere. One piece  killed the man standing next to me, ripped his whole face off, and the bullet  ricocheted and went into my shoulder.  </P> <P>  "It smashed the clavicle, the thing that holds the muscle leads from the  tendon and the biceps muscle . . . and as a result, the muscles, the biceps  muscle and then the left chest muscle, the one that guards the heart, began  falling down.  </P> <P>  "And it burns. That's the first thing that happens to you. It's just like a  red hot poker or an ice pick burning into you. Then it knocks you down. It is  like somebody swinging at you with a baseball bat. As hard as they can.  </P> <P>  "But the burning. I remember thinking that if I had time to pour a canteen of  water on it, everything would be OK. But it didn't quite work out that way. I  went for about 10 more minutes and then I just passed out from loss of blood  and pain.  </P> <P>  "I was out (in the hospital or convalescing) for eight months. And it still  hurts. It's a private pain, but it ain't easy. There are times when I'm in bed  and dreaming, and I'll begin jumping and I can feel those bullets hitting. If I  move my arm the wrong way, that sudden, searing pain feels like the round is  still entering, still moving in.  </P> <P>  "I've been down to the (Long Beach) Naval hospital several times and up to the  Presidio (Letterman Army Hospital), and they keep telling me that there will  have to be operations done on the thing again. I'm postponing it. I'll take  Advil or aspirins or, once in a while if it really hurts, I'll take some  codeine.  </P> <P>  "But I can just feel that fire in there. All the time."  </P> <P> At 5:34 p.m., four minutes after death, official hands are attending Juan  Mendez. A uniformed officer from LAPD's Rampart Division, who was patroling  nearby and made it to the store while gunpowder smells are still hanging,  touches his fingertips to Mendez's neck. No pulse.  </P> <P> The six-gun -- a souvenir of a supposedly wilder West -- is recovered and taken  to the trunk of a police car. "Who did he think he was going against?" an  officer mutters. "Clint Eastwood?"  </P> <P> Fire Department paramedics from Engine Co. 13 deliver their boxes and monitors.  Some attend guard Garcia and his knee. Others stare down at Mendez.  </P> <P> Scissors cut away his brown sweater.  </P> <P> The red-black bullet holes are obvious.  </P> <P> Especially one in the center of Mendez's chest.  </P> <P> "Just the right place," says paramedic George Balleweg. "Great shooting."  </P> <P> Three electrodes from a Lifepak 5 monitor are attached to Mendez's trunk. It is  probably a formality. A six-inch strip of tape hisses from the machine and the  line is quite straight. There is no electrical activity in the body.  </P> <P> Balleweg crumples the tape and tosses it.  </P> <P> Police officers -- lieutenants and sergeants and street cops from this volatile  area of town -- peer at Mendez before a sheet is pulled over his body and face.  </P> <P> "Anybody recognize this guy? . . . looks like a rock smoker, one of those dirt  bags from down the street . . . nobody I know . . . probably an illegal . . .  you want to look, Jim?"  </P> <P> Yellow plastic tape is unrolled to seal the aisles and area where Mendez fell.  There are blood smears here. Unspent cartridges there. Physical evidence that  must be protected.  </P> <P> Detectives Larry De Losh and Joe Getherall, partners from LAPD's  robbery-homicide division, arrive from Parker Center downtown to build the  foundation of another investigation. For these men, the end of Juan Mendez is  only a beginning.  </P> <P> Mendez's face is uncovered for Frank Giles. He's a city photographer. Giles has  lost count of the bodies he's photographed.  </P> <P> "I don't have many emotions about it," Giles says. "But sometimes I look at a  guy like this one and I think that we probably got up about the same time  today, in the same city, had breakfast and went our separate ways. Then we meet  like this.  </P> <P> "The big difference is, I get to take the pictures of him and he doesn't get to  see the New Year."  </P> <P> Coroner's investigator Tom Ratcliffe bends over Mendez.  </P> <P> He stabs him lightly with a scalpel. On the right side, just below the rib  cage, Ratcliffe inserts a thermometer, pushing it down and then hard up and  into the liver, where its temperature will set the official time of death.  </P> <P> Mendez is carrying no money, no identification. Just a comb, an empty leather  billfold and a stainless steel digital watch. His name and Salvadoran  citizenship will be established later through fingerprints.  </P> <P> Yet there's no guarantee that he really is Juan Antonio Mendez. That's just the  name he gave when arrested in June on two counts of possessing and selling  crack cocaine.  </P> <P> Ratcliffe grabs the cuffs of Mendez's pants. An assistant holds Mendez's  wrists. The body is jackknifed and tugged onto a collapsed gurney, wrapped and  strapped down, and wheeled through the store to an unmarked county van.  </P> <P> A policeman says something. Very quietly.  </P> <P> The words hold anger for an enemy. Yet their tone carries one fragment of  empathy for the death of a human being.  </P> <P> "Feliz Navidad, knucklehead."  </P> <P>  Dr. Martin Fackler was a combat surgeon in Vietnam and is director of the  Wound Ballistics Laboratory at the Letterman Army Institute of Research,  Presidio of San Francisco. He also is an Army colonel who wages constant war  against the mystique and misinformation surrounding weapons and wounds.  </P> <P>  An AK-47 assault rifle, he states, is not as deadly as the public believes.  And many more children might have died in a Stockton schoolyard last year had  Patrick Purdy used a hunting rifle or a 12-gauge shotgun instead of an AK-47.  </P> <P>  The severity of a gunshot wound, Fackler explains, has little to do with the  velocity of so-called "high-powered rifles" but is heavily influenced by "the  mass of the projectile (bullet), how heavy it was, the construction, the shape,  the type of tissue it hits, did it hit the liver or the intestines, did it hit  anything to disturb its path before it hit this person?  </P> <P>  "Do you realize," he asks, "that the muzzle velocity of the AK-47 is less than  the muzzle velocity of the weapon that was adopted by at least three European  armed forces in 1891?  </P> <P>  "There are simply two mechanisms, basically, as the bullet penetrates the  body. It makes a bullet hole (permanent cavity); in other words, the bullet  hitting the body tissues destroys, disintegrates and crushes what it hits.  There is a second (mechanism) that is much more dramatic and has been  emphasized far out of proportion -- the temporary cavity.  </P> <P>  "This (temporary cavity) is the same thing as a splash in water. You toss a  rock into water, the water parts momentarily and then comes back.  </P> <P>  "The temporary cavity (inside human tissue) does increase with the velocity of  the projectile (bullet), but (it) increases a lot more with changes in  projectile shape. Think of a diver going off a 10-meter board . . . going into  the water with an excellent dive. High velocity. Very little disruption of the  water.  </P> <P>  "Now, same diver, same mass and everything . . . but going off a two-meter  board at much lower velocity. If he does a belly flopper, he makes a much  bigger splash. And bullets do the same thing.  </P> <P> "As long as they (bullets) are going through tissue . . . straight ahead, and  not yawing at all, they make very little damage . . . after the bullet starts  yawing (in tissue), it will go to 90 degrees and is likely to go to 180 degrees  (tumbling). In other words, have its path exactly reversed.  </P> <P>  "The (United States) M-16 projectile tends to yaw after about five inches. The  AK-47 round, using the (7.62 millimeter) standard Chinese or Russian military  ball ammunition, doesn't generally yaw until it goes about 12 inches.  </P> <P>  "Some of the stuff that has been coming out of Los Angeles in the aftermath of  this Purdy shooting (where Purdy used 7.62 mm military-type ammunition) has  been really unbelievable.  </P> <P>  "You've got (hospital) people that are quoted as saying: 'Assault rifles are  so bad that if a person is hit in an extremity it must be amputated and if he  is hit in the trunk he is dead.' And another guy saying: 'The chances of you  dying if you're hit by an assault rifle are 50%.' These things are absolutely  ludicrous, absolutely non-factual.  </P> <P>  "Look at Mr. Purdy's kill rate. Thirty-five hits and five deaths. That's not a  high kill rate. If you wish to add up massacres, not only of Mr. Purdy but of  Mr. Wesbecker (Joseph T. Wesbecker) in Louisville and a few others, you will  find that when an assault rifle is used as the primary weapon . . . you have  more than twice as many wounded as are killed.  </P> <P>  "When a shotgun is used, you have more than twice as many killed as are  wounded. This summer there was a fellow over in France who used a shotgun and  killed 14 and wounded seven.  </P> <P>  "You don't want to be hit with a short-range shotgun. It takes a lot of tissue  and makes mush out of it. And this tissue doesn't work very well afterwards."  </P> <P> Juan Mendez has a new identity. He is 89-12450.  </P> <P> That means he died in 1989 and is the year's 12,450th victim of an undetermined  or violent end in which the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office  assumes physical jurisdiction over the body.  </P> <P> Part of that authority is the decision to perform an autopsy. Ten thousand  corpses were opened and examined by the county last year. It is decided Mendez  will be one.  </P> <P> Autopsy, by necessity, is a detached and indelicate process. But then, the 11  physician-pathologists handling 800 autopsies each month have no time for  surgical delicacies, fancy incisions or needlework. Nor need they work with  post-operative concerns for those wheeled into these grim and smelly basement  operating rooms between the Southern Pacific railway yards and County-USC  Medical Center.  </P> <P> In one room, all six stainless steel tables often are occupied. Dead by the  dozens are waiting. Some incoming addicts, derelicts, traffic victims, male and  female, the stabbed, beaten and shot of our county, must wait stiff and  uncovered on gurneys in the hallways.  </P> <P> Mendez, unwashed and naked but for the blue 89-12450 identification tag wired  to his big toe, is brought in.  </P> <P> Dr. Christopher Rogers, 31, will do the autopsy.  </P> <P> Detectives De Losh and Getherall are observing.  </P> <P> Doctor and detectives wear disposable masks, gowns and paper bootees. That  wasn't always standard. But then came AIDS.  </P> <P> Rogers says he is fascinated by the work. Sure, he could earn more in private  medicine. But, he says, he enjoys the puzzle-solving of being a forensic  pathologist.  </P> <P> He starts work, and it is not subtle.  </P> <P> An ordinary pair of pruning shears are used as rib cutters. A soup ladle  collects blood samples from Mendez's thorax. Washing off instruments, not  constant sterilization, is the rule. Then some are dumped in a cardboard box;  the hand-written sign on it states: "Knives To Be Sharpened."  </P> <P> This case isn't much of a puzzle for Rogers. Guided by X-rays, he finds a  bullet in Mendez's left knee. The joint, quite bloodless, is opened and the  slug pried out for De Losh.  </P> <P> It is a flat-nosed .38 and clearly from guard Garcia's gun.  </P> <P> Rogers measures the bullet holes in Mendez's chest. He marks their positions,  their angles and their passages on a diagram of a man; the chart will become  evidence. Then Rogers inserts a steel rod through each wound channel.  </P> <P> "We have potential entrances one, two and three, and potential exits one, two  and three, and one here in the knee . . . now, one through the sternum, right  through the heart, through the left lung and exits . . . and that is the  rapidly fatal wound.  </P> <P> "This one here, left chest, came in at intermediate range because we see the  (gunpowder) stipling . . . it fractured the fifth rib and then it goes through  both lobes of the left lung, then out, fracturing the rib, left seven.  </P> <P> "I guess we'll make the cause of death multiple gunshot wounds."  </P> <P> It is a 90-minute task, and as with all daily routines, there is chatter  unrelated to the work. Of whether the Vatican will give up Manuel Noriega. Of a  Christmas gift of tickets for "Phantom of the Opera." Of old friends and new  cars, living in Los Angeles and dead villains.  </P> <P> When it is done, Mendez is sutured; the stitches are huge and made with waxed  twine. His hair is given a final shampoo. He is wrapped in plastic with arms  and legs trussed tight by lengths of rope.  </P> <P> He is wheeled to a crypt, and in storage at 35 degrees, Mendez joins the  county's permanent population of 300 corpses in processing.  </P> <P> It has been a while since robbery specialists De Losh and Getherall have  witnessed an autopsy. They say it doesn't bother them.  </P> <P> "Unless it's a kid," De Losh says.  </P> <P> "Or a cop," Getherall adds.  </P> <P>  Evan Marshall was a homicide investigator and a Detroit cop for 20 years. He  has shot suspects, had suspects shoot at him, and now directs the criminal  justice program at Kirtland College, Ross Common, Mich. A columnist for Combat  Handguns and Guns &amp; Ammo magazines, he sees himself as "a student of  ammunition construction and effectiveness."  </P> <P>  Marshall knows that poison-tipped rounds and explosive bullets are effective  only in Ian Fleming novels. But he also knows the serious attention law  enforcement agencies are giving two radical handgun bullets.  </P> <P>  One, the Glaser, is a thin, copper-jacketed round that flies like a  conventional bullet and bursts on impact. It releases miniature lead shot and  creates broad penetration similar to a shotgun blast.  </P> <P>  The other is a super-light, plastic plug weighing less than a quarter of a  conventional .38 bullet. Muzzle velocity of the Thunderzap is more than twice  the speed of sound -- faster than a bullet from an M-16 assault rifle -- but  the light weight of the projectile allows total dissipation of energy at 100  yards. Before that, however, the round fragments on impact and, according to  current advertising, creates "vicious flesh destruction . . . shatters ribs and  blows rib pieces into lung tissue."  </P> <P>  Marshall has also studied the Army's Advanced Combat Rifle (ACR) program and  its evaluation of a bullet embedded in a bullet, so-called "duplex rounds" that  are relatively unstable and designed to tumble immediately upon impact.  </P> <P>  Another ACR ammunition contender fires a small steel arrow, a flechette, and  there's a French round of solid brass said to have penetrated 37 layers of the  Kevlar used in bulletproof vests.  </P> <P>  But their effectiveness is easily argued, Marshall says, and the truth of the  ammunition matter hasn't changed much since the days of cannon and musket  balls.  </P> <P>  "I've seen instances where people were shot with a standard .38 Special, round  nosed, lead ammo, and other people shot with a 125 grain, .357 magnum  hollow-point. You dissect both wound channels and the differences are very  subtle. You don't open up the person shot with a .357 magnum and their organs  are all turned to jelly, and they don't all slide out of the body. It just  doesn't happen.  </P> <P>  "Bullet placement is really the key. As I used to tell my (police) academy  classes: 'The three most important things to remember when talking about  ammunition are -- bullet placement, bullet placement, bullet placement.  </P> <P>  "I routinely tell people that anyone who takes any handgun to a lethal  confrontation isn't very wise. Because handguns, by and large, don't stop  people very well. Generally, with handguns, to produce incapacitation, we've  got to produce death.  </P> <P>  "We carry handguns because they offer concealability and portability, and in  the area of law enforcement, police generally end up relying on handguns  because people in this country have got used to seeing police officers carrying  handguns. In other countries, police routinely walk around with submachine guns  and nobody gets really excited about that. But I guess we're not quite ready  for that yet.  </P> <P>  "Law enforcement requirements are quite different from military attitudes.  They (military) want to wound people because that ties up medics and many other  support personnel. In law enforcement, the aim is to stop.  </P> <P>  "There are only two ways to get what we (police) call 'instant  incapacitation.' One is to sever the spine, which, of course, produces death.  The other is a brain shot.  </P> <P>  "But it is extremely difficult to produce incapacitation without producing  death. What we have seen (with handguns) is countless instances where people  have taken hit after hit after hit and not gone down.  </P> <P>  "Once the adrenaline gets dumped in the system . . . (many) people don't feel  getting hit the second, third or fourth time. We've seen instances where  basically, in order to stop people who are bent on killing other people, you  sometimes almost have to shoot them to pieces.  </P> <P>  "That justifiably horrifies people.  </P> <P>  "But as far as the technology of a bullet itself . . . the only humane bullet  is one that is never fired."  </P> <P> Several hours after death, Juan Mendez, 28, makes one contribution to life. His  corneas are removed, sent to the Doheny Eye Bank and will be implanted to  restore sight in others.  </P> <P> But no one has asked for the rest of Mendez.  </P> <P> His police record shows no address or names of family. He is presumed to be an  illegal alien. Just in case, his description and fingerprints will be checked  through the Veteran's Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the  Criminal Identification and Information office of the state Department of  Justice and other official clearing houses.  </P> <P> In about 60 days, if no leads are found, Mendez will be declared "Indigent  Dead."  </P> <P> He will be taken to the county crematory in East Los Angeles. His ashes will be  held for two years. Then they will be scattered at a common site.  </P> <P> The bullets that took his life will be sealed in plastic envelopes and held in  LAPD's property room until no legal considerations surround the case.  </P> <P> And a few small, impersonal, inanimate, valueless lumps of lead will outlive  Juan Mendez by many years.  </P> <P> FATAL PASSAGE  </P> <P> The first shot fired at Juan Mendez was at close range, striking him high on  the left side of the chest, angling down and fracturing the fifth rib. That  bullet continued on, penetrating both lobes of his left lung before fracturing  the seventh rib and exiting the back close to the spine.  </P> <P> The bullet that killed Mendez entered his chest cavity through the sternum,  striking downward through the left ventricle of the heart before exiting his  back. It crushed and destroyed tissue by forming a wound channel known as the  permanent cavity, which would likely be further widened if the bullet flattened  out after striking the sternum. For milliseconds after passage of the bullet,  the walls of the permanent cavity, including within the heart, are stretched  outward. This lateral tissue displacement forms a temporary cavity that may  have no effect on elastic muscle but can cause devastating disruption of soft  organs.  </P></p>

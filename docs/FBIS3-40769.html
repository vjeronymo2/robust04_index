He told reporters here that he noticed a change in the  perceptions of the politicians in the country on the Tibet issue  over a period of time, and attributed this to the decline in  "moral spirit, self-confidence and courage" among politicians of  the post-independence era.    However, he said, more stronger feeling and seriousness was  being witnessed among the Indian intellectuals and the student  community on the sovereignty of Tibet.    Referring to India's policy on China in regard to Tibet, the  Dalai Lama said India was "over-cautious." He said India  accepting Chinese sovereignty over Tibet was a "mistaken  commitment."    "At least India should describe Tibet as an "autonomous  region" of China, like the British, he felt and disclosed that  Indian legal experts on various occasions had questioned and  confronted the stand of the Indian government in this connection.    The Dalai Lama appeared apologetic towards the Indian  government's predicament and said "It is not easy for a big  nation like India to effect change in policy on an international  issue as it involves various factors and aspects."    On the collapse of the eastern bloc, the spiritual head said  the collapse of communism had both positive and negative effects  on the Tibetan issue and their fight for freedom.    When asked about the opinion on Tibet in western countries  and America, the Dalai Lama replied that several western  nations, including America, had confirmed the fact that Tibet  was an "occupied land" and both the houses of the United States  had accepted this.    He expressed his deep gratitude to the government of India,  and especially the government of Karnataka, for their support to  the Tibetan refugees settled in the state. "The Tibetans in  India have preserved their culture and spirituality, all because  of positive help rendered by the state and Union government," he  said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with W. Hoynck, Secretary General of the CSCE, by </F> Igor Belov, in Vienna, date not given: "The CSCE: For Security  from Vancouver to Vladivostok"]    [Text] The range of tasks for the first secretary general  in the history of the CSCE -- 60-year old German diplomat  Wilhelm Hoynck was elected to the office around a year ago -- is  quite wide. First and foremost he is expected to provide  administrative assistance to the chairman of the CSCE Council,  who is elected for one year from among the member countries'  foreign ministers. He is empowered to coordinate the  operations and actions of the peacekeeping missions carried out  within the CSCE framework and represent the all-Europe structure  in contacts with other international organizations. On the  instructions of the CSCE Council chairman the secretary general  can also put forward political initiatives.    Our representative met with Wilhelm Hoynck at the CSCE  Secretary General's residence in Vienna and asked him to answer  a number of questions. The first question was this: What are  the main tasks facing the CSCE this year?    [Hoynck] In 1994 we have fundamentally the same aim as last  year. I have in mind the attempt to make a CSCE contribution to  the creation of a new degree of stability in the gigantic region  from Vancouver to Vladivostok. This is a very ambitious  program, and I think that the CSCE is best suited to show what  it can do in the sphere of preventing conflicts and in the  peaceful settlement of crises. But all this must be based on  the CSCE's efforts to deepen the process of the observance of  commitments with regard to the human dimension. Only then will  those structures aimed at ensuring the full respect of human  rights and basic freedoms and the implementation of the  principles of democracy and the rule of law really take root.  This is a great range of tasks in which the CSCE must achieve  progress.    [Belov] How do you assess the new NATO "Partnership for  Peace" program? Will this program not reduce the CSCE's  activeness in the efforts to establish a just and lasting peace  in the general European region?    [Hoynck] Assessing the "Partnership for Peace" program is,  of course, not the prime task of the CSCE secretary general.  However, I would like to draw attention to the fact that a CSCE  foreign ministers' joint statement gave the program a  fundamentally positive assessment. I would also like to refer  to the statement issued by the NATO countries' heads of state  and government at their meeting in Brussels at the start of  January 1994. In that statement the CSCE is again assigned a  very great role. I want to emphasize that the two documents  that I cited coincide on the central question. I am talking  about the principle of the indivisibility of security in Europe.  I believe this to be of very great significance. It is also  important that the common concept of security in Europe is built  on a foundation of cooperation rather than through the buildup  of countermeasure forces. On this main premise or, if you will,  philosophical idea it seems to me that NATO and the CSCE adhere  to the same opinion. In such a system all states will occupy  the place that suits them and each state individually will be  able to introduce its own legitimate security interests into the  system.    [Belov] What role might the CSCE play in the matter of  stabilizing relations among countries within the CIS? How do  you view the possible participation of Russia's Armed Forces in  peacemaking missions on former Soviet Union territory?    [Hoynck] These two questions are interconnected but have  different aspects nevertheless. As for the process of  developing the CIS, it seems to me that it will be stable and  directed toward the future if all CIS members take greater  account of the principles elaborated within the CSCE framework.  There is a wide spectrum of opinions, beginning with the  catalogue of principles contained in the CSCE's Helsinki Final  Act. This includes the principles of national sovereignty, the  inviolability of borders, freedom of the choice of allies or  freedom not to take part in alliances. I believe that any  association of states in the region between Vancouver and  Vladivostok which is founded on voluntary participation and is  democratically administered would serve to strengthen stability  in this region. Permit me to emphasize once more: I am  profoundly convinced that, the more widely the principles of the  CSCE are applied within the CIS, the firmer and more stable the  CIS itself will be.    Now I should like to talk about the role of the Russian  Armed  forces in the peacemaking process. This is a very important and  very complex question. It is complex for all the participants,  primarily for those countries where conflicts are taking place  which those countries themselves are incapable of ending  independently. This is thus a question of countries which need  outside help. Without doubt this is a complex question both for  the Russian leadership, for states which are Russia's neighbors,  and for all CSCE member countries. It is absolutely clear that  within the CSCE framework some countries have considerably  greater potential than others in this respect. It is also clear  that in the course of conflicts these countries will be dealing  with a request for help from neighbors near and far. There are  absolutely obvious examples in this regard. I have in mind  Georgia and Tajikistan. In both those countries a situation has  been created which, according to the assessment of those  countries themselves, could not be resolved without Russia's  participation. The fact that Georgia and Tajikistan as well as  the Russian leadership were committed to ensuring that the  decision to provide assistance did not bear a purely bilateral  character but was implemented within a multilateral framework  emphasizes the CSCE's significance. Although from the viewpoint  of international law help in this aspect could be purely  bilateral in character. Of course, if such actions are carried  out within the CSCE framework they must correspond to the CSCE's  principles. It is also obvious that general powers, a kind of  carte blanche, cannot be given in this matter but each specific  opportunity must be examined in specific terms.    I am deeply convinced that the real interests of each of the  states needing help, the interests of Russia and all the other  CSCE members are best served by the approach in which all such  measures and events are implemented as part of a multilateral  process.    [Belov] How would you assess relations between the CIS and  the CSCE?    [Hoynck] Mr Ivan Korochen, executive secretary of the CIS,  recently visited us at our invitation. I would regard that  visit as one of mutual acquaintance. The meetings between the  CIS executive secretary and delegations from CSCE countries  showed that the latter have many questions about the status of  the CIS and the possibilities of cooperation. The discussions  showed that the CSCE national delegations understand very well  that the CIS is a commonwealth of states in development, that  the commonwealth itself emerged overnight, as it were, in an  extremely difficult situation for all its members, and that the  important thing now is that development should proceed in a  direction corresponding to the principles of the CSCE. I  believe that such contacts should be developed in the future in  the interests of "transparency." Then the CIS countries and the  CIS executive secretariat will have a complete understanding of  what the CSCE is doing. And the CSCE delegations will deepen  their knowledge of how matters are developing within the CIS.</p>

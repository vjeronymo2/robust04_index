			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATING VOCATIONAL SCHOOLS  </P> <P> The article by William Trombley, reporting on the recently signed vocational  school regulatory legislation ("Trade Schools Threaten Suit on State Rules,"  Part A, Dec. 13), brings to the public forum a much needed focus on the rights  and responsibilities of both proprietary schools and students seeking  educations from those schools. While it is inappropriate for the federal  government, i.e., the Department of Education, to comment on the merits of the  debate in progress between proponents and opponents of the law in question, it  is important for the American taxpayer to understand that the California debate  will have a very real impact nationwide.  </P> <P> At issue here is the concept of consumer rights and institutional  responsibility. From the perspective of the federal government, the taxpayer,  who will in the coming year contribute nearly $10 billion toward federally  assisted student loans and grants, must believe that those hard-earned dollars  will not be squandered or wasted.  </P> <P> The students who apply for and receive those dollars must be assured a fair and  equitable return on their tuition; they must believe that they will receive the  best education possible resulting in access to better earnings and quality of  life in general. The students have a right -- as do American taxpayers -- to  expect quality from their chosen institutions of higher education.  </P> <P> In return for the fees they collect, those institutions must exercise a great  degree of responsibility. The promise of a quality education should not begin  in the cashier's office, and it must certainly not stop there. There is no  place in this nation's education continuum for sellers of hollow promises and  baseless dreams.  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Education is faced with a staggering $8 billion in  student loan defaults. While there are virtually as many stories behind each  default as there are students in default, there is one story that troubles us  all and that is the one of deceit and misrepresentation, of institutional  financial and management failure, of unrealized opportunities and broken  dreams.  </P> <P> How many students complete a course, what percentage of students are placed in  course-related employment, and institutional effectiveness are valid issues for  discussion simply because they are very visible indicators of an institution's  ability to carry out its advertised mission. The debate that surrounded the  California legislation is being carried on in the much larger national forum as  the U.S. Department of Education begins to frame language for the  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act of 1965, due for congressional  action in 1991. The same issues of accountability, responsibility and rights  come up time and time again in our public meetings all around the country.  </P> <P> And while reauthorization is not restricted to proprietary, for-profit  vocational schools, we do intend to promote stringent regulations, within the  federal government's role, to protect consumers of education -- students -- who  may be more at risk, and, therefore, more susceptible to institutional abuses,  in the burgeoning vocational-school marketplace. Education is America's  investment in itself, and that investment must be protected against  institutional abuse and/or mismanagement, whether intentional or not.  </P> <P> The Department of Education is already prepared to deal with proprietary  schools that fail to deliver on their promises and the reasonable expectations  of their students. As stewards of the public's education dollars, we owe it to  this nation's citizens to require fair and equitable access to quality  education for all. The decade ahead will be a decade of opportunity and a  decade of action for education programs all across America. The U.S. Department  of Education, in partnership with the governors, legislatures, and departments  of education in all 50 states will exercise its responsibility to vouchsafe the  rights of our students, and we encourage our partners to do no less.  </P> <P> LEONARD L. HAYNES III  </P> <P> Assistant Secretary  </P> <P> U.S. Department of Education  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

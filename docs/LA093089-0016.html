			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDERS' PERFORMANCE A SAD SHOW OF SATIRE  </P> <P> On the TV screen and in theaters, I have seen put-downs and parodies of big  business, medicine, government, the military and grand opera.  </P> <P> But, unless I miss my guess, last Sunday when I watched the L.A. Raiders play  the Denver Broncos, I saw the Raiders satirizing the NFL game.  </P> <P> STAN GORDON, Encino  </P></p>

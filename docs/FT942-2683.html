			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (25): Group E - Mexico Mexico are genuine dark horses. Eight years ago when they hosted the World Cup, the expectations of the home crowd were too much for them. This time they will have none of those pressures, but they - will have the vast numbers of Mexican Americans to bolster their support. Mexico were banned from the 1990 World Cup for playing over-aged players in a youth tournament. The only international experience for many of the squad has come in the regional qualification tournament for this World Cup, which they won with habitual ease, the 1993 central American Gold Cup, which they also won comfortably, and the 1993 continental championship. It was their first appearance and they surprised south America by reaching the final which they lost 2-1 to Argentina. Mexico have a mixture of youth and experience. Hugo Sanchez (Rayo Vallecano) is the elder statesman. His striking partner will be Luis Flores (Atlas), a veteran of the '86 World Cup, Luis Alves Zague' (America), a naturalised Brazilian who scored seven goals in one Gold Cup match, or Luis Garcia (Atletico Madrid). Mexico's goalkeeper, Jorge Campos (UNAM), is from the Rene Higuita school and has put his side in trouble on occasion with his excursions from the penalty area. During the Gold Cup he even played two games as a forward. This is a tough group. If they do get through, they may emerge as the surprise package of the tournament.</p>

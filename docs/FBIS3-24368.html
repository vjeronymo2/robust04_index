			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vadim Soskov under the rubric "Situation": "An </F> Oblast-Level Emergency"]    [Text] Once again the consolidated budget situation is  alarming at both the federal and oblast levels. The regions are  not making ends meet. Arrears in the payment of wages,  especially to employees of social, cultural, and consumer  service facilities, come to several months. Social tensions are  rising, and confidence in the power structures is dwindling.  Under the circumstances, the regional authorities are more often  than not acting in the traditional manner: They send envoys to  the Ministry of Finance, and the envoys try to "lobby" for yet  another billion for their oblast, kray, or republic. However,  carving up the budgetary pie is becoming increasingly difficult.  There is no money.    Less frequently, the oblast authorities try to find a way  out  on their own, without assistance from the center. After all, it  is no secret that tremendous amounts are left uncollected at the  regional level. The Voronezh Oblast administration has resolved  to get at least some of them.    Deputy head of the Voronezh Oblast Administration Igor  Neznamov said: "For us to live like we did in 1993 the oblast  needs 240 billion rubles [R] in the first quarter. However, in  reality a budget of R124 billion has been put together. The  deficit comes to R116 billion. All these numbers are based on  prices of the fourth quarter of last year. Meanwhile, prices for  gasoline, electricity, raw and other materials, and medicines  increased sharply in January. Prices have gone up, but no  recalculation has been done so far. As a result, in January  alone we needed to allocate R80 to the sector financed from the  budget. However, we were able to fund only R33 billion.    As is known, Voronezh Oblast is primarily an agrarian  region.  Enterprises of the defense industry account for the bulk of the  industrial potential, but these enterprises are in need of  assistance themselves. For example, the neighboring Lipetsk is  one-half the size of Voronezh in terms of population, but the  volume of industrial production is two times greater there.    In a word, the consolidated budget situation in Voronezh is  extreme. Suffice it to mention that, if funding for preschool  facilities is cut off, employment will fall sharply because of  nonworking mothers, and the volume of industrial production in  the oblast will decline another 70 percent. Under the  circumstances, emergency financing procedures were temporarily  introduced in Voronezh Oblast in March. Governor A. Kovalev  signed a package of 17 decrees. The task is to regain control of  the economic situation in the oblast.    First of all, measures are envisioned that will bring about  a  reduction in the expenditures of the oblast budget. Only the  "protected" items of expenditure of organizations financed from  the budget are funded on a priority basis: wages, electricity,  municipal services. For example, the Decree "On Streamlining  Funding for Health Care in the Oblast" introduced strict  item-specific financing in health care facilities of the oblast.  It is forbidden for hospitals, polyclinics, and medical services  departments to purchase drugs at prices exceeding the  wholesale-factory prices of the Farmatsiya state enterprise, or  to purchase expensive equipment, except for that directly  supporting the provision of medical care to the population.  Monitoring of transfers of funds to the fund of compulsory  medical insurance will be reinforced.    Negotiated prices in construction are also becoming a matter  of the past. Firm cost estimates for construction products are  being introduced which proceed from the 1991 base price  multiplied by a uniform sectoral index. The latter will now be  determined by an oblast center for price setting in the  construction sector. At the same time, tax relief is envisioned  for private enterprises building facilities that are included on  the list of state needs of the oblast.    Measures to raise the rate of the profit tax taken in by the  local budget to 25 percent for enterprises and organizations and  30 percent for insurance organizations, i.e. 3 and 8 percent  more, respectively, are aimed at boosting the revenue side of  the budget. A fee of R2 million a month will be assessed on all  commercial stands.    Mutual offsetting of the debts of enterprises in Voronezh  Oblast will soon be performed. The plan is to subsequently  expand it to all oblasts of the Central Chernozem area.    In the opinion of Igor Neznamov, carrying out these  decisions  will yield about R20 billion per month to the oblast budget.  This does not solve all the problems, but will be a substantial  help to the organs of executive power in funding organizations  financed from the budget.</p>

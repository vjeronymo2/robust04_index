			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Raimundo Lopez: "The Atypical Path </F> Toward the Solution of Economic Difficulties"]    [Text] Havana -- Faced with the worst ever economic  situation, the Cuban Government chose a somewhat unusual road to  solve its woes. It simply placed the matter in the hands of  those whom it usually affects the most in other nations.    Following this decision the so-called Parliaments in the  Workplace became popular in Cuba. These are meetings among the  workers in each workplace, summoned by the Cuban Workers  Federation (CTC), to try and find solutions to the difficult  domestic financial situation.    The system was launched last January and triggered an  unusual  process of consultation at the grass-roots level. More than 3  million persons took place in the almost 80,000 meetings that  took place all over the island, until last March.    CTC leader Pedro Ross explained that the meetings had the  double purpose of finding ideas to increase the economic  efficiency at each specific center, while seeking other more  general solutions related to the national situation, as a whole.    Ross, responding to PRENSA LATINA, affirmed that the  reaction  to these meetings surpassed all expectations. This was so,  first, "because of the insight shown in the worker's  presentations about the solutions that should be implemented to  enhance the domestic economy and clean up the financial system."    He added that another aspect, deemed to be highly positive,  was the response to the summons. The meetings had an average of  over 86-percent attendance of all union members.    The first study to determine the measures needed to face the  nation's difficult situation was carried out last December at  the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP]. There  they decided to hold an extraordinary session to discuss only  the country's financial situation.    The situation shows a current money surplus of more than 10  billion pesos -- equivalent to the same amount in U.S. dollars  at the current exchange rate -- a fiscal deficit of as much as  4.2 billion [currency not specified], and substantial subsidies  for several sectors.    These factors have negative effects on the Cuban economy,  which is already suffering the sudden loss of its trade partners  in the former Soviet Bloc in Eastern Europe and a tightening of  the trade embargo the United States has maintained against Cuba  for over three decades.    Local authorities maintain that neoliberal economic policies  will never provide solutions for these problems.    A CTC report on the progress at the assemblies suggested  that  this process constitutes "a democratic exercise that quickly  earned its place as a useful tool and a viable way for the  people to participate in solving our vital economic problems."    The fact is that the meetings that took place at the more  than 80,000 work centers gave all Cuban workers, from the most  humble to the highest members, the opportunity to voice their  opinions and possible solutions to the economic difficulties.    The decision originated from the principle expressed by  President Fidel Castro that "without the understanding and  disposition of the workers and the people, no problem would be  solved and no measure would be any good."    The magnitude of the process was also highlighted by ANPP  President Ricardo Alarcon in statements to PRENSA LATINA.    The workers parliaments -- Alarcon stated -- have served to  jointly discuss possible general measures and for each worker to  express their opinion and compared to others, in order to form a  single plan.    He also indicated that the workers parliaments have  encouraged the rise of a national consensus in relation to the  critical measures to resist the situation, since "the solution  to the economic difficulties is the entire nation's problem."    Financial reorganization and economic efficiency are not  matters solely for a group of legislators, but a collective  enterprise to be confronted by the entire nation, Alarcon  emphasized.    In other words -- he added -- we must conceptualize a  people's government as it really is, that is, it is not an  isolated parliament above the rest of society, but a parliamnent  inserted into society.    In this respect, Alarcon explained "we are legislating  these issues from the moment every workers group meets to  express their recommendations on this matter and, most of all,  when they specifically agree on what to do at each work place  and in cooperation with other enterprises."    From this perspective -- he pointed out -- it has been  possible to identify and explain thousands of proposals,  thousands of specific measures, many of which are already being  put into practice, and are already being implemented.    Precisely, one of the CTC's first objectives is to find  solutions to the proposals suggested by its members and linked  to their respective work centers.    Felix Jimenez, director of La Corona tobacco factory, told  PRENSA LATINA that as a result of implementing proposals  suggested by the factory's employees, output objectives are  being met by 146 percent.    He indicated that we are all trapped in a spider's web, and  we are starting to shake ourselves out of it. We cannot let  this die out.    Another example cited by TRABAJADORES weekly magazine, is  that of an agriculture company located in the western Province  of Matanzas, where the number of workers was cut from 1,135 in  1993 to 217 in March 1994, a measure that enabled the company to  save 105,000 pesos in wages.    Despite the cuts implemented, the company expects an  increase  in productivity and expects to ensure income producing levels.    With respect to discussions surrounding the national  measures, these will be debated by the ANPP deputies on 1 May,  international labor day.    Ross insisted that on this occasion all proposals made by  the  workers will be taken into considerations.</p>

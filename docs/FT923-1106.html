			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cuban sugar growers face more problems CUBA, which in 1991-92 produced its lowest sugar crop in a decade, faces an even more difficult harvest in 1992-93, according to Mr Juan Herrera, the Cuban sugar minister, Reuter reports from Havana. The Cuban domestic news agency AIN said Mr Herrera told Cuba's official workers' trade union that 'in the coming harvest there will be even greater difficulties'. Cuba produced 7m tonnes of sugar in the 1991-92 harvest, which was plagued by shortages of oil, lubricants, spare parts, herbicides, pesticides and fertilisers. Mr Herrera said a fall in the number of available sugar cane harvesting machines would mean an increase in cane cutting by manual workers next season.</p>

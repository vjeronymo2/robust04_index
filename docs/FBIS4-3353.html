			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Lin Chunhua (2651 2504 5478): "The Fuzhou </F> Railway Subbureau To Transform Itself Into Limited-Liability  Company"]    [Text] Fuzhou, 5 Apr (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- The Fuzhou  Railway Subbureau is going all-out to transform itself into a  limited-liability company solely owned by the state.    The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is in charge of the railway  network within Fujian, which has a total length of nearly 1,100  km, an annual freight transport capacity of over 20 million  tonnes, and an annual passenger transport capacity of more than  17 million passengers. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, the main  railway artery in Fujian, has been electrified. The  construction of the Nanping- Hengyang Railway, Fujian's second  railway to other provinces, is in full swing. The province will  build seven more new railways before the end of this century.    The Fuzhou Railway Subbureau is located at the southeastern  tip of China's railway network, and there is no transit  transport by means of railways managed by the subbureau, so it  is convenient for the subbureau to carry out reform in isolation.    It has been learned that the Fuzhou Railway Subbureau will  take two steps to transform itself into a company. The first is  to change from its existing state of having assets invested  solely by the state and the reality of unified operation and  administration of the entire network into a limited liability  company solely owned by the state. The second step is to absorb  other investment entities and to develop into a shareholding  limited-liability company with state capital holding controlling  shares.</p>

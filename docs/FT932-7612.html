			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles agrees debt package and standstill extension with lenders ISOSCELES, the heavily-indebted parent of the Gateway food retail chain, said yesterday that its lending banks had agreed a restructuring package for its Pounds 1.4bn debts. Its current standstill agreement, under which debt repayment was suspended last year pending agreement on the restructuring, has been extended beyond its May 28 deadline. This is to allow time for shareholders to decide on the package at an extraordinary general meeting likely in the last week of June. The restructuring, put to lenders in early April, creates a new company, Gateway Holdings, to assume responsibility for Pounds 500m of debt, while the balance of about Pounds 923m will remain in Isosceles in a restructured form. Gateway Holdings will run the Gateway Foodmarkets Group and will be wholly-owned by Isosceles, a highly leveraged management buy-out vehicle. It ran into trouble when recession and the slump in values of retail businesses meant that disposals planned to cover debt could not be made at high enough prices. Gateway Holdings will have no liability for Isosceles' debt and in effect will be 'ringfenced' from the borrowings. Gateway this week announced a price and promotion campaign, making permanent price reductions on between 1,000 and 1,500 lines across a range of products.</p>

He is waiting for the Atlantic Alliance to come up with  precise membership criteria for countries like Poland instead of  closing itself off in a "selfish and shortsighted strategy of  every man for himself."    [Urbanowicz] With the U.S. "Partnership for Peace"  initiative, is the West sending you a signal of support strong  enough to appease your fears and reaffirm your European  aspirations?    [Kolodziejczyk] "Partnership for Peace" can only meet our  expectations if it opens up clear prospects for countries like  Poland of belonging to the Atlantic Alliance.    We understand that at present it is difficult for the West  to  put forward a precise date for our integration into the common  security zone. However, we expect the NATO member countries to  come up with clear criteria in the short term for NATO  membership. These criteria could be compliance with the  disarmament treaty, the UN Charter, the Charter of Human Rights  and Citizen Rights, the obligation to have civilian control over  the army, as well as transparency in military budgets.    [Urbanowicz] How far is Poland prepared to go in terms of  military cooperation with the NATO member countries as part of  "Partnership for Peace"?    [Kolodziejczyk] We are prepared to commit ourselves to a  broad range of actions, including joint maneuvers. I recognize  that this cooperation could cause certain financial problems for  Poland, but the 1994 budget has not yet been passed by  Parliament, and expenditure for the "Partnership" could be  written into it.    We have already established broad contacts with many  countries in the alliance. Poland remains open to other  initiatives in the area of European security, such as the Danish  proposal for military cooperation between the countries along  the Baltic Sea.    [Urbanowicz] How did you receive the French-German proposal  to offer Poland the status of "associate member" in the WEU  (Western European Union), which is the embryo of the common  security and defense policy of the European Union?    [Kolodziejczyk] France is a great advocate of the WEU. It is  obvious that the process of integrating the countries of Central  and East Europe into the European Union must go hand in hand  with a rapprochement with the WEU, which plays the role of  NATO's European pillar. Because I know that the United States  takes a dim view of this initiative, I am still a bit skeptical  about the WEU.    However, the fact remains that, for Poland, the most  important thing is to get out of the gray area of security it  has gotten into. I therefore feel that cooperation with the WEU  can only benefit us.    [Urbanowicz] How much time will it take for Poland to reach  the level of the countries of the Atlantic Alliance?    [Kolodziejczyk] For the moment, the West is mostly refusing  to give us technological cooperation. Our own industry can  produce limited quantities of good equipment, but not all of the  parameters of this equipment match Western standards. Without  technological openness by the NATO countries, these standards  could prove to be inaccessible to Poland. I hope that the  "Partnership" will make an initial breakthrough in this area,  which is very important to us, especially now.    [Urbanowicz] What does Poland fear?    [Kolodziejczyk] For us, the areas of destabilization lie in  eastern and southeastern Europe. The West does not seem to  realize this, and it is therefore abandoning us. The West thinks  that it no longer has anything to fear because the USSR has  disappeared and because Russia is so wrapped up in its own  problems. As for the countries in East Europe, they will have to  get by on their own. This selfish "every man for himself" policy  demonstrates shortsightedness.    [Urbanowicz] Can the development of cooperation within the  Visegrad Group (Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, and Slovakia)  become the key to opening the European Union's door to its  members?    [Kolodziejczyk] Not necessarily. It is above all a common  platform from which the countries of Central Europe can speak  with a single voice. The West is watching us do so with some  caution and probably does not really think we can work  effectively together within the four-member Visegrad Group. We  want to prove otherwise.</p>

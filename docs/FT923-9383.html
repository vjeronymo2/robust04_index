			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Royal Bank of Scotland warns on bad debts ROYAL Bank of Scotland yesterday issued a gloomy trading statement, which in part prompted a 12 per cent fall in its share price to 153p, writes Robert Peston. The bank said it expected bad debt charges in the current financial year to end-September, would exceed the previous year's record Pounds 351m. The bank also announced plans to raise Dollars 200m (Pounds 104m) by an issue of non-cumulative preference shares in the US. Merrill Lynch, US securities firm will act as adviser. Royal Bank said it did not expect any improvement in the 'recessionary environment in the short term' and business conditions for the group would probably 'remain difficult . . . through at least the remainder of calendar 1992'. Royal Bank's share price was also depressed by an announcement of a claim from Wallace Smith Trust, a company in liquidation, for reimbursement of sums - with a total face value of Pounds 418m - allegedly transferred to the wrong account. Royal Bank is contesting the claim.</p>

			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Investment begins at home for Siemens: Aid helped to win chip plant for Dresden Siemens' decision to invest more than DM2.4bn (Pounds 950m) in a new microchip production and research plant in Dresden may kill two birds with one stone. As Germany's largest electronics manufacturer, Siemens wants to base part of its production and research at home with the aim of capturing more of the European market. But choosing the eastern state of Saxony might also confirm the 'leap-frog' theory in which sectors of the eastern German economy are expected to become competitive through the introduction of the highest levels of technology and expertise, rather than updating existing plant. Siemens has traditionally gone abroad to manufacture the 64-megabyte memory chips and the 256-megabyte chips used for telecommunications, mobile telephones and vehicles. Its electronics divisions accounted for 65 per cent of this year's DM81.7bn turnover. In the US, Siemens co-operates with IBM in the manufacture of the 256 chip, and it produces semiconductors in south-east Asia. But Mr Werner Gries, a senior official at Germany's federal ministry for research and technology, believes Siemens wants to use its home base to produce these two chips. 'Siemens ranks third in the sale of semiconductors in Europe,' he said. 'It wants to go on the offensive. To enable it to do this, it will use the production and research facilities in Dresden to capture the market in Europe, and in other parts of the world.' In Mr Gries' view, what was crucial about the Siemens approach in Saxony was its decision to place research and production under one roof in Dresden. 'It wants to be able to develop the next generation of chips but in a way in which research and production can work much more closely.' Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chief executive of Siemens, said production from the 200,000 square metre greenfield site in Dresden, expected to start in 1995, will be largely export driven. 'What we are seeking is higher productivity, greater innovation, and markets,' he said. For the moment, the company would go it alone, but the door would be open for IBM or Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company which already co-operates with Siemens outside Germany. Investment grants were an incentive in the choice of Dresden. The state of Saxony, led by Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, and the federal government, will provide grants amounting to about 35 per cent of the DM2.4bn investment. In addition, the European Union's regional development fund and the federal ministry for research and technology is expected to provide DM300m. Siemens officials denied that the grants would help offset high real wage levels in eastern Germany. Wages are 20 per cent below western German levels although productivity lags behind western counterparts by 60 to 70 per cent. 'You have to pay high wages for a highly skilled workforce in the computer industry,' said a Siemens official. Mr von Pierer said Saxony's traditionally strong industrial base and its skilled workforce also contributed to the decision. Those skills will be upgraded when Siemens, under contract with IBM, brings over 50 of its specialists from the US. He also cited the lack of bureaucracy and red tape which Mr Biedenkopf is renowned for cutting through. For Saxony, the presence of Siemens could well reinforce the 'leap-frog theory,' in which investment channelled into greenfield sites can be used to introduce the highest levels of technology without using resources to modernise existing plants. Mr Joachim Fels, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, agrees. 'The leap-frog theory is happening slowly in some sectors in eastern Germany where an investor goes for high quality jobs, high value jobs, and a highly capital-intensive enterprise,' he said. 'But actually, there's really no other choice because eastern Germany cannot offer a low-wage economy. That's where the incentives and grants play such a big role. And probably these swung Siemens' decision to move to Dresden,' he added.</p>

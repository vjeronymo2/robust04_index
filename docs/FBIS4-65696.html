			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Institutional Reforms Minister Francesco </F> Speroni by Gianluigi Da Rold; place and date not given:  "Speroni: He Is Wrong If He Thinks We Will Betray Federalism"]    [Text] Busto Arsizio (Varese) -- Institutional Reforms  Minister Francesco Speroni said: "It is something I personally  regret. [Northern League ideologue] Miglio's attitude has not  changed. Perhaps for a while he may not be part of the Northern  League's Senate group." Speroni, like other "veteran" League  members, feels that something has changed. His relations with  Miglio are based not only on allegiance to the same flag, but  also on friendship and affection.    Friday evening [13 May] the new minister went to Como, to  Miglio's home, accompanied by Senator Marcello Staglieno,  Miglio's "disciple." They constituted a special League  "delegation" sent to sound out Miglio's thinking and to try to  mend a rift that has become apparent more from Miglio's pregnant  silences than from his public statements.    [Da Rold] Do you think that Professor Miglio could vote  against this government?    [Speroni] He could also abstain. I do not know exactly. My  understanding is that Miglio's attitude is not due to his  exclusion from the government. He seems to think that we have  abandoned, relinquished federalism. But this is not true. And  I am sorry that the professor could believe such a thing. He  thinks that in the final stage of the negotiations we sacrificed  federalism on the altar of governability and gained only a  Pyrrhic victory.    [Da Rold] The other day you announced that you will be  forming a committee, a study group, to examine a new draft  constitution that will set out the path to a federal Italy.  Will Professor Miglio contribute to this project?    [Speroni] I personally went to offer him this opportunity.  But he seems to have no intention of taking part, of helping.  And I regret this even more. [Speroni ends]    Speroni refused to discuss the matter further. He too is  waiting for the news conference that Gianfranco Miglio will give  in Rome on Tuesday after Silvio Berlusconi has presented his  program to the Senate. Then the professor will speak in  parliament.    [Da Rold] Pardon me, Minister, but the first incident seems  to have taken place within the government already. Perhaps it  is because the 13th fell on a Friday this month. You were  criticized in a communique from Berlusconi's spokesman, Antonio  Tajani, for having said in a radio interview that you want to  split the Interior Ministry.    [Speroni] There was no incident. Perhaps I was  misunderstood, or I did not express myself well. It was a radio  interview conducted very hurriedly. But I was certainly  misunderstood on the subject of collegiality; I spoke not  personally but on behalf of the League. Nobody wants to split  the Interior Ministry. We have already said that we want the  establishment of a Ministry of Local Government, and we have  seen, among other things, that a number of responsibilities are  divided among several different ministries, not only the  Interior Ministry. We have already talked about this. I did  not take part in the government negotiations, which is why this  morning I spoke with [League Secretary] Bossi and [Interior  Minister] Maroni, who confirmed to me that the League is putting  forward the proposal of a local government ministry. We will  not do everything at once. We will propose the separation of  responsibilities for the Interior Ministry in an ordinary law.    [Da Rold] Let us return to the subject of the committee, the  study group: Who will it include?    [Speroni] I do not know yet. It will include experts,  constitutionalists; I shall see. I have come to a ministry  where there is nothing. Only typists and secretaries, and a  constitutional adviser. There is not even a computer, and there  is no money. This too shows how keen previous majorities were  to carry out reforms.    [Da Rold] You will be guided by federalism. Will you also be  guided by the so-called Assago constitution, which set out the  republics, or cantons, or macro-regions?    [Speroni] Definitely by the Assago document, but also by the  document drawn up by the Bicameral Committee. We are open to  everyone. Personally, I identify more with the Assago document.    [Da Rold] How long will it take you to draw up a final  draft?    [Speroni] If I have the means available and I make my staff  work hard, I think we will have a draft in three months.    [Da Rold] Do you think you will encounter resistance from  within the majority over the federalist inspiration of a new  constitution?    [Speroni] I have listened to their arguments and have  talked with many of our allies' representatives. If they are in  good faith, I do not think there will be any resistance.    [Da Rold] Does the same apply to the National Alliance? Even  allowing for what has been called the "counterbalance" of  presidentialism?    [Speroni] That is a technical constitutional matter. It is  enough to consider the experience of other countries. Is the  United States not a federal and presidential republic?    [Da Rold] Then there is the idea of the macroregions. It  will be more difficult to reach an agreement in this regard.    [Speroni] It seems to me to be the most sensible idea. I see  that even the Agnelli Foundation is now thinking in terms of  seven large regions.    [Da Rold] The left-wing federalist, Massimo Cacciari,  however, has in mind a federalism based rather on the major  cities, on Italy's big municipalities.    [Speroni] What, then, do you do about Gallarate? No, I think  that the macroregions are the right approach, the best starting  point.    [Da Rold] Do the reform plans include bodies of  constitutional importance? What is your opinion concerning the  Higher Magistrates Council?    [Speroni] I think it should be removed completely from  political influence. I am talking about the members of the  Council elected by parliament on the basis of political vested  interests. Furthermore, I would rather await whatever  suggestions emerge from the Justice Ministry. I have my own  personal opinions in this regard. For instance, I would like  district attorneys to be elected by the people, as in America.  However, I repeat, these are my personal opinions.</p>

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / BBC to give Birt large pay rise MR JOHN BIRT has negotiated a large pay rise to take over as director-general of the BBC. Mr Birt is to be paid more than Pounds 185,000 a year. This compares with Pounds 140,000 paid to his predecessor Sir Michael Checkland, who left the corporation last year. The increase comes two months after a row developed concerning Mr Birt's pay while he was the corporation's deputy director-general. For six years in the post Mr Birt was not on the staff of the corporation but was paid as a freelance consultant through his private company, John Birt Productions. Mr Birt announced his intention to join the staff of the corporation on March 1. Since then he has not been paid through his private company and has been taxed on a Pay As You Earn basis. He has not, however, formally signed a BBC staff contract yet. The increase will more than compensate Mr Birt for the loss of tax advantages he enjoyed as a consultant. Accountants Ernst &amp; Young looked at the accounts of John Birt Productions for 1991 and found that his family saved Pounds 3,935 in tax in 1991 - Pounds 810 after deducting accountancy and administration charges. The director-general's salary is set by a remuneration committee of the BBC governors. During the freelance dispute Sir Michael Checkland argued that Mr Birt's position should be reviewed in 12 months, but that Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, should resign.</p>

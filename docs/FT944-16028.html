			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / City plans business levy to boost transport Plans to establish a private-sector fund worth up to Pounds 500m, financed from a business levy, to pay for improvements to London's ageing transport infrastructure are expected to be announced by the City Corporation soon. A report by the London School of Economics establishing the best method of raising private funds is expected to be published by the corporation in the next few weeks. This is likely to recommend a voting mechanism which would allow businesses to choose directly which projects they wished to support. The corporation hopes this would overcome potential Treasury opposition. Should the Treasury decide that the financing scheme should be included as part of public sector borrowing it would be disallowed. Under the plan companies operating in central London would pay an additional levy, based on the business rate, to an independently managed fund. This would be able to use the income to raise money in the international bond market. Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the City's policy and resources committee, said a central London fund might be expected initially to raise a total of between Pounds 300m and Pounds 500m. He said similar schemes existed in a number of foreign cities. A payroll tax on employers in Paris had helped pay for the development of the RER high-speed underground railway network. Mr Cassidy said a London fund, based on partnership between business and local authorities, could help finance projects from small local schemes approved by businesses in individual boroughs to projects benefiting the capital as a whole. This might include a business contribution to projects such as CrossRail, a Pounds 2bn scheme to improve the capital's east-west rail links, which was rejected earlier this year by a parliamentary committee and which the government is still seeking to revive. London businesses have complained consistently about the poor state of the capital's transport systems. Companies may be encouraged to accept a small levy, given that local authority business rates in London are expected to fall next year. A study by the London School of Economics last year estimated that an additional penny rate would raise Pounds 38m a year in inner London and Pounds 54m in Greater London. The Treasury has steadfastly opposed taxes dedicated to single purposes but other ministers are more likely to support the scheme, given the slow progress of the government's private finance initiative.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Defeat gives governors free rein on policy MANY of the country's 23 Republican governors gathered this week at a lakeside resort in southern Wisconsin appear in a sense happier since the defeat of their candidate, President George Bush, writes George Graham. It is as if the party's removal from power has offered them an opportunity to speak up for a message they feel their party has not enunciated well: what the party really stands for. 'We think it's going to be our responsibility as Republican governors to rebuild the party,' said Governor Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, chairman of the Republican Governors' Association. Many Republicans active at the state level fear that their national leaders, during 12 years in the White House, have strayed from the straight and narrow, lured by entrenched Washington interests or diverted from hands-on government into arid discussions. But in the states, Republican governors - and, many of them will admit, Democratic governors - have shown discipline in grappling with the revenue shortfalls that beset 35 states last fiscal year. Those such as Governor Thompson, Governor John Engler in Michigan and Governor Carroll Campbell in South Carolina have also shown innovation in reforms of welfare, health and educational systems. 'Now that we do not have either house in Congress nor the executive branch, that's where the action is going to take place, where the voices are going to be,' said Governor Thompson. 'Our programmes are going to be tested not at the federal level but at the state level. The only parts of the country where Republicans are setting the agenda are going to be those states where we have Republican governors,' said Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. The most gaping of the post-election wounds is the division over where the party should stand on social issues, especially abortion. Speaker after speaker in Wisconsin called for a return to the vision of the party as a 'big tent', capable of enfolding a variety of opinions. 'The Republican party has been, and has got to get to the position of being, the big tent. I think we have to have differences of opinion on social questions if we are going to be a majority party,' said Governor Thompson, adding that he believes the whole party platform will have to be changed. 'We've got to be the party of the big tent. Everybody says it. I believe it and I hope I've practised it,' added Senator Robert Dole, Senate minority leader. The idea that Republicans should concentrate on the economic issues that unite them, rather than on the social issues that divide them, finds wide party support. However, the Republicans still have a lot of work to do before they have pitched a tent as broad as their governors would like.</p>

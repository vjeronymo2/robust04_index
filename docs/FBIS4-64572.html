			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  Mixed Reviews on Substance; Points for Style </H8>   Press opinion on Social Democratic Party (SPD) Chancellor  candidate Rudolf Scharping's mid-April visit to the United  States was divided on whether Scharping succeeded in allaying  U.S. concerns over the SPD's foreign policy--a goal widely  regarded as his main objective for the trip. Scharping received  more praise, however, for displaying solid diplomatic skills and  projecting a statesmanlike personal image during the visit.  <H5>  Press Split on Mission's Success </H5>   While some commentators thought Scharping made progress in  convincing U.S. officials that an SPD-led government would be a  reliable ally, others saw any such success as largely cosmetic  and detected lingering U.S. concerns. Viola Herms Drath,  reporting from Washington for the 15-16 April HANDELSBLATT, was  among the more favorable reviewers. Scharping, she maintained,  succeeded during his "Washington debut" in "nipping in the bud  some prejudices against the Social Democrats as unreliable  partners" and reducing his perceived "foreign policy  disadvantage" vis-a-vis Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Drath  attributed this to the SPD leader's assurances of "continuity"  with the main thrust of Kohl's foreign policy and emphasis on  parallels between the SPD's domestic program and that of the  Clinton Administration. "In Clinton's Washington," Drath  concluded, these themes "sound familiar and are well received."  Commentator Leo Wieland, writing in the 15 April edition of the  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE, agreed that Scharping apparently won his  "campaign for trust" with his U.S. interlocutors, but implied  that the sincerity of his promise of continuity remained in  doubt at home. If Scharping's intent was "to leave the  impression" that a change in government would not noticeably  alter Germany's basic foreign policy, Wieland wrote, then "all  appearances are that he succeeded -- in America."    Other commentators remained unconvinced that Scharping had  put U.S. concerns to rest, especially on the issue of German  participation in UN-sponsored military operations. Ulrich  Deupmann, who reviewed the Scharping visit in the 14 April issue  of the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, conceded that the U.S. desire for  Germany to take a greater part in such operations may have  played "only a subliminal role" in Scharping's meetings with  U.S. officials, but maintained that "little doubt remains about  Washington's fundamental expectations." According to Deupmann,  Scharping apparently left the meetings with the "contradictory"  impression that increasing Germany's role in UN military  missions was relatively low on Washington's list of priorities,  in part because "no one openly expressed such desires to him."  Kurt Kister, whose commentary appeared in the same newspaper on  15 April, also highlighted the gap between the U.S. position on  this issue and Scharping's interpretations of it, ascribing the  contrast to both U.S. reluctance to mention the issue and  conscious political calculation by Scharping. The  administration's decision not to raise the matter with Scharping  was understandable, Kister noted, since there was no urgent need  to do so, and "no one discusses the fire department as long as  nothing is burning." At the same time, the requirements of the  German election campaign meant that it was "in Scharping's  interest" to avoid any charges of U.S. arm-twisting. Kister  pointed out, however, that "even if no one told Scharping in so  many words," the United States was growing impatient with  Germany's reluctance to increase its involvement in UN military  actions, and this friction was imposing a burden on the two  countries' relations.  <H5>  Greater Praise for Style </H5>   By contrast, media opinion was more consistently positive on  Scharping's diplomatic abilities and the personal image he  projected during the visit. Reviewers lauded the SPD chairman's  English-language skills, with descriptions ranging from "fluent,  if still capable of improvement" (Carlos Widmann in the 18 April  DER SPIEGEL) to "excellent" (Drath in the 15-16 April  HANDELSBLATT). Several commentators also pointed out the care  that Scharping had taken in laying the groundwork for his trip.  Both Martin Winter, writing in the 16 April issue of the  FRANKFURTER RUNDSCHAU, and Dieter Buhl, writing in the 15 April  edition of DIE ZEIT, called Scharping's preparatory cultivation  of U.S. contacts "systematic" and Drath, in her HANDELSBLATT  article, praised the "contacts and knowledge of the American  mentality" he had developed during his previous U.S. visits.  Scharping's personal style in representing his party and  country, however, was the most widely praised aspect of his  visit. Drath called him "conspicuous for his level-headedness"  and attributed his success in putting U.S. fears to rest to his  being a "realistic politician." Buhl, in a more sarcastic vein,  noted that Scharping's U.S. hosts were "relieved to find that he  was not, in fact, a pacifist, or even anti-American."    Even critical commentators, who sometimes suggested that  Scharping's moderate style was artificial, conceded that it  served its alleged purpose. In his 15 April SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG  commentary, for example, Kister conceded that Scharping's  "restraint, self-confidence, and sometimes strained friendliness  left behind the image of a serious, responsible politician."  Similarly, Wieland, in his 15 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  review, described Scharping's conduct as "balanced,  statesmanlike, nonpartisan" and "consensual," even while  asserting that creating this impression "was precisely [his]  intention." If there was one repeated criticism of Scharping's  conduct, it was, in fact, the notion that it was too often  tailored for political purposes. Some commentators remarked,  for example, that he too deliberately emphasized parallels  between his own political ideas and those of Mr. Clinton, as  when Carola Kaps noted in the 14 April FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE  that a Scharping speech had "omitted hardly a single catchword"  used by the U.S. President. Widmann, in his DER SPIEGEL  article, even implied that Scharping's reflective mood after  visiting the Holocaust Museum may have been a calculated  gesture. Far more typical, however, is Wieland's commentary, in  which, after searching for a single adjective to describe  Scharping's performance, he finally settled on the word  "dignified."</p>

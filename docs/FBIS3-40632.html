			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Avinash Alok: "GATT: Indian Trade Would Gain, </F> Except in Patents"]    [Text] The two most prominent trading partners of the  world, European Community and the United States, have reached an  agreement to liberalise trade. And 113 countries have consented  to endorse it.    The agreement, which is likely to be signed in April 1994 in  Marakash, Morocco, has been reached in face of stiff opposition  from some quarters in the developed and the developing world.  Textile lobbies of the US and Portugal, farming lobbies of  France and Japan and different quarters of the developing world  have severely opposed the new arrangement.    The mercantilist practice of maximising exports and  minimising imports is no longer accepted. Trade benefits both  exporters and importers. Specialisation in production according  to the resource endowments leads to cost minimisation round the  world. But in the short run, when the imported cheaper products  displace domestic goods from the market, some problems crop up  before the factors of production shift to better alternatives.    Thus, lifting of tariff or non-tariff barriers leads to  problems for the inefficient producers and benefits the  consumers. The cost-benefit analysis of liberalisation of  foreign trade underlines that benefits overweigh costs. For the  developed world, trade liberalisation has become a necessity as  their domestic markets are becoming saturated.    On the other hand, for the developing world this analysis  needs to be done more carefully. Their gains from trade are  less, because of low value-added primary exports and higher  percentage of export earnings in GDP. This latter fact means  that the developing world's vulnerability to external factors is  high. And there is an immediate loss of revenue, because of  decrease in customs duty. But in the long run the gains from  trade are likely to overweigh costs.    The opening of primary products market, which has so far  been  guarded by high tariff and subsidy walls, is expected to help  the developing countries. The specialisation in the production  of goods in their respective areas of advantage will help them  capture the markets of the developed world. The other point to  reckon with is that the developing world's bargaining power  becomes very low in bilateral negotiations.    A number of issues, which were controversial, have been left  out. Issues like entertainment, financial services, shipping and  communication fall in that category. The US reluctantly agreed  to phase out import quotas on Third World textiles and clothing  in over 10 years rather than 15 years.    India is going to gain by this agreement in all spheres  except the patents. In textiles, although 49 per cent of the  quota is to be lifted only after the year 2005 AD, the Indian  industry, which ranks amongst the best in the world, is going to  get a big boost during the phased withdrawal of 51 per cent of  the quota by the end of the period.    Indian exports of steel ropes, wires and rods have been the  target of US anti-dumping authorities in the past. The new rule  under the agreement is that the volume of dumped imports is to  be treated as negligible, if from a particular country it works  out to be less than one per cent of the market for similar  products in the importing country. This stipulation is going to  help Indian exports in a number of spheres, besides the  specified ones, because of very low labour cost and subsequent  lower costs of production by international standards.    Though Indian economy has not been able to generate enough  surplus of foodgrains, farm and related products, poultry and  dairy-based ones, will find a good market in the developed  world. This section of exports (poultry and dairy) has a very  high value-added content and a very good market in the developed  countries. Although India produces very little of the Japonica  variety of rice, the demand for which will rise with the opening  of the Japanese and Korean rice markets, pressure on the  Japonica variety will make the Indian variety more attractive.    India is a part of the developing world. It falls in the  low-income bracket, but the size of its economy sets it apart  from the other developing countries. Indian export earning in  terms of the GDP is as low as 8.12 per cent. Manufactured goods  constitute about two-thirds of the exports.    The factors which affect the developing world are not of  concern to India and if its economy moulds itself according to  the requirements of the developed world markets then the new  agreement will help it tremendously.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Pounds 900m Heathrow expansion move likely to spark battle A PLANNING application for a Pounds 900m fifth terminal at London's Heathrow airport will be lodged next week. It is likely to spark a bitter planning struggle lasting several years. The plans, to be submitted by BAA, the airport's operator, would expand Heathrow's cap-acity to more than 70m passengers a year from the present 42m. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive, says the terminal is needed to cope with forecast increases in air traffic and is essential for Heathrow to maintain its position as Europe's premier airport. However, strong opposition to the plans, originally announced last year, is already mounting. The nearby London borough of Hounslow and Spelthorne borough council in Surrey have indicated they will refuse permission on noise and environmental grounds. The London borough of Hillingdon has also expressed concern, but says it wants to see details of the application before reaching a decision. BAA's legal advisers, led by Lord Silsoe QC and solicitors McKenna, expect Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, to send the proposals, along with a plan for a new motorway spur to the terminal, to a public inquiry. It is unlikely that this could be organised to begin before autumn next year because of the complexity of the issues and the variety of opponents lining up against the BAA. Hearing the evidence could take another year and BAA does not expect ministers to announce a decision until late 1996 at the earliest - by when the deadline for the next general election would be a few months away. Construction of the first phase, which would provide capacity to handle an extra 10m passengers a year, would not be expected to be finished until 2002. The terminal would be handling the extra 30m passengers when finally completed by 2016. Opponents of the plans fear that the terminal will be used as a springboard to persuade the government to permit development of a fourth runway at Heathrow. The Civil Aviation Authority has said that additional runway capacity will be needed in south-east England by early next century. BAA says the increasing size of aircraft means the squeeze at Heathrow is on terminal rather than runway capacity and that existing runways can cope with expected rises in air passenger traffic. The new terminal to the west of the airport would stand on 600 acres, of which about half is already owned by BAA. The remainder of the site is mostly occupied by the Perry Oaks sewage works. The proposals call for a core building with two or three satellite buildings from which passengers will board and disembark from aircraft. In addition, there are plans for a hotel, aircraft stands, maintenance hangars and taxiways as well as car parks.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by N. Perkovic: "Under the Sea Into the World"] </F>   [Text] Podgorica, 16 May 1994 -- Owing to a project made  possible by the OTE, the Greek Telecommunications Organization,  Montenegro and Yugoslavia will not remain a desert island in the  "sea" of international telecommunications. A part of the $3.5  million equipment for digital radio-relay connections, which had  been bought by Montenegro from the Italian company  "Alcatel-Teletra" before the sanctions were introduced, will be  delivered to Montenegro via Greece. Beginning from September  1996, Montenegro should have an underwater connection from Bar,  through Durres and Corfu, to the whole world.    This is the result of the agreement achieved in Salonika and  Athens between the Yugoslav and Montenegrin PTT and the  representatives of the Greek telecommunication service. In  Salonika, Vucic Cagorovic, the Yugoslav PTT general manager,  Milorad Jaksic, the Serbian PTT general manager, and Jusuf  Fetahovic, the Montenegrin PTT general manager, concluded the  work of expert groups from both countries.    There followed a meeting of expert groups in Athens, led by  Jusuf Fetahovic and Petros Labron, the OTE general manager, in  which the agreement was reached that Montenegro should be  included in every project for optic cables planned for the  Adriatic.    Experts consider that the $30 million investment in the  radio-relay and optic cables project will be the most profitable  investment in Montenegro. Therefore it is considered that this  historic endeavor will be fervently supported by the Montenegrin  Government, especially if we know that both Montenegro and the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would profit from it because this  would enable them to become linked to the international  communication network. Otherwise they would not only be cut off  from the world and deprived of the possibility of following  scientific achievements in this field, but they would also lose  an important income in hard currency.    Taking into consideration all parameters, this will be the  most profitable ecological and tourist undertaking in the  ecological state of Montenegro [as published].</p>

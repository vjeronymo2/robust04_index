The regulations are intended to authorize the operation of commercial vehicles on U.S. Highway 191, to prohibit the transport of hazardous materials on U.S. Highway 191 except under certain circumstances, and to update and consolidate permit procedures related to commercial vehicle operation on all park roads.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  September 26, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dan R.

It is a federally funded highway and is maintained within Yellowstone by the State of Montana under the provisions of a Special Use Permit issued by the National Park Service (Yellowstone National Park).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The wagon road which eventually became U.S. Highway 191 was constructed through Yellowstone in 1910 with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior at the sole expense of Gallatin County, Montana. The road was constructed ``to facilitate travel and commerce'' between residents in the southern portion of Gallatin County and the county seat located in Bozeman, Montana. From its inception, the purpose, historical use, and management of U.S. Highway 191 indicate that the highway was constructed, regulated, and maintained as a connecting route between Bozeman and West Yellowstone, Montana, for the principal purposes of commerce and convenience and only incidentally for access to Yellowstone National Park.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The early differentiation of this route from other park roads was articulated in the Superintendent's Annual Report for 1913 and 1914, which stated in part:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> This is the only road in the park on which motor propelled vehicles are allowed and it is not a part of the regular tourist route.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The ongoing intent to exempt U.S. Highway 191 from the general regulations related to commercial vehicles which govern other park roads is indicated in 36 CFR 5.4 (1993), which reads as follows:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=2 --> Sec. 5.4&blank;Commercial passenger-carrying motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> (a) The commercial transportation of passengers by motor vehicles except as authorized under a contract or permit from the Secretary or his authorized representative is prohibited in *&blank;*&blank;* Yellowstone (prohibition does not apply to non-scheduled tours as defined in Section 7.13 of this chapter, nor to that portion of U.S. Highway 191 traversing the northwest corner of the park) *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Although use of U.S. Highway 191 has since expanded to include interstate travel, local commercial and non-commercial traffic remains the predominant use of the highway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to public interest in the management and regulation of commercial traffic on U.S. Highway 191 within Yellowstone National Park, the park conducted a series of three public meetings in 1987 and completed two environmental assessments (1990 and 1992) to evaluate the potential impacts of commercial traffic on natural and cultural resources and on visitor safety and experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the concerns identified during this process was the potential for a hazardous material spill from a commercial vehicle accident to cause irreparable damage to riverine areas adjacent to the road; and the potential social and economic impacts of redirecting some or all of the commercial vehicle traffic to alternative routes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

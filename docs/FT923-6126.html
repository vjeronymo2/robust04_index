			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / International Company News: Swedes confirm Procordia to head state sell-off list PROCORDIA, the pharmaceutical and food conglomerate, is likely to be privatised in late October or early November, pushing it to the top of the state's disposal list. The decision will be confirmed shortly by Mr Per Westerberg, the industry minister. The state owns 40.4 per cent of Procordia's voting shares and 34.2 per cent of the equity. The other big shareholder in the company is Volvo which holds 45 per cent of its voting rights and 39.5 per cent of the equity. The government had hoped to kick off its ambitious privatisation of the state-dominated industrial sector earlier in the year but this was held up by Volvo's SKr38.7bn reverse takeover attempt to acquire majority control of Procordia last January. The resulting highly public confrontation between the two main Procordia shareholders ended four months later when Volvo withdrew its offer. Ministers decided instead to sell off the state's equity in SSAB, the Swedish steel company, as its first privatisation. The government, which is being assisted in its preparation of the privatisation by S. G. Warburg and Goldman Sachs, hopes to attract considerable international interest in the sale of the state's shares while at the same time ensuring there is also a wide dispersion of Procordia's shares within Sweden. There has been a short delay in the announcement of the plans for Procordia while the company was involved in merger discussions with Erbamony, part of Montedison, the Italian chemicals conglomerate, which failed to achieve an agreement. The underlying strength of the company was confirmed yesterday with the publication of its first-half results. Procordia recorded an 8 per cent improvement in profits after financial items to SKr2.29bn (Dollars 446m) for the first six months of the year, up from SKr2.11bn. Turnover grew by 2 per cent to SKr19.75bn from SKr19.4bn. Kabi Pharmacia, the pharmaceutical arm of Procordia, enjoyed an 11 per cent increase in its operating profits to SKr1.39bn from SKr1.25bn while sales improved by 15 per cent to SKr6.7bn from SKr5.84bn. The company also prospered in other parts of its business activities. Operating profit in the food division rose by 16 per cent to SKr141m from SKr122m while as a result of the record-breaking hot Swedish summer beverage operating profits climbed by 35 per cent to SKr145m from SKr107m for the first half.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Urumqi, February 17 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region seized favorable opportunities  and made remarkable progress in major economic construction  fields last year.    Local officials told reporters that the gross domestic  product of the autonomous region was expected to reach 37.7  billion yuan in 1993, an increase of 10 percent compared with  the corresponding figure of 1992, while local revenue grew by  33.1 percent to 3.47 billion yuan.    Big increases were also seen in total agricultural and  industrial output value, imports and exports, the amount of  promised foreign investment, and investment in fixed assets,  according to the report.    Further reform measures in rural areas have greatly  emancipated the productive forces of the autonomous region's  countryside and pastoral areas, the officials said.    By 1993 Xinjiang had been blessed with bumper harvests in  agriculture and animal husbandry for 16 years running. Last  year, the output of grain and cotton was expected to reach seven  million tons and 700,000 tons, respectively, said the officials,  adding that Xinjiang has become China's No. 1 producer of cotton.    At the same time, the continuation of the policies for  opening border areas has promoted the opening-up drive of the  whole autonomous region.    Last year, Xinjiang scored an increase of 30.6 percent in  its  imports and exports, and did 910 million U.S. dollars in foreign  trade.    The region has approved the establishment of 363  foreign-funded enterprises in the past year, involving an actual  use of 55 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds, while working  hard to promote economic and technological co-operation with  inland areas, and setting up its own economic and technological  development zones.    As an effort to improve conditions for economic construction  and to create a better environment for opening, the region has  speeded up its building of basic facilities over the past few  years.    In 1993 alone, Xinjiang invested 22.6 billion yuan in fixed  assets and launched 35 major construction projects, including  the double-tracking of 475.5 km of the railway from Lanzhou to  Urumqi, building or rebuilding nine major highways, and the  construction of the plant with a designed capacity of 140,000  tons of ethylene.    In the meantime, Xinjiang region scored a series of  breakthroughs in prospecting for oil and natural gas, nonferrous  metals and other natural resources last year. It produced 10.35  million tons of crude oil in that year and gained a processing  capacity of 7.65 million tons of crude oil a year.    Local residents benefited from the overall economic  development of the region. For instance, the per capita income  for farmers and herdsmen of the region amounted to 780 yuan, up  5.4 percent compared with the level of the previous year.    This year the local government has decided to continue to  concentrate on the development of farming, energy,  transportation and telecommunications, as well as on the  building of infrastructure, industries serving the development  of oil and gas, light and processing industries with farm and  sideline products as the raw materials, and the establishment of  rural and township businesses in the fields of industry and the  service trades, according to the officials.</p>

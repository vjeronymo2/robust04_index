			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Further cuts in Japanese car exports to Europe agreed THE EUROPEAN Commission and Japanese authorities agreed at the weekend to cut the number of cars entering the European Community from Japan this year to 980,000 units, a fall of some 17.6 per cent from last year's level. The deal, which was reached in Tokyo after two days of intense talks, goes much further than an earlier agreement in April that, given the weakness of the European car market, Japanese exports to the EC should be reduced by 9.4 per cent to 1.09m units. The agreement favours the EC car industry at the expense of Japanese makers, which were hoping to keep the figure above 1m units. Japan was, however, able to win agreement that the level of Japanese exports could be adjusted mid-year, not only if EC market conditions deteriorated substantially, but also if they improved. The two sides reached an understanding only after a second session of talks on Friday extended throughout the night to about midday on Saturday. Exports to the UK are maintained under the new agreement at 202,800 on the grounds that market conditions are improving there. Exports to France are to fall to 69,000 from an initially agreed 77,300, while those to Italy are down to 38,800 from 42,900, Spain to 29,300 from 34,200 and Portugal to 39,000 from 41,500. Under a monitoring arrangement aimed at gradually opening up the EC market to Japanese car exports, Japan limits the number of cars it exports to the EC to a mutually agreed level. This arrangement is due to end with full liberalisation in 1999. The agreement in April was based on a forecast by the European Commission that the EC car market would fall 6.5 per cent this year to 13m units. However, EC automotive demand fell 18.5 per cent in the first seven months of the year. The latest agreement is based on mutual recognition that demand for cars in the EC market will reach some 11.7m units in 1993. Although the Japanese authorities had recognised the weakness of car demand in the EC, and were in principle agreed that a reduction would be necessary, they had at first resisted the EC's request, in part out of fear of setting an unwanted precedent. The Japanese car industry, which has been under severe pressure from weak demand in its home market and fierce competition in the US in the wake of a higher yen, expressed a mixture of concern and resignation. 'Our basic stance is that given the weakness of the EC market, it cannot be helped,' a Toyota official said. It is unlikely Japanese car exports would have been much greater than the level agreed at the weekend. Exports to the EC were already down 16 per cent in the first six months of the year.

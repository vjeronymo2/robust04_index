Mr Alexandra said talks floundered after a  media statement attributed to ANC President Nelson Mandela  demanded a declaration of assets ahead of the election pact.  "The PAC will contest the election on its own, in its own  name," he said. Mr Alexander said the ANC was pursuing the  election pact as a merger between two companies, which indicated  a lack of commitment on the part of the organisation.</p>

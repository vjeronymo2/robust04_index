			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Challenge to Guinness rulings fails MR Roger Seelig, one of the defendants in the forthcoming second Guinness trial, has failed in an attempt to challenge rulings by the trial judge. In the High Court yesterday two judges refused Mr Seelig, former corporate finance director of Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, leave to seek judicial review of four decisions of Mr Justice Henry in pre-trial hearings. Lord Justice Russell and Mr Justice Hodgson said they could find no flaw in the trial judge's rulings and Mr Seelig did not have an arguable case for judicial review. Mr Seelig, who faces conspiracy and false accounting charges, complained that Mr Justice Henry had set aside a summons to produce documents that Mr Seelig wanted from the Department of Trade and Industry; refused to stop the criminal proceedings against him on the grounds of abuse of legal process, delay and unfairness; and twice refused to reopen his abuse application and invite the prosecution to call certain witnesses, including officials from the DTI. Lord Justice Russell said that Mr Seelig alleged a conspiracy between DTI inspectors investigating Guinness who had interviewed him, DTI officials and the prosecuting authorities. The documents he wanted disclosed were notes of meetings between them. The DTI had opposed disclosure, claiming that the majority of the documents were covered by legal professional privilege and some by public interest immunity, while others were not likely to be material evidence at the trial. Mr Justice Henry had seen nothing sinister in those meetings and had been satisfied that there had been no misconduct by the inspectors or any abuse of their powers. Lord Justice Russell said Mr Seelig did not have an arguable case that Mr Justice Henry's rulings had been seriously flawed, unreasonable or irrational, and there was nothing to suggest that the judge had incorrectly exercised his discretion in deciding that, despite delays and publicity, Mr Seelig could get a fair trial. The court had imposed reporting restrictions under the Contempt of Court Act when the hearing began on Wednesday but lifted them to permit yesterday's judgment to be reported.</p>

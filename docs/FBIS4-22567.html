			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Siegfried Thielbeer: "Estonia as Bridge to </F> Russia. Between Dispute Over Principles and Pragmatism"]    [Text] Tallinn, Mar--While in Moscow one can occasionally  hear threats in regard to the alleged suppression of the Russian  minority in Estonia--there is even talk of a bloodbath,  apartheid, and deportation--and in Tallinn Russia is accused  time and again because of the delays in troop withdrawal and  alleged imperial intentions, the situation in the country itself  is absolutely quiet. Neither are the human rights of the  Russians disregarded--only the right to vote in parliamentary  elections is witheld from noncitizens--nor are there  "deportations." Estonians and Russians get along well in their  daily contacts, even if most Estonians in the depth of their  heart would really like the "occupation Russians" out of their  country and the Russians fear precisely this. But there is a  gaping difference between heart and mind, and the Estonians,  too, know that they cannot drive the Russians across the border.  They see the humanitarian problems. And for the Russians it is  much more important to take part in the Estonian economic  miracle and to earn kroons than to flirt with the "ruble zone,"  even if they are annoyed about the demand to apply for residence  permits.    In the daily contacts, even when there are occasional  provocations, the tone of voice is recitative in the Nordic  manner. The Russians, too, have become more "Nordic" in the  meantime. The striving to live together in harmony is  unmistakable. In Estonia, just like in Latvia, there have never  been serious incidents between the nationalities. Even the  grumbling in the lines has stopped, because one no longer has to  stand in line: The atmosphere in the shops has become relaxed  and friendly, as in the West. The Estonian Government, too,  especially Prime Minister Laar, refers to the fact that the  situation in the country is quiet and that unfortunately a  completely false impression is created by the saber-rattling in  Moscow. There are continuous assurances to the effect that there  really are no difficulties with the Russian minority. Once the  Russian troop withdrawal is complete, so goes the argument, then  even the last old Stalinists in Estonia, who up to now regarded  Estonian independence as a temporary episode, will realize that  they must obey Estonian laws. Up to now, they say, the old  Russian leaders have done a disservice to their own cause, for  example by thundering against the language requirement for  Estonian citizenship, instead of learning the language. Once the  occupation army is out of the country and the sovereignty of  Estonia is restored, they say, it will be possible to be more  generous toward the Russian minority.    Behind the dispute over principles--Estonia wants Moscow to  admit that it occupied Estonia in 1940--and the Russian threats  to protect the Russians with "sanctions" if necessary, there is  concealed a network of pragmatic cooperation, including between  the nations and the economic actors. In the negotiations about  technical details of the troop withdrawal, say about the removal  of the stocks of mines and ammunitions, as well as the nuclear  reactors of the Paldiski submarine base, the experts are finding  agreeable solutions. Estonia suspects that the Russian military  pensioners could form a fifth column. But the pension transfers  to the barely 11,000 former officers from the Russian Ministry  of Defense are cleared smoothly through Estonian banks. During  the past year, Russia has reduced the number of its troops to  approximately 2,000 officers and noncommissioned officers,  because wages and food provisioning suddenly had to be paid for  in kroons. In the Estonian Ministry of Defense and in the high  command, Estonian former colonels of the Soviet Army are  performing their service in civilian clothes because, in  Estonian uniform, they would lose their Moscow pension.    In spite of the far-reaching reorientation to Western  markets, the foreign trade between Estonia and Russia is again  increasing, especially through agricultural exports into the  region of St. Petersburg. Tallinn, so Estonian Foreign Minister  Luik emphasizes, is the second most important port of  transshipment for Western humanitarian transports to Russia. And  without the in part highly-skilled Russian workers in the  industrial plants, many of whom at one time belonged to the  Soviet armament industry, the economic upswing of the country  could not be attained, as people in the Estonian Ministry of  Economics, in the Estonian Government in general, and among most  of the parties, know. In terms of investments of foreign firms  in Estonia, Russia--after Sweden, Finland, and America--is still  before Germany in fourth place. What is the point of the Russian  threat of sanctions, in the meantime taken back by Prime  Minister Chernomyrdin in Helsinki, if Estonia receives its oil  no longer from Russia, but through private and international  enterprises such as Neste and Statoil? Whether Neste or Statoil  fill their tankers with Russian or Norwegian oil depends, above  all, on the prices. Only with respect to natural gas supplies is  Estonia dependent to the extent of 100 percent on Russian  shipments. The Russian Gazprom gas concern, however, long ago  for a great deal of money bought 30 percent of the shares of  Eesti Gaas [Estonian Gas]. For Gazprom--where Chernomyrdin once  was a director--the sales against Estonian currency at world  market prices is important.    Estonia, so says Foreign Minister Luik, could be a bridge  between East and West--not politically, as once Finland under  Kekkonen wanted to be, but economically. Many Estonian firms, he  pointed out, have close contacts with Russian firms. Through the  "Russian" firms with Russian workers and managers, he suggested,  splendid contact with the economy of Russia could be established  from Estonia. The traffic system and information infrastructure,  he added, are rather well-developed.    If the Russian leaders today complain about the fact that  the  Baltic states do not thank Russia and Yeltsin for granting them  independence, he suggested, this is rather their problem with  their own past. To the contrary, the Russians actually should be  grateful to the Balts. For through their aspiration for  independence and democracy, he said, they contributed to the  breaking up of the Soviet system and the democratization of  Russia. The Russians, too, could learn from the Estonian  economic miracle through shock therapy, said Prime Minister  Laar. According to him, Russia's problem is not that it was  subjected to too much shock therapy, but that it received too  little of it. Foreign Minister Luik said that Russia, in which  politics no longer determines the economy, also has an interest  in a strong, independent Estonia. As a satellite, he suggested,  Estonia is economically worthless for Russia. It is valuable, by  contrast, he said, as a partner, if it has a stable currency,  and a stable democracy and is economically prosperous.</p>

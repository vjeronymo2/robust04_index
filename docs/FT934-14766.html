			<p>931015 FT  15 OCT 93 / Russia's breadwinners and losers: The needy are replacing grain producers in the pecking order RUSSIA today enters a brave new world of freed bread prices in a reform that switches subsidies from inefficient grain producers to impoverished consumers. A likely tripling in prices will be softened with a monthly bread subsidy of Rbs1,400 for about 60m people - almost a third of Russia's population. The subsidy is enough to buy at least four loaves a month at prices expected to jump from Rbs100 to about Rbs300-400. Natalya is an office manager on a monthly salary of Rbs50,000. 'The new price will be a noose around our neck,' she complained, pausing in front of the bread shelves at a Moscow grocery store yesterday. Tamara, a house-painter earning three times as much, shrugged cheerfully. 'We'll continue eating bread whatever happens. Otherwise we'll stop existing.' Today's price reform is 'not an experiment', says Mr Yevgeny Tiurin, vice-president of Roskhlebprodukt, the state grain purchasing agency. 'It is the introduction of a normal system.' Roskhlebprodukt is responsible for delivering grain from the state farms to big cities, the army, and regions which do not produce their own grain. Until now one of its main functions has been to 'squeeze' the Finance Ministry for subsidies to make up the difference between the price at which farms sell grain and the artificially low price charged to flour-mills and bread-baking enterprises. These have been respectively Rbs80,000 and Rbs24,000 per tonne of grain. Ms Liudmila Vronina, the official at the Social Welfare Ministry responsible for the new system, says the subsidies to help the poorest members of society to buy bread at free prices are already up and running in many parts of the country, including Moscow. The monthly subsidy will be automatically added to all pensions, and is also being given to all unemployed, invalids, army officers' wives (as part of the Yeltsin government's policy to keep the army on side), students, and children, regardless of their background. Working Russians earning less than Rbs14,620 - the minimum pension level, as the authorities have no other means of measuring the minium subsistence level - will also qualify. For the government's hard-pressed budget, it should mean a big reduction - up to two thirds - in bread-related subsidies and, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the finance minister, hopes, a reduction of wasted funds and inefficiency. The total savings on the bread subsidy reform, had it been in effect from the beginning of the year, could have been as high as Rbs700bn at current prices. The expected budget deficit this year is Rbs20trillion. In another reform move, the government plans to do away with a make-believe credit system for collective and state-owned farming - whereby money is printed by the central bank but never repaid by borrowers. The government intends to switch to straight subsidies to finance fuel and other farm inputs. Mr Fyodorov says that credits for agriculture and Russia's remote northern regions, which buy all their food produce ahead of the winter, when transport becomes virtually impossible, account for two-thirds of subsidised central bank credits. Politically, these moves will anger the old co-operatives and state-owned farming lobby which has depended heavily on guaranteed grain prices for surviving without genuine economic reforms. But the government says it has nothing to lose from a section of the population which will vote against its policies whatever it does. The reform is also expected to make it profitable for bakeries to sell bread. To prevent them from selling clothes, drinks and cigarettes at profitable prices instead of unprofitable bread, the government has told them they must continue selling bread for three years after privatisation. Most shops in Moscow and many other parts of the country have already been privatised.</p>

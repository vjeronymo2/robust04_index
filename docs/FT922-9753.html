			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mine lock-out to hit Canadian coal exports CANADA'S BIGGEST coal mine will halt export shipments later this week after locking out 1,100 members of the United Mine Workers of America trade union. Westar Mining, which owns the Balmer mine in south-east British Columbia, closed the mine at the end of last week within hours of a vote by union members to reject a management contract offer. A Westar official said that the mine had low stocks at the time of the lock-out. A shipment of coal for Korea, expected to be loaded in Vancouver by the end of this week, will be the last until the mine reopens. The official said, however, that shipments from Westar's Greenhills mine will continue without interruption. Balmer exports almost its entire output of 6m tonnes a year. About two-thirds of the total is sold to steel mills in Korea, Japan and Taiwan, but the mine has customers in about a dozen other countries as well. Workers at the mine have been without a contract since the end of last year. Westar has demanded a two-year wage freeze and numerous changes in work practices to bring down costs as part of efforts to tackle its severe financial problems. Westar, which suffered a CDollars 6.4m (Pounds 3m) first-quarter loss, has been talking to lenders about rescheduling its CDollars 330m debt. It missed an interest payment due last week, and has warned that the Balmer mine cannot survive without concessions from banks and workers. The British Columbian government earlier this week sent an industrial relations mediator to Balmer. Even if his efforts are successful however, the mine is expected to remain closed for at least another two weeks.</p>

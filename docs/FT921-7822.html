			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Attempt to rescue Hong Kong BCCI collapses THE Hong Kong subsidiary of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International is almost certain to go into liquidation after the collapse of negotiations between the receiver and a potential buyer. Mr Noel Gleeson, the receiver, said his talks with the Hong Kong Chinese Bank - a subsidiary of the Indonesian-owned Lippo Group leading the buy-out team - could go no further after the discovery of previously unrecorded claims of more than HKDollars 2bn (Dollars 145m) against Bank of Credit and Commerce Hong Kong (BCCHK). Most of these claims came to light in recent weeks from liquidators of BCCI operations in Britain, the US, Japan, Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands. Although Mr Gleeson doubted if these claims would succeed in court the fact of their registration meant they had to be considered when assessing the financial health of BCCHK. An undertaking by the Abu Dhabi owners of BCCI to guarantee Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.2m) of the unrecorded claims - having previously indicated they would underwrite all those claims - was insufficient to allow Hong Kong Chinese Bank to continue. Mr Hamish MacLeod, the colony's financial secretary, said the balance had now shifted in favour of liquidating the bank. Mr Gleeson will appear before the Supreme Court on March 2 when he expects the court to order liquidation. The BCCHK affair has reflected poorly on the Hong Kong government. On July 5, the day BCCI was shut down by co-ordinated action of bank regulators around the world, Mr David Carse, the colony's banking commissioner, issued a statement reassuring depositors that the bank was 'sound and viable'. Mr Carse closed the bank three days later. It has since emerged that BCCHK has a negative net worth, although the scale of this has not been revealed. Depositors, who feel they were misled by the government, have called for an independent inquiry. Hong Kong Chinese Bank said that while many of the technical problems of buying BCCHK had been resolved the emergence of the latest substantial claims had meant negotiations could not go further. Hong Kong Chinese Bank's takeover plans were last week dealt a blow when China Resources, a large diversified company owned by China's ministry of foreign economic relations and trade, withdrew from its consortium. Mr Gleeson said BCCHK was one of the best and most honestly run arms of the BCCI empire. It had more than HKDollars 4bn cash on deposit. However, he declined to say whether his investigations had uncovered any wrongdoing. Depositors of BCCHK have received a pay-out equal to 25 per cent of their deposits, up to a limit of HKDollars 500,000. Mr Gleeson said he expected a pay-out of a further 15 per cent this year, and eventually depositors could expect 70 to 75 per cent of their money back.</p>

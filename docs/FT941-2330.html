			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Left set to force second poll in Salvador The race for the presidency in El Salvador is likely to go to a second round, according to preliminary results of Sunday's poll - the first to be held since the end of a bloody civil war two years ago. With 75 per cent of the votes counted the supreme electoral tribunal declared that Mr Armando Calderon Sol of the ruling Arena party was ahead of Mr Ruben Zamora by 49.26 per cent to 25.59 per cent. Mr Zamora is running for a left-wing coalition including the former FMLN guerrillas. A first round victory would require 50 per cent or more of the vote. President of the tribunal, Mr Lus Arturo Zaldivar said: 'Looking at the results we have been giving, it makes us think that, yes, there will be a second election.' Observers say that although Mr Calderon Sol would be favourite to win a second round, the right-wing party's failure to secure an outright win would help provide greater checks and balances in El Salvador's fledgling democracy. A second election for president would be held on April 24. Mr Calderon Sol had predicted victory in the first round. The elections have proved a notable success for the FMLN, which has become the second most important political force in the country, two years after it laid down arms following a United Nations-brokered peace agreement. The FMLN, which was running its own candidates in simultaneous congressional and municipal elections will now head the opposition in congress and appears to have won a substantial number of municipalities, particularly in areas which it controlled during the 12-year civil war. Election day was marred by irregularities, which the left-wing coalition said amounted to fraud on the part of the electoral tribunal, controlled by Arena. The coalition claimed that various strategies had been used throughout the electoral process to reduce the number of voters, on the premise that a high turnout would favour the left. 'The tribunal has done everything to impede the holding of a proper democratic election,' said Mr Facundo Guardado, a senior FMLN official. Tens of thousands of voters who had electoral cards were unable to vote because they did not appear on electoral lists, while some 74,000 people, a high number of which were from areas believed to be sympathetic to the FMLN, were excluded because they did not have birth certificates. FMLN leaders put the the total number of excluded voters at over 300,000. Most of these are new voters who, they believe, are more likely to support a left-wing coalition. The UN mission in El Salvador, which has highlighted the country as a success story for peace where democracy is being consolidated, played down the irregularities. However, independent observers have questioned the will of the tribunal to ensure the election was as free and fair as possible.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / People: John Kerwin packs it in John Kerwin, 47, is quitting as sales director of Dalepak, the frozen foods group, after falling out with chief executive Chris Ivory. Kerwin, who has been with the company for 14 years, has resigned from the board and will be leaving the company once the terms have been settled. Dalepak, based in North Yorkshire, has been going through a difficult period. It is a big supplier to Britain's major supermarket chains and its profits have been squeezed by the rise in the cost of its imported raw materials and an inability to pass on these increases to customers. The company gave three profit warnings last year and cut its dividend at the halfway stage when it reported a 13 per cent fall in sales of its main frozen foods business. Peter Holley, Dalepak's finance director, said yesterday that Kerwin's departure followed a disagreement over the way the company should organise its sales effort. Ivory, the chief executive, wanted to get more involved with the big customers like Tesco, Sainsbury, Asda and Kwik-Save. The two executives 'did not see eye to eye' on the matter and Kerwin will be leaving the company by mutual agreement. He will not be replaced and Dalepak's sales teams will now report to Ivory. Holley stressed that there was 'absolutely no connection' between Kerwin's departure and Dalepak's full year figures which will be released on July 26.</p>

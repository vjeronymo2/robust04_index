			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Liffe drops Globex talks THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe), Europe's largest derivatives exchange, has pulled out of negotiations to join Globex, the after-hours electronic futures trading system. The suspension of the year-long talks was described as 'mutually agreed'. But the discussions were derailed two weeks ago when the Chicago Board of Trade ruled that Liffe would not be able to list its successful German bond contracts on the system. 'This does not bode well for Globex,' said one market participant. 'It shows that the exchanges behind Globex are putting their own interests first.' A year after the launch of Globex, France's Matif is the only futures exchange to have listed its products on the system, which was jointly developed by the CBOT, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters, at an estimated cost of Dollars 80m. The bulk of the 200,000 contracts traded so far this month were Matif products. Liffe had been given a list of the products which it would be allowed to trade on Globex which included its Bund future contracts - its second most actively traded product. In a memo to CME members, Mr Jack Sandner reported that: 'On July 21, 1993, the Chicago Boad of Trade instructed me, as Chairman of Globex, to inform Liffe that Bund futures and options should be withdrawn from the list of products available to Liffe.' Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, described the decision to exclude the Bund contracts as 'an insurmountable barrier' to Liffe joining Globex, even though some other problems had been ironed out. No senior CBOT officials were available to comment on the change of heart. However, the CBOT gained approval from its regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to trade Bund and gilt futures several years ago. Although these products have not yet been listed, the CBOT is believed to be hoping to develop, and eventually list on Globex, its own Bund futures. However, previous attempts by US exchanges to build up liquid markets in European interest-rate products have not been successful.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by "a responsible source at the Defense </F> Ministry"; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] Our air, naval, and ground Armed Forces have  repulsed the iniquitous and aggressive and treacherous attacks  launched by the military ruling regime in Sanaa today on all  fronts. Our forces were able on the Abyan, Karish, Tawr  al-Bahah, and Kharaz fronts to defeat the invading aggressors  having delivered against them crushing blows and inflicting on  them the following human and material losses: four enemy  aircraft shot down, the destruction of three tanks, six Katyusha  rocket-launching vehicles, and three (Dushka) crews; five tanks,  four Katyusha-launching vehicles, and three crews captured;  hundreds of enemy officers and men killed, and numbers of others  captured or surrendered. Our heroic forces continue decisively  to repulse and pursue the remnants of conspiracy, aggression,  and invasion pressed by the military ruling regime in Sanaa on  all the battlefronts for the 45th day since the start of their  aggressive destructive war against our people.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: We Should Discuss Japan's Bid for UNSC </F> Permanent Membership]    [Text] Hisashi Owada, ambassador to the United Nations, at  a meeting held by the working group on reforming the UN Security  Council [UNSC], announced: "Japan is willing to do its best as  a permanent member of the Security Council to work for world  security and stability."    His comment indicates in clearer terms than before the  government's stance that it wants to obtain a permanent seat in  the UNSC to contribute to the international community.    Becoming a permanent member of the UNSC is an extremely  important choice for Japan to make because it will determine its  future course. However, no thorough discussions on this issue  have yet been held, even in the Diet. We are deeply concerned  that the government has repeatedly indicated its intention to  seek a permanent seat in the UNSC while making no efforts to  answer questions from the people or to form a national consensus.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has long displayed a positive  attitude toward obtaining the permanent membership. At a  question-and-answer session held at the Diet last month, he  expressed his willingness by saying: "If Japan, a nonnuclear  nation, joins the UNSC as a permanent member, it will strengthen  UN functions."    In his speech given at the UN General Assembly last fall,  former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely showed a moderate  stance on Japan's bid to become a permanent UNSC member.  Regarding the UNSC reform issue, he said: "It is important to  actively make good use of the member nations, which have the  will and capability to contribute to world prosperity and  stability."    It must be pointed out that "prosperity and stability" in  Hosokawa's speech was changed to "security and stability" in  Owada's remarks. Obviously, the Hata administration has gone a  step further than the former administration.    Diplomatic authorities seem to think that Owada's recent  remarks only indicate an already established policy in line with  the stance expressed by Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa.    However, what is the meaning of Japan's joining the UNSC,  which is comprised of five nuclear power nations, and how should  Japan think of responsibilities and obligations to protect  security in view of its pacifist Constitution? Regarding these  basic questions, it cannot be said that we have had satisfactory  discussions and explanations.    At the aforementioned question-and-answer session, Tomiichi  Mirayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan  [SDPJ], called for revision or abolishment of the current UNSC  permanent membership system and said: "Being a major power in  the United Nations, obtaining an important post in the old  United Nations should not be Japan's UN diplomatic objective."  Although the Hata administration is expecting the SDPJ to  return to the coalition, there still is a large gap between them  regarding the issue of permanent UNSC membership.    Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger] head Masayoshi Takemura even  directly criticized the government by saying: "I doubt it is a  good idea for the government to repeatedly express at diplomatic  venues the positive stance of becoming a permanent member before  forming a national consensus."    Because political leaders and parties have been absorbed in  the political warfare under the current fluid political  condition, they failed to deepen discussions on such important  issue. This must be called political negligence. However, this  does not mean that politicians should let bureaucrats take over  the issue without going through formalities and making efforts  to form a national consensus.    From the statement that Japan was asked to submit to the  International Court of Justice to present its opinion on the  legal status of the use of nuclear weapons, the government just  deleted a sentence that said the use of nuclear weapons "is not  necessarily a violation of international law." This must be  taken as a lesson and the government must realize that a  diplomatic stance will not be established without taking the  people's will and sentiments into consideration.    On one hand, Prime Minister Hata explained how significant  it  is for Japan, "a nonnuclear nation," to become a permanent  member of the UNSC. On the other hand, he accepted the Foreign  Ministry's view that "the use of nuclear weapons is not a  violation of the law" -- a view shared by nuclear nations --  until criticism erupted from various sectors. This indicates  how shaky his determination is to carry through Japan's stance  in the UNSC.    Therefore, we must immediately start in-depth discussion on  what is the meaning of Japan's pursuing permanent UNSC  membership by taking various viewpoints into consideration.</p>

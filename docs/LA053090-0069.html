			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Pit Bull News: Executives at a Denver television station have defended their  staff's videotaping of an illegal pit bull fight as "legitimate news-gathering  activities." KCNC-TV General Manager Roger Ogden said station employees who  attended and videotaped a fight in September didn't realize at the time that it  was illegal. The station and police agencies began an investigation this month  after allegations were made by anonymous sources that KCNC staged a fight  between two dogs for reporter Wendy Bergen's series.

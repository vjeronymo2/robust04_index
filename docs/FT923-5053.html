			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Iraq faces protest for jailing Briton BRITAIN is to issue a stern protest to Iraq after the discovery that Baghdad has imposed a 10-year jail sentence on Mr Michael Wainwright, a Briton charged will illegal entry into the country. The sentence, which the Foreign Office described as 'totally disproportionate', follows the jailing last week of another Briton, Mr Paul Ride, 33, for seven years on the same charge. The detentions come soon after the start of British, US and French air force operations to police a 'no-fly zone' in southern Iraq and provocatively recall President Saddam Hussein's policy of keeping westerners as 'hostages' during the early months of the Gulf crisis in 1990. Mr Zuhair Ibrahim, who represents Baghdad's interests from the Jordanian embassy in London, will be summoned to the Foreign Office today 'with some urgency' to receive an official protest at the sentence and a demand that Mr Wainwright and Mr Ride be released. Mr Wainwright, 42, was arrested in April near Mosul in northern Iraq after entering the country from Turkey while on a cycling tour. However, his detention was confirmed only last month after his family received a letter from him explaining his plight of being detained in Iraq. The scale of Mr Wainwright's sentence was learned at the weekend after he was visited by Red Cross officials. Mr Ride was arrested last month after having allegedly wandered into Iraq from Kuwait. The families of both men have denied they were spies. Both men were visited in Baghdad's Abu Graib prison last weekend by members of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who described them as 'in good health and good spirits'. A Red Cross spokesman said the pair appeared well treated. Although the Foreign Office said 'all possible means' would be employed to win the pair's release, the combination of Iraq's present hostility to the west and its recent history of provocative intransigence bodes ill for any swift release for the two men. President Saddam said yesterday he was arming tribesmen in the southern marshes to help them fight infiltrators from Iran who were taking advantage of western air cover over southern Iraq, Reuter reports from Baghdad. 'We are sending a lot of weapons to the tribes,' the president said in a ceremony honouring members of Iraq's ruling Ba'ath party and marsh tribesmen who were said to have crushed an Iranian-backed infiltration attempt in Qurna last week.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by North Korean affairs desk reporter An Hui-chang: </F> "Suspicion of the Status of Kim Pyong-il Who Returned Amid Rumor  on His Seeking Political Asylum--Discord With Kim Chong-il Over  Succession to Power"]    [Text] "The cases in which Kim Chong-il has exercised his  power have been considerably reduced and major policies,  including the nuclear issue, are being directly handled by Kim  Il-song," and "Kim Chong-il's face, occasionally seen in public,  does not look healthy, thus causing the people to suspect that  something unusual is happening." Amid this situation, the  observation that Kim Chong-il's position "is not firm" was  quickly raised since the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party  Central Committee was held last December. Kim Chong-il's close  associates, including Kim Tal-hyon, were demoted during the  session. Under these circumstances, the movements of Kim  Pyong-il, Kim Chong-il's half brother, are also arousing the  people's suspicion.    This suspicion was prompted by the fact that Kim Pyong-il,  who was appointed North Korean ambassador to Finland last March,  returned to North Korea after serving only a month and a half in  Finland, and has remained in North Korea for over a month for no  apparent reason.    Kim Pyong-il did not attend a dinner arranged by the Finnish  president for new foreign ambassadors, and hastily left Finland.  Then, what was the reason behind Kim Pyong-il returning to his  home country without even attending the dinner arranged by the  president of a host country, which is regarded as an important  event for diplomats?    First, people believe that he was summoned home for the  purpose of preventing him from seeking political asylum or other  possible unexpected acts. According to the rumor, on his way to  the Helsinki airport to return to North Korea, Kim Pyong-il  muttered that "It would have been better if I had sought  political asylum."    It is a well-known fact that Kim Pyong-il has been subjected  to various types of controls by Kim Chong-il. Kim Pyong-il,  after completing the Namsan senior middle school in 1970,  graduated from the department of politics and economy at the Kim  Il-song University in 1976. He was then commissioned as an  officer of the Ministry of People's Armed Forces (rank was  unknown).    After graduating from the Kim Il-song Military College in  August of 1981, Kim Pyong-il was assigned as military attache at  the North Korean Embassy in Yugoslavia, and served until 1983.  He served in the General Bureau of Security Guard for four years  from 1984, and thus served in a post close to his father. In  1988, however, he was appointed as North Korean ambassador to  Hungary, and resumed his overseas service. Following this, Kim  Pyong-il was appointed as ambassador to Bulgaria in February  1989. After staying in his home country for a while, he assumed  the post of North Korean ambassador to Finland this March.    The fact that the eldest son of Kim Il-song's present wife  is  wandering from place to place as a diplomat clearly illustrates  that Kim Pyong-il has been regarded as a "political rival" by  Kim Chong-il.    It has been learned that even after Kim Pyong-il was sent  overseas, Kim Chong-il mercilessly purged the figures showing  intimacy and familiarity with Kim Pyong-il among his schoolmates  and associates.    Ko Yong-hwan, a former North Korean diplomat who defected to  the ROK some time ago, explains how Kim Pyong-il has been held  in check by Kim Chong-il.    "On the day Kim Pyong-il arrived in Sofia as the North  Korean  ambassador to Bulgaria, the embassy's party secretary directed  the staff to greet the ambassador at the airport. However, only  two went to the airport, including the party secretary himself,  among some 30 embassy staff members. This was because if one  meets Kim Pyong-il, one must prepare a report in the form of a  document noting how long and by whose directive one met with Kim  Pyong-il, and the content of the conversation with him, and must  forward the report to the State Security Department."    Since Kim Pyong-il has been treated harshly by Kim Chong-il,  it is possible that he may commit any kind of unexpected act,  and this report was aimed at collecting information regarding  his activities and preventing him from committing an unexpected  act. His recent summoning seems to have a similar purpose.    The other observation has been focused on the "indication of  abnormality" within the North Korean power structure.    According to remarks of the people who recently visited  North  Korea, including Reverend Billy Graham who visited there last  February, Kim Il-song is personally handling overall policies.  As a result, "delicate relations" with Kim Chong-il have been  created.    In particular, the return of Kim Yong-chu--Kim Il-song's  brother--to power as vice president after 20 years, reflects to  a certain degree that Kim Il-song feels somewhat uneasy in  turning over his power to Kim Chong-il.    However, the dominant observation is that the view that Kim  Pyong-il's recent movements are related to Kim Chong-il's  succession to power is premature.    At any rate, a precise observation of the movements within  the North Korean power structure surrounding Kim Pyong-il will  be possible only after his return to Finland.</p>

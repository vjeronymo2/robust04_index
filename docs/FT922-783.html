			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (5): Socialist roots of a master tactician - Profile: Arjun Singh ON THE shelf of his study at his home in New Delhi, Mr Arjun Singh, minister for human resources and a future contender for the premiership, has a bust of Lenin. He defends the founder of the Soviet Union as a radical reformer. 'As a human being, he has a right to a home'. But to the visitor, the portrait of Lenin is a signal of where Mr Arjun Singh wants to position himself in the Congress party. In contrast to Mr Narasimha Rao, who comes from the south and has become a protagonist for economic liberalism, Mr Singh is from the Hindi-speaking north and voices the party's socialist roots and the anguish of its traditional electoral base among the rural poor. Mr Rao sought to silence Mr Singh's criticism of the government's shift to pro-market policies by naming him as chairman of the committee set up to draft the economic policy document presented to the party's main policy-making body - the All India Congress Committee - at its session at Tirupati in April. A master tactician, Mr Singh characteristically drafted a policy platform that had the party facing two ways at once - endorsing the Nehruvian socialism of its past while giving Mr Rao a free hand over liberalisation. But the statement in the document that there will be no retrenchment in the public sector - only retraining - bears his hand. At the same time Mr Singh used the Tirupati session to distance himself from Mr Rao and demonstrate his credentials as his successor. He urged elections to the Congress Working Committee (CWS) which runs the day-to- day affairs of the party - a departure from a past in which Mrs Gandhi and her son Rajiv nominated loyalists to the party's top jobs. In the election that followed, Mr Singh was the candidate who won most support with 435 votes. Working hand in hand with Mr Sharad Pawar, the minister of defence, he organised a list of names that won bloc support from the northern states. Mr Rao was miffed at what he considered a challenge to his authority and asked all those who were elected to resign. Both Mr Singh and Mr Pawar refused. After weeks of deadlock, the two ministers came up with the compromise that they would resign if Mr Rao at the same time nominated them to the committee. The prime minister agreed. Having made his point, Mr Singh now pooh-poohs any idea that he is a contender for the post of party leader or prime minister. 'Not by any chance,' he says. 'Don't be under a false illusion.' He adds: 'What I consider of primary importance is that we have to maintain unity in the Congress party and remain solidly behind the prime minister.' Urbane and unfailingly courteous, Mr Singh does not look the socialist politician that he was before joining the Congress. A voracious reader and a pragmatist, he would probably adapt his policies to circumstances as prime minister. Mr Singh has responsibility for education as minister for human resources. But he shows no sign of bending to pressure from the World Bank and the international donor community to make primary education compulsory. 'To bring in compulsion does not go well,' he says. A former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh - the large central Indian state where the BJP is now in power - Mr Singh also leads the wing in the Congress that favours confrontation with the Hindu radical party. He has been at odds on this with the prime minister, who believes that the Congress needed BJP support to pass its economic policies. Mr Singh had to step down from the post of chief minister in 1989 after his family was implicated in a lottery scandal in the state. Now he takes a tough attitude towards foreign banks which have overstepped the law in the Bombay stock market scandal. 'The laws of the country have to be observed,' he says. 'If they have violated the laws - Indian or foreign banks - the law will take its own course.'</p>

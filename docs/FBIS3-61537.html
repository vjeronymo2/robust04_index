			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Pokrovskiy, under the rubric </F> ``Science'': ``Expertise Becomes Independent''; first paragraph  is DELOVOY MIR introduction]    [Text] The council of the Russian Basic Research Fund  [RFFI] has approved several documents that regulate virtually  all actions of its staff and experts, which will make it  possible to settle any conflict situations and, as a result, to  enhance the effectiveness of RFFI.    In essence, the regulatory documents amount primarily to  clear-cut delegation of functions and authority of fund  agencies: fund council, expert councils, executive committee,  body of experts, and fund management. At present, the procedure  of providing expert opinions is as follows. Applications for  funding come to the expert council and two experts (let us  recall that in the 1993 competition, because of the shortage of  personnel we had to limit ourselves to one expert per  application), whose names are kept secret. Each expert qualifies  a project on the basis of several aspects and gives it an  overall rating, using a three-point scale: ``definitely  supported'' (1), ``can be supported'' (0), and ``rejected''  (-1). If all three ratings are positive, the project  automatically receives support.    Each scientific direction (according to the quota approved  by  the fund council) has the right to a specific share of the RFFI  budget. If, after supporting definitely approved projects, it is  not exhausted, projects with one zero and two one's come next,  and so on in descending order. If there are insufficient funds  to support the next batch of applications, they are submitted  for consideration by the expert council. Within the quota  limits, approval of applications is purely automatic.    There has also been a change in structure of the RFFI: there  is approval of the composition of the executive committee, which  assumes some of the duties of the fund council during the period  between its meetings. There has also been approval of expert  councils and composition of the body of experts. Experts are  allowed to submit applications for grants to the RFFI on a  general basis. In the opinion of fund staff, the rules that have  just been adopted are theoretically quite capable of resolving  any conflicts that may arise.    The slogan proposed by its new chairman, Academician  Vladimir  Fortov, is ``Independent expertise with high intellectual  potential.''    In our opinion, everything will depend on how well the new  rules we have described will work. And we are assured that they  must work well because activities of the fund will be automatic,  instead of being subject to influence peddling or the will of  superiors. It seems that the fund's affairs are on the rise.  Incidentally, it receives funds directly from the Ministry of  Finance, rather than through the Ministry of Science, as before.  With today's shortage of money in Russia, the fund receives  almost everything it is supposed to (as does all of science,  about 80 percent): this year, the fund expects to get 24 out of  the 30 billion rubles requested (it has already received 13.5  billion), and it will use these funds to complete the bulk of  its 1993 programs, and first of all the program for individual  and group grants.    At the present time, work is in progress on the concept of  augmenting the sum in the RFFI account by making expert  evaluations of projects having no direct bearing on basic  science. Specialists from institutes of the Russian Academy of  Sciences, institutions of higher learning and industrial  laboratories have been included among the RFFI experts. True,  the fund is not being inundated with orders, although it is  already obvious that very large entities require such a service,  for example, the VPK [military industrial complex]. Negotiations  with customs officials have begun concerning expert evaluation  of materials transported across the frontier. On this score,  Vladimir Fortov stated: ``There is not a single organization in  the country today that could compete with us in intellectual  potential and our independence of other agencies.''    Being a nonprofit organization, the RFFI can receive money  only from the State budget or in the form of voluntary  contributions. I hope that Russian entrepreneurs will hear the  latter, and will realize that science is the highest and main  potential for the future rebirth of Russia. It is time, finally  time to learn that ``gray gold'' is much more precious than  ``black gold.''</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Bay Area All-News Channel: A network affiliate and a public television station  in San Francisco are talking about joining forces to create the first all-news  channel operated by local stations in the United States. KRON-TV, an NBC  affiliate, and public television station KQED would like to launch Bay News  Center in March. It would focus on regional news. The KQED board of directors  is expected to vote Dec. 7 on the proposal. KQED Inc. owns both Channel 9, on  which it broadcasts, and the UHF Channel 32, currently on the air as KQEC, a  part-time sister station to Channel 9. The plan is to use Channel 32 for the  news station. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

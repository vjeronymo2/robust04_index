			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / International Company News: First Chicago to make Dollars 625m special provision FIRST Chicago, the large Chicago-based banking company, is to take a Dollars 625m special provision under a plan to reduce its exposure to the troubled US commercial property market through the sale of some Dollars 2.1bn of its portfolio. Mr Richard Thomas, chairman, said it was cutting its assets because 'we have looked closely at the US commercial property market and see no recovery in the near term.' First Chicago, the 10th largest bank holding company in the US and the parent of First National Bank of Chicago, has been increasingly focusing on serving the retail and middle commercial markets and has been disposing of assets which do not fit this strategy. The commercial property move had been expected, but details helped push First Chicago shares Dollars 2 3/8 higher yesterday to close at Dollars 33 on the New York Stock Exchange. The bank also said it would be adopting fair value accounting for its Dollars 1.1bn venture capital portfolio, with a cumulative pre-tax appreciation conservatively estimated at Dollars 300m. In commercial property, the bank will segregate Dollars 2.1bn of its lowest rated assets into a separate 'held for sale' category and try to dispose of them quickly. The pool includes Dollars 700m of non-performing property and Dollars 1.4bn of performing property loans. In addition to the Dollars 625m provision, to be taken in the third quarter, the bank will allocate Dollars 150m of existing reserves to the 'held for sale' pool. The bank said that after yesterday's action the carrying value of the pool was about 54 per cent of contractual exposure. Before the special reserve, write-downs and existing reserves for the portfolio totalled 20 per cent of contractual exposure.</p>

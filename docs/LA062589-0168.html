			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFORMER TO HEAD HUNGARY'S COMMUNIST PARTY  </P> <P> This country's reform Communists won a decisive battle against conservatives  Saturday when the party, in an unprecedented move, named prominent economist  and reformer Rezso Nyers as the new Communist Party chairman and appointed a  four-man team to steer party politics until the next Communist congress in  October, Hungarian Radio reported.  </P> <P> The decision effectively strips General Secretary Karoly Grosz, 58, of much of  his power and places Hungary's leadership in the hands of a reform-minded  majority that says it wants to transform Hungary into a socialist democracy.  </P> <P> Grosz, who was hailed as a reformer as recently as 13 months ago when he took  power from longtime Communist leader Janos Kadar, has come under increasing  criticism in recent months as a fumbling centrist who lacks the vision to steer  Hungary into the future.  </P> <P> A Communist Party spokesman said that Grosz would retain the title of general  secretary until the party congress, now set for Oct. 7, but that the party will  be run by Grosz, Nyers, reformist Premier Miklos Nemeth, 42, and Minister of  State and Politburo member Imre Pozsgay, 55.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The 'Hungarian Gorbachev'  </P> <P> Pozsgay is called the "Hungarian Gorbachev" by some and is the country's most  popular and closely watched reform politician. He is currently consolidating  support from both party members and opposition groups and is widely expected to  make his move for Hungary's leadership in October.  </P> <P> Nyers, 65, who pioneered Hungary's first economic reforms in the late 1960s but  was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 for advocating rapid change, is enjoying  a comeback today that is rare among East Bloc politicians. He was renamed to  the Politburo in May, 1988, when Grosz took office as part of the progressive  wind that also swept Pozsgay into his Politburo seat.  </P> <P> Nyers assumes an honorary position created for Janos Kadar when he was deposed  as general secretary, but the reinstated reformer has told the Hungarian press  that he intends to play more than just a ceremonial role, although it is not  clear how much power he will actually have. The post has been empty since the  Politburo stripped Kadar, now 77 and in ailing health, of that title last  month.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the party also announced that hard-liner Janos Berecz, a former  Communist Party secretary for ideology and propaganda, would head an institute  for political science that has not yet been founded. This announcement, along  with the others made on Hungarian Radio on Saturday, indicate that Hungary's  reformers have won a battle against hard-liners during a protracted Central  Committee meeting that started Friday morning and continued into Saturday  night.  </P> <P> Opposition party leaders hailed the news.  </P> <P> "I hope that with the leadership of Pozsgay and Nyers, a new party can be  born," said Gabor Demszky, a leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats.  </P> <P> Hungary has made great strides toward economic and political reform in the past  13 months, but critics say Grosz has not kept pace and has in fact angered many  Hungarians by his contradictory and often unclear comments.  </P> <P> The general secretary has also been unable to resolve a growing and now openly  admitted rift between party progressives and more orthodox Communists.  </P> <P> Reform Communists, who are looking ahead to multi-party elections that could be  held by the end of this year, say they must consolidate their numbers and gain  the upper hand in the party's leadership if they hope to win public support at  the polls.  </P> <P> While leading Communists hesitate to criticize Grosz by name, Hungarian  Parliament Speaker Matyas Szuros said Thursday: "A politician who is  inconsistent and makes contradictory statements discredits himself. . . . We  have to prepare for the congress with a leadership whose members are at least  in solidarity with one another and act in harmony."  </P> <P> Rumors that Grosz would resign have abounded for several months. They were  fueled last week when Grosz failed to appear at a meeting with opposition  groups who are working with the Communists to hammer out new property and  election legislation that will then be given to the National Assembly, or  Parliament, to approve.  </P> <P> Instead, the Communist delegation was chaired by Pozsgay. Nyers and Pozsgay  have also gained high marks for attending the ceremony honoring former  Hungarian Premier Imre Nagy, who was given a patriot's burial June 16 after  being executed as a traitor for his role in the 1956 uprising.  </P> <P> Grosz, as leader of the Communist Party, was pointedly excluded from the  ceremony by its organizers. He had further angered many by his remarks about  the Communist Party's attitude toward Nagy, who is now officially recognized as  having been executed after a show trial.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not believe that the current survey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials are subject to the notice and comment procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OBRA '87, the Medicare and Medicaid law and regulations now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contain comprehensive, detailed criteria for assessing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality of care provided to Medicare and Medicaid residents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as well as the standards and methodology for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies. The survey forms, procedures and guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely enable surveyors to certify whether facilities are,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in fact, complying with these binding statutory and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory requirements. These materials do not, in any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way, add to or change these requirements and thus cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterized as ``substantive'' rules; rather, they are a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mixture of ``interpretive rules,'' ``general statements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy,'' and ``rules of agency procedure'' within the meaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A) which excludes such rules from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice and comment requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the course of reviewing comments, it became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apparent that many commenters associated the use of scope  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and severity scales to determine deficiencies with results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that do not depend on using scope and severity scales in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this way. Many commenters were concerned that surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not investigate extenuating circumstances surrounding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations of requirements unless they were required to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scope and severity scales for determining deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This is not the case. The surveyor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines provide surveyors with a consistent structure to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate situations and analyze information prior to making  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance decisions. One such evaluation that surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are directed to make under certain requirements is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of a facility's responsibility for a certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> situation. For example, survey guidelines list situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> where pressure sores may be unavoidable and aid surveyors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether a resident's pressure sore was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preventable or not. This type of guidance is provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many of the resident-centered requirements. In addition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyor training courses stress ways to arrive at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent and accurate conclusions as to facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of commenters requested that we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require surveyors to consider, when identifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies, whether or not the facility identified a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation before the survey and attempted to correct it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We believe that it would be inappropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ignore a failure to prevent a negative outcome, but the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation does allow the competence that the facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated by identifying and addressing the deficiency on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its own initiative to be considered when enforcement action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is selected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain commenters asked that we direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors to determine whether a negative outcome is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result of a resident's refusal of treatment, which is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident's right.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Whenever there appears to be a conflict  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between a resident's right and the resident's health or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety, we do direct the surveyor in the guidance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors to determine if the facility attempted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate both the exercise of the resident's right and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resident's health, including exploration of care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives through a thorough planning process in which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the resident may participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An additional factor that commenters believed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surveyors should take into consideration when determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies is whether the noncompliance occurred because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility was following a physician's orders.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We cannot allow this to be considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency determination. The facility is accountable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providing to the resident the medical services to which he  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or she is entitled as a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and it is the facility's responsibility to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services provided by physicians will satisfy the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations under the Act and regulations. The statute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically contemplates a relationship between a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and either the Secretary or the State in which the facility,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in exchange for certification and payments for the care of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program beneficiaries, commits to provide care in a manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with statutory requirements. A facility cannot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excuse itself from this obligation by deferring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility to an individual (the physician) with whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither the State nor the Secretary has any statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship for the purpose of maintaining compliance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility health and safety standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters were also very concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we correlate the stringency of the enforcement action with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the seriousness of the deficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is not necessary to use scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales when determining deficiencies to ensure this result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We establish criteria for determining remedies in &sect;488.408,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of remedies, and we link infractions with specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of remedial action. Under this scheme, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility with a single deficiency that caused no harm is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated the same as a facility with on-going, widespread  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> problems that threaten resident lives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Certain commenters requested that we give  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities with a good history of patient care the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to correct occasional isolated problems before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the end of the survey so as to avoid deficiency citations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for these problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A new study suggests that eating large amounts of dairy products, especially  yogurt and cottage cheese, may increase the risk of developing ovarian cancer,  a researcher said. A team of researchers affiliated with Harvard Medical School  found for the first time that women with ovarian cancer were more likely to eat  dairy products, especially yogurt and cottage cheese, compared to healthy  women. Dr. Daniel Cramer, who headed the study published in the British journal  The Lancet, stressed the findings need to be confirmed before recommending  women eat less dairy products. Scientists believe that a sugar found in milk,  cheese, yogurt and other dairy products known as galactose may damage the  ovaries.  </P></p>

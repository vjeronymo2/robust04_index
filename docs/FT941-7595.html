			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / CBI raps pay costs in public sector The government's failure to control public-sector pay is one of the main reasons for the current tax increases, the Confederation of British Industry said yesterday. Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said yesterday: 'During the recession total government paybills have risen from 13 per cent to 14.2 per cent of national output. That is a good part of the reason we now face large tax increases.' He was introducing a CBI paper urging the public sector to copy the private-sector shift to decentralised bargaining and pay flexibility. The paper says that the annual increase in paybills in private-sector manufacturing and services fell close to zero last year compared with a rise of nearly 4 per cent in the public sector. The CBI said service-sector settlements rose 2.6 per cent in the third quarter of 1993 compared with an earnings rise of 2.25 per cent. It said this was the first time in living memory that earnings had risen more slowly than settlements.</p>

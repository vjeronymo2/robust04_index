			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by party affairs correspondent Yerah Tal] </F>   [Excerpt] MAPAM's [United Workers Party] 11th convention  yesterday called for an Israeli recognition of Syria's  sovereignty over the Golan Heights -- provided that Syria commit  itself to full peace with Israel, full normalization, meticulous  security arrangements "conditioned on space and time," and  arrangements that would secure the water resources essential to  Israel's existence.    In its resolutions, the convention stresses that the Israeli  recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan should not  necessarily correspond with physical Israeli presence on the  Golan, "the extent and duration of which will be determined in  the negotiations on the peace accord."    The convention resolutions regarding Syria further say that  MAPAM views the formula the prime minister coined -- according  to which the depth of peace will match the depth of withdrawal  -- "as a starting point for the formation of the government's  policy on the issue of the Golan Heights.    "Regarding the problem of the Golan Heights, Israel's  supreme  interest is the security aspect, that is preventing the Golan  from turning into a springboard for attacks against Israel in  general and the Galilee in particular," the resolution says. At  the same time, MAPAM reiterates its stand that the Golan  settlements will not be an obstacle on the road to peace.    On the Palestinian issue, the MAPAM convention calls on the  Palestinian leadership "to take into consideration the dynamic  developments in the region, and to focus on implementing the  Declaration of Principles on both the interim arrangement and  the Gaza-Jericho First agreement."    The convention calls on the PLO leadership and the Israeli  Government to make a joint efforts to enhance the negotiations  and attain the desired agreement. Another resolution states  that "over the past two decades, MAPAM has maintained that a  mutual recognition of both nations' right for self determination  lies at the foundation of peace between them. The readiness to  accept UN Resolutions 242 and 338, and the willingness to return  land for peace are a necessary condition for an Israeli peace  policy. MAPAM has always regarded the autonomy as a temporary  introduction to the permanent solution that would be founded on  those principles." [passage omitted]</p>

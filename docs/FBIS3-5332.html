			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 5 KYODO -- Major Japanese dailies  decried U.S. President Bill Clinton in their editorials Saturday  [5 March] over his reinstatement of the "Super 301" trade  provision that opens the door for trade sanctions against Japan.  But the editorials at the same time urged the Japanese  Government to take decisive steps to slash Japan's swelling  trade surplus.    The major dailies denounced the Super 301 clause as  violating  free trade principles confirmed with the conclusion in December  of the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade.    The ASAHI SHIMBUN interpreted Clinton's move as bowing to  domestic pressure after the recent U.S.-Japan summit in  Washington failed to achieve a breakthrough in the so-called  trade framework talks.    Given relevant promises made during the presidential  campaign  two years ago and strong demands from Congress to force open the  Japanese market, Clinton could hardly avoid reinstating the  Super 301 trade provision, the ASAHI said. The daily said,  however, that using the threat of sanctions unless Tokyo makes  concessions is "tantamount to waving one's fist" and a behavior  Japan "cannot accept."    "It is only natural that the Japanese Government voiced  ardent opposition," the ASAHI said. The paper said the fact  that Clinton explained his decision in a phone call to Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa indicates that Washington is  not interested in setting off a trade war.    The Hosokawa cabinet must demonstrate its political will to  improve trade relations by drawing up an action plan to change  Japan's economic structure, which the ASAHI said is the main  cause for the nation's huge trade surplus.    The MAINICHI SHIMBUN reproached Clinton for damaging  bilateral relations by "pulling the trigger of the institutional  gun, before Japan has even thrown back the ball." His reviving  the clause is "extremely regrettable," the paper said in its  editorial.    Reinstating the clause as if the stalled framework talks had  already collapsed is "a dangerous game" that could drive overall  bilateral relations into a "dangerous abyss against the  President's own intention," the MAINICHI said.    The daily called for a plan to tackle Japan's total as well  as bilateral current account surplus.    The YOMIURI SHIMBUN said editorially that Clinton's move is  "regrettable," but now Japan holds the "key" to solving the  bilateral trade frictions. It urged Hosokawa to demonstrate  "maximum leadership" in addressing the nation's trade imbalance  "quickly and voluntarily."    Deploring the revival of the Super 301 provision, the NIHON  KEIZAI SHIMBUN pointed to the damage Japan would suffer in a  trade war of sanctions and retaliatory measures.    Clinton's move indicates that the United States this time  will "not indulge" Japan's trade surplus, all the more as the  end of the Cold War has eased pressure to play down trade  conflicts for the sake of unity against a joint enemy, the  economic daily said. To avoid further turbulence in the foreign  exchange markets, Japan should not stick to its "determined  no-policy" approach, the paper said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "According to the Modus, 33 Percent </F> Wish Horn To Be Prime Minister"]    [Text] Modus Inc., which is actually not very well known  for its political public opinion polls, has provided a flash  report to the newspapers.    On 16-17 May, after the 1994 parliamentary elections, the  Modus Economic and Social Marketing Advisory Inc. prepared a  flash report on possible prime ministers. The survey was  effected in four cities (Budapest, Miskolc, Gyor, and Szeged) on  a sample of 520 people. The sample represented the full  Hungarian population over the age of 18 according to gender,  age, and education.    Modus was trying to find out whom people would welcome as  prime minister. All the questioned people were aware that  parliamentary elections had taken place on 8 May. The party  preferences of the sample basically corresponded to the results  of the first round of elections. The small differences compared  to the first round can be attributed to the fact that the survey  did not extend to all types of settlements.    In reply to the question "if the decision was up to you, to  which politicians would you give the prime ministerial post,"  the following five names were mentioned in the first five  places: Gyula Horn [Hungarian Socialist Party, MSZP] 33.1  percent, Gabor Kuncze [Alliance of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] 23.7  percent, Peter Boross [Hungarian Democratic Forum] 9.4 percent,  Jozsef Torgyan [Independent Smallholders Party] 6.5 percent, and  Viktor Orban [Federation of Young Democrats] 6.5 percent. It  is interesting that, of the MSZP's voters, 84.9 percent would  like to see Horn as prime minister, and 73.1 percent of the  SZDSZ's voters would like Kuncze as prime minister.</p>

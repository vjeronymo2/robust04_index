			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: The Coronation of Poppaea - Opera Monteverdi's last opera, when performed as superbly as it is in the new Opera Factory production, becomes one of the most complex and disturbing of all artistic experiences. Its main themes are sexual infatuation and the abuse of state power, and the terrible links that can be forged between them. Poppaea is like Mozart's Figaro in the way it presents a complete spectrum of characters shaded by love and lust; but it is unlike that folle journee in that the good end unhappily and the bad happily - and that, in the view of the composer and his librettist Busenello, seems to be what Life means. This pitiless tale of moral and emotional ambiguities told in a score of utmost grave beauty would seem to be native territory for David Freeman and his Factory hands. So it proves. The Queen Elizabeth Hall stage, designed by David Roger as an airy, marbled-tinted stepped arena with two small instrumental bands disposed on either side, offers an acting space of ideal intimacy - with different areas colonised at different times, the total made grander than the sum of its parts. The format of scenes, at once freely developing and strict in structural control, is permitted to build up its awesome intensity without any of the barriers normally placed between characters and audience in larger Poppaea theatres. The text is uncut, and faster-moving than most nipped and tucked ones; Anne Ridler's fine translation, uttered with unaffected clarity by the entire cast, provides the motor power of the staging - as in this opera the words always should but so often do not. And Freeman's encouragement of all the ensemble virtues (which include performers in more than one role) promotes a cross-cutting between the opera's shared destinies that grapples the audience to their unfolding with iron hooks. The treatment of one scene seems questionable: the Nero-Lucan duet, here a dressing-up scene with the emperor in semi-drag and minions throwing up into fruit-bowls. Historically suggestive, no doubt, but the piercing irony of text would perhaps be better served by plainer means. For the rest, though, the combination of fluidity, athletic movement and unfettered characterisation makes this a sharper-pointed, more multi-faceted Poppaea than any I have previously encountered. The tension pulled between the three female leads is alarmingly taut: Marie Angel in the title role, horribly well-judged in her calculated sensuality, the fast-vibrato-laden tone-colour applied with pinpoint skill; Janis Kelly as Octavia, magnificently aristocratic in bearing and declamation; and the attractively bright-toned Sally Ann Shepherdson as Drusilla, who rises to her test of loyalty (violently staged by Freeman) with fierce youthful passion. The male-soprano leads are taken by male performers, and sung an octave below pitch: common 20th-century practice, which normally fogs up the vocal lines a great deal more than it does here - a tribute to the controlled spontaneity and fleetness of the singing and its accompaniment under Peter Robinson's direction. Nigel Robson's tenor Nero, pig-tailed, sexually ambiguous and quick to violence, is another horribly well-judged portrayal; Geoffrey Dolton's baritone Otho, the great romantic of the opera, pours out his agonies in ever more eloquent style. The Seneca of Michael Neill, in spite of odd vowel-sounds, touches all the right depths. Howard Milner's high-tenor Nurse is both raucously funny and genuinely tender, though in the lullaby - how revealing that the opera's lyrical peak-point should be a hymn to sweet oblivion] - he inevitably misses an alto's full rich tonal flow. No Poppaea has everything; this one lacks the 'animal' lustre that great voices finely used can shed on the drama. The qualities it does possess - dramatic conviction, musical directness, wholeness of viewpoint - are more than sufficient compensation. Queen Elizabeth Hall: performances until May 12, then five more in June</p>

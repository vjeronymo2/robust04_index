Ministry spokesman Ferhat Ataman told A.A. [ANATOLIA] that  reports that a group of Westerners was detained was untrue.    Earlier in the day, Reuters news agency said security forces  in southeast Turkey detained seven [words indistinct] activists  on Tuesday [words indistinct].    But Ataman said the group had not been detained, but  willingly stayed overnight at a state guest house to await an  escort deemed necessary for their onward journey to Siirt, a  town in southeastern Turkey.    An official from the British Embassy in Ankara also denied  allegations of detainment.    The seven Westerners were three Britons, one New Zealander  and three Irish nationals.    Turkish officials have accused a number of Western press  organizations of deliberately distorting news stories,  particularly those about the situation in the southeast, so as  to disrupt Turkey's human rights image.    The Government Press Office has told foreign journalists in  the southeast they should not engage in activities likely to be  construed as provocative or unprofessional.    Earlier on Wednesday, Ataman told reporters: "Certain groups  with self-conferred observer duty are making use of the freedom  and democracy in our country to indulge in subversive activity.    ``Unfortunately they include certain press groups which  disseminate false news by provocation, prejudice and  distortion.''</p>

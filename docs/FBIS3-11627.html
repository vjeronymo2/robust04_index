Dr. Pallais, who was deputy government minister at the time  and in charge of public security, was subpoenaed to testify on  Tuesday afternoon before the military judge, First Lieutenant  Lester Gallo Sandoval. Pallais confirmed that, upon  instructions from the government, he and high-ranking Police  officers took over the investigation in connection with this  case.

Consequently, and given  that rumors...    [Unidentified reporter, interrupting] Doctor, did you...    [Pallais, interrupting] Given the rumors circulating which  implied that the motorcade was led by Army General Humberto  Ortega, I was instructed to supervise the investigations that  the National Police had begun and to maintain close contacts  with Mr. Genie so he would trust that justice would prevail and  would therefore be inclined to cooperate in the investigation by  giving the names of witnesses whom he had identified and who  said they were afraid to testify.

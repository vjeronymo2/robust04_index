			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Paris phone-tap case death A former French presidential aide, who was being investigated in a wiretapping scandal, has been found hanged, police officials said yesterday. Mr Pierre-Yves Guezou, a retired officer in the paramilitary Gendarmerie police, was one of five former aides of Socialist President Francois Mitterrand to be suspected of illegally tapping telephones in a case which dates back to the mid-1980s. Mr Gilles Menage, chairman of the state utilitity Electricite de France and former head of President Mitterrand's private presidential office, is among those being investigated. The investigation centres on alleged invasion of privacy in connection with the tapping of telephones of journalists, politicians and an actress by the anti-terrorist unit of the Elysee palace between 1983 and 1986. Last week, an investigating magistrate informed the five former aides that they were under formal investigation, a first step towards a possible trial. The death of Mr Guezou follows other suicides among the entourage of President Mitterrand, whose term expires next spring. Last April, Mr Francois de Grossouvre, a former security aide to the president and latterly in charge of the Elysee's hunting estates, was found dead. In May 1993, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former Socialist prime minister, killed himself.</p>

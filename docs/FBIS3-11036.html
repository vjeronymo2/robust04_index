			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Our Opinion" station editorial by Orlando Contreras] </F>   [Text] Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina today will  arrive in India as part of a visit to several Asian countries.  As is well known, this tour began in Indonesia, the country  leading the nonaligned movement. The Indonesian Government and  the productive sectors in general have reaffirmed their  willingness and desire to increase trade and cooperation with  our country in several areas.    Robaina's trip through that region of ancient culture is  still underway, so it is premature to make an assessment, either  country by country or of the mission as a whole. I believe,  however, that the objective of these visits has been achieved.    Cuba needs to make known to the world the true situation  current in the country, and its new strategies to counteract the  perverse blockade and the collapse of the European socialist  bloc, particularly of the ex-Soviet Union. Our international  relations also have an impact on the priorities of our economy  within the context of principles.    Today I would like to underscore the importance of the Cuban  foreign minister's visit to India. This Asian country is one of  the most heavily populated nations on earth, a multinational,  multiethnic, and pluricultural country, the industry of which is  extremely versatile.    India and Cuba are linked by long-standing ties of  friendship. As you are all well aware, both were founders of the  nonaligned movement in 1961, and both countries demand the right  to a dignified life for Third World nations, which implies  international cooperation, trade without barriers, transfer of  technology in an unrestricted manner, and respect for  self-determination and national sovereignty.    Commander in Chief Fidel Castro had already visited this  vast  nation, the culture of which spans more than four milleniums,  and which was responsible for one of the earliest literary  creations of man. Its great forefathers and leading figures of  the modern state, beginning with Gandhi; then Nehru; later,  Nehru's daughter Indira; and finally, Rajiv Gandhi, have  enhanced the policy of peace, mutual understanding, and demands  for the rights of neglected peoples.    With all of these precedents, it is easy to assess the  importance of this visit the Cuban foreign minister will begin  within the next few hours to India, without minimizing, of  course, the visits he already made to other countries of the  region, and the visits he is still to make to other Asian  countries, all of them heirs to ancestral cultures.</p>

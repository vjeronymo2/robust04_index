			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Books: The master tale-teller - Fiction TALL STORIES ARE TRUE: THE COLLECTED STORIES OF EDGAR WIDEMAN Picador Pounds 8.99, 432 pages THE CRAFT OF storytelling has always held a primal importance for African-Americans. Deprived of access to conventional means of historical narrative as well as to much of the media, blacks in America have nonetheless managed to forge a vibrant and varied fictive tradition which has kept their culture alive. It is this heritage that informs the work of John Edgar Wideman and provides an explanation for the seemingly paradoxical title of his collected stories. In Wideman's world, all stories are indeed true, if truth means they can help remedy the lies and distortions which mainstream white society has often employed to keep blacks in their place. Throughout this book's 34 stories, Wideman's characters, usually inhabitants of the Pittsburgh community of Homewood, tell one another tales, tall or otherwise, in an attempt to understand their often bleak lives. This preoccupation with the craft of storytelling is the glue of the first two volumes, All Stories Are True (1992) and Fever (1989). In the title story, a man retells a tale told him by his convict brother about a leaf that flew out of a prison as it was cheered on by the inmates. It is a stirring image of freedom and escape, given added poignancy by the man's admission that his jailbird sibling will never explain that the leaf was blown back in again. The story's truth lies not in its factual accuracy but rather in the way it expresses a desire for freedom. In 'Signs', a black college professor complains of anonymous racial abuse, only to confess eventually that the whole affair was her fabrication. Wideman, though, leaves plenty of doubt as to the veracity of this confession, making us wonder if perhaps the teacher did it just to end the abuse. Once again, factual truth is bypassed to lead us to deeper understanding of the psychology of racism. When people are unable to tell one another these liberating stories, life becomes more difficult, even unbearable. In 'Doc's Story', an abandoned black husband rues his decision not to share the more imaginative aspects of his culture with his white ex-wife, particularly the story of the blind man who could play street basketball with the best of them. 'Fever', meanwhile, is a brilliant exercise in positive revisionism, telling the story of a black man who helped a white doctor during Philadelphia's yellow plague of 1793, during which white historians have inaccurately claimed local blacks behaved in a cowardly fashion. Here, better than anywhere else, one sees the real Wideman at work, his almost oracular voice able to keep his people's myths and heroes alive. On occasion, Wideman lets his extra-literary bent get the best of him, creating stories in which the artifice subsumes the tale told, such as the jazzy 'Everybody Knew Bubba Riff', a Joycian stream of consciousness that defeated this reader's weary eyes. And it is hard to see what place the post-Modernist hijinks of 'Surfiction' have in the same volume as the devastating 'Newborn Thrown in Trash and Dies'. The high point of this book is the third volume of stories it incorporates, Damballah (1981), a masterpiece of black American fiction. For reasons known only to themselves, Wideman and his editors decided to place it last rather than up front where it belongs. Damballah's 12 stories provide the fictional history of a Homewood clan, from slave days until the present. Far better than Roots, it depicts the pressures brought to bear on the African-American family and the strategies for survival it has been forced to undertake to stay together. The book is peppered with heartbreakingly beautiful moments, such as when John French, the family's strong man, finds a dead baby in the garbage. Afraid of reporting it to the white authorities, he decides to bury it, working during a snow storm to dig a deep enough grave. When he realises he has no way of interring it other than dropping it six feet, he first shovels in a bedding of fresh snow to cushion the fall. Later in the family's history, an old woman examines a woven silk portrait of her granddaughter her son had made while he was in Vietnam. Everyone in the family hates it because it makes the little girl look Oriental, though the grandmother is able to imagine the old Vietnamese man who sewed it, seeing in his handiwork his own granddaughter, dead perhaps from napalm. It is with moments like these that Wideman shows himself to be a writer who rarely sounds a false note, a writer who, at his best, can make any story sound true.</p>

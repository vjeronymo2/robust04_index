Analysis and Summary of Xinjiang's  Current Cotton Industry"]    [Text] Xinjiang's cotton industry, which had been  brilliant, now faces the straits of a "cold winter." People look  forward to the coming of spring.    The cotton industry in Xinjiang enjoyed a good time for  production and sales in the eighties, making it one of the  "three types of high" industries of high output value, high  profit, and high income, and jumped to the status of one of the  region's pillar industries.    The implementation of reform has pushed cotton industry  enterprises into the market. Now the cotton industry is finding  it hard to survive, lying where the mountains and the rivers  end--at the end of its resources, anxiously anticipating the  coming of new hope. Looking at the regional cotton industry's  output for January to September, the forecast for 1993 was for a  3.89 percent decrease from 1992. Among the major cotton  products, estimates were that only 700,000 units of yarn would  be produced, an 11.81 percent reduction from 1992; only an  estimated 210 million meters of cotton cloth accomplished, down  6.51 percent from 1992, and at the level of a decade ago; only  an estimated 39 million meters of printing and dying cloth, a  reduction of 28.55 percent from 1992, and only slightly higher  than the output of 30 years ago. Up to the end of September last  year, the gross industrial output value achieved was 960 million  yuan, a reduction of 19.13 percent for the same period in 1992.  The cumulative loss for the cotton industry was 120 million yuan.    The cotton industry's fall from its previous brilliance to  its current difficult situation is due to the following factors:    --The scale of the national cotton industry is too big, with  gross supplies exceeding demand, so products accumulate badly.  In 1980, China had 17.80 million spindles of cotton yarn; in  1990, this had increased rapidly to 42 million spindles of  cotton yarn, while the practical demand was for just 27 million  spindles. In the past decade, the spindles in storage occupied  over 40 percent of the year's requirement.    --A heavy burden of "triple debt" and declining efficiency  led to enterprises' shortages of operating funds. Based on  Cotton Bureau statistics, cotton enterprises currently owe more  than 300 million yuan to cotton and gunny companies for raw  material, and owe over 500 million yuan to cotton plants outside  the region. Combined with enterprise losses, it has led to  shortages of capital, forcing some enterprises to stop or cut  back on production.    --A lower level of equipment and production quality and  standard. At present, the regional production scale is up to 100  thousand spindles, with only 4.6 percent having world advanced  equipment, while 17.4 percent of them being equipments which  should have been eliminated before the founding of new China or  in the fifties. Enterprises lack staying power, and their  products noncompetitive.    --There is a big shortage of transportation. Two-thirds of  Xinjiang's cotton products are sold outside the region, which is  about 120,000 tons of cotton products going out of Xinjiang  every year. The market is focused chiefly along the Guangdong,  Jiangsu, and Zhejiang areas; a shortage of railway cars makes  transportation difficult, which seriously affects enterprises'  production and sales.    --Unstable teams of enterprise staff and workers. Low  economic efficiency causes low income among staff and workers,  so there is a serious outflow of technical mainstays.    --A lot of work is urgently needed to bring a "brilliant  spring" in the cotton industry.    One way of accomplishing this is through earning foreign  currency by export. It is only by stressing the production of  high standard, high quality, and high level products can  enterprises create international markets. In 1993, as a new  force suddenly coming to the fore, the Kuerle Cotton Plant did  extraordinarily well in its pursuit of exports. From January to  September, they exported 6,399 tons of cotton yarn, with an  export value of 20.62 million yuan, which constituted 40 percent  of Xinjiang's total. This greatly increased efficiency, and the  1993 forecast is for losses to be down 55 percent from last year.    Enterprises change patterns and styles in order to survive.  The Shihezhi Bayi Wool Spinning Plant took the lead in  establishing a new enterprise management guidance principle of  "taking the market as the leading direction, taking sales as the  head, taking efficiency as the focal point." They carried out  self-decision operations, self-responsibility for profits and  losses, and self-planned development, put over 40 million yuan  into technology replacement, introduced advanced equipment,  finally spinning 65-80 high-tech yarn, and a high-woof, light,  thin, product of about 300g for the south China market. By  developing new products, they created an output value of 139  million yuan from January to September last year, leading the  enterprise onto a good circulation track.    Pay attention to the enterprise, dig out its internal  potential, increase income while cost-cutting, reduce  expenditures on raw materials, and realize efficiencies from  basic enterprise management.    Favorable policies are sorely needed. For the cotton  industry, Xinjiang has the obvious shortcoming of poor location,  so it can compete with inland enterprises only through good  quality and low price. Last year's cotton price rise no doubt  was a case of "snow added to frost" for the cotton industry. The  government should: extend favorable policies on technology  replacement, loans, and investment; reform the cotton supply  system, reducing middlemen by guaranteeing the supply of raw  materials; and, in addition, absolutely prohibit price rises in  cotton circulation links to help enterprises get through these  difficult times and get on a good circulation track. If these  things are done, for Xinjiang's cotton industry the snow will  melt, the rains stop, the winds cease, and the spring breezes  blow again.</p>

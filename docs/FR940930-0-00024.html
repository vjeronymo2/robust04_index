			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The adoption of the tail number requirement would not result in an ``appreciable'' cost to the carriers, since most of them already track their aircraft movements by tail number. While ATA states one of its member carriers tracks its aircraft by nose number instead of tail number, no individual carrier has stated it would have difficulty in supplying data by tail number. A carrier could easily program a bridge for converting its nose number to a tail number for Part 234 reporting purposes. If this is not feasible, the carrier may contact the Office of Airline Statistics (OAS) to make other arrangements for tracking aircraft through the carrier's system. Any air carrier may request a waiver under 14 CFR &sect;234.12 from the on-time flight performance reporting provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eliminate On-Time Flight Performance Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alaska stated the Department should initiate a rulemaking to see whether the existing on-time performance requirements should be eliminated, rather than imposing additional reporting requirements. Alaska believes the airline industry's condition is far too dire to permit the continuation of a reporting regulation which Alaska argues has no appreciable influence on consumer choice or industry scheduling conduct. Alaska does not adjust its schedules based on on-time performance ratings. Its scheduling practices are tied to its internal schedule monitoring system that uses departure times, in contrast to the Department's arrival-based reporting requirement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaska believes that collection of additional data_mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations, wheels-off and wheels-on times, and aircraft tail numbers_is unnecessary and unjustified until the current reporting requirements are shown to have improved carrier scheduling conduct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department disagrees with Alaska's position that carrier on-time performance is unaffected by the reporting requirements. In its answer to this rulemaking, Northwest stated it has made changes to its schedule to improve on-time performance. On May 17, 1993, Delta implemented a system-wide communication program to improve its on-time performance. Given the industry's improvement in on-time flight performance since the reporting requirement was instituted in 1987, the Department believes most carriers have made similar changes. Before the reporting regulations were in effect, a Department investigation into scheduling practices of selected air carriers at four major airports disclosed that 25 to 60 percent of those carriers' scheduled flights were more than 15 minutes late (52 FR 34056; September 9, 1987). Today, more than 80 percent of the reporting carriers' flights are on time. On-time flight disclosure helps to eliminate deceptive scheduling practices by carriers, to the benefit of consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alaska believes departure times, rather than arrival times, are a better indicator of a carrier's reliability. The Department disagrees. Consumers are more interested in arrival times, because they have meetings to attend or may have somebody meeting them at the destination airport. Consumers also consider elapsed flight time when selecting an air carrier. If arrival times were ignored, schedule times could be shaved to make them more appealing to consumers. If the flights departed on time, the carrier would have a 100 percent on-time record even if every flight arrived a half-hour late. Such information would be very deceptive to the consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> New Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> American suggested the Department collect aircraft-type data along with the other proposed data elements, as a means of increasing the utility of the data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department agrees with American that aircraft-type data are useful for tracking the number of passengers affected by aircraft delays. However, the Department can convert tail-number information into aircraft-type data using the aircraft inventory data base maintained from the carriers' Schedule B&hyph;43  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Inventory of Airframes and Aircraft Engines <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and B&hyph;7  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Airframe and Aircraft Engine Acquisitions and Retirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These schedules provide aircraft type by tail number. Thus, DOT does not need air carriers to supply aircraft-type information with its Part 234 submission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

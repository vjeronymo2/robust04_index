			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Heron Intl sifts throughthe bidders Heron International's board of directors yesterday started the process of selecting a short-list of six bidders for Mr Gerald Ronson's troubled property and petrol stations group, after the deadline for offers closed last Friday. The company had expressions of interest from 40 groups but Lord Boardman, chairman, would not comment on the number of formal proposals that had been received. However, a number of leading US investment banks are understood to have submitted offers. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which control substantial property funds, have been discussing a similarly complex untangling of the property developer's Broadgate and Ludgate properties, and both are understood to be interested in Heron. Heron has given assurances that it will be able to put forward concrete proposals to its bondholders by the end of the month, and Lord Boardman said the directors would meet again next week to discuss the proposals. Heron had been on target in its asset disposal programme, agreed at the time of the Pounds 1.4bn restructuring last year. Many of these assets, however, were held by a subsidiary, Heron Corporation, whose bankers have first call on the proceeds. Heron International was unable to meet its dividend payments, while the bankers to Heron Corporation have received payments in advance of the agreed timeframe.</p>

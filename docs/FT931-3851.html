			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pilkington expands via Pounds 95m purchase  -Buy from Heywood will lead to bigger share of the UK market PILKINGTON, the glass group, is paying Pounds 95m for the UK and Irish glass processing and distribution business of Heywood Williams, the building and automotive components distributor. Pilkington said the purchase would give it vertical integration in the UK similar to the pattern in continental Europe. The acquisition follows the 1990 purchase by St Gobain, the French glass maker, of Solaglass, the second largest UK glass distributor. The deal, on which Heywood's shareholders will vote on April 1, has many attractions for Pilkington. It would gain a leading 24 per cent of the UK distribution market, letting it market new products direct to customers and improve manufacturing capacity utilisation. It would also enable Pilkington to use some of its unrelieved advance corporation tax, and would immediately enhance earnings. Pilkington's shares rose 7p to 108p. However, analysts said the price was high, and feared that although Pilkington would increase its sales to the Heywood business it could lose sales to competitors. Mr Roger Leverton, Pilkington chief executive, said the group's lack of control of distribution had put it at a disadvantage in the UK market. If the deal goes through, the Heywood business would increase its glass purchases from Pilkington from the current 60 per cent to 100 per cent. This would lift Pilkington's capacity utilisation in the UK to about 95 per cent. Mr Leverton admitted that the price showed that Heywood 'understood the strategic importance to a glass manufacturer' of gaining control of distribution. But he said the merger benefits would in effect halve the p/e Pilkington was paying. The businesses being acquired were making an 'on-going' profit for 1992 of Pounds 5.2m. The added benefit of an 8 per cent rise in the glass price from February 1, which Mr Leverton said was 'absolutely sticking', would give an exit p/e of about 17 before the merger benefits. Mr Ralph Hinchliffe, executive chairman of Heywood, said the structure of the UK glass market had changed radically in recent years, influenced by glass prices down more than 30 per cent since 1988, higher imports and St Gobain's acquisition of Solaglass. 'We came to the conclusion that the business under our ownership was unlikely to return to satisfactory levels of profitability,' said Mr Hinchliffe. Mr Leverton was conscious that customers of Pilkington which compete with the Heywood businesses could be upset by the tie-up. He said the operation would be run on an arms length basis. 'About 50 per cent of the market is still held by independents who buy a lot of glass from Pilkington. We must ensure that they can live comfortably with us,' he said. The deal would involve a goodwill write-off of Pounds 52.6m, and would be financed by debt. This would increase Pilkington's gearing from 80 to 90 per cent, Mr Leverton said. However, Pilkington expects to recoup 'significantly more than Pounds 95m' from the sale of its US spectacle lens business. It is also looking at selling a stake in its Australian subsidiary.

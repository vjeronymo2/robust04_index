			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / UK Company News: British Gas expands in electricity generation BRITISH GAS has set up a new wholly owned subsidiary with initial capital of Pounds 12m to invest in electricity cogeneration schemes worldwide. The new division will invest in the development, construction and operation of combined heat and power plants for customers in the UK and overseas. Mr John Earl, managing director of Cogeneration Investments, said the company will support British Gas's Global Gas business in its overseas operations. 'Cogeneration provides a lot of environmental benefits and can be at the end of many fuel chains,' he said. Cogeneration involves the production of electricity and recycling the waste gases to provide heating or cooling for other industrial processes. Cogeneration Investments signed its first contract, worth about Pounds 15m, to provide the energy requirements for SCM Chemicals Europe - one of the world's leading titanium dioxide makers - for the next 15 years. As part of the deal, the company will build a 15MW CHP plant at SCM's south Humberside site. The plant is expected to operate at over 80 per cent efficiency compared with 30 per cent from conventional power stations, and greatly reduce carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. Mr Earl said the company expected to sign another deal this year and was involved in discussions on two further contracts.</p>

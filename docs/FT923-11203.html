			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / France sees its trade slip into deficit FRANCE slipped into a trading deficit of FFr951m (Pounds 97m) last month after five months of trade surpluses, writes Alice Rawsthorn. So far this year French companies have benefited from buoyant exports which have helped to shelter them from the sluggish state of the domestic market. The value of French exports rose to FFr106.4bn last month from FFr103.4bn in May. However imports rose at a faster rate to FFr107.4bn in June from FFr99.3bn in the preceding month thereby pushing the trade account into the red. Despite last month's deficit, France recorded a healthy trading surplus of FFr16.6bn in the first half of this year.</p>

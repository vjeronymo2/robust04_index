			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Pavol Kanis by Ivan Brozik; </F> place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brozik] You are currently  holding talks with an Indian delegation visiting Slovakia. What  are the plans of your government department in that country?    [Kanis] The Indian defense minister arrived on the basis of  a cooperation plan, within the framework of previously concluded  agreements. It is an official visit. Apart from holding talks  on cooperation between the ministries of defense, the Indian  guest will visit Slovak companies--[Tatra Sipox at] Banovce nad  Bebravou, Konstrukta Trencin, ZTS [Heavy Engineering Works]  Dubnica, ZTS Martin. Together, we will also pay a visit to the  IDET exhibition in Brno. The Slovak exhibition will be our  destination there.    [Brozik] Your reply suggests that these international talks  and activities might be aimed at the recovery of our arms  industry, to a certain degree.    [Kanis] I believe that the Slovak arms industry finds itself  in its present problematic situation also because of the absence  of an effective and sufficiently strong steering center in  Slovakia. That is also why our manufacturers were unable to find  their bearing when arms production was halted and the conditions  for exporting arms deteriorated. The very change of the  political line in the wake of the revolutionary changes did not  have to bring about such a drastic weakening of arms production  and such an enormous decline in arms exports. One only had to  find one's bearing far more quickly and look for new customers.  The number of potential new customers is fairly large. They  are interested in weapons from Slovakia because of their quality  and also because Slovakia, while being a small country, avails  itself of a huge production potential. Many small countries are  emerging in the world that are interested in building up an  effective defense potential. In the long run, we have good  chances in those countries.</p>

			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Call for 'green' facts in company reports COMPANIES SHOULD provide information on the environmental impact and risks they face in their annual reports, the 100 Group of leading finance directors recommended yesterday. The group's environmental working party concluded that companies should normally devote at least one page in the narrative section of their report to the issues. It did not specify in detail the information that should be provided, but the group's statement of good practice says companies should invest time in identifying environmental priorities and reporting on them accordingly. They should report on responsibilities, monitoring procedures and achievement of targets and start to develop verifiable information which can be independently audited. The chief executive's report should reflect commitment to the issues, it added. Mr Bob Carlton-Porter, working party chairman, said: 'There are good reasons for companies to disclose environmental information voluntarily.' The paper cites Imperial Chemical Industries and British Steel as two examples of current best practice.

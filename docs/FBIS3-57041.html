			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of Azerbaijan Ministry of Defense Communique of 23 </F> January]    [Text] The struggle waged by the Republic's people and  military forces to liberate the territories occupied by the  Armenian occupationists is strengthening every day. Responding  to President Geydar Aliyev's call to the Republic's people, the  Azerbaijan National Army [ANA] has inflicted effective blows on  the enemy units and forced them to abandon many of their  positions and flee from several towns they occupied in  Fizulinskiy and Kelbadzharskiy Rayons.    The troops of our military units, which have significant  responsibility to the people in safeguarding Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity, have displayed significant heroism in  clashes with the ferocious enemy. Regardless of the resistance  put up by Armenian occupationists, the blows the ANA units have  inflicted on the enemy [words indistinct]. In fact, they are  now more determined in their advance against the enemy units.  The occupationists are becoming more and more aware of the fact  that they are gradually being defeated in a foreign land.    The Armenian Armed Forces, which have lost many men and much  military equipment and which have realized that they will not  remain unpunished for the acts of violence they have committed  in Azerbaijan's territory, are retreating in a disorderly way.  Kozly, [place-name indistinct], Kabakchylar, Sarnichlar,  [place-name indistinct], Susuzlu, [four place-names indistinct],  Kamishly, and Bagyrly in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon were liberated  from the occupationists as a result of ANA's successful  operations during the past few days.    The ANA units captured several strategically important  heights, including [place-name indistinct], in the violent  clashes that took place in that rayon. Consequently, they have  placed the upper section of the Kelbadzhar-Agdere motorway and  the section of the Kelbadzhar-Lachin motorway up to [place-name  indistinct] under their control.    The enemy units lost many men and much military equipment in  the clashes that took place in Kelbadzharskiy Rayon during the  past week. They lost some 300 officers and men, nine tanks, two  PDM's [not further identified], and five artillery guns.  Azerbaijan's military units seized four tanks, two PDM's, a  large quantity of infantry arms, mortars, and arms depots as  spoils of war.    According to information from [words indistinct], the number  of deserters has increased eight-fold. The deserters are trying  to flee to Armenia. Five Armenian officers and men taken as  prisoners of war have said that they are affiliated with the  117th Division of Russia's 7th Army. The information they have  revealed indicates that morale among the troops in Khankendi  [Stepanakert] is very low. Yerevan has recently prepared to  dispatch fuel, construction materials, and 20 military vehicles  to Khankendi. People are taken from their homes in Yerevan and  sent to the front lines. The prisoners also revealed that they  joined the fighting because they feared serious repercussions  against their families.    This confirms the fact that Armenian military forces  supported by Russian military sub-units in Armenia, and not the  Nagorno-Karabakh self-defense forces as claimed by the Armenian  and Russian mass media organs, are fighting in Azerbaijan,    The ANA units, which are cared for by their state and  people,  are becoming more and more steadfast every day. The people of  the liberated towns can return to their homes. Azerbaijan's  people must rest assured that the aggressor will be forced to  retreat and our homeland will be liberated.</p>

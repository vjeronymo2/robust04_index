			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Analysis made by the Center of Economic Market Conditions </F> under the Russian Federation government: "February: The Month's  Prices--My Dear Moscow, and St. Petersburg, and Others"; plus  report on foreign prices with selections made by Lyubov Volkova]    [Text] The results for February have been summarized.  Judging from the operational data of daily monitoring of prices  by state statistical organs, the past month was not as bleak as  January. The inflation rate was substantially lower. If you  remember, at that time the level of inflation was 22 percent,  growing by 6-7 percent a week at times. But during the first two  weeks in February, the inflation index was 4 percent, and in the  second half of the month--no more than 2 percent.    The general inflation index was 109.9 percent, and since the  start of the year--134.1 percent.    The prices of paid services rose most markedly for us. Their  rates rose substantially faster than prices for food and  industrial goods. This did not occur suddenly and according to  predictions will not end soon. This February the prices for paid  personal services rose by 14.3 percent, while they rose by 9.4  percent for food items and by 10 percent for industrial goods.    In the list of cities of Russia being studied, Moscow went  from 35th to 33rd place in terms of higher prices. Here the cost  of the group of the 19 most important food items rose by 4,388  rubles [R] and now totals R45,400. In St. Petersburg the group  now costs R42,600, which was 13.3 percent higher than in January.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The  simplest food items rose in price at a fast rate this time;  these are the items our old folks, children, and low-income  persons live on. During the month the price of vegetables rose  sharply--by 22 percent; of dairy products--by 19 percent; and of  groats and macaroni products--by 16 percent. The price of fish  products and animal fat rose by 13 percent.    During the month the prices of the following items rose  least  of all: fruit--by 4.1 percent; vegetable oil--by 3.6 percent;  and sugar--by 1.1 percent. Vodka got 1.4 percent cheaper.    In both stores and at markets prices mostly rose for the  very  same goods, which attests to the objectivity of the processes.  But the rise in prices for vegetables at markets was higher and  totaled 25 percent. But then prices for fish, milk, and eggs  rose substantially less at markets.    In all, prices for foodstuffs have risen as follows since  the  start of the year: for dairy products--by a factor of 1.6; for  vegetables--by a factor of 1.5; and for baked goods, animal fat,  and salt--by a factor of 1.4.    The average cost for the group of 19 for Russia as a whole  on  28 February was R41,300. But there are substantial differences.  For prices of organized trade, the figure is R39,800, but for  market prices it is R54,100 [unclear].    There has always been only one answer to the eternal  question, "Where is it best to live": "Somewhere else." But even  so...    Look at the map of Russia. It is divided into parts and  colored in different tones. Darker--inflation is higher than the  average Russian level, the brightest part--inflation is lower  than the average Russian level. The average between them is the  average Russian level plus or minus 1 percent. The gap between  the maximum and minimum cost of the group in various cities of  the country is a factor of 3.4. The Volga Region is one of the  "cheapest" regions, but within it there are differences in  prices. Thus, in Ulyanovsk the group of 19 items costs R24,100,  while next door, in Tolyatti--R54,400. The most expensive cities  in terms of the cost of the group of most important foodstuffs  remain the cities of the Far East region, Magadan (R97,000),  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (R83,800), and Vladivostok (R83,300).     <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-029C-44A>             Inflation Indexes for Economic Regions of Russia in February 1994 </FIG>    <H5>  Where Should You Go for a Suit? </H5>   The city of Rubtsovsk, of course. There in January a man's  suit (two-piece) cost ten thirty-ninths the price in Vorkuta.  And by the end of February the gap had increased even more and  now equals ten forty-ninths the price. Barely one-fifth.    For Russia overall, prices for nonfood goods rose by 10  percent. Last month the price of fuel rose the most--by 55  percent, of medicine--by 23 percent, of synthetic laundry  detergent--by 22 percent, and of wallpaper--by 20 percent.  Prices for shoes and tobacco products changed the least--by 7  percent.    That is the analysis of the month's prices made by the  Center  of Economic Market Conditions under the Russian Federation  government.  <H5>  What Things Cost Abroad </H5> <H6>  Germany </H6>   Bread is expensive in Germany. One kilogram costs roughly  2.5  marks, which in our money equals about R2,000. But if you  compare it with earnings, bread costs Germans less than it does  us.    Did the price of bread rise after reunification? Yes, many  times over, roughly 8-fold. And right after the reunification of  Germany, on 1 July 1990. Common money was introduced and right  away free prices. The next day, one might say.    Did the prices of other goods rise to the same degree? No,  the price of bread rose most of all. Because in the GDR bread  used to be almost free, the government subsidized the baking of  it.    Prices for domestic goods are like this. One can buy a  television for 500 marks. That is 3 days work for an average  paid specialist. The televisions, it is true, are from Taiwan,  and small and their service life is 3-4 years. But their quality  is pretty good. There are, of course, televisions for 10,000  marks too. That is two and one-half months work for a  specialist. Different sums, different quality. The difference is  20-fold. In our country practically all televisions are from  Taiwan or similar countries. But their cost is not 3 days work  for a specialist but 2-3 months work. And only if the specialist  has a pretty good job. The average wage of a specialist in the  former East Germany is 3,100 marks. That is 75 percent of the  West's.  <H6>  Inflation </H6>   In Finland 1 loaf of white bread costs approximately 8 marks  and sugar costs just as much. Butter costs an average of 34  marks for a kilogram. Milk is 4-5 marks. Fresh meat, not frozen,  is about 80 marks, the worst, about 40 marks. Half a kilogram of  granulated coffee costs 10-12 marks.    Convert prices to the mark's rate and you will be convinced  that the absolute price levels have not been reached yet.    Our earnings are a different matter. They are not yet  comparable.</p>

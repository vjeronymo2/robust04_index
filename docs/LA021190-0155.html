			<p><P> February 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNIT TO EXAMINE MINORITIES IN TEACHER RANKS  </P> <P> Curtis McCray, president of Cal State Long Beach, has established a special  task force at the university to examine the shortage of ethnic minorities  entering the teaching profession.  </P> <P> "(There is a) national and local crisis in attracting minorities into teaching  careers," McCray said in a press release announcing formation of the 12-member  task force.  </P> <P> "We should not just sit back and allow this situation to get worse."  </P> <P> According to statistics from the National Education Assn., minorities currently  compose about 9% of all the teachers in America. But despite the fact that the  nation's classrooms -- including those in Long Beach -- are being occupied  increasingly by minority students, the association predicts that by the turn of  the century only one public school teacher in 20 will be a member of a  minority.  </P> <P> "Teacher preparation is an important part of the mission of CSULB," McCray  said. "An important dimension . . . must be minority recruitment strategies."  </P> <P> The president's task force, which will meet regularly, is slated to present its  recommendations on the matter before Sept. 1.  </P></p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Concerns on council fraud 'not met' Local authority councillors are failing to respond to high levels of public concern about fraud and financial malpractice in local government, a report warns today. The report by Public Concern at Work, a charity which helps people raise concerns in the workplace, found that one in 20 of those questioned in a survey of 1,000 people said they had some direct experience of fraud and corruption in councils. About a quarter of those had worked for a council or for a local government contractor. The report highlights a number of fraudulent practices including a building services manager who was demanding cash from companies which wanted to stay on the council's list of contractors. A study by the Audit Commission, which monitors local government spending, estimated the loss from reported frauds in 1992-93 at Pounds 25m. Most were benefit frauds, however, rather than malpractice, and the charity accepts that local government fraud was still relatively low. Public perception, however, suggests that councils need to respond more effectively. The survey calls for internal council 'hotlines' or separate reporting procedures to be established to give employees more scope to report fraud.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 18 KYODO -- Japan greeted with cautious  welcome a Saturday agreement between the top leaders of North  and South Korea on a summit meeting to defuse the current crisis  over Pyongyang's suspected nuclear arms program.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said, "the fact that things have  gone that far means a good climate has been produced. I hope  the summit will succeed by all means."    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa also said he welcomed the  news, and voiced expectations of moves toward North Korea's  acceptance of international nuclear inspections.    A Foreign Ministry official concurred, saying, "that means  the conditions are being set for a solution to the issue."    Earlier in the day, South Korean President Kim Yong-sam  accepted North Korean President Kim Il-song's overture, agreeing  to a summit meeting without conditions.    Some Japanese officials, however, hedged their welcome of  the  development with caution.    "We have seen similar moves before, but a solution has been  prolonged," one ministry official said.    He said a real solution will not be found until North Korea  fully accepts inspections by the International Atomic Energy  Agency, the U.N. nuclear safety watchdog.    The official also pointed to the unofficial status of former  President Jimmy Carter, who visited North Korea as a "private  citizen" to seek a peaceful solution to the issue and conveyed  the North Korean leader's proposal for a summit to Seoul.    He said Japan should keep close watch on Washington's  official assessment on the results of Carter's mission.</p>

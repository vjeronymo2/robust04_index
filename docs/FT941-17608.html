			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Markets: And now it's time to say goodbye - Serious Money This is the last column I shall write on personal finance, so perhaps readers will forgive a spot of self-indulgence as I look back over 3 1/2 years in the job. Back in 1990, the first thing that struck me about personal finance was the gap between the ideal and the reality. Finance is an incredibly complex subject and few consumers, however enthusiastic, can be expected to grasp all the details. In the ideal world, the consumer would know where to go to find objective, expert advice - just as, in the world of transport, one can summon the AA man to ask his unbiased opinion on a used car. But, in the real world, there is a complex structure of salesmen, tied agents and independent financial advisers plus an alphabet soup of regulators. It is easy for a consumer to be bewildered if told 'Hello. I'm a Fimbra-registered IFA.' Even if you understand what that meant, because of the commission system, you still could not be sure of receiving an unbiased view. The FT has consistently taken the line that the system of commission, whereby an adviser or salesman is paid by the company for selling a product and not by the customer for the advice given, is open to abuse. The personal pension scandal puts the problem in a nutshell. Salesmen knew they would earn lots of money if they recommended a transfer into a personal pension, but nothing at all if they told people to stay put. Surprise, surprise. They recommended a transfer, often without completing the paperwork properly. At last, things are changing. New rules will mean that investors must be told how much commission salesmen and advisers earn. Not only is this right in itself, it will give a boost to the system of fee-based advice, which we believe is much more likely to give consumers an impartial view. Until now, many consumers have been unwilling to pay fees, because they believe they are getting 'free' advice elsewhere. * * * When I started this job in August 1990, it was a great time to invest in equities and bonds. But many savers preferred the 15 per cent they could receive from cash and now are contemplating dwindling building society incomes. I have consistently prodded savers to diversify from cash. Alas, I went wrong this year and under-estimated the scale of the rally which has taken the stock market from very high historic valuations to even higher ones. Inflation has fallen much further than I expected; that has made investors very optimistic about the prospects for falling interest rates and has caused a massive shift from cash and into equities and bonds. Nevertheless, I am still nervous about the level of share prices. Are low inflation and slow economic growth really compatible with soaring corporate profits? And if we have moved to a low inflation era, should we still value the market on the basis of the yield ratio used in the inflationary 1970s and 1980s? After all, for much of the 1950s, equities yielded more than bonds. * * * One thing I did get right this year was to draw readers attention to the O'Higgins theory. This was developed by an American fund manager who looked at the 10 highest-yielding shares in the Dow-Jones index and then picked the five with the lowest absolute share prices. A portfolio consisting of these stocks outperformed the Dow by an average of around 9 per cent a year between 1973 and 1991. I applied the theory to the FT-30 index and found it seemed to work in the UK, too. At the start of the year, the method picked five stocks: Blue Circle, British Gas, Forte, Hanson and Lucas. The average gain for the five this year (including gross dividends) was 46.8 per cent; the All-Share (also including dividends) is up 28.7 per cent. Of course, the theory does not work every year (it just seems to work over the long term) and a portfolio of just five stocks inevitably will involve more risk. Besides which, the FT-30 index is hardly used these days, so that could affect the theory's success. Still, I am sufficiently encouraged to apply the theory again to the FT-30's present constituents: Allied Lyons, Asda, BICC, Blue Circle, BOC, BTR, Boots, BA, British Gas, BP, BT, Cadbury Schweppes, Courtaulds, Forte, GEC, Glaxo, GrandMet, GKN, Guinness, Hanson, ICI, Lucas, M&amp;S, NatWest, P&amp;O, Reuters, Royal Insurance, SmithKline Beecham, Tate &amp; Lyle and Thorn EMI. The result is that three of 1993's selections are picked again: British Gas (344p, 5.2 per cent yield); Hanson (273.5p, 5.2 per cent); and Lucas (197p, 4.4 per cent). The additions are BICC (408p, 5.9 per cent yield) and Tate &amp; Lyle (397p, 4.1 per cent). All figures are based on the FT of December 30. One reader asked what the O'Higgins method would choose in the US. Based on December 29 closing prices, the system would select American Express, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Union Carbide and Woolworth. * * * Finally, my thanks to all those readers who wrote over the years, with questions, suggestions and (mostly constructive) criticism. May your portfolios prosper.</p>

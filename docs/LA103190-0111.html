			<p><P> October 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CLEANLINESS COURSE FOR RESTAURANTS OKD  </P> <P> The city is about to become the county's first to require restaurant managers  to attend a course on cleanliness.  </P> <P> By a 4-0 vote, the City Council last week gave preliminary approval to an  ordinance that will affect more than 200 restaurants citywide and make  mandatory a four-hour training course to educate restaurant managers in safe  and sanitary food-handling procedures.  </P> <P> If the ordinance receives final approval at the Nov. 13 council meeting,  restaurants with more than four employees will have eight months to comply. The  city will notify in writing all restaurants that are affected by the ordinance.  </P> <P> Each location will be required to have at least one manager on staff who has  earned a certificate by passing the county course and a written exam. The  course costs $20 and the certificate is valid for three years.  </P> <P> Mayor Don E. Smith said he first approached the county Health Care Agency with  an idea for the pilot program two years ago.  </P> <P> "Because of my position we eat out a lot and we came across times when I  practically lost my appetite" because of unsanitary conditions, Smith said.  </P> <P> The course will focus on health procedures like personal hygiene and keeping  foods at the correct temperature, said Jim Huston, assistant director for  environmental health at the Health Care Agency.  </P> <P> County officials will check certificates at each location during inspections  that the health department conducts three times each year, Huston said.  </P> <P> Violations are considered a misdemeanor and will be reported to the city.  </P> <P> Huston said he hopes that the program will be duplicated by cities throughout  Orange County.  </P> <P> The certification program is one way to assure the public that "when they go in  (to a restaurant) they are eating safe hygienic foods handled by safe, hygienic  people that know what they are doing," Huston said.MARY HELEN BERG  </P></p>

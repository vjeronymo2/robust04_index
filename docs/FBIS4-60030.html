			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 19 May (MENA)--President Muhammad Husni  Mubarak addressed an appeal to Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih today urging him to stop the fighting in Yemen in order to  spare the blood of the Yemeni people and avert the squandering  of that fraternal nation's resources in a civil war.    The president said that he continues to hope that his  repeated appeals will find a sincere response and that peace  will prevail in Yemen, especially in these blessed days in which  Muslims are standing before God praying that He may grant them  guidance, wisdom, security, and peace.    Following is the text of the president's appeal:    Like all other Arabs I have followed with great sadness and  profound regret the fierce fighting in fraternal Yemen, which  has been going on for nearly two weeks. This fighting is lethal  to the sons of Yemen, is destroying the country's resources, and  pitting the units of its armed forces against each other in a  violent confrontation that cannot serve the Yemeni people's  interests and objectives.    It is heart-rending to watch this bloody fighting that bodes  an extensive civil war that will ruin the resources of an Arab  homeland that sorely needs stability and security. The homeland  needs to devote its energies to improving the life of its people.    It is especially sorrowful that this civil strife should  come  at a time when the Arab nation is attempting to heal the  numerous wounds caused by the consequences of the Iraqi invasion  of Kuwait and the Gulf war.    We were hoping that a new climate would arise in the Arab  world, paving the way for a broad inter-Arab reconciliation,  restoring inter-Arab solidarity, and reviving the hope of  collective Arab action that will end the nation's current  divisions. This is necessary if we want to face that challenges  that will confront our Arab world at the beginning of the 21st  century.    The civil strife in Yemen came abruptly, opening new wounds  that would have been avoidable had the two parties begun a  dialogue and agreed to reach an understanding on how to keep the  armed forces outside the conflict.    We have done our utmost to prevent a clash between the two  sides. Our only motive was to safeguard the supreme Arab  interests.    We stressed the importance of avoiding armed clashes between  the two sides and urged that their armed forces be separated so  that war would not erupt. We expressed willingness to assist  the two sides in settling their disputes without recourse to  military force. We did this because we know that war never  settles any dispute in a decisive or sound way.    It was never our aim to show bias to either party.    Our objective was to safeguard the interests of a fraternal  people whose blood was mixed with the blood of Egyptians who  defended the Yemeni people's right to live and make progress.  Our objective was to save Yemeni unity from the risks of armed  conflict and civil war that could finish off this unity and lead  Yemen to fragmentation and rupture. Our objective was to save  the resources of an Arab people from being wasted in fratricide,  exhausting Yemen's resources and resulting in nothing but  partition, bitterness, and severe loss for all parties.    It was our hope that our repeated appeals would find a  sincere response from all parties, so that peace and security  could prevail throughout Yemen during these blessed days when  Muslim pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat to pray to God Almighty  to grant them guidance, reason, peace, and security.    Now that the collision between troops from the two sides has  entered a critical stage that portends a long war of attrition,  I appeal to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, on this blessed day  when pilgrims stand on Mount 'Arafat and in the name of the  constitutional legitimacy binding him, to rise above  differences. In the name of the unified Yemeni people who aspire  to security and stability, in the name of the Yemeni unity that  could be ruined by the war, and in the name of every Arab who  looks forward to a wiser and more prudent Arab world, I appeal  to him to end this fratricide and save Yemeni blood from being  shed in vain in a war that is hard to justify. I appeal to him  to order an immediate halt to the fighting, in order to save  Yemen, its fraternal people, and the goal of unity, which is the  aspiration of every Yemeni. The destiny of the homeland must be  placed above any other consideration, because the homeland is  the core and the basis. Individuals may come and go, but a  homeland means immortality and survival. This is the hour when  Yemen needs everyone to rise above their wounds. I pray to God  Almighty to inspire us with reason and prudence, to lead us onto  the right path, and to guide us as to what is best for our  nation, for He is the best master and supporter.</p>

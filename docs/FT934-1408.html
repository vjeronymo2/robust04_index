			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Sport: The rise of a young champion - Tennis It is time once again to produce the annual FT World Rankings, necessary because the men's and women's computer rankings are unfairly weighted. The ATP Tour system counts only a player's best 14 results (bad losses can be ignored) and does not offer the four Grand Slam Championships their full value. The WTA system protects the higher ranked players who do not drop quickly enough after poor performances. No-one would question that the 22-year-old American Pete Sampras and Germany's Steffi Graf, now 24, have been the outstanding players of the year. These two fine athletes head my lists in which there are five men who were not in last year's list and two newcomers among the women. With two of the four Grand Slam titles (Wimbledon, US Open) among his eight tournament victories, Sampras has enjoyed the best season of his young life. He has won 85 of the 101 matches he has played and pocketed Dollars 4.58m to lift his career earnings to Dollars 11.5m. It now seems likely that Sampras will fulfil the potential he had shown in 1991 when, at 19, he became the youngest US Open winner. Only in this year's two climactic events - the IBM/ATP Tour finals in Frankfurt and the Compaq Grand Slam Cup in Munich - has Sampras looked vulnerable. First, Michael Stich, with brilliant serving, and then Petr Korda, with superb returning of the serve, halted his advance. In the absence since April of the reigning world champion Monica Seles, following the knife attack by Gunter Parche in Hamburg, Graf has dominated the women's year with 10 tournament wins. The only real challenge to her supremacy on the important occasions came from Jana Novotna who should have won their Wimbledon final after leading by a set and 4-1. However, she did not, and Graf added a fifth Wimbledon title to the third French crown she had just acquired and then went on the win the US Open for the third time. For good measure Steffi also claimed the Virginia Slims Championship, her 79th career title, to end the year with 76 wins and six losses, all of which earned her prize money of Dollars 2.8m, a record for women. The men's year was notable for the return to form of the 1991 Wimbledon champion Stich who re-enters the list after a year's gap. Stich finished the season strongly winning the ATP Tour championship, leading Germany to victory in the Davis Cup and reaching the final of the Grand Slam Cup. But Stich does not displace Jim Courier from the No 2 spot (which he did on the ATP computer) because of his failures on the four most important occasions of the year. In Melbourne he lost to Courier, who went on to win the title; in Paris he lost badly to Goran Prpic in the fourth round while Courier lost narrowly in the final; at Wimbledon, where Courier was also a finalist, Stich lost a dramatic quarter-final against Becker; in New York, Stich was beaten in the first round by Henrik Holm while Courier lost in the fourth round to Cedric Pioline, his only bad loss. It was chiefly that performance which earned the stylish Frenchman ninth place in my list. Pioline had a marvellously consistent year with three other appearances in finals. Sergi Bruguera's feat in winning his first major title in Paris, was considerable. The Spaniard also reached eight other finals, winning four of them. After a mediocre year by his standards, Stefan Edberg drops to No 5. His best performances were to reach the final of the Australian Open and the Wimbledon semi-final where Courier beat him both times. Only one tournament fell to this great attacking player in 1993: ironically, the clay court event in Madrid. Andrei Medvedev, only just 19, made a great impact with three wins from five finals plus an appearance in the French Open semi-final. Michael Chang, with five tournament wins, had his best year since winning the French Open as a 17-year-old in 1989. Goran Ivanisevic could not reach a Grand Slam final as he had done at Wimbledon in 1992 and slips four places while the Austrian, Thomas Muster, comes in as the winner of six titles - all on clay. At first sight it may seem curious to have ranked Seles at all. However, the world champion did win the year's first great title in Australia with a fine win over Graf. It was one of the season's best matches. Furthermore, she did win another tournament before being forced out of the game with an extended bout of 'flu. Hamburg was her comeback event. I have no doubt about the quality of her tennis at the time of the attack and her achievements must be recognised. No-one else in the women's game achieved anything notable. True, Sanchez-Vicario, in winning four tournaments, did play more matches than anyone else (91), and she won more too (77) but she did lose 14 times. Her fellow Spaniard, Martinez, won five tournaments and did well to reach her first Wimbledon semi-final. Although Mary Joe Fernandez was equally impressive in winning the year's most exciting encounter, a comeback against Sabatini in Paris, she was disappointing elsewhere with only one tournament to her name. It is a pleasure to see Anke Huber at last emerging from Graf's shadow and sad to say farewell to Manuela Maleeva-Fragniere who retires officially after next month's Australian Open. The eldest of the three Bulgarian sisters, Manuela went out on a high note with a victory over Navratilova in the final of the European Indoor Championships in October, her 18th career title.  ----------------------------------------      FT WORLD RANKINGS for 1993  (Last year's position in brackets)  ---------------------------------------- MEN 1.

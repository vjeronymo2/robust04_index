			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Budget hopes take Singapore to record high VOLATILITY in the currency markets, ahead of the Group of Seven finance ministers meeting this weekend, gave investors an excuse to remain inactive and prices gained marginal ground after moving within a tight range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei index closed up 42.54 at 16,863.15 after moving between 16,925.15 and 16,794.12, fluctuating on index-linked trading. Volume fell from 215m to 200m shares; declines led advances by 567 to 344 with 205 unchanged; the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 2.60 to 1,281.31 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell by 0.80 to 1,204.25. Trading remained dull as most investors focused on yen-dollar currency movements. The yen closed up Y0.07 at Y116.78 after hitting an all-time best of Y115.90-94 in New York. While the yen's rise in Tokyo was checked by financial authorities hinting at possible intervention, traders said that investors will remain on the sidelines ahead of Saturday's G7 meeting in London. Dealers were also quiet as yesterday was the last trading day for February settlements. Meanwhile, a plunge in the balance of margin stock buying reflected weak sentiment among individual investors. The Tokyo Stock Exchange said that margin buying fell to a 10-year low as positions bought on margin were liquidated ahead of margin settlements in March. The oil sector was the main loser, dragged down by Showa Shell Sekiyu. The affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plunged by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,000 on concerns over its foreign exchange losses, announced over the weekend. Other oil stocks were also weak with Nippon Oil down Y3 to Y590 and Mitsubishi Oil down Y26 to Y859. Exporters continued to weaken on the higher yen. Hitachi fell Y5 to Y671 and Toshiba retreated Y4 to Y556. Toyota Motor lost Y10 to Y1,330. However, gas utilities, which depend on imports, were firm, with Tokyo Gas up Y5 to Y411 and Osaka Gas advancing Y5 to Y427. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y6,000 to Y613,000 on reports that it would cut 30,000 employees by encouraging early retirement and transfers to affiliates. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 157.28 to 18,136.01 in 79.8m shares. Nintendo, the video game maker, fell Y180 to Y9,920 on fears of lower profits due to the higher yen. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets took their lead from domestic developments and turned in mixed performances. SINGAPORE built up its hopes that Friday's budget would prove positive for business and investors alike and shares gathered momentum to close at a record high. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 21.45, or 1.3 per cent, to 1,661.32 in volume that swelled to 175.8m shares. The mood was also buoyed by expectations of strong fourth quarter domestic product growth data, due today. HONG KONG moved in the opposite direction, profit-taking leaving the Hang Seng index 82.69, or 1.3 per cent, lower at 6,149.19 in turnover of HKDollars 2.82bn. The heavily oversubscribed Denway Investment lost 15 cents to HKDollars 2.05 on its second day of trading. AUSTRALIA saw the All Ordinaries index close 3.3 higher at 1,608.3 in turnover of ADollars 319m. Trade was boosted by Pancontinental Mining, 4 cents higher at 99 cents, after French group Cogema sold its 10 per cent stake in the miner for ADollars 24.4m. On Monday, Degussa, the German chemical group, sold its 10 per cent stake for ADollars 21.1m. TAIWAN spent a volatile session with heavy profit-taking in the last half-hour erasing early gains. The weighted index, which briefly broke above 4,200 points at mid-morning, ended 26.95 down at 4,071.49. Parliamentary confirmation of Lien Chan as the next premier came shortly after the market closed. BANGKOK saw rumours resurface that the market could face further official investigations into share price manipulation. The SET index ended 0.46 higher at 946.08.</p>

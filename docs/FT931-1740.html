			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Arts: Quartermaine's Terms Have you seen The Edward Fox Performance? Observed once, it is very interesting and rather touching. It embodies a classy English eccentric of terminal affability. He exists in a cocoon apart from everyday communication and ordinary life. Every main vowel is drawled into a complex diphthong ('upside dahn,' 'smairshing'.) The way he adjusts from one tilting stance to another is deployed for maximum effect. Each of the half-dozen chief facial expressions is held for a minimum of five seconds, then contrasted with another. The mouth, in particular, goes through a range of gaping positions  -as if posing for Munch. If he chooses his repertory carefully, he might go on giving this performance ad infinitum. Alas, the signs are that he intends to do so. Returning to Simon Gray's Quartermaine's Terms, in whose 1981 West End premiere and subsequent TV production he enjoyed success, he gives not only the same performance he did in '81 but also the same as in The Philanthropist in the West End in 1991 (and before that at Chichester), and much the same as when he played Higgins in the tour of My Fair Lady last year. The first time around, Fox's performance is an icon of Englishness as marvellous as a Beefeater or a bowler hat. (And the deep furrow down each cheek is so fascinating that you want it hung in the Tate.) The more you watch, however, the less there is to see. The same goes, I am sorry to say, for Quartermaine's Terms. This revival is staged by Kevin Billington, who directed the tour of the original production; and the cast includes another actor from the original production and another from the TV version. Almost everyone gives a flawless performance. Flawless except that the whole affair now seems too pat, too formulaic. The trick of Quartermaine's Terms is that it applies farce methods to produce a comic surface over a situation which continually becomes more and more pathetic. The situation is a staff room and the lives of its seven staff members. One running joke is the accident-prone new teacher; another is the mistakes people make over his name or the title of the play currently on at the local theatre; another is Quartermaine's mindless hail-fellow-well-met dazed charm. Others teachers have personal crises and change from scene to scene. Quartermaine, who alone never changes and undergoes no crisis, is in fact the most pathetic character of all. Quartermaine is one of those uncommunicative types who recur in English literature and drama, from Evelyn Waugh to Harold Pinter, and his apparent stalemate (actually a helpless decline and fall) is, of course, a deliberate portrait of English decline in general. Simon Gray handles it all very entertainingly, but the formula is not a rewarding one to reexamine. In this revival, Clive Francis, James Grout, Sarah Badel and Lucy Scott contribute excellent pieces English character acting. Best of all is Peter Barkworth as Eddie Loomis, the school's fussy, pedantic, and increasingly decrepit director. His every detail is eloquent, like the way he leans sideways suspiciously before saying 'Oh good'. At the Richmond Theatre until March 27</p>

The sources said that Jordan's official request, submitted  to  the Iranian Foreign Ministry, seeking a reduction in the number  of diplomats in Iran's embassy in Amman from 40 to nine by the  end of this current month "reflects Jordanian concern about  Iranian ambitions."    They pointed out that the Jordanian Government had moved two  months ago to check the activities of the Iranian diplomatic  mission in Amman after an assault on Jordanian Ambassador in  Tehran Yasin Istanbuli. They said that some unknown individuals  broke into the ambassador's home, tied him up for hours,  searched the house, and stole some of its contents. Official  sources say that they suspect that those individuals who broke  into the ambassador's home and assaulted him belonged to an  Iranian intelligence branch or worked for one of the centers of  power in Tehran.    The Jordanian sources revealed that the government requested  an official "apology" from the Iranian Foreign Ministry for that  assault incident but the Iranian Government only expressed  "regret" about the incident. They said that Jordan also  expressed displeasure at the fact that the Iranian authorities  did not take sufficient security measures to protect the  Jordanian diplomatic mission and discover the identity of the  "unknown" individuals who stormed the ambassador's home.  [passage omitted]    The Jordanian Foreign Ministry has emphasized that it has no  reservations regarding the activities of the Iranian Ambassador  in Amman Ahmad Dashmaltajian despite press reports claiming that  he was one of the founders of Hizballah in Lebanon in  cooperation with Syria.    The Jordanian reservations regarding the Iranian diplomatic  mission concern, among other things, the funding of the Islamic  Research Center in Amman and the attempt to have a seat for  Shiite studies at the Jordanian University. An official source  has stated that Iran "concentrates its efforts on Shiite  cultural and academic aspects with the aim of spreading the  ideologies of the Iranian revolution" but "pays no attention to  economic cooperation between the two countries." He added that  Jordan decided that the presence of 40 Iranian diplomats in  Amman as compared with just three Jordanian diplomats in Tehran  "is unjustifiable...considering the volume of cooperation  between the two countries."    The source also said that "among the Iranian practices in  violation of diplomatic rules and traditions was the attempt by  the Amman mission to distribute books and leaflets against  regimes in the Gulf, a matter which necessitated decisive  intervention by the Jordanian authorities to prevent the  distribution of these books and leaflets."

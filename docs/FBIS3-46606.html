			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by unidentified National Army of Democratic </F> Kampuchea spokesman on 2 Janaury; place not given -- read by  announcer]    [Text] On 31 December French radio reported that puppet Hun  Sen and other leading Vietnamese communist puppets in Phnom Penh  mendaciously announced to everybody that they had captured  Anlung Veng on 30 December. The spokesman of the National Army  of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] would like to totally reject this  vicious propaganda claim by puppet Hun Sen and other leading  Vietnamese communist puppets.    What is the reason for this fabrication by the Vietnamese  communist puppets in Phnom Penh?    1. It is to scare those who do not know the truth, and it is  aimed at undermining the king's national reconciliation effort.    2. It is to boost the morale of their soldiers who are badly  dispirited, combat weary, and mutinous against their commanders  everywhere.    3. It is to deceive others in their show of hollow force  against the masses, the students, the teachers, and other  residents in Phnom Penh who are revolting against the Vietnamese  communist regime and the two-headed, three-eyed administration  both in Phnom Penh and the provinces; and so on.    As a matter of fact, however, the masses and the people have  seen through that lie.    One thing that everybody admits as true is that the  Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and their alliance have  been attacking the people and Democratic Kampuchea. They have  been attacking us all the time, both on the battlefield and in  their psychological propaganda activities.    1. More than 200,000 Vietnamese communists attacked  Democratic Kampuchea and the Cambodian people for 13 years.    2. After the signing of the Paris agreement, the alliance  both inside and outside the UN Transitional Authority in  Cambodia [UNTAC] joined hands with the Vietnamese communists and  their puppets in attacking Democratic Kampuchea.    3. Immediately after the formation of the provisional  two-headed government in July 1993, the Vietnamese communists,  the alliance, and their puppets launched attacks against  Democratic Kampuchea and the people, particularly at Phnum Chhat  and in Stoung. And after the adoption of the Constitution and  formation of the so-called legal two-headed government, they  again have begun attacking Democratic Kampuchea and the people.    Although the king entreats: Children, you should be  reconciled with one another; the people say: Let us be  reconciled; and the world community urges: Cambodians, be  reconciled; but the Vietnamese communists, their puppets, and  their alliance keep shouting: Fight! Fight! Fight!    The truth is that hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese  communists have been attacking and slaughtering the Cambodian  people and Democratic Kampuchea for the past 13, 14, or 15  years; the Vietnamese communist puppets have been serving the  Vietnamese communists for the past 13, 14, or 15 years; and  UNTAC came in to help them for another 18 months.    The Cambodian nation and people, like the world people at  large, have seen and heard about the defeats of these warmongers  bent against peace and national reconciliation. Most are of the  opinion that the more they struggle and writhe, the firmer and  tighter they become fastened. The ones who are holding onto the  noose around their necks are not Democratioc Kampuchea nor the  Khmer Rouge; it is the Cambodian people, the students, the  teachers, and the soldiers who are opposed to the aggressor  Vietnamese communist regime and are jointly supportive of the  king's national reconciliation policy.    [Dated] 2 January 1994    [Signed] Spokesman of the NADK</p>

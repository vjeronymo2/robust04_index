			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Try advances 22% to Pounds 2.2m Try, the property and construction group, yesterday unveiled a 22 per cent rise to Pounds 2.2m in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31. It also reported that sales of its houses had doubled in the last six weeks. Mr Hugh Try, chairman, said that although the actual number was small, the company had seen a 'definite pick up' in sales. The increase in activity had been felt across the group's geographical spread of Scotland, East Anglia and south of London. During the year Try sold 168 units, compared with 171 last time. He warned, however, that the contracting industry continued to face a difficult period. 'We are not prepared to maintain volume without an acceptable margin,' he said. Operating profits in the contracting division fell by Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.3m. Group turnover during the year fell from Pounds 124.6m to Pounds 114.3m. The housebuilding division reduced losses from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1m, after the Pounds 1m exceptional write-down on the value of housing land. A further Pounds 3.2m extraordinary provision was made against the closure of the property development division. The final dividend is maintained at 4p for a 6p (same) total.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sandoz share split plan welcomed Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said its consolidated net income jumped 14 per cent last year to SFr1.7bn (Dollars 1.2bn). It attributed the rise to increases in drug sales volume, improved margins in its chemicals and environment sector and higher financial income. This news, plus the proposal by directors to split the shares five-for-one and convert the participation certificates into registered shares, was well received in the markets. The registered shares gained SFr20 to SFr3,970 and the certificates put on SFr50 to SFr3,970. Sandoz also announced that Mr Marc Moret, the chairman, would pass on the function of chief executive to Mr Rolf Schweizer, the vice-chairman. It said the move should not be read as a slight to Mr Daniel Wagniere, appointed chief operating officer a year ago. It was designed to ensure a step-by-step succession. Group sales rose 5 per cent to SFr15.1bn and operating income was up 9 per cent to SFr2.2bn. Sandoz said its operating margin in the life sciences sector - comprising pharmaceuticals, nutrition products and seeds - advanced from 16.6 per cent to 16.7 per cent in spite of the unfavourable business climate. Directors proposed a 23 per cent rise in dividends.</p>

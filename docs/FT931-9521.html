			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Workers fury at job-loss terms ANGRY and emotional scenes at the gates of Leyland Daf's British plants yesterday afternoon reflected the deep sense of outrage among workers at the receiver's redundancy announcements. They are especially incensed about the contrast between the position of those whose jobs have been cut in the UK and that of their colleagues from the company's Dutch plants who have also lost their jobs as a result of Daf's liquidation. Mr Michael Smyth, 45, who has worked for the company at Leyland, Lancashire, since January 1970, said: 'I'm leaving with my shoes, my brew and my tea cup after 22 years. The gaffer just called me over and said I had lost my job. Where will I get another at my age?' The company is not obliged to pay any redundancy money, either in the Netherlands or in Britain, and it will not be doing so. Daf workers in both countries will have to rely on state help to survive. In Britain statutory redundancy provision is one week's pay to a maximum of Pounds 205 for every year's employment with the company to a maximum of 20 years' service - a total of Pounds 6,150. Average redundancy payments at Leyland Daf are estimated by the Department of Employment to be Pounds 2,812.50. Yesterday the company said that at the request of the receiver the Department of Employment had agreed to speed up payment of redundancy to the Leyland Daf workers from the usual 14 weeks to one week. They will receive unemployment benefit at Pounds 43.10 for a single person and Pounds 26.60 for a dependent adult. The Department of Employment estimates that the 1,635 redundancies will cost the taxpayer Pounds 4.5m. If Leyland Daf had been able to honour its redundancy agreement it would have cost the company Pounds 30m, according to the receiver. In the Netherlands, the state will give Daf's dismissed workers their normal pay for the next six weeks, followed by weekly payments to those who remain jobless of 70 per cent of previous earnings up to a maximum of Pounds 20,000 a year for up to three years. Redundant workers must satisfy the authorities that they are seeking work. 'It is a scandal that British workers are being treated in this cavalier fashion,' Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU engineering and electricians' union, said yesterday. 'Other European countries make provisions to treat their redundant workers decently.' Mr Tony Woodley, the TGWU general union's national secretary for the auto industry, said unions at Leyland Daf were 'ready to assist in any way to secure the future of the Daf plants'.</p>

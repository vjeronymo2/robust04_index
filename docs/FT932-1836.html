			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Personal View: Science policy for the central planner Mr William Waldegrave, UK minister for science, does not seem to understand why a market economy is efficient. The centrepiece of his white paper on science, engineering and technology is the adoption of the methods of the central planner to guide the government's expenditure on research in the academic world. Called 'technology foresight', the favoured technique entails setting up panels of experts for each technology sector in the economy. These panels will collect opinions on scientific opportunities and potential market applications from experts in each sector, and then seek to identify the technologies which will be most important to the economy. The criterion of importance will be the match between the strength of the research groups and that of companies able to exploit their research. The government aims to establish a single consensus view of the academic research that the government should finance to help industry; it will also increase the quantity of this commercially relevant research. But a market economy is more efficient than a centrally planned economy because there are many sources of decisions, not just one. No fallible human can be right most of the time about such uncertain issues as research that will produce useful results. The more people take such decisions independently, the greater chance there is that someone will be right. If individual companies undertake 'technology foresight' to guide their research programmes, they should promote economic growth. But if governments do it, and impose their views on the economy, they will hinder organic growth. Prosperity may also be reduced by emphasising commercial relevance when selecting academic research for support. Such relevance is appropriate to technology, where academics would naturally have close relations with industry; but it is less likely to be appropriate in the sciences. If most academic research is expected to produce applicable results, less curiosity-orientated research will be done. Curiosity-orientated research - pure research - has led to important new industries, such as biotechnology, and often to useful by-products. Emphasising utility in academic research may reduce the chance of breakthroughs which provide significant industrial benefits. Science policy has long been the last refuge of the enthusiastic planner. The founding father of science policy, J D Bernal, was a Marxist. Many of the people attracted to the subject do not believe in the market, and businessmen and scientists often fail to recognise the conceptual difference between a company and a state. It is surprising that a government which espouses the advantages of the market economy should share such conceptual confusions, and that it should rely on a largely untried technique for planning future expenditure on science. Although the white paper says that 'technology foresight' has delivered considerable benefits in other countries, the supporting study shows that these benefits have been in developing policies and promoting discussion - not in improving the productivity of research. The technique is still at an experimental stage, and has been used on a large scale only in Japan and the Netherlands. The government will therefore be lucky if it gets results by its target date of the autumn of 1994. The idea that forecasts of UK economic developments and industrial strengths can be used in deciding which scientific proposals would be worth developing displays optimism about the forecasts' value and, implicitly, pessimism about industry's ability to adjust to new technologies. It also betrays ignorance of the growing internationalisation of industry, and a simplistic belief in mercantilism. Prosperity will be enhanced if research and production are done where they can be done with the most efficiency. A science policy appropriate to a market economy might encourage industrialists and academics to consult one another, but would leave them to decide whether they collaborated and what research they should do. Industrialists know best what research would be relevant to industry and are most likely to exploit the results if they have paid for them. The government would only finance pure research for which no application was foreseen; and provide financial incentives to encourage industry to give money to universities to fund such research. Academic research is more likely to benefit the nation if researchers are free to chose what they do; so government should promote academic independence. In determining its policy for science, the government would do well to follow the advice that the German government recently received. That is, the main question in choosing the areas of science to support should be: where are the best scientists working? The author is an economic consultant</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Arjo optimistic despite 24% decline to Pounds 122m The paper industry has begun to recover after five years of decline, according to Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Anglo-French paper manufacturer. In an optimistic statement yesterday, it said that paper prices had begun to rise in the last quarter of 1993 and remained firm this year. However, the benefits of this recovery in prices and volume came too late to prevent a 24 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 122.1m (Pounds 161.1m) in 1993. Volume rose by 3 per cent and turnover by 4 per cent to Pounds 2.73bn. However, at constant 1993 average exchange rates, turnover fell 4 per cent implying an average fall in prices of 7 per cent. The pre-tax figure was hurt by exceptional restructuring costs of Pounds 13.7m for the closure of a German pulp mill and a 25 per cent reduction in staff at a Spanish mill. It was also hit by provisions for unrealised losses on foreign currency loans to its Portuguese associate Soporcel. This figure was Pounds 14.1m (Pounds 3m). The effect of these was that operating profit, before exceptionals, was down just 5 per cent to Pounds 184.4m (Pounds 193m). Earnings per share fell by 35 per cent to 7.5p (11.6p). The proposed final dividend is held at 3.85p making an unchanged 6.5p for the year. The dividend cover of 1.3 was a low in the current cycle, said Mr Alain Soulas, chief executive. He repeated the company's aim of maintaining long term cover in the 2 to 2.5 range. Net borrowings rose slightly to Pounds 303.2m (Pounds 284.9m) with gearing at 25.7 per cent (23.6 per cent). Mr Soulas said that the strength of the balance sheet meant 'we can grow by acquisition, especially in paper merchanting.' COMMENT At first sight, Mr Soulas' optimism looks overdone. A few months of recovery seem scant compensation for years of falling sales and profits and a frozen dividend. But a business like Arjo's has huge operational gearing: when sales and prices recover, a lot of the gain falls straight through to the bottom line. The real question is whether the sales growth since the autumn has been much more than merchants restocking. Four years of falling prices meant that stocks were as low as possible on the grounds that they would be even cheaper the following month. But there are some good signs: real price rises and six months of better sales sounds like genuine demand. Even if there is a hiccup over the slow summer months, 1994's pre-tax profits should easily exceed 1992's and possibly stretch towards the Pounds 170m mark. That would be a long way short of the Pounds 260m achieved as recently as 1991 and would still leave the stock on a chunky prospective p/e in the upper 20s. But if recovery continues, that operational gearing should come to the rescue and push the p/e below the market average by 1996.</p>

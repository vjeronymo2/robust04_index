The opposition is expected to try to exploit the change to  force the government into calling an early election. However,  the dissident Centre Democrat, Mrs Bente Juncker, has said that  as long as the government sticks to the policy programme agreed  when the government was formed in January last year she would  not help to bring it down.    An election to the Folketing must be called by the prime  minister, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Social Democratic party  leader, by December 6. Mr Rasmussen has repeatedly said that he  will postpone calling an election as long as possible.    Mrs Juncker was appointed minister for social affairs,  replacing a Social Democratic minister, in a cabinet reshuffle  on January 27. The reshuffle was intended to strengthen the  government in general and the Centre Democrats in particular in  the run-up to the election but it went badly wrong.    Two weeks after the reshuffle Mrs Juncker was dismissed for  passing on libellous rumours to journalists concerning the head  of a home for mentally retarded adults.    Recent opinion polls suggest that the government -- made up  of the Social Democrats, the Centre Democrats, the Christian  People's party and the Radical Liberals -- will lose seats in an  election. There is a risk that the Centre Democrats, with nine  seats, and the Christian People's party, with four seats, will  be eliminated from the Folketing altogether.    If an election result were to follow the opinion polls, Mr  Rasmussen would continue to have a good chance of forming a  minority administration, but he would have to rely on the  support of the left-wing Socialist People's party.</p>

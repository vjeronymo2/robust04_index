			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon President Glavkos Kliridhis will  inform Robert Lamb, the U.S. coordinator on the Cyprus issue,  that the process of the proximity talks cannot continue,  following the Turkish side's negative stance. The meeting  between Mr. Kliridhis and the U.S. official has been set for  1700 today. Mr. Lamb had a meeting with Turkish Cypriot leader  Rauf Denktas this morning.    Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that President  Kliridhis will also stress to the U.S. official that the only  thing that can be done at this time for an agreement is for the  Turkish side to accept the UN document as it stands.    Responding to questions, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that the Greek  Cypriot side will cooperate fully with the UN secretary general  with the aim of having the 21 March document accepted, because  without its acceptance any dialogue would be fruitless. Mr.  Kasoulidhis also noted that many things will become clear at the  Kliridhis-Lamb meeting this afternoon. He also gave a negative  answer to a question on whether pressure is being exercised on  our side. Mr. Kasoulidhis further expressed the view that the  United Nations will not continue to be hopeful after the end of  April that Rauf Denktas will change his stand if he does not  accept the document by then.    The government spokesman also said that representations have  been made to third parties on their intervention with the UN  secretary general to amend his original report, but the  spokesman did not make it clear who these third parties are.  Responding to a question, Mr. Kasoulidhis said that if third  parties want to contribute toward a Cyprus solution they can do  so provided they realize that the very initiative of the  secretary general's representatives is in danger of failing if  the time limits are not observed and the international  organization is discouraged from remaining firm on the result it  had decided upon.    Responding to a question whether the government is satisfied  with President Clinton's election commitments, the government  spokesman said that it is too early to answer this question  because, as he noted, the Cyprus Government would first like to  see the U.S. reaction when the effort it is making to have the  Turkish side agree fails. At the same time, Mr. Kasoulidhis  said that the government has made it clear since last year that  it is prepared to proceed with talks on the substance of the  Cyprus issue by using Butrus-Ghali's set of ideas.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLAN TO SHIP SAND TO CABRILLO BEACH  </P> <P> About 200,000 cubic yards of sand near the Hyperion sewage treatment plant in  Playa del Rey would be dumped on Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro under a plan  endorsed Wednesday by the Los Angeles City Council.  </P> <P> The sand would be used to replenish the outer beach, which suffers severe  erosion because it is located outside the harbor's breakwater. The inner beach,  which is protected inside the breakwater, would not be affected.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County, which maintains the beach, has agreed to prepare the  various environmental documents for the plan, but the city still needs approval  from, among others, the California Coastal Commission and the U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers.  </P> <P> Under the plan proposed by Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, the sand would be  removed and hauled from Playa del Rey by contractors building an annex to the  sewage treatment plant. It would then be spread across the beach by the city's  Department of Recreation and Parks. City officials said they hope to award a  contract for the hauling job next August.  </P></p>

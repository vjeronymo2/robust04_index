			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Rabin warns over defeat in Jerusalem MR YITZHAK Rabin, Israeli prime minister, warned yesterday the defeat of his Labour party and of veteran Mayor Teddy Kollek in Jerusalem municipal elections would have a damaging impact on the Israeli-Palestinian peace process and on Arab-Jewish relations in the holy city. His warning came after preliminary results of the Jerusalem poll last night showed a substantial victory by Mr Ehud Olmert, the right-wing Likud candidate, over Mr Kollek, the moderate mayor who has led the city for 28 years. Mr Olmert said yesterday the preliminary results showed he had defeated Mr Kollek by 59.5 per cent to 34.6 per cent. Elsewhere in the country the Likud party kept control of Tel Aviv, Israel's commercial capital, and took six other councils from Labour. Labour won three councils from Likud. The results of the Jerusalem election are a big boost to the demoralised Likud party and a setback for Mr Rabin who had, unwisely according to political experts, turned the municipal polls into a vote of confidence in his peace policy. Mr Olmert, a 48-year-old former cabinet minister, campaigned on an aggressive policy of Jewish settlement anywhere throughout the divided city and has raised fears of increasing Arab-Jewish tensions at the heart of the most sensitive issue for future peace talks: the control over the disputed city. Last night Mr Olmert, who has opposed the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, said he strongly supported solidifying Jerusalem as a united city under Israeli sovereignty. He said he firmly backed the right of any residents of Jerusalem, Arab or Jew, to buy property anywhere in the city. In practice experts say this would open the door for ideological Jewish settlement in Arab neighbourhoods. Senior Palestinian politicians warned that Mr Olmert's election would exacerbate already strained relations between the two communities in Jerusalem. Mr Rabin yesterday warned against the dangers of Mr Olmert reviving past efforts by Likud to settle Jews in Arab areas. 'If there will be a repetition to what the Likud did in the past in sneaking to apartments in the Old City, Silwan and the City of David it can cause a great harm to the delicate fabric of relations.' Mr Olmert last night criticised Mr Rabin for politicising his elections and sought to reassure Jerusalem residents and said he would treat Arabs as equal to Jews in the allocation of resources. 'We will invest more in improving the quality of life of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem. This is our elementary obligation as human beings.' Mr Olmert however stressed that he expected to be deeply involved in negotiations about the future of Jerusalem due to begin within two years and would insist on no territorial concessions to Palestinians.</p>

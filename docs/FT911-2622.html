			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Money Markets: Holding support STERLING'S political risk was illustrated last week by its nervous decline as financial markets looked to this week's UK local elections in England and Wales for guidance on the timing of the next general election. Disappointing economic news, including a widening of the March UK current account deficit, also had an impact. If this trend continues, the market will be obliged to take another look at the assumed timetable for cuts in UK bank base rates. Wholesale rates point towards further reductions, but the mood is not quite as confident as it was. Short sterling futures give a good guide. The price for June delivery touched a high of 89.13 on March 15, indicating that the three-month interbank rate was likely to be below 11 per cent by mid-June. To calculate the expected level, subtract 89.13 from 100.00. This gives an answer of 10.87, or about 10 7/8 per cent for the three-month offered rate in the cash market at delivery. This is not an exact prediction, because of technical costs involved in running a futures contract, but it indicates roughly where the market thinks it is moving. The high point was touched a few day's before the Budget, on March 19, but a week later the mood of euphoria had changed. June short sterling fell to 88.57 on March 26, suggesting a cash rate of about 11 1/2 per cent at delivery. The price of 88.57 is now an important level, with dealers noting that there is then little in the way of further technical support until 88.35. A low of 88.55 was touched last Wednesday, but support was not decisively broken and by Friday the contract had rallied to 88.62 at the close. Whether this continues to hold is likely to depend on the result of the local elections, and on sterling's performance in the ERM, nowadays two not unrelated factors.</p>

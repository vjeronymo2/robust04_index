			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Right Honorable Dr. Ntsu  Mokhehle, has announced that members of the Royal Lesotho  Defense Force have been dispatched to all the districts to  maintain law and order as a result of the strike by members of  the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police.    In a statement released today, Dr. Ntsu Mokhehle said that  the nation should remain calm and not be alarmed by the presence  of members of the defense force. The prime minister further  requests the nation to cooperate with the defense force members  in their effort to protect human life and property, and to  maintain peace and stability.    The striking police have reported that they will not accept  their monthly salaries at the end of the month, which is on  Friday next week. In a letter reportedly written to the  minister of finance, police say they want 60 percent increase  for police officers, soldiers, and prison officers. They also  demand a risk allowance increase of 100 percent for the three  categories. The letter states that the police will not resume  work before their demands, which include mountain allowance,  patrol rotation, plain-clothes allowance, and patrol allowance,  are met.    The letter says that police want the Police Order of 1991 to  be repealed so that their promotions should be controlled by the  commissioner of police and not the principal secretary of home  affairs, as they allege is the case now.    The strike began yesterday, and reports from different  districts say police are not working countrywide. The strike by  members of the Royal Lesotho Mounted Police continued throughout  the country today. Reports of loss of life, looting, and  destruction of property have been received, and members of the  Royal Lesotho Defense Force have been deployed to maintain law  and order. It is reported from Mohale's Hoek that residents  have taken the initiative to protect property in business  premises, as it is apparent that looters come from places  outside the area.    The government is appealing to all Basotho to follow this  initiative and protect business premises in the light of the  current situation and urges employees to cooperate with their  employers, as these businesses are to their benefit.    The government would like to reassure the business community  that the situation, which is taken advantage of by criminal  elements, is now completely under control. It further advises  that great caution and vigilance should be exercised to curb any  further activities of this criminal element.</p>

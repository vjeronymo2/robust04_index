Although it is known that they are posted  throughout the country, their real mission here is not clear.  It has been said that they are here to carry out civic work,  but other sources insist they are participating in  counternarcotics operations.    Several contingents of U.S. soldiers have arrived in  Colombia  to participate in the so-called cooperation plan in the struggle  against drug trafficking. Several soldiers traveled to Leticia  in the Amazon Region to install radar to control clandestine  flights in the southern part of the country. That decision  generated an extensive debate in Congress. Leticia residents  protested, saying that heavily armed soldiers had occupied the  streets.    A group of U.S. soldiers also arrived on San Andres Island  to  install a radar to control aircraft coming from the United  States. Approximately 50 persons from the U.S. Navy, known as  SeaBees, arrived to build a base equipped with several patrol  boats on the banks of the Guaviare River. A similar mission is  being conducted in the Puerto Lopez area, Meta Department.  Soldiers from Ft. Rucker, Alabama, are stationed at Malaga Bay.    According to authorities from both countries, the troops  arrived in Valle del Cauca to build a school and a clinic and to  repair several roads in Juanchaco. The arrival of troops and  their equipment in helicopters and warships has made residents  of those areas skeptical; some believe they came with a  different objective.    A total of six U.S. bases have been built throughout the  country.</p>

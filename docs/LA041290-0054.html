			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO EARNINGS  </P> <P> Infrasonics: The San Diego-based manufacturer of ventilators for hospital and  home-care patients reported a third-quarter profit of $82,000 on sales of $2.1  million, up from a loss of $72,500 on sales of $1.2 million for the same  quarter the previous year. For the first nine months of the fiscal year,  Infrasonics' profit stands at $246,900 on revenue of $4.9 million, contrasted  with a loss of $236,100 on sales of $3.6 million over the same three quarters  the previous year. President Jim Hitchin said the improved sales are due to the  federal Food and Drug Administration's recent approval for the company to begin  selling its high frequency infant respirator, a product that has boosted the  company's market share.  </P> <P> Tables, D13  </P></p>

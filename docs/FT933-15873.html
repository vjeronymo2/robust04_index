			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Katyusha rockets fired into northern Israel A NUMBER of Katyusha rockets fired from Lebanon slammed into northern Israel early on Tuesday, causing light damage, security sources said, Reuter reports from Jerusalem. Rockets landed in Israel's western Galilee and also in Lebanon in Israel's self-styled buffer security zone for repelling guerrilla attacks. No one was injured, the sources said, adding that Israeli troops returned fire. Israeli soldiers had clashed with guerrillas in Lebanon on Monday. Lebanese security sources said two people, one of them a six-month-old baby, died in an Israeli retaliatory attack on guerrilla targets in Lebanon. Israeli residents had braced late on Monday for possible rocket attacks in response to the clash. Israeli security sources said pro-Iranian guerrillas ambushed an Israeli patrol earlier on Monday, wounding one soldier on the edge of the security zone. Hizbollah fighters also attacked a position held by Israeli-backed militiamen in Toumat Niha. Israeli military censors made deletions from this report.</p>

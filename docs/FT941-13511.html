			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Profits surge ahead at US brokers After-tax profits at Merrill Lynch and two other broking firms surged in the last quarter of 1993, setting the seal on a record year for the US broking industry. Commissions and investment banking fees led the rise in revenues in the latest period, as trading volumes on the New York Stock Exchange surged to a peak and companies rushed to raise new equity and debt finance. By contrast, income from principal (or own-account) trading, which had been a big cause of profit growth earlier in the year, fell slightly in the final three months from the previous quarter. Principal trading has been viewed by investors as a volatile source of earnings. Merrill reported net income in the final quarter of Dollars 347m, compared with Dollars 221m the year before. For the year as a whole, net income reached Dollars 1.4bn, or Dollars 5.98 a share, up from Dollars 893m, or Dollars 3.92 a share, the year before. Smith Barney Shearson, created when Travelers (formerly known as Primerica) bought the Shearson retail broking firm from American Express last year, reported net income of Dollars 145.1m in the final quarter of last year, up from Dollars 118.8m in the previous three months (though the preceding quarter only included two months of figures for Shearson). The brokers' figures were bolstered by record turnover levels on the New York Stock Exchange at the end of last year, with commission income at Merrill rising to Dollars 805m from Dollars 690m in the preceding three months. At Shearson, it rose to Dollars 543m from Dollars 407m in the previous period. PaineWebber also reported solid growth in commissions, rising to Dollars 265m in the quarter, from Dollars 248m in the previous three months and Dollars 205m a year before. The rise helped push net income at PaineWebber to Dollars 56.9m, or Dollars 1.08 a share, from Dollars 41.4m, or 73 cents a share, the year before. All three firms also benefitted from a rise in investment banking fees, which at Merrill jumped to Dollars 520m from Dollars 452m in the third quarter, at Smith Barney rose to Dollars 217m from Dollars 200m and at PaineWebber climbed to Dollars 114m from Dollars 101m. Asset management fees rose to Dollars 165m from Dollars 109m at Smith Barney, to Dollars 91m from Dollars 83m at PaineWebber and to Dollars 418m from Dollars 250m at Merrill. By contrast, income from principal (or own-account) trading at Merrill fell to Dollars 675m from Dollars 732m in the previous quarter, while at PaineWebber it fell to Dollars 185m from Dollars 210m. The Smith Barney Shearson results helped to push Travelers' net income for the fourth quarter to Dollars 297.9m, or Dollars 1.19 a share, from Dollars 258.7m, or Dollars 1.03 a share, the previous quarter. For the year as a whole, Travelers' net income was Dollars 915m, or 3.88 a share, up from Dollars 728m, or Dollars 3.35 a share. Stripping out the effects of accounting changes and other one-off factors, net income rose to Dollars 942m from Dollars 621m. Year-ago comparisons are distorted by the acquisition of Shearson. Travelers' figures do not include the results of the Travelers' insurance company, which was absorbed by Primerica at the start of this year and from which the company has taken its name. The whole group will report figures jointly from the first quarter of this year.  -------------------------------------------------------------------          US BROKERS -    1993 RESULTS (Dollars m)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                   Merrill Lynch      PaineWebber      Smith Barney                                                         Shearson Net income                1,358              246              305* (% change)                  +52              +15              n/a  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Revenues from: commissions               2,894              996            1,252 (% change)                  +19              +21              n/a  ------------------------------------------------------------------- principal trading         2,920              779              549 (% change)                  +35               +8              n/a asset management          1,557              325              319 (% change)                  +24              +22              n/a investment banking        1,831              413              667 (% change)                  +23               +8              n/a  ------------------------------------------------------------------- * After dollars 65m restructuring charge  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company figures  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

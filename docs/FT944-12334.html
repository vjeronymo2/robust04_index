			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Big fall in Tories' southern lead The Conservatives are only three points ahead of Labour in southern England from Kent to Dorset, an NOP poll for Meridian, the region's ITV channel, has found. This compares with 35 points at the 1992 election. The poll, on a sample of 750 people, puts the Tories on 40 per cent, Labour on 37 per cent and Liberal Democrats on 20 per cent.</p>

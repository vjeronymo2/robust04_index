			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: "What Are the Deep Wounds of the </F> Islamic Ummah?"]    [Text] King Fahd of Saudi Arabia disseminated a message in  which he has expressed regret at the wounds of the Islamic  ummah. He has also expressed concern about the hiatus in the  so-called peace talks and hopes of peace!    What is worth pondering in this message is the allusion to  the wounds on the body of the Islamic ummah, which have resulted  in discord and rifts among the Muslims. It is important to see  what these wounds are and who has inflicted them.    1. Unfortunately, one of the greatest problems of the  Islamic world at present is that most of the rulers of the  Islamic countries are affiliated with the dominant powers of the  world. This situation is further aggravated when these servile  rulers prefer to obey the great powers and honor them instead of  following Islam and revering the views of the majority of their  own people.    These subservient rulers have always obstructed any progress  or action by the Muslims and one of the reasons for the people's  backwardness is these rulers. This is especially conspicuous  among the Arab countries, where they lack legitimacy and  popularity and where the people are even deprived of the right  to elect their own officials. The Saudi regime is a perfect  example of such a government.    2. Another wound that has been inflicted on the body of the  Islamic ummah is from those who enjoy the privilege of  administering the two holy mosques. Pilgramage is an Islamic  issue and should not be allowed to become a victim to  international politics. Unfortunately, the administrators of the  two holy mosques implement policies that have been described by  the great leader in his 'Id al-Fitr sermon yesterday as  "obstructing" and "creating obstacles." These policies generate  the impression in the minds of the Muslims that the pilgrimage  also takes place in accordance with the whims and wishes of the  United States and the great powers. The Saudi regime should not  prevent the Muslims from participating in the grandest conclave  of the Islamic world.    3. What is the justification for the Arab countries' efforts  for peace with the Zionist regime, which is basically  illegitimate, just when the uprising of the true owners of  Palestine is assuming wider dimensions day by day?    It is extremely unpleasant for Muslims to observe that a  group who claims to govern an Islamic country is seeking to give  official recognition to the Israeli Government in the occupied  Palestinian territories and when there is a pause in this  process they become displeased.    4. Who has dictated the plot for reducing oil prices in  order to disrupt the economies of the oil exporters? Why is it  that the policy of oil production and export of the Islamic  countries that have the largest recognized oil reserves in the  Islamic world should be decided by the United States and other  international powers?    5. Who are those who are suffering losses from a slump in  oil prices and its thousand-percent decrease? Why is Saudi  Arabia opposing the reduction of its oil production, which would  result in a rise in oil prices?    As the Muslims of the world can see, the wounds of the  Islamic ummah are not those mentioned by King Fahd but are those  that have their roots in these affiliated regimes.</p>

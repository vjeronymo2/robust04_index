			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: In the news CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester and Nationwide building societies are cutting investment rates from Monday. They are also offering mortgage rates of 4 per cent. At C&amp;G, cuts are between 0.8 and 0.61 of a percentage point on gross rates. The flat rate on the London Share account is dropping from 7 per cent gross to 6.25; the London Deposit account's top tier of Pounds 25,000 and over will pay 7.2 instead of 8. The Flexi-Tessa rate is 6.85, down from 7.5, but the new Best 90 account is unaffected. It is paying 7.55 on the bottom tier of Pounds 10,000 and up to 8.55 on balances of Pounds 100,000. Nationwide's top tier of CashBuilder (Pounds 25,000 and above) will pay 5.6 per cent gross instead of 6.2. Rates on CapitalBuilder are now 6.3 on the top tier of Pounds 50,000 and above. There are also interest rate and overdraft reductions on Flexaccount, the interest-bearing current account. ***** FIRST-time buyers at C&amp;G are being offered a mortgage of 4 per cent fixed (8.1 apr) until February 28 next year. The mortgage then reverts to C&amp;G's standard variable rate, now 7.99. It is available on interest-only and repayment mortgages for a minimum deposit of 10 per cent. The maximum loan is Pounds 70,000 and application fee is Pounds 50. If you redeem in the first three years, the mortgage will be treated as though you had taken out the loan at the standard rate. Nationwide is selling off up to 1,500 of its repossessed properties for a similarly reduced rate. Buyers will be offered a fixed rate of 4.25 per cent for two years (7.8 apr) and a free valuation. You have to put down a 10 per cent deposit and take out the society's payment cover policy for the fixed-rate period. The arrangement fee is Pounds 50. There are no early redemption penalties. ***** SCOTTISH Amicable reduced payouts on 10-year with-profits policies by more than 15 per cent this week, from Pounds 7,331 to Pounds 6,174 (based on a male, aged 29 at outset, paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums). Roy Nicholson, managing director, said cuts were caused by the group's investment focus on small company shares, which had suffered in the recession. However, this factor had little effect on longer-term policies; accordingly, 25-year policies are being reduced by just 4.7 per cent, from Pounds 62,543 to Pounds 59,602. The payouts represent annual returns of 10.4 per cent for the 10-year policies and 13 per cent for 25 years. ***** It was another good week for small company shares. The County Small Companies Index rose 0.3 per cent from 1051.95 to 1055.57 in the week to February 25 while the Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) increased 0.2 per cent from 1346.28 to 1349.05 over the same period.</p>

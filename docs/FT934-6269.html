			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Belgian Banking and Finance (4): Difficult times ahead - The property market It ranks as the most expensive building in Europe. Shaped like a gigantic glass juke box, the new European Parliament headquarters is known in Brussels as the Caprice des Dieux - a French pun which refers to the oval shape of the roof, a brand of cheese, as well as to its folly. The Parliament's futuristic headquarters is a monument to a bygone era of grand political designs. Its BFr40bn price tag is out of step with today's more sober expectations about the pace of integration in Europe, but it also matches the new mood of austerity in the Belgian property market. After the Roaring Eighties, when development and rents expanded at breakneck speed, Belgium is experiencing stagnation in the property market. Brussels boom will not be followed by bust, in London or New York style, mainly because built-in 'stabilisers' are offered by the presence of European institutions, the Belgian national government, and the 19 Brussels communes. Still, there is a nagging feeling that the good times are unlikely to return any time soon. 'We face a difficult period of one to two years,' says Mr Jean-Claude Vandecauter, general manager of the Brussels office of Knight, Frank and Rutley. Mr John Travers, senior partner with Healey &amp; Baker in Belgium, agrees: 'Yields on property are good, but growth is less good. We are going to have a difficult two to three years.' Experts compare the present slackness to the period immediately after the first oil shock in 1973. This led to a period of slow growth from 1975 to 1985, characterised by a slump in office rentals and a rise in vacancies. What is striking is how the upturn which followed in the mid-to-late 1980s coincided with a fresh political impetus given by the 1992 single market programme. Thus, in the period between 1985 and 1991, rent levels increased at an annual rate of between 12 and 15 per cent a year. Mr Richard Ray, manager of investment at Richard Ellis, believes that rents have dropped as much as between 5 and 10 per cent since the top of the market in late 1991. He quotes BFr8250 and BFr8500 per sq m. 'There is still a little slippage likely next year, but not much more than 10 per cent,' says Mr Ray. Availability tells a similarly bleak story. As recently as 18 months ago, availability in the capital was as low as 2.5 per cent. But according to January figures, 6.4 per cent of office space was now available for rent. In the summer of 1993, it rose to 7 per cent. It could rise to 8.5 per cent in 1994. Mr Philippe Winssinger, managing director of Debenham, Tewson, Winssinger, explains: 'There is less demand. Corporate profits are stagnant, so the first place companies look to cut costs is office space and personnel.' He cites examples such as the recent restructuring ordered by IBM and Wang, two important computer employers in Belgium, as well as Societe Generale de Belgique, the industrial holding company. Aside from the recession, the strict urban planning policy of Mr Charles Picque, minister-president of the Brussels-capital region has restricted development. The policy has, however, helped to support rents; and most developers recognise that there is no chance of returning to the late 1960s, when many of the capital's historic areas were torn down in a free-for-all which reflected as badly on the politicians and planners as on the developers. Today, one of the built-in insurances is the continuing expansion of the European Commission. Though the Commission is not taking up availability at its former rate, it is still on the look-out for places to put fonctionnaires displaced from its Berlaymont headquarters, which remains an empty shell awaiting renovation. The Quartier Leopold area still looks a good long-term bet. Yet the present difficulties should not be exaggerated. Healey &amp; Baker's recent survey of the European property market placed Brussels in a strong fourth position behind London, Paris and Frankfurt. Brussels continues to be seen as the most important political centre in Europe, boasting not only the the Commission but also the Council of Ministers, the Council Secretariat and the European Parliament - with all the attendant lobbyists and lawyers. The addition of new members to the newly-formed European Union over the next decade will also maintain momentum in the property market. Austria, Finland, Sweden, and Norway are seeking to enter the EU by January 1, 1995. If they succeed, there will an immediate requirement for more interpreters, more translators - and more office space. 'It is a psychological boost,' says Mr Vandecauter. On the other hand, international institutions are not the dominant players in the Brussels letting market - they only account for about 16 per cent of office occupation. Belgian state (30 per cent), international private sector (24 per cent) and Belgian private sector (23 per cent) all have a bigger presence. In the longer term, the former European Community occupied 400,000 square feet only 15 years ago; today, it occupies 1m square feet. In 15 years, some experts put the requirement as high as 3m square feet. Outside Brussels, the highlight of the Belgian property market this year was the opening of the country's largest out-of-town shopping centre at Wijnegem, near Antwerp. It contains 170 shops spread over 37,000 sq m, together with a 14,000 sq m hypermarket. Mr Travers says that foreign retailers are moving into Belgium at an impressive rate. Recent newcomers include Henness &amp; Mauritz, the Swedish clothes chain, and Zara, a Spanish competitor. They follow in the footsteps of some important French and Dutch entrants into the Belgian market. However difficult the present market, the longer-term outlook seems assured. Even though building and development will not be on the scale of the European Parliament complex, the fundamentals look fairly strong. Mr Travers has spent the last 20 years in Belgium. 'I believe in Brussels,' he says.</p>

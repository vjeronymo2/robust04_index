			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _All activities necessary for placing the new facilities into operation including engineering and frequency coordination must be completed before relocation, including engineering and frequency coordination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The new communications system must be fully built and tested before the relocation itself commences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Should the new facilities in practice prove not to be equivalent in every respect, within one year the public safety operation may relocate back to its original facilities and stay there until complete equivalency (or better) is attained. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 7. When disputes do arise in relocation negotiations, the Commission stated that they can be resolved best through individual mediation and arbitration efforts rather than adjudication by the Commission. Thus, the Commission emphasized its intent to use alternative dispute resolution (``ADR'') techniques to expedite and improve the relocation process whenever feasible. Resolution of such disputes entirely by the Commission's adjudication processes would be time consuming and costly to all parties. Therefore, the Commission continued to encourage parties unable to voluntarily conclude relocation agreements to employ ADR techniques during both the voluntary and mandatory negotiation periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Nevertheless, the Commission stated that it is cognizant of Petitioners' concern that public safety entities with limited resources not be placed in situations in which they would have to accept less favorable terms if disputes arise in the negotiation and relocation process. In considering this issue, in addition to or as a supplement to ADR, the Commission stated that it believes an effective way to expedite the negotiation process and minimize the burden on all parties in these situations is to encourage parties to utilize independent, impartial estimates of the costs to relocate the existing operation to a comparable facility. In order to be fair to all parties, the independent estimates would need to include both the specifications for a comparable new facility and the costs associated with providing that facility to the incumbent licensee. The Commission stated that it believes that in most cases the availability of the option of choosing to resolve disputes through the use of independent estimates will provide an incentive for both sides in a negotiation to work quickly towards a mutually agreeable solution. In cases in which such estimates are obtained, they will provide a benchmark for an agreement that could avoid the need for the parties bringing the dispute to the Commission. However, where such disputes come before the Commission, it will expect the incumbent to have obtained  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> bona fide <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  independent estimates of its relocation costs and to present those estimates to the Commission for consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. Accordingly, the Commission modified its mandatory relocation procedures to provide for consideration of independent estimates by third parties not associated or otherwise affiliated with either the incumbent licensee or the new service provider. Under this new provision, the Commission will consider the independent estimates of the cost of replacement facilities obtained by incumbent licensees in deciding any relocation disputes that are brought before it. The Commission stated that it believes that the responsibility for obtaining independent estimates should rest with the incumbent licensee, as the licensee will be in the best position to describe to parties preparing estimates the operating requirements for the new facility. Incumbent licensees are encouraged to present two separately prepared estimates obtained from qualified professional third parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Commission stated that independent estimates presented in disputes brought to it for resolution must include a specification for the comparable facility and a statement of costs of providing that facility to the incumbent licensee. The specification should describe the design and technical parameters of the new facility, the equipment to be used in its construction, a statement attesting to the comparability of the proposed new facility to the facility it would replace, and a testing and transition plan. The cost statement should include individual estimates for the design of the new facility, equipment, and testing, as well as the transition. Where the two estimates are substantially different, the Commission expects the participating parties to choose the most reliable and reasonable estimate, average the two estimates, or obtain a third estimate by a mutually agreeable party. If a dispute is brought to the Commission, it will consider the two estimates as evidence of the relocation cost but retain discretion to make its own determination based upon the facts presented to the Commission. In deciding such cases, the Commission stated that it intends to be guided by the principle of ensuring that the incumbent is provided a comparable facility at the minimum cost to the new service provider. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Commission stated that it encouraged public safety licensees to obtain two independent estimates of the cost to relocate with comparable facilities early in the relocation process. The Commission believes that such estimates will be very helpful in the negotiation process, including those cases that employ ADR techniques. Moreover, having such estimates at its disposal, should Commission intervention become necessary, will expedite a relocation process that is fair to all parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. The Commission also shared Petitioners' concern that public safety systems, especially those in rural areas, must have adequate time to negotiate relocation agreements. Previously, the Commission recognized that the demand for the new technology spectrum will vary from market to market and from one area to another and that in some areas, incumbent 2 GHz facilities may not need to relocate as quickly as in areas where spectrum is needed more quickly for emerging technologies. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> MO&amp;O, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the Commission adopted a bifurcated four-year voluntary/one-year mandatory negotiation period to accommodate these variations in demand. However, the Commission agreed with Petitioners that public safety licensees may need more than one year to negotiate agreements where the negotiations do not start until sometime after the voluntary period has expired. Accordingly, the Commission modified the relocation plan to extend the mandatory negotiation period for public safety entities to two years. However, the Commission concluded that it would not serve the public interest in implementing broadband PCS to extend to six years the current five year period of protection for public safety facilities. As stated previously in this proceeding, the Commission's primary goal is to provide usable spectrum for the implementation of emerging technologies in an expeditious manner. Therefore, the Commission maintained the current five year period for public safety facilities by shortening the four-year voluntary period to three-years. The relocation plan for public safety facilities will thus provide a three-year period for voluntary negotiations followed by a two-year period for mandatory negotiations. This will provide public safety entities, especially those with facilities in rural areas, ample time to negotiate and conclude agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ordering Clauses. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Accordingly,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it is ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That the petition for reconsideration filed jointly by the Public Safety Microwave Committee, the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International, Inc., the County of Los Angeles, and the Forestry-Conservation Communication Association IS GRANTED to the extent described above and is denied in all other respects. Further,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> it is ordered, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That Part 94 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations is amended as specified in the Appendix, effective 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

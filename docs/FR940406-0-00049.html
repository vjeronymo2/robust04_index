The Board is not required to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods are effective in achieving compliance with this subpart G. In choosing among available methods for meeting the requirements of this subpart G, the Board gives priority to those methods that offer programs and activities to qualified individuals with a disability in the most integrated setting appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Time period for compliance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Board shall comply with any obligations established under this subpart G as expeditiously as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;268.707 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Program accessibility: New construction and alterations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each building or part of a building that is constructed or altered by, on behalf of, or for the use of the Board, shall be designed, constructed, or altered so as to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with a disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;268.708 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Communications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The Board shall take appropriate steps to ensure effective communication with applicants for employment, participants, personnel of other Federal entities, and members of the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Board shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids where necessary to afford an individual with a disability an equal opportunity to participate in, and enjoy the benefits of, a program or activity conducted by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) In determining what type of auxiliary aid is necessary, the Board shall give primary consideration to the requests of the individual with a disability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Board need not provide individually prescribed devices, readers for personal use or study, or other devices of a personal nature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Where the Board communicates with employees and others by telephone, telecommunication devices for deaf persons (TDD's) or equally effective telecommunication systems shall be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Board shall ensure that interested persons, including persons with impaired vision or hearing, can obtain information as to the existence and location of accessible services, activities, and facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Board shall provide signs at a primary entrance to any inaccessible facility, directing users to a location at which they can obtain information about accessible facilities. The international symbol for accessibility shall be used at each primary entrance of an accessible facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) This subpart G does not require the Board to take any action that would result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a program or activity or in undue financial and administrative burdens. In those circumstances where the Board believes that the proposed action would fundamentally alter the program or activity or would result in undue financial and administrative burdens, the Board shall establish a written record showing compliance with this subpart G would result in such alterations or burdens. The determination that compliance would result in such alterations or burdens shall be made by the Board of Governors or their designee after considering all Board resources available for use in the funding and operation of the conducted program or activity, and must be accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for reaching that conclusion. If an action required to comply with this subpart G would result in such an alteration or such burdens, the Board shall take any other action that would not result in such an alteration or such burdens but would nevertheless ensure that, to the maximum extent possible, individuals with a disability receive the benefits and services of the program or activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

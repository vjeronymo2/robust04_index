			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Observer: Taken away Looks like the owners of four of London's trendiest Chinese restaurants were too busy meditating to notice that their holding company was levitating somewhere below solvency. Blaidwood, which owns Now &amp; Zen, ZenW3, Zen Central and Zen Chelsea, has gone into receivership this week because it cannot service loans unrelated to its food outlets. The good news is that the receivers believe the eateries in question remain an appetising target for prospective purchasers.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional lift for Home Counties The poor economic situation, particularly in the south-east of England, was blamed by Home Counties Newspaper Holdings for a fall into operating losses in the six months to June 30. On turnover of Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 10.8m) the company reported operating losses of Pounds 203,000, against profits of Pounds 199,000. However, investment income of Pounds 237,000 (Pounds 470,000) and an exceptional gain of Pounds 512,000 (Pounds 33,000 charge) on the sale of Reuters' shares left the pre-tax figure at Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 636,000). Earnings per share were 3.66p (4.25p) and the interim dividend is maintained at 2.75p.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taipei, Feb. 24 (CNA) -- Delegates from Taiwan and  the United States began three days of negotiations here Thursday  [24 February] on tariff reductions.    Taiwan is required to hold tariff reduction talks with  member  countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a  condition to gaining membership in the world trade body.    Taiwan hopes agreements reached at this round of  negotiations  will set the tone for its subsequent negotiations with other  GATT members.    Vice Economics Minister Sheu Ke-sheng [Hsu K'e-sheng] and  Assistant US Trade Representative for GATT Affairs Dorothy  Dwoskin are the chief negotiators for the two sides. Sheu [Hsu]  heads up a 170-person delegation.    According to sources at the talks, the United States is  likely to request that Taiwan agree to the bilateral elimination  of tariffs on 2,172 products.    Last year the United States asked Taiwan to lower tariff  rates on industrial and agricultural goods to 10 and 20 percent,  respectively.    The US side is also likely to claim "initial negotiation  rights" regarding tariffs on an additional 2,786 of its export  items to Taiwan, the sources said.    Other topics to be discussed include nontariff obstacles and  Taiwan's monopoly system.</p>

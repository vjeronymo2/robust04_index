			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / British Aerospace cuts 600 jobs BRITISH Aerospace yesterday announced it was cutting 600 jobs in its regional aircraft operations in the Greater Manchester area because of the recession in the commercial airline industry. The cuts at BAe's Woodford and Chadderton plants follow a company warning earlier this week that a further 650 jobs are likely to be lost next year at its commercial aircraft plants at Filton in Bristol and Broughton near Chester. The latest cuts reflect the continuing pressures on BAe's commuter and regional aircraft markets as well as the decision of the European Airbus consortium to reduce production because of cancellations and order deferrals. BAe, which manufactures the wings for Airbus airliners, is having to scale back production to match the reduced rate of Airbus output following recent decisions by large customers such as Northwest Airlines to cancel big orders. Before the latest job cuts, BAe unveiled a radical restructuring programme for its loss-making commercial aircraft activities, including the closure of its aircraft manufacturing plant at Hatfield, the shedding of 3,000 jobs and a preliminary agreement to join its regional jet activities with Taiwan Aerospace. The restructuring also involved the transfer of turbopropeller commuter aircraft activities to Prestwick in Scotland. But BAe said it was reducing its commercial aircraft workforce further because 'the effects of the recession on the airline industry are on-going, with consequent deferment and cancellation of orders'. The company, one of the UK's biggest manufacturers, has also made heavy job cuts in its defence activities. It said that its latest market outlook required it to adopt a 'more prudent' approach to its regional jet and turbopropeller commuter aircraft production. The restructuring moves coincide with the final round of negotiations between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace for a joint regional aircraft venture. BAe said the negotiations were making 'good progress'. BAe and Taiwan Aerospace said in September they expected to complete the deal by the end of the year. However, several aerospace industry analysts expect the transaction to take longer. The latest round of BAe job cuts were attacked by the Labour party and by the engineering unions. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman, said: 'If we are to have an industrial future, these are the type of hi-tech jobs we cannot afford to lose.'</p>

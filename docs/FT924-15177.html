			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sage expands via buys in France and the US SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based accounting software supplier, is paying an initial Pounds 4.4m cash for two acquisitions, one in France, its first in mainland Europe, the other in the US. It is paying FFr12.5m (Pounds 1.4m) for 95 per cent of Ciel, a Paris-based software house - like Sage, a fast-growing supplier of accounting software for small businesses. There are further revenue-related payments for the former owners, who are staying on as management, to a maximum of Pounds 5m during the next two years. The remaining five per cent is subject to a put and call agreement, providing further incentive for the former owners to improve revenues and profits. Last year, Ciel's sales were more than FFr18.9m and are expected to be more than FFr25m this year. It is profitable with more than 800 new users each month, but Mr David Goldman, Sage chairman, said the company had yet to exploit recurring revenues from sales of maintenance and stationery. He expected gross profit margins of above 25 per cent eventually. Sage is paying Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.3m) for Remote Control International, a supplier of sales automation software based in San Diego, California. Again there are further revenue-based payments to a maximum of Dollars 7m. RCI has some 250,000 customers, including Sage, for its Dollars 695 'TeleMagic' package. Mr Goldman said there was good synergy between TeleMagic and Sage's accounting packages. Other software suppliers were also writing packages to run with TeleMagic. The market for sales automation software was set to rise from Dollars 166m in 1992 to Dollars 2.5bn in 1997, according to market intelligence surveys, he added.</p>

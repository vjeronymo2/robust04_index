			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Profits rise by 14% at GEC Alsthom GEC-ALSTHOM, the Anglo-French power company, saw net profits increase by 14 per cent from FFr1.71bn (Dollars 340m) to FFr1.95bn for the year ended March 31. The power group, formed three years ago as a joint venture between the UK's GEC and Alcatel-Alsthom of France, increased operating profits by 20 per cent to FFr3.35bn on sales 8 per cent up at FFr52bn. GEC-Alsthom has emerged as an aggressive player in the European power generating equipment market due to a forceful strategy of developing a broad product range and exploiting the licensing agreement that European Gas Turbines (EGT), its French subsidiary, has with General Electric of the US. The US group has a 10 per cent stake in EGT, with the rest belonging to GEC-Alsthom. One market where GEC-Alsthom has gained ground against its chief competitors, Siemens and Asea Brown Boveri, is combine-cycle gas turbine power stations, the fastest-growing sector of the thermal power generation market. The Anglo-French company has this year won a number of contracts in this sector including the main one for PowerGen's new station at Connah's Quay in North Wales. EGT yesterday announced it had won a FFr1.2bn export order to supply eight gas turbine generators to Iran Power Generation and Transmission (TAVANIR). EGT has also won smaller export orders for Europe and Latin America worth a total of FFr500m. Its counterpart in the UK reported its first orders for typhoon gas turbines for off-shore platforms in the North Sea and Australia. The EGT orders in France and the UK contribute to a total of FFr2.5bn of new export orders for the GEC-Alsthom group. GEC-Alsthom said that it received orders worth FFr53.3bn in the 1991-92 financial year.</p>

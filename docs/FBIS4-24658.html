			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Jian (0491 0256) of the Enterprise </F> Supervisory Office of the Beijing Municipal Industrial and  Commercial Bureau: "Tricks by Foreign Side in Joint Ventures To  Transfer China's Domestic Capital"]    [Text] After business registration, some foreign investors  in joint ventures resort to many tricks to devour China's  domestic capital during the initial period of the joint  venture's operations, the profit-making period, and the  winding-up period by taking advantage of the incompleteness of  some policies, loopholes in departmental convergence, a lack of  information on the world market, and their eagerness to seek  foreign capital. They mainly employ the following tricks:    They use deceptive methods to raise the price of equipment  when submitting quotations. Under the pretext of "joint  purchase and each having a share of the stock," they ask the  Chinese side in the joint venture to remit foreign exchange to  overseas bank accounts. Not knowing about their foul play, the  Chinese side is cheated into remitting foreign exchange out of  the country.    They use intangible assets for investment and raise prices  by  introducing a no-price reference system and taking advantage of  the Chinese side's difficulty in carrying out accurate  appraisals, thus holding the stock of the joint venture and  sharing its profits.    By investing technology and equipment, they control the  supply of materials needed for production and the right to  purchase outside the country. They devour the Chinese side's  foreign exchange outside the country by submitting high price  quotations. Taking advantage of the Chinese side's eagerness  for "more foreign exchange," they monopolize overseas sales  channels and rights and cut off the link between Chinese  enterprises and the international market. They lower the export  price of commodities and raise the selling price of these  commodities in foreign countries to make exorbitant profits  abroad.    They establish enterprise "groups" with "key enterprises"  (enterprises with 50 percent or more of the stock in the  possession of the foreign side) as their core and turn other  enterprises in these "groups" into processing factories of the  "key enterprises," thus controlling domestic sales of products  manufactured by other enterprises. These "key enterprises"  purchase other enterprises' products at low prices and thus make  exorbitant profits through domestic commercial channels.    Not long after investing, they withdraw their investment  capital under false pretexts and allow production to continue  with the Chinese side's capital or domestic bank loans. They  participate in profit sharing by illegally obtaining  qualifications.    By taking advantage of policy differences between regions,  they transfer their income to other tax-rate regions (usually  low-tax regions) by irregular financial means, thus creating a  false loss-making situation.    They transfer cost expenses from an enterprise where they  hold a high percentage of the stock to an enterprise where they  hold a low percentage of the stocks or else they shelve the  expenses to form a large "expense pending apportionment." In  enterprises where they hold a low percentage of the stock, they  shift the burden to the Chinese side.    They make one investment and then repeatedly spirit it away  to form capital with multiple registration. In this way they  get profits from various aspects by illegally obtaining  qualifications.    They rent out or sell duty-free goods and equipment to  others  to receive exorbitant profits.    They illegally engage in business operations which are  prohibited by the state. By deceptive means, they cheat a large  amount of capital out the Chinese side and deposit it into their  accounts to obtain interest. They mix this interest with their  business profits and remit it out of the country.    When a joint-venture enterprise winds up due for certain  reasons but has a surplus at liquidation, the foreign side will  use diluted stock to participate in the distribution of the  remaining assets.    These tricks can be summed up in four types: Submitting high  price quotations, occupying diluted stocks, taking advantage of  price differences, and false accounting. Each trick manifests  itself in the different development periods of joint-venture  enterprises. These tricks by law-breaking foreign investors  have caused losses of state assets, as well as the results of  introducing foreign capital. Effective measures must be taken  to stop them.</p>

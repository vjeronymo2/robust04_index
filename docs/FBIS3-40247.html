			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Drazena Peranic: "Alija's Former Men"] </F>   [Text] Just one newspaper in Bosnia-Herzegovina has  recently issued a short news item that in Sarajevo Rusmir  Mahmutcehajic, the minister for special purpose production, has  been released from duty. If by any chance something like this  had been happened a year ago, it would have hit the headlines of  many newspapers with obvious surprise: Why is Alija Izetbegovic  discharging his top man? However, just as Izetbegovic's policy  has both formally and officially moved from the declarative  striving for a civic state to striving for his own national  state, so the ranks of his most prominent men have been  diminishing and changing.    Following the prewar departure of the show-biz darling  Muhamed Cengic, vice chairman of the Party of Democratic Action  [SDA], one after another of those people have disappeared from  the political stage: Irfan Ajanovic, SDA secretary and the  party's first man in the former federation [of Yugoslavia] and  the republican assembly; Omer Behmen, the grey eminence of the  SDA and Izetbegovic's colleague from prison (both of them were  members of the Young Muslims organization long before the war);  Jusuf Prazina, the petty criminal who became a myth and hero of  the Bosnian Army overnight; Armin Pohara, Izetbegovic's closest  confident, and his personal envoy in the mission to do away with  civic Tuzla; Sefer Halilovic, the face on the fighters'  T-shirts, the so-called "seferovka" shirt, and formerly the  undisputed commander of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Hadzo  Efendic, reportedly the legend of the defense of Gorazde, and a  principal actor in the Bosnian Government for many months; and  finally, SDA ideologist Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, who left quite  silently, or so many people believe.  <H5>  From Singer to Tactician </H5>   Getting rid of Cengic probably came as a great relief for  Izetbegovic. In the broader public Cengic was a very popular  politician (until the war he was identified with the famous  Surrealists [a group of comedians] from Sarajevo), more and more  frequently assisting the opposition in its attacks on the  ineffective and nationally divided Government of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, whose vice-chairman was Cengic himself. A  large amount of money that this Foca entrepreneur collected from  local Muslims for the foundation and work of the SDA still kept  him in place as Izetbegovic's deputy until the beginning of the  war. Thereafter Izetbegovic sent him, reportedly with the  appropriate credentials (which later proved invalid), to  Istanbul, appointing him representative of Bosnia-Herzegovina in  that country. Today, on his way from Turkey to Slovenia, Cengic  is trying to get in touch with Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Izetbegovic, but Izetbegovic is no longer interested in that.  Ajanovic, the last [Bosnian] delegate in the Federal Assembly  and SDA representative in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  former folk singer, and later one of the most radical people in  the SDA, became the first legitimate tactician by order of the  president, using the bar of the Zagreb hotel Panorama as his  office for many months. Nevertheless, after Ajanovic's arrival  in Zagreb, various logistics centers started to mushroom  throughout Croatia, under the patronage of the powerful Zagreb  lobby (H. Cengic, Tankovic, Sabic), in which there was no place  for the SDA secretary, or rather there was no possibility for  war profiteering. Thereafter Ajanovic was seen to take part in  various panel discussions throughout Europe on the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, in which he fervently advocated a Muslim  Bosnia. Nonetheless, he decided to return to Bosnia, but he was  captured by Karadzic's men. And while part of the SDA was  calling him a captive in the Serbian prison in Banja Luka, the  Serbian media reported that Ajanovic had already been walking  the streets of Belgrade for months, and quite freely at that.    On one occasion Izetbegovic stated that he would sacrifice  the entire party for his former prison-mate Behman. All the  time Behman represented a truly grand character in the party,  having the halo of being the greatest martyr of the communist  system. Behmen's untouchability, which emanated from his most  severe treatment in communist penitentiaries, frequently, while  perhaps unjustifiably, also carried the burden of the strongest  national intolerance. Behmen became the pillar of the  nationalistic policy of the Muslim party. At the parliamentary  session on 14 March 1993, during the debate as to whether the  Vance-Owen plan should be signed, Behmen stated: "We are the  losers! We have to sign what has been offered to us. We have  no other choice. What we must do actually reflects the  situation on the front. The regions where we are stronger are  ours; those where we are weaker are not ours.... The proposal  is our fate, and it awaits us!"    Whether Behmen's words disturbed Izetbegovic, who was  attempting to win several percent more territory for the Islamic  Bosnia, both at the negotiating table and militarily, is still  unknown; nevertheless, after that Behmen was appointed Bosnian  ambassador to Iran. Today, Behmen is writing letters to  Sarajevo, begging to be recalled, because he has had hardly any  contact with either Bosnia-Herzegovina or anybody from  Bosnia-Herzegovina! At the time when Juka [Jusuf Prazina] was a  hero, the Sarajevo media, such as OSLOBODJENJE, were describing  him as a fearless hero of the time, while editors were boasting  about having the privilege of drinking coffee with Juka! Juka,  who had been a criminal before the war, acquired the reputation  of a Robin Hood, a protector of the poor, by stealing hundreds  of cars, and tons of oil and food, so that the humanitarian  donation of part of his fortune was no problem to him, while on  the other hand it drew the media's attention to his personality.  Encouraged by the media attention (authors were writing books  on him, musicians were composing songs about to him), Prazina  started to consider himself a genius, predestined to be the new  Bosnian leader. For that reason he soon fell into disfavor  among both the authorities and the media, so he left town, and  on Mount Igman played a local boss, arbitrarily stopping or  letting vehicles through from and into Sarajevo. He soon joined  the Croatian Defense Council, and for a certain time served Mate  Boban as an additional argument against Izetbegovic. After that  he fled first to Germany, then to the Netherlands, Austria, and  finally Belgium. Several days ago all the international press  carried the news that he had been killed in Liege!  <H5>  Leader of Mixed Marriages </H5>   Armin Pohara entered politics in 1990, before the first  multiparty elections, as the chairman of the tiny Party of Mixed  Marriages from Bosanski Brod, with "brotherhood and unity" [a  slogan from Titoist times] being as main platform, committed to  the federation of former Yugoslavia. His party stood body and  soul behind [former Yugoslav prime minister] Ante Markovic's  movement of reformists, while Pohara even reproached the former  prime minister for insufficient support for the unity of  Yugoslavia. In the first days of the war he was actively  involved in defense, wearing a uniform of the Defense Command of  Bosanski Brod, which soon silently surrendered to Karadzic's  army without a fight. The sudden recollection of his Muslim  origins made the leader of Mixed Marriages offer his services to  Izetbegovic, who promoted Pohara to coordinator of the Armed  Forces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and his special envoy in the  operation "Eliminating Red Tuzla." Since the citizens soon  banished the envoy from Tuzla, and in the meantime the  Croat-Muslim conflict had broken out, this political chameleon  ran away to seek protection under Boban's wing, looking for his  chance in the politics of a Croat-Muslim Party. Today, this  anonymous pre- war journalist is finally accomplishing his dream  -- he is the chairman of a party, editor in chief of an  independent newspaper, ZAPADNA BOSNA [WEST BOSNIA], writing  editorials and aspiring to be a new Geneva negotiator.    A captain in the former Yugoslav People's Army, Sefer  Halilovic entered the Bosnian political stage quite grandly,  obsessed with his mission to defend the integral  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Originally from Sandzak, the captain  rejected the introduction of ranks in the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, justifying that with the slogan "we shall  all prove ourselves in fighting," which provoked a reaction  among the more experienced and qualified army officers. Given  the needed media attention, Halilovic more frequently behaved  like a politician than as a soldier, and thus soon raised the  question in the foreign media as to who the real authority in  Bosnia-Herzegovina was -- Izetbegovic or Halilovic. The  abandonment of the idea of an integral Bosnia-Herzegovina, as  well as the negotiations for additional percentages of the  territory for the so-called Bosnian state, forced Izetbegovic to  suspend Halilovic and replace him with Rasim Delic, who is a  professional soldier and quite disinclined toward politics. At  the beginning the official explanation was that the shift  reflected Halilovic's reappointment to some other post, rather  than suspension, but now the information is much more exact --  Halilovic is under house arrest.   <H5>    Loyal Personnel </H5>   Hadzo Efendic is a man of rather moderate intellectual  abilities, but for that reason extremely loyal to Izetbegovic,  whom the SDA, while the discredited leaders were in charge,  suddenly launched as a promising new party man. The SDA created  a new image for Efendic as the man who defended Gorazde.  However, this Muslim enclave in eastern Bosnia, having been  declared a UN protection zone, is today a synonym for the  suffering of Bosnian Muslims. Having been appointed deputy  prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the absence of [prime  minister] Mile Akmadzic, Efendic was considered to be the  government's strongest man, although his utmost level of action  is the repetition of hackneyed phrases about the Bosnian  peoples' unity, so long as Izetbegovic supports the concept of  integral Bosnia under his authority. Today, when a miniature  Muslim state is being publicly advocated, Efendic has been  removed from Sarajevo, and following the proven method, sent to  Vienna.    The latest silent removal of one of the leading SDA people,  Rusmir Mahmutcehajic, is still the most indicative example of  Izetbegovic's policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In the times of  peace, when Izetbegovic did not even think about publicly  advocating his Muslim state, Mahmutcehajic was considered to be  a radical nationalist in SDA. Today, when Izetbegovic is  finalizing his Islamic political options, Mahmutcehajic is a  persona non grata for such a job. His removal proves that  Izetbegovic's goal -- a Muslim Bosnia -- has long outgrown  Mahmutcehajic's nationalism. These days the former SDA  ideologist is in a way protected by the intellectuals of  Sarajevo, because in comparison with others, his politics are  regarded as quite moderate.    The struggle for as close a position to Izetbegovic as  possible is now going on between Ejup Ganic and Haris Silajdzic.  In the last couple of months Silajdzic has won a considerable  advantage over Ganic, and he is more and more frequently seen in  Izetbegovic's company during state visits of increasing  importance. Nevertheless, Ganic, as a constant political  claimant to a more important position in the administration,  will hardly allow Silajdzic to get too far ahead. Be it as it  may, the struggle of various of Izetbegovic's aides for the  second most powerful position in the administration again  confirms the same thing: Izetbegovic's undisputed dominance on  the throne of the Bosnian Islam.</p>

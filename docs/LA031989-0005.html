			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOO QUICK FOR KREMLINOLOGY;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV'S RUSSIA BY BASILE KERBLAY TRANSLATED BY RUPERT SWYER (PANTHEON  BOOKS: $9.95,PAPER; 175 PP.)  </P> <P> Change in Gorbachev's Soviet Union has come so rapidly and openly that one can  only sympathize with the efforts of professional Sovietologists to write books  that keep pace with events and also say something more interesting than that  which is available in the mass media. These fellows used to have an easy time  of it during the old stagnant pre-Gorbachev days when change came sluggishly  and information was tightly guarded. Then, their tea-leaf reading seemed an  indispensable exercise. Now, it may be simply beside the point.  </P> <P> This book is an effort to jump on the express of Soviet reform, describe the  obstacles and predict the ultimate destination, all without pausing for the  author to catch his breath. The galleys sent out for review were finished in  June of last year and what with translation and other delays will reach stores  almost a year later.  </P> <P> Much has happened in the interval to make this brief and hastily thrown  together book seem dated. For example, the power of Yegor Ligachev, described  in this book as almost an equal in power to Gorbachev, has declined  considerably in the last year. By concentrating on breaking events rather than  on the sources of change, the author has guaranteed his book a short shelf  life.  </P> <P> The result is not so much a book as a it is a collection of notes for a book.  Important notes, by an important author, but sketchy and therefore unsatisfying  nonetheless.  </P> <P> Most interesting is the assertion by Kerblay, a distinguished Sorbonne  professor, that his fellow Kremlinologists, in evaluating Gorbachev's reforms,  tend to get it exactly wrong. They ignore the complexity and energy of the mass  social base of Soviet society and its impact on events. Kerblay chides that  "Sovietologists generally focus on the political regime or the workings of the  economy . . . for the well-bred scholar holds that society has no leverage on  so rigid a system."  </P> <P> He stresses instead the obvious, often missed by the experts, that Gorbachev's  policies have already profoundly altered the mores of the society on a  grass-roots level and that uncontrollable and unexpected responses are now  possible.  </P> <P> Which means that the reform drive no longer fully depends on Gorbachev's  survival. The genie of freedom, Kerblay seems to argue, is now out of the  bottle "making a reversion to the status quo ante highly unlikely."  </P> <P> One consequence "is the emergence of public opinion, which is visible in the  eagerness with which people devour newspapers and follow TV discussions, and  even more so in the influence that certain movements are coming to exert in  sensitive areas such as ecology, the preservation of the national heritage, and  the building of nuclear power stations, to the point where they are starting to  affect decisions." As proof of his point only last week four Soviet Asian port  city governments, on their own authority, refused to allow a nuclear-propelled  container ship to dock. This was an action of municipal independence not likely  to be tolerated in any Western democracy.  </P> <P> The other basic shift in grass-roots thinking derives from the massive  condemnation of Stalin that has provoked a far more serious debate on "the  problem of morality in public life." Meaning that everything that is important  is up for grabs.  </P> <P> Having established all that, the author inexplicably plunges into a lengthy  dirge on the ills of Soviet society from alcoholism to the inefficiency of  agriculture. None of this seems fresh or revealing compared to a typical  Gorbachev speech.  </P> <P> There is also a lot of other stuff that we know or could easily pick up  elsewhere: long lists of names, citation of past scandals, and familiar  biographical detail without point, like Gorbachev's place of birth, education  and route of ascension to power. It reads like filler intended to pad an  already too-thin effort.  </P> <P> To make this padding seem portentous, there is the inevitable lapse into  know-it-all Kremlinology. For example, the assertion that Gorbachev's  "originality lies less in his ideas, which he borrows frequently from his  advisers, than in his courage . . . ." Sounds plausible enough, but how does  the author know this? He doesn't. This sort of statement, authoritative but  undocumented, just lies there in the text every five pages or so as if ordered  up by a cynical editor to hold the reader's respect.  </P> <P> Even more offensive is the headlining of the obvious as if it were fresh. A  chapter on "The Broad Outlines of Gorbachev's Policies," begins with the news  that "Gorbachev's chief foreign-policy aims are to resume dialogue with the  United States in order to achieve nuclear arms cuts . . . ." Hot stuff, no?  </P> <P> But tailing the flood of daily news accounts from the Soviet Union is the least  of this book's problems. More serious is the tendency of its summary thoughts  to have been called into question by the fast pace of events.  </P> <P> For example, in a discussion on the limits of glasnost, the statement that  "there never has been any discussion of Soviet foreign policy" in the media was  disproved in the aftermath of Afghanistan. Or the flat assertion that "the  Party has no intention of relinquishing either its ideological monopoly or its  control over all aspects of social life," which, this season, is no longer so  obvious.  </P> <P> Even the solid passages often tell us what we already know. There is a good  discussion of the problems inherent in restructuring the Soviet economy, but it  relies heavily on already published and widely noticed works by Soviet  economists, led by Abel Aganbegyan. One does not need a Kremlinologist  interlocutor, as in the old days, to get Aganbegyan's story. The writings of  this top Gorbachev adviser, who is a frequent American television guest, were  not smuggled out of his homeland. The man himself is signing them out there in  the mall.  </P> <P> That is the problem with this thin work. There was a time when a hurried look  into the Kremlinologists' crystal ball could provide the illusion of insight.  We were at the mercy of Soviet experts who had access to secret data or who  were particularly skilled at inferring far too much from a single snapshot of  the leadership at the Kremlin wall. A book like this one with its dull listing  of names and events distilled from endless hours of perusing purloined  documents and reading between the lines of party documents and Pravda accounts  might have been worth the effort then. But now the latest Gorbachev or Sakharov  speech or indeed the latest report in The Times will tell us far more.  </P></p>

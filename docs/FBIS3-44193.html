			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Johannesburg Jan 26 SAPA -- The Mineworkers Union  [MWU] has recommitted itself to remaining a whites-only union,  saying it believes white trade unionism is at the threshold of a  huge revival. In a resolution passed at the end of the MWU's  annual congress in Johannesburg on Wednesday, the union said it  expected an increase in membership in reaction to affirmative  action which would benefit blacks.    White miners would in future seek the protection of a white  trade union as they would be unable to voice their aspirations  through political channels. The congress regretted the  break-down in talks between the Freedom Alliance, the government  and the African National Congress, saying a golden opportunity  for a permanent and peaceful political solution had been lost.</p>

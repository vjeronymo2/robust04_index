			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Gloom on jobs in Gloucestershire Gloucestershire has suffered the sharpest fall in overall employment in Britain, a report on the county's economy by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, shows. It said the recession and cuts in the defence industry, on which the county relies, meant unemployment nearly tripled between 1990 and 1993. Industries which have grown rapidly in the 1980s, such as financial services, have stalled.</p>

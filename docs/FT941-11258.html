			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Cariplo chairman stands down while under investigation Mr Roberto Mazzotta has temporarily stepped down from the chairmanship of Cariplo, Italy's largest savings bank, following the issue of an arrest warrant by Milan magistrates on Monday on charges of alleged corruption. Arrest warrants were also issued for three other bank officials including Mr Carlo Polli, the deputy chairman, on similar charges relating to phoney property transactions by Milan-based Cariplo's rich pension fund. According to Milan magistrates the transactions carried out between 1985 and 1992 involved more than L5bn (Pounds 2m). Part of this was channelled illicitly to the Christian Democrats and Socialists, who exercised the main political influence over Cariplo. The magistrates are understood to be investigating some 50 property transactions. Cariplo, which hasthe largest deposit base of any financial institution in Italy, has assured clients that its financial operations are not affected and that the investigations affect its independently operated pension fund. Mr Mazzotta, a former Christian Democrat minister, is still believed to be abroad and his temporary resignation was conveyed to the board on Thursday. This move is in line with Bank ofItaly directives issued last year requiring executives to step aside pending judicial enquiries. Mr Mazzotta was appointed chairman in 1987 by the thenChristian Democrat-dominated government against the opposition of the Bank of Italy. It is not clear whether the board or the government nominates a successor. As it is a Milan bank, the populist Northern League of Mr Umberto Bossi is anxious to have a representative on the board. Mr Bossi yesterday said he was willing to make an electoral alliance with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, if the latter had no links with 'southern fascism'. This condition underlined the fact that the central obstacle to a deal between the League and Mr Berlusconi's nascent Forza Italia (Come On Italy]) movement is Mr Berlusconi'scontacts with the neo-fascist National Alliance. Mr Bossi was speaking at the opening of the League's three-day congress in Bologna. The uneasy marriage between industrial Mestre and historic Venice will be put to the test for the third time since 1979 in a referendum on Sunday. Those favouring continued unification of the two communities have a narrow lead of 51 per cent in the opinion polls.</p>

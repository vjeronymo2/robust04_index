			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Howard rejects calls to resign over jail break-out Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, yesterday rejected Labour demands for his resignation after he released a report into a break-out by five terrorists and an armed robber from Whitemoor prison in Cambridgeshire. The report by Sir John Woodcock, former chief inspector of constabulary, blamed the escape on management confusion that allowed 'pampered' inmates to take advantage of lax security. He said: 'So many things were wrong, so many procedures and policies totally ignored, and with such regularity, that the escape could have taken place on any day of any week with the same chance of success.' Mr Howard told the Commons that the break-out, and the subsequent discovery of a pound of Semtex explosive at Whitemoor, happened because the prison service failed to follow written instructions. He said a separate report drawn up before the break-out by Judge Stephen Tumin, the inspector of prisons, concurred in the general view in the prison service that Whitemoor was 'virtually impregnable'. Mr Howard announced a further inquiry by Sir David Yardley, the former local government ombudsman, into whether there was sufficient evidence to bring disciplinary charges against members of the prison service. A separate inquiry by Sir John Learmont, the former quartermaster general for the army, will review security in all prisons, including the possible introduction of glass screens to prevent contact between inmates and visitors. Mr Howard said security had been tightened at Whitemoor and prisoners' perks, such as use of telephones, excessive personal property and sending warders to do their shopping, had been stopped. He added that Mr Derek Lewis, director-general of the prison service, had agreed 'there will be no question of a bonus' this year. Mr Lewis was paid a bonus of Pounds 35,000 for the year to March. The Whitemoor escapers, armed with two pistols smuggled into the prison, escaped by cutting fencing and climbing another fence with rope made in the prison workshop.</p>

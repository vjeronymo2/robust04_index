			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> A BUMPY RIDE, BUT A SMOOTH LANDING;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USIU'S KEVIN BRADSHAW, THE NATION'S NO. 3 SCORER, HAS  SETTLED IN AFTER REDISCOVERING HIS DESIRE TO COMPETE.  </P> <P> Kevin Bradshaw was a high school basketball star in Florida. He is now U.S.  International's leading scorer, No. 3 in the nation.  </P> <P> But Bradshaw did not make the transition easily. The way was littered with  decisions, both good and bad:  </P> <P>  -- He accepted a basketball scholarship to a small Florida college.  </P> <P>  -- He married his pregnant girlfriend.  </P> <P>  -- He dropped out of college and joined the Navy.  </P> <P>  -- His daughter was born.  </P> <P>  -- He was divorced.  </P> <P> Through it all, Bradshaw has plugged away, trying to do the right thing.  </P> <P> It was a stuffy summer day in Florida. Kevin Bradshaw, fresh on leave from the  Navy, drove the 10 miles to where his ex-wife lived, outside of Gainesville.  </P> <P> It's a moment that has stayed with him. He remembers the creak of the car door  as he stepped onto the driveway. The aroma that wafted from inside the house.  </P> <P> And he remembers his first look at his daughter, Jiana Cherall, who was now  nearly a year old.  </P> <P> "That first time was the most painful," Bradshaw said. "I didn't want to get  upset. I would have said things that wouldn't have helped, but I would have  said them anyway."  </P> <P> Bradshaw had had a year to ponder it. It had been that long since he left his  basketball scholarship at Bethune-Cookman in Daytona Beach to marry his  pregnant girlfriend and join the Navy to support his new family.  </P> <P> In the interim, his wife had decided she didn't want to come to San Diego,  where Bradshaw was stationed, leading to their divorce. And his child had been  born.  </P> <P> So much had happened, so quickly.  </P> <P> Bradshaw was Florida high school player of the year his senior season at  Buchholz High in Gainesville. He averaged a school-record 30.2 points per game.  He still holds school career records for points (1,693) and rebounds (584) and  season records for points (946), field goals in a game (19) and shooting  percentage in a game (90.4, 19 of 21).  </P> <P> But then came the ill-fated decision to attend Bethune-Cookman. A child and a  quick marriage.  </P> <P> Basketball, which had been his trademark, was set aside.  </P> <P> Now, he's trying again. He left the Navy last year and is playing his junior  year at U.S. International. The three years away haven't had any apparent  negative effects: Bradshaw's 31-point average for the 9-13 Gulls is third best  in the country.  </P> <P> He has also adapted to the academic life, finishing his first semester with a  2.9 grade point average in physical education. Bradshaw decided during his Navy  hitch that he wanted to make it back to school. And if basketball was what got  him there, it didn't matter.  </P> <P> "For once, I was working, and when you're working, you realize how important a  degree is," Bradshaw said.  </P> <P> USIU was the first school to show an interest in him. After meeting with Coach  Gary Zarecky, Bradshaw decided USIU was the place for him, too, and he put his  name on a letter of intent during the early signing period.  </P> <P> "We hit it off," Bradshaw said. "(Zarecky) was straightforward. It's amazing  what happens when you're surrounded by good people."  </P> <P> And so Bradshaw continues his uneven odyssey.  </P> <P> It is difficult enough to earn a basketball scholarship out of high school,  considering the thousands of kids who may have the talent but never make it to  college. But it's harder still to make it, drop out and return.  </P> <P> Bradshaw, who will turn 24 Monday, is attacking the basket and the classroom  with a maturity gained through his experience. He kept his game sharp by  playing on the All-Navy team and was named All-Armed Forces last year, joining  future NBA player David Robinson. He is well on his way to setting several  school records, including scoring and free throw shooting. He is one of the  best in the country at the line, making 173 of 202 (.856).  </P> <P> Basketball was the furthest thing from Bradshaw's mind when he joined the Navy  in 1986. After joining, he left it completely for more than a year.  </P> <P> "I didn't play anymore," Bradshaw said. "I stayed away for a year. I thought  '20 years, I'll get my retirement, get fat and have kids.' "  </P> <P> But Earl McKinney, who was stationed with Bradshaw aboard the U.S.S. McKee in  San Diego, slowly got Bradshaw back into the game.  </P> <P> "He never knew I was a star in high school," Bradshaw said. "He said 'You don't  look like you can play.' "  </P> <P> When Bradshaw finally relented, they headed over to the 32nd Street Gym.  Bradshaw handled the ball, pounding it to the floor and feeling it snap back in  his palm. And then he took his first shot in nearly a year.  </P> <P> "I missed," Bradshaw said. "It was a brick."  </P> <P> He missed the basket but rediscovered the urge to play. Once again, basketball  was to become an important part of Kevin Bradshaw's life.  </P> <P> Bradshaw developed his game in elementary school like most do, on local courts  against neighborhood kids.  </P> <P> One was Vernon Maxwell, with whom Bradshaw would develop a close relationship  when both went on to star at Buchholz.  </P> <P> Maxwell, a year older, went on to play with the University of Florida and the  NBA's San Antonio Spurs.  </P> <P> Bradshaw was recruited by Florida, Florida State, Auburn and Georgia, but he  shied away.  </P> <P> "I didn't like the atmosphere of the big schools," Bradshaw said. "I went to a  class, and it was an auditorium with students."  </P> <P> A lot of people figured Bradshaw was a shoo-in to attend Florida, in his  hometown.  </P> <P> "Gainesville is small," Bradshaw said. "It has just three high schools. The  University of Florida is Gainesville. I don't know what was said behind closed  doors . . . everyone thought I was going to Florida."  </P> <P> When other schools backed off, it became apparent to Bradshaw that if he was  going to go big-time, it would be at Florida. But he says he had seen and heard  too many negative things about Coach Norm Sloan's program.  </P> <P> "Deep down inside, I still don't think I should have gone to Florida," Bradshaw  said. "I haven't seen any black athletes come out of Florida saying they were  happy there. Or who graduated.  </P> <P> "I heard a lot of bad things, but people will talk. But it's another thing to  see the players not happy and they're stuck."  </P> <P> Bradshaw decided instead on Bethune-Cookman, a small Division I school where  his freshman-sophomore high school coach was an assistant. It didn't take long  to realize he had made a mistake.  </P> <P> "It was just awful," Bradshaw said. "They just weren't big on basketball. It  was just one way to get money into the program. I wasn't happy from day one.  But I thought I should try and stick out, give it my best."  </P> <P> Bradshaw played there for two years and was named All-Mid-East Athletic  Conference after averaging 19 points and 5.4 rebounds his sophomore year. But  it wasn't working out.  </P> <P> "One thing or another," Bradshaw said. "Slowly, I started to fade away."  </P> <P> What hurt perhaps most was that Bradshaw, once known throughout Gainesville,  was slipping into obscurity.  </P> <P> "I'd be hanging with Vernon, and people would ask me what I was doing, where I  was playing," Bradshaw said. "I mean, I was only an hour and half away."  </P> <P> The pressure began to mount as his grades slipped. He knew Bethune-Cookman was  not for him, but he wasn't sure what to do about it.  </P> <P> Then he found out that his girlfriend was pregnant.  </P> <P> Bradshaw left school and went home to try and figure things out. After talking  to his parents, Bradshaw decided the right thing to do was get married and join  the service so he could support a family.  </P> <P> He chose the Navy because he didn't have a car and went to the recruiting  office closest to home.  </P> <P> "It was strange," Bradshaw said. "Whenever I thought of the service, I thought  of the Army, Air Force or Marines. . . . The Navy recruiting office was in a  mall about a half-mile from my parent's home."  </P> <P> Bradshaw got married the day before he was to leave for basic training in San  Diego. The plan was for his wife to join him a few weeks later. She never  arrived.  </P> <P> "Other people had a big say in what happened," Bradshaw said. "I just felt I  should be with my wife.  </P> <P> "It upset me because she knew why I joined the Navy. I thought it was the right  thing to do."  </P> <P> Bradshaw joined the Navy in March of 1986, and was divorced and a father by  August. Now he had to adjust both to the service and life without the reason he  had joined in the first place.  </P> <P> All Bradshaw wanted to do was forget about what had happened . . . and forget  about basketball.  </P> <P> "I was hurt," Bradshaw said. "I'd pretty much thrown basketball to the side. I  just wanted to concentrate on the Navy. It was hard at first. Coming from  school and going into the Navy. It was like party time in school, (compared to  the Navy) where somebody was telling you what to do, when to do it and how to  do it."  </P> <P> Bradshaw slowly adjusted. He now says joining up was the best decision he ever  made.  </P> <P> "I was always taught to try to do everything that is right and do what I  believe in," Bradshaw said. "If you're not happy, you don't do the right  things. I think if I hadn't joined the Navy, I'd be somewhere doing bad  things."  </P> <P> Kevin Bradshaw's life is improving, but he's still feeling the effects of that  day outside Gainesville.  </P> <P> It was more than a year before Bradshaw got his first leave. He went to his  parents, then drove to his ex-wife's parents' house to see his Jiana Cherall.  It was an unannounced visit.  </P> <P> "Opening the car door, walking up the steps, it was like everything was in slow  motion," Bradshaw said.  </P> <P> There's a big difference between knowing you're a father and feeling what it is  like to be one. Bradshaw says he wasn't entirely ready for the experience.  </P> <P> He picked up his daughter. And did not want to let go.  </P> <P> "Having my kid taken away," Bradshaw said. "I was thinking, 'This is my first  kid and now I am going to have to leave her.' (My ex-wife) was under the  impression I was just going to show up, look at the kid and take off."  </P> <P> Bradshaw soon started court proceedings to get partial custody. It was decided  that the child should be exposed to both sides of the family, and she now  spends every other weekend with Bradshaw's parents.  </P> <P> He talks to his daughter on the phone often and visits her during the summer.  But Bradshaw avoids the old hangouts when he's home.  </P> <P> For all he knows, a few people in Gainesville might still be wondering whatever  happened to Kevin Bradshaw. By now, they might not even recognize his name  among the nation's scoring leaders.  </P> <P> "Personally, I'd like them to know," Bradshaw said. "A lot of people gave up on  me."  </P></p>

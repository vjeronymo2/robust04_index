			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / German rates cut to five-year low: Bundesbank's half-point reduction improves prospects for European recovery The German Bundesbank cut its leading interest rates by half a percentage point yesterday to the lowest levels for five years, improving prospects for European economic recovery. The Bundesbank reduced its key discount rate to 4.5 per cent, the lowest since June 1989. Six other European central banks also eased interest rates. The Lombard rate, which sets a ceiling for German money market rates, was cut to 6 per cent. The Bundesbank said the move, accelerating the pace of German interest rate cuts, was justified by the domestic outlook for inflation, now down to 3.1 per cent in west Germany. Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, welcomed the cuts and said they would strengthen Germany's economic recovery. In an explanation marking a shift in its traditional response to the fast-expanding money supply, the Bundesbank said the cut would help reduce monetary growth by encouraging investors to move funds away from bank deposits into bonds. On the foreign exchanges, the Bundesbank's move failed to strengthen the dollar. The US currency rose to a high for the day of DM1.6820 after the rate cut, but then slid by nearly a pfennig to close in London at DM1.6735. In New York the dollar fell to DM1.66825. Analysts said this showed the dollar would not rise without a tightening of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve, generally expected to be imminent. In Europe, the D-Mark finished firmer against the French franc, closing at FFr3.430 from FFr3.424. On European bond markets, the cuts triggered initial rallies but overall gains on the day were held in check as traders and investors took profits. Among other countries that eased credit yesterday, central banks in Italy, Denmark and Austria cut their discount rates to 7 per cent from 7.5 per cent, to 5 per cent from 5.25 per cent and to 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent respectively. The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate to 5.1 per cent from 5.3 per cent. Belgium cut the central rate to 5.35 per cent from 5.45 per cent. The Bank of France cut its intervention rate to 5.5 per cent from 5.6 per cent before the Bundesbank council met yesterday. The Bundesbank cuts took many economists by surprise. Broad money supply, or M3, grew at a revised annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of 15.4 per cent in March, well above its 1994 target of 4 to 6 per cent, although the expansion has slowed from the 20 per cent-plus rate earlier this year. German economists said, however, that the reductions were understandable in the light of recent dollar weakness. 'The Bundesbank has taken advantage of an ideal constellation of circumstances,' said Mr Martin Hufner, chief economist at the Bayerische Vereinsbank. Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the International Bank of Japan in Frankfurt, said the monetary easing was consistent with last week's Bundesbank's intervention to support the dollar. The Bundesbank believes this year's money supply figures have been distorted by special factors. Some economists, however, questioned the logic of the Bundesbank's argument that reducing short-term rates would damp money supply growth by encouraging depositors to move money into long-term funds.

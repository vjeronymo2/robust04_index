			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Risks in Sino-US Tension"] </F>   [Text] Australia is right to oppose the tactics being used  by the United States to wrest human rights concessions from  China. The objectives of Canberra and Washington are the same  -- to persuade Beijing of the intrinsic merits in political as  well as economic liberalisation. Both nations have criticised  China for its recent crackdown on dissidents. However, while  Australian policy is to treat human rights separately, the US  risks boxing itself into a corner by making these issues an  integral part of trade and foreign policy.    Australia does not have the economic clout of the US and our  interests as a member of the Asia-Pacific community are not  always in harmony with those of the US. Our approach on human  rights, set during last year's visit to China by the Prime  Minister, Mr Keating, is a quieter one. Yet it has resulted in  two parliamentary delegations being invited to study conditions  in China. These have provided a foundation for informed and  patient lobbying in Beijing.    The US approach is founded on President Clinton's readoption  of "linkage" -- tying progress on human rights to the rest of US  policy. Hence the threat to withdraw China's  most-favoured-nation [MFN] trading privileges. Such a move  would severely damage China's economy. The US takes about 30  per cent of China's exports and the raising of tariff barriers  would have a punishing effect on the remarkable economic  expansion led by southern China.    But there would also be collateral damage to Hong Kong (the  conduit for Sino-US trade) and Taiwan (which has invested  heavily on the mainland). The stakes are also high for the US.  While trade sanctions might pressure China into a positive  response, this would be inconsistent with past responses by  Beijing's leadership. It is more likely the present tension  will further cool relations between China and the US and harm  the latter's own interests in the region.    The US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, drew a  predictable response with his forceful remarks in Canberra on  Tuesday [8 March]. Angered by China's arrest and detention of  several dissidents over recent days, he said: "These actions  will have a negative effect on my trip as well as on the subject  under review" -- that is, MFN. Beijing's response was to make  more arrests while saying it would not tolerate external  pressure over human rights, even if it meant losing preferential  trade arrangements. It is difficult to see how Mr Christopher's  visit to Beijing over the next few days can lead to productive  results in such a hostile climate.    The US posture on human rights reflects the best aspects of  the American ethos. However, there are problems in linking it  to foreign policy. Former president Mr Ronald Reagan's  secretary of State, Mr George Schultz, was a critic of linkage,  and for good reason. He showed the US could, without fuss or  fanfare, achieve real results where noisy criticism had failed  -- especially in cajoling the former Soviet Union to ease  restrictions on Jewish emigration. But President Clinton's more  aggressive and overt approach arouses concern about the  direction of US foreign policy, especially in this region.    The Clinton policy has been driven by the US Congress. It  was congressional outrage over the violent suppression of  political dissent in Tiananmen Square and Dili that led to MFN  reviews for China and Indonesia. (Jakarta reacted more  favourably to US trade pressure than has Beijing because it was  in line with Indonesia's trend towards gradual political  liberalisation.) Congressional demands for faster growth in US  employment were also behind the President's ill-considered  decision to pick a fight with Japan over trade access. The US  should be in no doubt that these issues are all capable of  causing unintended but real harm to Australia's interests.</p>

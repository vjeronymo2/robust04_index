			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Ryan Hotels falls into red A SURGE in interest charges and exceptional costs left Ryan Hotels with a pre-tax deficit of IPounds 186,163 (Pounds 196,457) for the 12 months to October. That compared with a profit of IPounds 975,085 last time and came from turnover up by IPounds 1.65m to IPounds 21m. Losses per share were 0.59p (earnings 1.11p), or 0.42p (earnings 1.48p) on a nil basis. Mr Conor McCarthy, chairman, said additional borrowings to fund capital expenditure had led to an increase in interest payable from IPounds 1.72m to IPounds 2.57m. A rise in exceptional costs, from IPounds 82,000 to IPounds 415,462, was the result of a series of cost-cutting programmes, he added. Mr McCarthy also announced that, to achieve a more equal distribution of the trading results for the two halves of the year, the Dublin-based group was changing to a January year end. To achieve this change, Ryan Hotels would be reporting on a 15-month period from November 1991 to January 1993. At this stage the question of a final dividend would be considered, the chairman said. A final of 0.5p was paid last time.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Caracas, 29 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- The Venezuelan  Central Bank suspended the sale of foreign exchange for six days  in order to adopt new measures to halt profiteering after the  imposition of exchange and price controls on Monday.    Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera on Monday ordered the  partial suspension of individual rights and the imposition of  exchange controls as part of a strategy to reverse the decline  of the economy and overcome the financial crisis. Announcing  the drastic measures over radio and television, the president  explained that they were necessary because the seriousness of  the economic crisis produces "insecurity and distrust," affects  national life, and threatens to disrupt public peace.    An announcement published on Tuesday in the GACETA OFICIAL  indicated that the sale of dollars will be resumed within six  days in order to halt the sharp fall of the bolivar against the  U.S. dollar, the price of which went up 85 bolivares in one  month.    Presidential spokesman Guillermo Alvarez Bajares announced  that the Council of Ministers will meet today to implement the  price and exchange controls and adopt other measures. Alvarez  explained that individual rights were suspended to prevent the  disruption of public order, "because there are groups interested  in promoting disturbances," which could not be put down with the  laws that exist in a de jure state.    Venezuelans awoke yesterday amid great uncertainty because,  although price increases were prohibited, merchants "speedily"  changed the prices of products. [passage omitted]</p>

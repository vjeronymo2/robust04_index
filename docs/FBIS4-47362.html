S. Kelzon, N. V. Yanvarev, V. G. Muramovich, </F> St. Petersburg; UDC 629.12.037.6]    [Abstract] A shaft line with a mass distribution featuring  a suspended mass on two supports one of which is pliable is  mathematically modeled to examine the effect of the rigidity of  the pliable support on the dynamic characteristics of a  propeller shaft-stern deadwood bearing system. The dynamics of  the shaft drive on the Arktika nuclear icebreaker are calculated  using this model. It was found that as the capacity of  icebreaker power plants increases, the amount of vibrations in  the stern end of the hull becomes untenable, and leads to  fatigue cracks and damage to the deadwood bearings. The energy  of the interaction of the propeller and the ice must be  optimally distributed. Two cases are examined: 1) a single  impact of the propeller blade with the ice and transition  processes in the shaft line caused by the impact; 2) induced  transverse vibrations of the shaft line due to a periodic pulse  load caused by the interaction of the propeller with the ice.  The optimal rigidity of the deadwood bearing support is 150  MN/m. The problem of determining the rigidity parameters of the  supports of the deadwood bearings should be solved by optimizing  the bearing parameters in each case using supports with an  adjustable rigidity, which makes it possible to adjust them away  from the critical frequency over the entire range of frequencies  of rotation of the propeller shaft.

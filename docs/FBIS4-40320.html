			<p>BFN     [Text] Belarus will sharply reduce grain imports this year.  Last year it imported 1.6 million tons of grain.    Deputy Minister for Bread Products Mikhail Petrashkevich  told  INTERFAX that since the beginning of the year, Belarus had  imported only 287,000 tonnes of grain (including 87,000 tonnes,  purchased by the Ministry for Bread Products and 200,000 tonnes  by individual enterprises). Grain is mostly imported from  Denmark, Germany and France at $105 to $120 for a tonne. In  addition, 5,000 tonnes of grain were bought in the Krasnodar  Region and 15,000 tonnes in the Stavropol Territory.    Petrashkevich said that grain imports were reduced due to  sharp cuts in the production of mixed fodder. Moreover, the  population prefers to buy cheap rye bread (previously, wheat was  the main import item.)    In 1993, Kazakhstan was the biggest grain supplier of  Belarus  (1 million tonnes). The other CIS countries exported a total of  600,000 tonnes of grain to Belarus.    Petrashkevich noted that Belarus did not care from which  country it imported grain. Whereas last year, Kazakhstan  exported grain to Belarus at reduced prices, this year, the  Kazakh Government is demanding $110 for a tonne on the condition  that payment is made in advance. Wheat ranks first in  Belarusian grain imports (about 600,000 tonnes a year).  Observers estimate that as in 1993, Belarus is to harvest about  60,000 tonnes of grain this year. The entire grain crop is to  amount to 7-8 million tonnes, compared to almost 7.7 million  tonnes in 1993.</p>

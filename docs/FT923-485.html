			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Justinian: Revival of trust in the law No opening of the law year in recent times has revealed such a significant facelift in the composition of the English judiciary as the one that begins on Thursday. The recent double replacement of the Lord Chief Justice of England and the Master of the Rolls - the two highest offices in the Supreme Court of Justice - conveys the impression of a new judicial broom sweeping through the dusty corridors of the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand, sufficient to restore public confidence in the administration of both criminal and civil justice. The arrival this year of four new Law Lords - enhancing the calibre and liberal disposition of the final court of appeal - has made necessary a number of replacements in and additions to the Court of Appeal. This reflects a distinct break with the past, improving the prospects of sensible and sustained legal reforms, and raising hopes that the esteem in which the public has hitherto held its senior judges will be restored. The postwar period of civil jurisdiction was dominated in the public's mind by Lord Denning, now 93. Appointed a High Court judge in 1944 and promoted to the Court of Appeal in 1948, he became a Law Lord in 1957. He returned to the Court of Appeal in 1962 as Master of the Rolls, where he dominated the court scene for the next 20 years. It was an idiosyncratic domination, reflected in his large output of judgments (he never allowed either of the two appellant judges to deliver the first judgment of the court). Lord Denning asserted the need for judges to be creative, to shape the law. For him, the doctrine of precedent was an obstacle that should be brushed aside if he believed the previous case-law stood in the way of individual or social justice. The difficulty with Lord Denning was his strong personal opinions, especially his moralistic attitude to the family and sex, and his overt hostility to trade unions and to some elements of society. It was a remark in 1982 in one of his autobiographical books that led to his undoing. He made a racist comment about the composition of a jury in a case arising out of riots in Bristol. He had to apologise, the passage in the book was withdrawn, and he bowed out, the last of the octogenarians on the bench. However Lord Denning's judicial brethren may have chafed under such a maverick influence, he held sway by the sheer force of his genial disposition and masterly court-craft. His literary style, moreover, was attractive to the newspaper-reading public, so he was easily seen as the embodiment of British justice. Only the House of Lords in the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of the greatest of our postwar judges, Lord Reid, kept English law on the smooth path of legal development. Public law owes much more to the creativity of Lord Reid than to the variable decisions emanating from Lord Denning. The mantle of Lord Reid now falls appropriately on the recently reconstructed House of Lords. Following Lord Denning, Lord Donaldson's decade at the helm of civil justice has been quietly remarkable. The parlous administration of the Court of Appeal's workload during Lord Denning's period has been largely rectified. The Court has been transformed from a one-judge band with two judicial bookends, to a corporate body in which the Master of the Rolls has led a team of 27 Lord Justices contributing to more stable, if unexciting, jurisprudence. Lord Donaldson, who formally retires on Wednesday, admits that he would have liked to have handed over to his successor, Lord Justice Bingham, in a tidier state. But he recognises that necessary reforms must be seen through by a new Master of the Rolls. He himself would have had to retire in the middle of such reforms. Lord Justice Bingham's appointment brings to the office a jurist of the highest quality, something that has to some extent been missing from civil justice. The criminal appellate court has had a battering in recent years, more the result of fundamental defects in the system than in its executants. Criminal appeals immediately after the war occupied little more than a day a week for the Lord Chief Justice and two puisne judges - today three divisions of the court sit regularly. In the 1950s Lord Goddard, a proponent of capital and corporal punishment, was out of tune with postwar Britain. His successor in 1958, Lord Parker, was the reverse. An outstanding and progressive lawyer, he began to shape the growing criminal jurisdiction with efficiency. In 1971 Lord Widgery, who was capable of absorbing complex material and delivering off-the-cuff judgments with astonishing speed, nevertheless barely disguised his distaste for this class of judicial work. (His prime expertise was in the field of planning law, intellectually far removed from rape and robbery.) By contrast, Lord Lane who retired this April, understood the world of criminality and was an outstanding Lord Chief Justice, despite popular belief to the contrary. His failing was to retain an Olympian aloofness, which let him down badly during media criticism over a spate of miscarriages of justice. Already his successor, Lord Taylor, has made a favourable public impression through his obvious readiness to be open about the job of Lord Chief Justice. If we do not now begin to see a marked difference in legal approach and in judicial attitude and style to contemporary legal problems, it will be astonishing. Come the 21st century, English law should have recovered its prestige, and should sit fittingly alongside the civilian systems of the rest of the European Community.</p>

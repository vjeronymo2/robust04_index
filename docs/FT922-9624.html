			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Queen's Speech (Analysis): Push for personal provision - Pensions THE GOVERNMENT'S legislative programme heralded few surprises on the pensions front. Indeed, it may have been more notable for what it did not say about pensions than what it did. The speech made no reference to pension law reform - an issue that had been rising on the political agenda since the disappearance of more than Pounds 400m from pension funds controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Instead, it focused exclusively on personal pensions. As foreshadowed in February by the then social security minister, Mr Tony Newton, the government has pledged to maintain the increase in personal pensions which its tax breaks first inspired in 1988. The 2 per cent incentive payment to those opting out of the government's State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, which expires in April 1993, will be replaced by a more modest rebate of 1 per cent on tax payments. Only those over the age of 30 - roughly 40 per cent of the nation's 4.6m personal pension holders  - will benefit from the new rebate. The total cost of the new rebate, at Pounds 175m per year, is considerably below the estimated Pounds 685m annual cost of the current pension incentive payment. The rebate will apply to the national insurance payments of individuals between the lower and upper wage bands (currently between Pounds 54 and Pounds 405 a week). At best, this will cut an individual's payments by Pounds 182.52 per year under the current tax structure. The Department of Social Security says the new lower tax incentive is intended to run for 'at least three years', suggesting that no more efforts to tinker with private social security schemes are envisaged. The new 1 per cent incentive payment has angered occupational pension schemes, the members of which will not benefit from it. The National Association of Pension Funds, the trade body representing those schemes, has condemned the policy, saying it unfairly promotes private pensions at the expense of employer-sponsored plans.</p>

			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: COMING ATTRACTIONS  </P> <P> Former presidential hopeful Jesse Jackson is taking to the TV screen again, but  this time as a guest on NBC's "A Different World." The episode, which will be  taped the week of March 13 (no set air date as yet), will focus on voter  registration. "TV is the medium to reach our youth," Jackson told USA Today,  adding that voting is a "way for our youth to choose political participation  over guns and violence." The Jackson episode was the idea of "A Different  World's" producer-director Debbie Allen who says her mission is to make the  show "about something that's important, not just who's your date this Friday."

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Domtex keeps up recovery DOMINION Textile, the Canadian-based international integrated textile group, continued its recovery in the fourth quarter, mainly due to strengths in the denim market. Operating profit was CDollars 38.1m (USDollars 29.3m), up 13 per cent, on sales of CDollars 361m, a rise of 4.9 per cent on a continuing basis. Final net profit for the year ended June 30, after special items, was CDollars 30.3m, or 68 cents, against a loss of CDollars 74.8m, or CDollars 2.31, a year earlier, on sales of CDollars 1.33bn, compared with CDollars 1.37bn. The 1992 loss included a CDollars 65m special charge. 'Fiscal 1993 was our best performance in five years,' said Mr Charles Hantho, chairman. 'And we see the improvement continuing into fiscal 1994.' Domtex has restructured to meet competition, and is a leading denim and yarn producer. Most of its plants are in the US and Canada, with others in Europe, north Africa and south-east Asia.</p>

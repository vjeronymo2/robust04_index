			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Hambro buys Nationwide's 304 estate agencies for Pounds 1 Nationwide building society has agreed to sell for just Pounds 1 a total of 304 estate agency branches acquired since 1987 for Pounds 120m. The sale marks the latest exit from the struggling business by leading financial services groups. These paid high prices in the late 1980s to buy branches from which they could sell a range of services such as home loans and insurance policies. The collapse of the housing market, however, has led to mounting losses, prompting large scale closures and disposals. About a quarter of all estate agency branches are estimated to have closed since 1988. The Nationwide chain, which is being acquired by Hambro Countrywide, the estate agency and financial services group, has made losses of Pounds 80m since 1987, taking the total loss to Pounds 200m for Britain's second largest building society. A loss of less than Pounds 50m has also been incurred by Guardian Assurance which had a 49 per cent stake. Guardian is thought to have paid Nationwide to acquire its stake prior to the sale. Abbey National bank and Prudential Corporation made combined losses totalling more than Pounds 500m when they sold their estate businesses in 1993 and 1991. Mr Brian Davis, Nationwide's chief executive, said the society had secured new mortgage business from its estate agents but house sales had been disappointing. Not all financial services groups have been displeased with their expansion into estate agency. Halifax, Britain's biggest building society, said a tenth of its mortgage business was generated through it 530 branches. It was 'strongly committed' to remaining in the business even though the division made a Pounds 2m loss in the first six months of this year. The sale by Nationwide will make Hambro Countrywide, 50 per cent owned by Hambros Bank, the UK's largest estate agents chain with 750 branches handling 6 per cent of all house sales. Nationwide's agencies made a pre-tax loss, after interest, of Pounds 13.8m for the 12 months to the end of March on a turnover of Pounds 37.4m. In a separate deal worth Pounds 12m, Hambro is also acquiring Nationwide's surveying and property valuation interests. Hambro Countrywide will issue 24m new shares to Nationwide, half of which will be purchased by Hambros Bank from the building society at the issue price of 50p. This will leave the bank with a 52 per cent stake and Nationwide with 3.4 per cent. Hambro made a pre-tax loss of Pounds 707,000 for the six months to June 30, due to a rise in losses from its estate agency division from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 2.18m.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Civil Aviation Administration of China Ready </F> To Jointly Operate Airlines With Foreign Investment"]    [Text] The Civil Aviation Administration of China [CAAC]  is ready to cooperate with foreign investors, on a trial basis,  in jointly running and developing domestic and international  flights. If the undertaking of Sino-foreign cooperative civil  aviation is successful, the civil aviation market will be opened  up further.    This message came from a high-ranking official from CAAC in  Beijing and should be described as one of the effective channels  for the modernization of China's civil aviation. It is an  undeniable fact that China's civil aviation has been developing  very quickly since China started opening up, but many drawbacks  also exist. By practically cooperating with foreign investors,  the virtues can be brought into play to make up for defects,  which will be beneficial to both the Chinese and the foreign  sides in the cooperation.    The undertaking of civil aviation has been monopolized by  the  state since New China's founding, thus forming a "unifying  situation" encompassing investment, construction, and  management. The greatest weakness of this practice is that  everything relies on the state and that improvement is  neglected. The contingent of aviators and air crew are mainly  cadres transferred from the Air Force after strict political  inspection, thus inevitably paying too much attention to this  but setting no demand on the business. We must bear in mind  that modern civil administration is closely bound up with high  technology. High-precision computers, sophisticated meters, and  an increasingly high degree of automation must all be put under  human control. For example, new types of aircraft with a high  degree of technology, such as Boeing-777, Euro Airbus A-300 and  A-301, must be piloted by high-caliber aviators. In order to  develop modern civil aviation, China cannot but introduce  various new types of aircraft and hugely upgrade the overall  quality of pilots and set a much higher demand on technology,  otherwise problems will easily arise. Not long ago, a Taiwan  airbus "A300-600R" crashed in Nagoya and caused more than 200  casualties, and the tragedy was, as far as we now know,  precisely caused by pilot and co-pilot negligence. Normally  speaking, "China Airlines" has a longer history, but many  instances of "dangerous situations" unavoidably arose when its  aviators piloted new types of aircraft. They also admitted that  the quality and administration of pilots must be improved.  Hence, as far as the training of aviators is concerned, the  CAAC must exchange with advanced countries more frequently, and  jointly running the business is precisely a realistic and  feasible way. The situation is the same in aircraft maintenance.    Another criticism of CAAC is that its service conditions are  quite poor, in particular, its planes often take off behind  schedule. Of course, this relates to such factors as the growth  of air routes, frequent flights, inadequate airport facilities,  and difficulties in aircraft transfer. Consequently, although  the crux of the problem has been clearly known for years,  improvement is slow. Under such circumstances, cooperating with  foreign advanced airlines on an trial basis and assimilating  their management skills in practice can make up China's own  deficiencies.    It is not the first time that the CAAC has cooperated with  foreign investors. For example, the supply of air food is  precisely this kind of cooperation with Hong Kong's catering  business, whereas joint maintenance is another type of  cooperation with Hong Kong enterprises engaging in aircraft  engineering projects. This time, the stress will be laid on  such key aspects as management and administration, which is an  important step.    CAAC is ready to cooperate with foreign investors, but there  are also some preconditions. That is, under the principle of  mainly relying on Chinese investment, foreign businesses can  conditionally invest in or run the business of China's civil  aviation, including the construction of civil airports and  tarmacs (including runways and parking aprons) in China in such  forms as joint ventures or joint operations. When cooperating  with foreign investors, the Chinese side must invest over 51  percent of capital in the projects and assign personnel to take  up the posts of chairmen of the board of directors and general  managers. Foreign businessmen granted the right to run the  above-mentioned joint-venture projects are welcome to invest in  and run civil aviation service projects in such aspects as  airport terminals, freight transport depositories, land service,  air food, guesthouses, restaurants, and aviation fuel. All  these are attractive targets of investment.    China also said that foreign businessmen are welcome to  invest in aviation enterprises engaging in agriculture and  forestry, in the form of joint venture or joint operation. The  proportion of foreign investment in this respect can be decided  through consultation.    However, the air traffic control system must still be  financed and administered by China; whereas foreign airport and  aircraft construction enterprises cannot invest in and set up  air transport enterprises.    It clearly indicates that foreign enterprises cannot take  part in areas which have a bearing on state sovereignty and  security, but they can cooperate with the Chinese side or set up  joint ventures in all other areas. For example, foreign  investors have become stockholders of Sanya Airport in Hainan  Province.    At present, the global civil aviation business is in a state  of recession, and most foreign airlines are interested to  develop their business in China. Now is the golden opportunity  for CAAC to develop and expand further and to march to the  international market.</p>

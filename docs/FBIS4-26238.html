			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by XINHUA reporter Zhu Chengxiu (2612 2110 </F> 0208): "On Li Denghui's Certain Remarks"]    [Text] Beijing, June 18 (XINHUA) -- This year, Mr. Li  Denghui [Li Teng-hui], the preeminent power-holder of the Taiwan  authorities, has made a great deal of unusual remarks inside and  outside the island of Taiwan, and these remarks have quite  flagrantly betrayed his inclination toward "Taiwan  independence." This has triggered serious concern at home and  abroad. People commonly maintain it is imperative to keep a  close watch on Li Denghui's moves from now on and also refute  his strange talk and comments.    Some of Li Denghui's remarks were blatant, and some were  ambiguous; and more often than not they were self-contradictory  and logically confusing. Moreover, soon after he made certain  mind-boggling remarks, he would amend them to alleviate  questioning by the media. But whenever there was an  opportunity, he would give a different explanation. Despite his  changeability, he was helplessly "revealing his true intenis  true." What, then, is Mr. Li Denghui's true intent?    People may have discovered that, within the island of  Taiwan,  Mr. Li Denghui has disseminated the seed of discord by  occasionally provoking contradictions between Taiwanese people  and those from the mainland. On cross-strait relations, he has  denied that there is but one China, thus separating Taiwan from  the mainland and pitting Taiwan against the mainland. He has  also, time and again, been wantonly critical of the CPC, and the  language he has used has been so vile that it appeared he had  lost his head. In this way he has exposed himself step by step.    Among Li Denghui's pronouncements is the demagogic phrase  of "the sorrows of being born a Taiwanese." Whenever he uses  this phrase, he invariably makes reference to "Exodus" in the  Bible. In other words, he is distressed by the invasions and  suffering in the history of Taiwan and it is his ambition to  lead the Taiwanese in building a new nation. What Li Denghui  tries to do here is to separate Taiwan from China, and Taiwanese  from Chinese. Yes, the corrupt government in the later years of  the Qing Dynasty ceded Taiwan to Japan following the 1894-95  Sino-Japanese War, and the Taiwanese people suffered enslavement  for half a century. That episode of history is, however, a  tragic chapter for China and the Chinese nation as a whole.  Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and the concessions in Shanghai and  other parts of China are all symbols of the tragic fate of China  due to aggression by the big powers, a Chinese nation in  humiliation. For many long years people on both sides of the  strait suffered, and their sufferings were those of the Chinese  nation as a whole. It should also be pointed out that from the  day the Qing Government decided to cede Taiwan, Taiwanese, one  stepping into the breach as another fell, fought and laid down  their lives in their struggle against the ceding and the  aggression of Japanese imperialism. Numerous national heroes  emerged among the Taiwanese. Their wish that Taiwan be returned  to China was realized 50 years later after the Chinese people  fought eight years of bloody war. Although all their struggles  ended in failure, their heroism will be immortalized in history.  How could Li Denghui, who prates about "the sorrows of being a  Taiwanese" and "Exodus" and claims to be most knowledgeable  about modern Chinese history, be so ignorant of the history of  his own country?    We must also point out that only a unified and strong China  can prevent tragedy from falling on the Chinese people. Being  born a Taiwanese is being born a Chinese. Only by working for  the great cause of motherland reunification will we be able to  prevent the historical tragedy from repeating itself. We are  convinced that Taiwan compatriots will, instead of being swayed  by Li Denghui's demagogy, obtain a more profound understanding  of this.    Li Denghui claimed that cross-strait relations should not  develop into a relationship between father and son but into a  relationship between brother and brother. He also asserted that  the inclusion of Taiwan as a province of the People's Republic  of China by the CPC constitutes a "strange dream," adding  "Taiwan and the mainland are under different governments. This  is all I can say." This is another ill-intentioned attempt by  him to sow discord among and incite the compatriots in Taiwan  regarding cross-strait relations. This is him trying to confuse  people about cross-strait relations. It should be said that the  people of both sides of the strait are kinsfolk to each other;  as far as the country is concerned, both sides of the strait are  one entity, each forming a part of China. Like 30 other  provincial-level administrative regions of China, Taiwan is also  a provincial-level administrative region. In the future there  will be Hong Kong and Macao. All these provincial-level  administrative regions form the great People's Republic of  China. How can one distinguish between father and son in a  unified body? Moreover, when the two sides of the strait are  reunified peacefully in the future, it will not be one side  swallowing up the other side or vice versa; Taiwan will become a  province or a provincial-level special administrative region of  the People's Republic of China; the central government will  reserve a certain number of leading positions for Taiwan. As  for the question of "different governments," we have always  advocated one country, two systems. When peaceful reunification  is achieved in the future, Taiwan can practice a system  different from that on the mainland. Taiwan's party, government,  and military will be managed by Taiwan itself. These policies  of ours were made known to the world long ago. They cannot be  obliterated by a few ambiguous utterances by Mr. Li Denghui.  However, this does in no way mean that China is permitting the  promotion of two political entities of equal standing. If Mr.  Li Denghui stubbornly clings to his aim of a political entity of  equal standing, he is dreaming of something strange, but when he  wakes up he will find that everything is empty. Mr. Li Denghui  should know this.    Recently Li Denghui also hawked the so-called "Republic of  China on Taiwan" everywhere in an attempt to use these ambiguous  words to create "two Chinas" internationally, and to stand up to  the People's Republic of China as an equal. His attempt will be  doomed to run into a wall. Interestingly, he, despite flaunting  the signboard of "the Republic of China," does not take great  interest in "the Republic of China" and claimed that it is "a  regime from the outside." The fact that he does not value the  general interests of the Chinese nation above everything else  makes Mr. Li Denghui a very confused person.    Lately, sovereignty also has become one of the pet topics of  Li Denghui. At one time he would say "sovereignty is a  dangerous word." At another time he would toy with such pretty  slogans as "sovereignty rests with the people." He scolded the  Communist Chinese, saying "they lack the qualification to talk  about sovereignty." Recently he changed his mind, saying that  it would be better not to talk about the issue of sovereignty  and that mainland leaders "are ossified." The whole thing is  deadlocked over the issue of "sovereignty rests with the people  and let's set aside the problem of sovereignty for the moment."  His babblings are just mind-boggling. Very few people in the  world can understand why "sovereignty" is "a dangerous word,"  because all they know is that sovereignty is sacred and  inviolable. As regards Li Denghui's so- called "sovereignty  rests with the people," this is nothing but his attempt to make  use of an empty concept to evade the issue of who owns the  sovereignty of Taiwan. "Let's set aside the issue of  sovereignty for the moment" is another stalling tactic to gain  time. Li Denghui's aim, in the final analysis, is to split  Taiwan away from China. But, to borrow Mr. Li Denghui's own  words: It is nothing but babblings in dreams.    Li Denghui has repeatedly emphasized the present divide and  separate rule on both sides of the strait. He failed to speak  about the historical reasons which lead to this situation. He  refrained from speaking on the efforts needed to achieve  reunification. Therefore, people cannot help thinking that he is  trying to fan up a separation consciousness from that side of  the strait. There is a saying that to judge a person, one needs  not only to listen to his remarks but also to observe his deeds.  Mr. Li Denghui is just the sort of person who is obsessed with  his own small calculations.    On several occasions this year, Li Denghui has let loose a  torrent of abuse against the Chinese Communists. His muddle  headedness has even surprised the people on the island. Because  the Chinese Communists did not deem to heed his curses, he  became so conceited that he even said, "When I get tough, the  other side blinks." People are simply amazed at the degree of  his lack of self-knowledge. He also repeatedly claimed that  before he reached the age of 22 (that is in 1945, before the  retrocession of Taiwan to China) he had been a Japanese. If one  understands that he is not ashamed of, but even proud of his  country being conquered by Japan, then it will be easy to  understand on what kind of ideological basis he has based his  various fallacies of today. Of course, what makes the people  most concerned now is how far this person, with such an  ideological basis, will go on the erroneous path.</p>

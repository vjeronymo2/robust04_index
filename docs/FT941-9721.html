			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Property: How to beat the greedy gazumpers - Cadogan's Place With markets rising in London, gazumping could re-appear. Gazumping happens when, after accepting an offer but before exchange of contracts, the vendor rejects it to accept a higher offer. The disappointed buyer then blames the vendor's agent although, often, it is not the agent who is at fault. Can anything be done to ensure vendors behave properly? Yes. Make your offer conditional upon the vendor signing a 'lock-out' agreement. This binds them not to accept any other offer for a stated period (although it does not stop them showing other potential buyers around in case the deal with you should fall through). Buying agent Wilson &amp; Wilson, which has overseas clients who come a long way to view properties, insists on these agreements. They promise that the buyer will exchange contracts within 10 working days (two weeks) of receiving the draft documentation. If that does not happen, the deal will almost certainly lapse. Meanwhile, inner London homes for sale include: 46 Clanricarde Gardens, W2. A superbly decorated flat near Notting Hill Gate tube station. Pounds 195,000 for a 104-year lease.

Last month, the river Lavant brought the worst flooding in 130 years to Chichester, West Sussex. The river also runs through the nearby village of East Lavant where, for around Pounds 500,000, Henry Adams &amp; Partners (0243-533 377) is selling Paxtons, an 18th century brick and flint house in two acres. Paxtons does not flood. It is on higher ground, and even the cellars stayed dry during the deluge.</p>

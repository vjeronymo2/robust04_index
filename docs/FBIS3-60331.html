			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by chairman and deputy chairman of Environmental </F> Protection Association: "Government Lowers Ambitions for  Environmental Protection"]    [Text] This policy harms nature and undermines the Swedish  timber industry's export potential, Ulf von Sydow and Stefan  Edman feel.    Logging in Njakafjall in Vilhelminas is finished for this  year. The rich forest with its many threatened species continues  to be harmed.    But Njakafjell is not a unique case, rather an example of a  more general course of events. Every week reports reach us on  how valuable nature around our country is being damaged--a  result of an exceptionally weak environmental protection policy.    The government says that the responsibility for managing  environmental protection in the forests lies with the timber  industry. It is called "voluntary cooperation." Laws that  provide effective protection (outside of preserves and national  parks) consequently do not exist.    Often, fortunately, individual timberland owners do  cooperate. But if voluntary cooperation is contingent upon  owners receiving compensation for sparing a valuable wooded  area, environmental protection is likely also to be forfeit.  State provision for compensating infringement are small and do  not go far.    The politicians' most important contribution is doubtless  the  clarity of their goals. The proposition on biological diversity,  for example, states that "...the environmental objective should  be given the same emphasis and significance as various economic  considerations." The new forest protection law contains similar  formulations on objectives.    Other environmental areas are rife with obligatory,  sometimes  costly, demands that require adjustment. The catalytic  converter, for example, adds thousands of kronor to the price of  a new car.  <H5>  Disadvantaged Area </H5>   In the area of environmental protection, on the other hand,  there are virtually no requirements. If a person wishes to  protect the environment, that is fine, but if a person does not  feel that he has the means or the interest, he can forego it.    The situation resembles conditions in the 1960's when  industries were not obliged to defray environmental costs,  rather they received state subsidies to deal with emissions.    The improvements that we have begun to notice with regard to  forest management are important and positive, but they are not  occurring because of legislation, but despite legislation. In  reality, there is no environmental protection law worthy of the  name.    A key problem is the regulations on compensation which were  introduced in 1987.    --Before 1987, the extent of the demands regarding  responsibility for the environment that society could make in  connection with the felling of timber (sparing protected zones,  old and dead trees, high brush, etc.) pertained to all of the  affected property. After 1987, it pertained only to "the  affected area of the property," that is, normally only the  cutting area.    This modification meant that the responsibility on a daily  basis for protecting nature during timber harvesting was  dramatically reduced. But the resolution also opened the way for  unwilling timberland owners to avoid the responsibility for  protection by cleverly laying out their cutting area. A couple  of these cases are pending in the courts.    --At the same time, a ceiling was introduced, which has been  set after sentencing in a couple of cases at approximately 9,000  kronor (the equivalent of about 50 trees). The timberland owner  need never suffer greater expense.    If society requests greater responsibility, the timberland  owner--regardless of what natural asset is threatened--can  either refuse to take on the responsibility or else, demand  compensation. The already limited exigencies to take  responsibility are thus set aside completely.  <H5>  Hasty Compromise </H5>   The 1987 resolution was a hastily constructed compromise.  The  Social Democrats quite simply needed support in order to  introduce plan and building laws. The consequences for  environmental protection were not analyzed at all.    Since its enactment, the resolution has been criticized  strongly, particularly by the Liberal Party, which had  reservations from the start.    Thus it is the more surprising that the so-called Freedom  and  Rights Committee is now proposing that the somewhat scrambled  Social Democratic-Center Party compromise be written into the  Constitution and accorded the same status as the right to vote  and freedom of the press!    Still stranger is the fact that neither the Left Party, the  Social Democrats, nor the Liberal Party's committee members  protested the suggestion! Did they not realize the consequences?    Clearly individual timberland owners should have the right  to  compensation in the case of a major infringement. But, at the  same time, modern environmental thinking stipulates that each  line of trade must be prepared to take economic responsibility  for its effects on the environment.    We are convinced that most timberland owners agree with us  that they must assume some fundamental, obligatory  responsibility without compensation.    The current arrangement, in which the timber industry  largely  lacks legal (and thereby economic) responsibility for the  environmental harm it perpetrates is unreasonable and benefits  only the loggers who shirk their environmental responsibility.    If the proposal for a change in the Constitution is passed,  it will exclude any possibility of creating modern conservation  legislation. Do Olof Johansson, the Liberal Party, and the  Social Democrats accept that? And where do the Christian  Democrats stand on this?    At the same time, the government is on the verge of letting  go of the most viable possibility for solving the need of new  forest reserves. Sweden has, from the international perspective,  protected a very small portion of its forested regions, only 0.5  percent below the reforestation limit.    To achieve the goal of protected biological diversity, on  the  order of 10 times as much forest area should be protected.    The need is greatest in south and central Sweden, but  establishing large reserves in these parts is expensive,  complicated, and time consuming, not least because of the  extensive parceling of property.    One way to rapidly improve our situation is to transfer a  portion of the still completely state-owned Domain AB to the  Environmental Agency and reduce correspondingly the value of the  company. Such a solution was discussed already when the Office  of Domains was incorporated a couple of years ago, but was not  utilized.    By allowing Domain/Assi [Swedish Forest Industries] to merge  with the partly private NCB, the government is on the verge of  blowing its unique opportunity of establishing the needed  reserves in a single stroke. Has the trade minister thought of  this?  <H5>  Biotope Protection </H5>   A further step backwards is the government's application of  so-called biotope protection that was intended to protect  "certain smaller field and water areas (biotopes) that provide a  habitat for endangered animals or plants or are otherwise  especially deserving of protection." The protection was intended  primarily to have an automatic, overall application.    The government has now determined that biotope protection  should be implemented in a manner that completely waters down  the Riksdag proposal:    --Protection for "habitats for endangered animal and plant  species" will not be undertaken at all. Instead, there will be  protection for a number of specified types of environment.    --Of the designated environments, there are only a few  biotopes in logging areas that will be accorded automatic,  overall protection.    Viewed in its entirity, this conservation policy means that  the government has backed off from its previously established  ambitions. The gap between political rhetoric and actual  practice is widening.    This policy harms nature and also undermines the Swedish  timber industry's opportunities in export markets. Credibility  with regard to environmental efforts will be ever more  important, and nothing would strengthen the Swedish timber  industry's credibility more than a strong conservation  legislation and an ambitious investment in additional nature  reserves.</p>

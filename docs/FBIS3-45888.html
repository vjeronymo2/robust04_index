By the end of November employment stood at 147.716 million,  slightly more than the 147.533 million in October but 203,000  fewer than at the beginning of this year, according to the State  Statistics Bureau. This figure is for all non-agricultural  workers.    The bureau's latest report said that by the end of November  State industries had cut their payrolls by 56,000 to 108.833  million from the beginning of this year, but they still grew by  154,000 compared with October.    Of the workers in State industries, 74.07 million held  permanent jobs, down 1.54 million. But those working under  contracts increased by 1.721 million to 22.306 million. The  rest held temporary jobs.    Collective enterprises reduced payrolls by 688,000 to 35.524  million, while foreign-funded and private firms added 541,000  workers to raise their total employment to 3.359 million.    Meanwhile, wages paid out in the first 11 months of 1993  totalled 395.52 billion yuan ($45.46 billion), 21.8 percent more  than during the same period in 1992.    Of that total, State industries paid 309.99 billion yuan  ($35.63 billion), up 21.9 percent. Collective enterprises paid  71.76 billion yuan ($8.25 billion), up 15.1 percent. And  foreign-funded and private firms paid 13.76 billion yuan ($1.58  billion), up a hefty 73.5 percent.    In another development, November's retail price index--the  country's most important inflation indicator--rose 15.1 percent  over the same month the previous year. The cost-of-living index  increased by 16.7 percent in Novermber.    The retail sales index for consumer goods rose 15.2 percent,  while at State-owned commercial outlets the index rose 14.5  percent.

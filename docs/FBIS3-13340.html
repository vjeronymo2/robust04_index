Such a decision would have to  have been made in the wake of certain mediatory efforts of  friendly countries -- Iran and China. Iran has assured the  Pakistani authorities that it will continue to work to help stop  human rights violations in occupied Kashmir. Apart from this,  India has also agreed to allow a delegation comprising  representatives of Muslim countries to visit Kashmir to assess  and observe the situation on the ground and the human rights  condition there.    Pakistan's decision to defer the resolution by one year is  certainly not an exemplary decision, because, in our opinion,  the adoption of the resolution would have been the best thing.  However, a situation had arisen at the Human Rights Commission,  under which Pakistan had to yield to the pressures of Iran,  China, and 15 other friendly countries. It had become clear  many days ago that about 40 or more of the 53-member commission  did not intend to vote on the resolution and hardly 10-12  members could have agreed to vote. It was expected that some  seven to eight members would vote in favor of the resolution.  Hence, even though the resolution would have been adopted with  a slight majority, it would not have exerted much moral  influence and pressure and India could have refused to respect  it.    Opinions may vary on the method now adopted by the friendly  countries and it can be said that Pakistan should not have  deferred the resolution under any circumstances. The chairman  of the Kashmir Committee and several opposition leaders have  stated the same thing. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto had also  said that the resolution was not a game of statistics but a  matter of principle and even if we were left alone, we would not  refrain from supporting the cause of the Kashmiris. The  decision to defer the resolution, obviously, seems to be  contrary to this commitment, but, if viewed closely, it would  not be appropriate to jump to the above conclusion. Pakistan  has once again declared its intention to continue to fight for  the cause of the Kashmiris and the foreign minister has stated  in no uncertain terms that Pakistan will raise its voice in  support of the Kashmiris at all international forums. He has  also said that our resolution will always hang like a sword over  India's head and we will be able to present it again at the UN  General Assembly or the UN Human Rights Commission session.  Thus, to assume that by deferring the resolution Pakistan has  withdrawn its support to the Kashmiris will be totally erroneous  and incomprehensible logic.    The foreign minister's assertion that by tabling the  resolution Pakistan has realized many of its objectives is  correct to a great extent. This was not a mean achievement, as  the BBC has said that after a gap of 29 years Pakistan has  raised the Kashmir issue at every international forum. It is  also true that during the debate on the resolution, the Kashmir  dispute had become the focus of the world's attention. The  member-countries, which had decided to abstain from the voting,  also condemned India's action in occupied Kashmir. By tabling  the resolution, Pakistan has also belied the Indian claim that  the Kashmir dispute is a bilateral problem and that the Simla  agreement does not empower Pakistan to raise the issue at any  international forum. Pakistan has proved this stand as being  completely wrong. Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had to  admit that most of the world nations were not paying heed to  India's stand and were paying greater attention to what he  called "irrelevant issues" like the human rights. The Indian  leader also admitted that Pakistan appears to be a champion of  human rights, while India is standing in the dock as a criminal  in the court of international opinion. Narasimha Rao's  confessions make it clear that Pakistan has achieved  considerable success in projecting the Kashmir issue at the  international level.    One of the main clauses of the formula, under which Pakistan  has deferred its resolution, is that a delegation of the  member-countries of the Islamic Conference Organization will be  allowed to visit Kashmir. In addition, other agencies like the  Amnesty International and Red Cross will also enjoy the right to  send their delegations to Kashmir. Earlier, two major  delegations have already toured occupied Kashmir and 10  India-based foreign ambassadors are currently visiting the  territory. That shows that India has been forced to open up  Kashmir to international observers, which, in fact, was one of  the major objectives of Pakistan. India has also promised to  certain friendly countries to reduce its troops in occupied  Kashmir and to improve the human rights situation there.  However, India's past record has not been encouraging, as  rightly suggested by Pakistani delegate Ahmad Kamal that  whenever India comes under pressure, it makes certain promises,  but when that pressure is removed, it deviates from its  commitments. Nonetheless, it would not be that easy for India  now to breach its promises because the entire world is keeping  an eye on the situation in Kashmir. Therefore, to construe that  Pakistan has deferred its resolution without achieving anything  would be incorrect. The Kashmiris themselves and the Pakistanis  have to wage a prolonged struggle to liberate the Kashmiris from  Indian subjugation. One of the stages of this long struggle was  to table the resolution at the UN Human Rights Commission. It  has yielded some results and much success has been achieved in  making the international public realize the importance of the  Kashmir problem. This holy war and the struggle are still  continuing and will continue in future. Pakistan will continue  its efforts to help the 12.5 million Kashmiris achieve their  right to self-determination. The tabling of the resolution was  a kind of war on the Kashmir front, but the war is still  continuing and we will certainly be crowned with success, and  the Kashmiri people will finally emerge victorious.</p>

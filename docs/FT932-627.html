			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / City's anti-IRA plan is opposed MINISTERS are hostile to plans to restrict access to parts of the City of London in an effort to prevent further terrorist bombings, Paul Abrahams writes. The plans, proposed by the Corporation of London - the local authority for the City - would probably require legislation and government support to reach the statute book. The scheme, announced in outline earlier this month, involves banning non-essential traffic from about a third of the City. The boundaries would be likely to include only the heart of the City. The area would be divided into five zones. Each would have an access through a single entrance staffed by guards. The proposals follow two IRA bombs in the past 14 months that killed four people and caused hundreds of millions of pounds of damage. Whitehall officials say ministers are concerned that the plans would be an admission of success for the IRA if they were to go beyond sensible policing measures. The Corporation has received some support for the scheme during meetings with 400 City businesses. Most supported the plan, although some expressed concern about access for service vehicles. The Corporation insisted yesterday that nothing firm was yet on the table and that the scheme was unlikely to be implemented soon.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the Defense Ministry has  confirmed reports concerning the downing of three aircraft of  [word indistinct] type belonging to the al-Ahmar gang in the  battles which were fought near Bab el Mandeb in the Red Sea, as  well as the sinking of a gunboat near the shores of Aden. He  said one of the pilots of these downed planes was alive and  would confirm this fact himself, when his health allowed him to  do so.    The command of the Naval Forces has confirmed reports  concerning the sinking of a gunboat belonging to the bloody  al-Ahmar gang by our courageous Navy, which is vigilant in  protecting our territorial waters.    Commenting on statements by the so-called military source at  the Defense Ministry under the al-Ahmar gang which, as usual,  claimed that their forces were continuing their progress in the  Kharaz area, the responsible source at the Defense Ministry  confirmed that there was no truth in their reports, and that it  was just part of the cheap media propaganda which the bloody  al-Ahmar gang typically used. The source confirmed that our  forces, the forces of unity, democracy, and modernism, had  fought a rare defensive battle, in which they had resisted with  courage and steadfastness the hordes of treachery and betrayal,  and had inflicted heavy losses on those forces, forcing them to  retreat and withdraw from where they had been pushed into the  war by the adventurous al-Ahmar gang.</p>

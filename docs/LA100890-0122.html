			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> 2 PRESUMED DROWNED AT CASTAIC  </P> <P> A 50-year-old man and boy, 17, both from Pasadena, are presumed drowned in  Castaic Lake after their rented fishing boat was swamped Sunday afternoon, Los  Angeles County sheriff's deputies said today.  </P> <P> The identities of the two were not released pending notification of their  families.  </P> <P> Two other men in the boat were saved by county lifeguards, who sped to the  scene at 4:25 p.m. in boats, arriving less than five minutes after the incident  was reported, a Sheriff's Department spokesman said.  </P> <P> The four were fishing on upper Castaic Lake, where power boating is popular.  Deputies would not release the names of the survivors.  </P> <P> The boat apparently hit a wave and was swamped. The missing are presumed  drowned in an area of the lake where water is more than 200 feet deep. Divers  are unable to search in the depths and no search for the bodies was planned  this morning, deputies said.  </P> <P> Helicopters repeatedly flew over the site and lifeguard boats searched the  area, but the two missing men were not found. The incident has been ruled an  accident by sheriff's investigators.  </P></p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / The Middle East: Settlers and Jericho Arabs cautious over 'first step' THE Moshav (co-operative farm) of Na'ma - one of Israel's many settlements in the occupied West Bank - lies in the floor of the sun-baked Jordan Valley. The pre-fabricated houses, many unoccupied, and the empty plots of ploughed earth bear witness to the desolate and temporary nature of Israel's settlement policy in such a barren area. If the Gaza-Jericho peace plan between Israel and Palestinians is signed in Washington this week Israeli troops will withdraw from an enclave around Jericho, a small, ancient dusty town of cafes, fruit stalls and curio shops strewn with Pepsi-Cola bunting. The 25 families who live in Na'ma, wedged in the middle of the future Palestinian-controlled territory, will become guinea pigs for a new form of co-existence between Israelis and Palestinians after decades of mistrust and bloodshed. 'We are going to be the test here in Na'ma,' said Mrs Ana Meller a Russian immigrant who has lived eight years on the farm. 'In the past five years there has been a lot of hatred between us and the Arabs. Each time I took my workers to the fields I was afraid they were going to stab me. I don't want to live like this any more. We must change.' Like Mrs Meller, many farmer-settlers in the Jericho area are supporters of the Labour party, which leads Israel's coalition government, and their farm is subsidised by the Labour movement. They moved to the Jordan Valley largely because of economic incentives offered by previous governments. They are not fanatical Zionists. A vast majority support the Gaza-Jericho plan, despite fears about what the future may hold. 'If this is the price we have to pay so that my children don't have to go to fight wars like I did and my father did and my grandfather did then its okay,' said Mr Eyal Levi, a vegetable farmer living at Na'ma. 'Our main problem is security. We just don't know what is going to happen. Just yesterday we were enemies and tomorrow we will be brothers. We will have to see what will happen. Maybe there will be a problem, maybe not. We hope not.' The Gaza-Jericho plan allows for continued existence of Na'ma and other settlements whose agriculture depends on the underground springs running through Jericho. Mr Levi and most of the settlers near Jericho would like to stay after the Palestinians take control. But Mr Levi and Mrs Meller say that if the security situation deteriorates they are prepared to take government compensation and leave Na'ma. Not all West Bank settlers are as moderate. A small minority in Na'ma - supporters of the religious Tsomet party - threatened yesterday to burn their houses if they were forced one day to leave. A more fanatical Jewish group - aligned to the right-wing National Religious party - has started a sit-in at the site of a sixth century synagogue on the outskirts of Jericho. 'There was a Jewish community here 1,500 years ago and I think this land belongs to the Israel nation,' said Mr Yaron Benzvi, a member of the Jericho Yeshiva - a religious study group. 'This land was promised to the Jews by God. We don't believe the government will give up Jericho. We want the Jewish to wake up and make it not happen. Taking Jewish people out of this land is going against God.' Mr Benzvi represents a very small minority. Extremism in Jericho, however, is not confined to the Jewish community. The Islamic fundamentalist Hamas movement - which rejects talking peace with Israel - called a strike yesterday to protest against the accord. Most shopkeepers ignored the call. But in the poorer sections of Jericho businessmen closed their graffiti-covered shutters. Islamic extremism thrives in the economically decimated occupied-Gaza Strip but is less strong in Jericho. Most of the Palestinians in Jericho yesterday cautiously welcomed the peace deal. They hope the agreement will be followed by aid inflows and investment to boost an economy dependent on farming and tourists visiting the site of Christ's Baptism or the Mount of Temptation where Jesus was said to have fasted for 40 days after his baptism. 'We see this as a first step towards peace,' said Mr Isaac Shawar, a grocer who opened his shop yesterday. 'But this step must be followed by other steps returning all occupied Palestinian lands. We want to live a better life. Jews and Moslems were friends for centuries. My family used to live in Beersheva next to Jews as brothers. The problems only started in 1948 and if the problems are undone, maybe we can live like that again.'</p>

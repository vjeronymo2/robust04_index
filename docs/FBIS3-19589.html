			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "A.An.": "Haider: European Treaty Is </F> Precondition for Agreement to EU"]    [Text] There has been movement in the debate about Europe.  Great Britain might be willing to give in concerning the  contentious issue of the blocking minority for European Union  [EU] decisions. So far, the final conclusion of the membership  negotiations has failed because of disagreement on this issue.    The issue of European integration was also the focal issue  at  a meeting of the Federal Executive Committee of the Freedom  Party of Austria [FPOe] in Salzburg on Saturday [19 March]. The  marathon debate took more than six hours. In the course of this  discussion the FPOe made a clear change in its EU policy. Until  then rejection of EU membership had dominated. Now the FPOe has  become more positive toward the EU.    A precondition for a recommendation to vote yes [in the  referendum on EU membership] is the conclusion of a European  treaty between the government and the opposition, FPOe Chairman  Joerg Haider stressed. "In view of the existing results of the  negotiations, which are known only very rudimentarily, it is all  the more necessary to critically ask whether the necessary  homework has been done."    Over the past few days, EU advocates in the FPOe have spoken  up more loudly. In the diet elections [in Salzburg, Tirol, and  Carinthia on 13 March], polls showed that half of FPOe voters  are positively inclined toward the EU.    The European treaty is to set down the fulfillment of  several  demands within a precise timeframe. Among other things, Haider  is demanding a constitutional safeguarding of direct payments to  farmers and tax reform to protect small and medium-sized  enterprises.    The invitation to Foreign Minister Alois Mock (Austrian  People's Party) and State Secretary Brigitte Ederer (Social  Democratic Party of Austria) to brief the FPOe about the results  of the EU negotiations is still open.</p>

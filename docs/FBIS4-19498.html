			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg, April 17 (CTK) -- A two-day working  meeting between Czech Defense Minister Antonin Baudys and his  German counterpart Volker Ruehe ended in Hamburg today.    The ministers discussed the security aspects of recent  developments in Europe, above all in the former Yugoslavia, and  a plan for cooperation between the Czech and German armies to  consist of 36 joint operations.    They also talked about the attitude of Russia to the  Partnership for Peace project and to developments in Bosnia.  "The situation is complicated by the fact that Russia as a  superpower would like to have some sort of special status within  the Partnership, and would also like to take a share in common  responsibility for the security of Europe," Baudys told CTK.    With Russia having expressed dissatisfaction at the most  recent events in Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example, a situation  had arisen where all sides should put their cards on the table  and speak openly, he said.    The point of issue had to be the original decision of the UN  Security Council, which had given the mandate to NATO troops.  Russia playing a larger part in international negotiations on  the former Yugoslavia would mean a change in the agreed  approach, said the defense minister.    He praised the performance of Czech soldiers serving in the  former Yugoslavia in UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force]  units, saying they were some of the best there.    Ruehe told CTK he valued the intensive and regular dialogue  with representatives of the Czech Army. The next meeting is to  take place in Prague in six months' time.    Today Baudys left Hamburg for Munster. From there he will  continue to Bonn, which he is visiting at the invitation of the  Konrad Adenauer Foundation, close to the German Christian  Democratic Union (CDU). Baudys belongs to the Czech Christian  Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL).</p>

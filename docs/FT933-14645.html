			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Northwest Airlines close to union deals NORTHWEST Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier, yesterday secured a tentative agreement with its machinists' union and an agreement with the Teamsters' union is believed to be immi-nent. The airline, which is integrating its operations with those of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, needed significant labour concessions to remain operating outside the protection of the bankruptcy courts. Last week it ratified an agreement with its pilots' union which will save the carrier Dollars 365m over three years. Northwest has agreed that Dollars 61m of the savings from its pilots could come from work-rule changes instead of direct wage and benefits cuts. There is also a provision to give all employees the choice of being repaid for their concessions within 10 years, or they may choose to receive as much as 37.5 per cent of the common stock in the company. Previous agreements had called for employees to receive a 30 per cent stake. The machinists' pact replaces an agreement which was rejected by union members last month. The terms of the new agreement are believed to be similar to those of the pilots' agreement. Northwest is now expected to reach an agreement with its Teamsters' union shortly.</p>

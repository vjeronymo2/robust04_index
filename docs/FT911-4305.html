			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / International Company News: BASF dividend cut after 45% fall in income BASF, one of Germany's big three chemical companies, will pay a lower dividend after a steep drop in profits last year, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt. Shareholders will receive DM13 a share compared with the previous year's DM14, which included a DM1 bonus to mark its 125th anniversary. For 1988 the group paid DM12. Some analysts had expected a cut to DM11 a share in view of the poor result. However, the dollar's slight recovery and lower oil prices have improved the outlook for 1991. The group said net income totalled DM1.1bn (Dollars 622m) in 1990, a decline of 45 per cent. It has already announced a 37 per cent slide in pre-tax profits for 1990, with the fourth-quarter figure plummeting by 64 per cent. Like the other German chemical groups, BASF has suffered from the dollar's weakness, the recession in the US and other markets, and higher raw material prices. BASF said rising labour and environmental costs. especially in Germany, had also depressed the final quarter's result.</p>

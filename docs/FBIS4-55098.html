			<p>BFN     [Text] Teplice nad Becvou, North Moravia, May 7 (CTK) --  Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus said today the parliament should say  that it would pass no more laws redressing the injustices  committed under the communist regime. Speaking at a press  conference held within a session of the Executive Council of his  Civic Democratic Party (ODS), Klaus said that the state should  transfer to churches certain property which serves their mission  and goals, saying that no further "law of a restitution  character" would be adopted.    He said that work continued on a legal document dealing with  the completion of restitutions and extra-judicial  rehabilitations also referred to as "a restitution and  rehabilitation full stop." "We know well that before this  full-stop is made, questions related to the return of church  property must be solved," Klaus said. The law winding up  restitution and rehabilitations should have a preamble saying  clearly why restitution and rehabilitations were realised and  what stage they have reached, he added. The law itself would de  facto rescind all articles of the existing restitution and  rehabilitation laws (blocking privatisation), Klaus said.    Parliament chairman Milan Uhde (ODS) added that the preamble  must clearly say that "we are aware of the fact that the extent  of wrongdoings and crimes which had been committed against  property, human rights and lives is much higher than any law  could have tackled." "But this does not mean that we, as  representatives of the state, should engage in a lifetime search  for definitive and absolute justice," he added.    The restitution of church property has for long been a  question at issue between the ODS and the three other coalition  parties -- the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), the Christian  Democratic Union- Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL) and the  Christian Democratic Party (KDS) which supported broader  restitution than the ODS. But Klaus has stressed that the issue  is hampering and slowing down the process of definite settlement  of property relations in the country and the process of  privatisation.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Shixing (7559 0013 2502): "New Tax System </F> Will Further Promote Development of China's Petroleum Resources"]    [Text] In 1979 China began to cooperate with foreign  countries in the extraction of its petroleum resources, and for  more than 10 years over 50 foreign petroleum companies have come  to China to participate in the extraction of its petroleum  resources. To meet China's need for foreign cooperation in the  extraction of petroleum resources, China follows international  practice by drawing on the experience of some of the world's  petroleum-producing countries and by constantly perfecting and  enriching China's tax policy for foreign cooperation in  petroleum as well as its laws and regulations. China has  initially formed a set of regulations for foreign cooperation in  petroleum that contain clear measures, which play an important  role in attracting foreign capital and promoting the prospecting  and exploration of petroleum resources. In 1991 China completed  the reform of its income tax system for enterprises in which  foreign businessmen had invested and for foreign enterprises. At  the end of 1993 China carried out the largest reform of its tax  system since the founding of the PRC, with the focus on  reforming the circulation tax and on reforming the income tax on  domestic venture enterprises and individuals. For China's  petroleum corporations and foreign petroleum corporations, the  main point was the abolishing of the consolidated industry and  commerce tax and the changes in the collection of the value  added tax, business tax, and consumption tax.    To maintain the continuity and stability of the tax policy,  so that it is more advantageous to attracting foreign capital  and promoting the opening up to the outside world, the Fifth  Session of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee passed the  "Decision on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax,  Consumption Tax, and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which  Foreign Businessmen Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises."  On the basis of this decision the State Council issued a "Notice  on Provisional Regulations for Value Added Tax, Consumption Tax,  and Business Tax on Enterprises in Which Foreign Businessmen  Have Invested and on Foreign Enterprises." In the decision and  notice, provisions were specially made for the tax issue with  regard to Sino-foreign cooperation in the extraction of  petroleum resources, the main parts being: "The collection in  kind of the value added tax on petroleum and natural gas  extracted from Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields is at a  rate of 5 percent; and, in line with the existing stipulated  collection of the mining area use fee, the value added tax will  temporarily not be collected, and when the value added tax is  being calculated there will be no deduction on the income tax.  When crude oil or natural gas is exported, there will be no  drawback. The oil (gas) fields at sea exploited by the China  National Offshore Oil Corporation will be run in accordance with  the abovementioned stipulations."    The stipulated tax preference is mainly embodied in:    1. The industry and commerce consolidated tax on crude oil  and natural gas extracted in Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas)  fields has been changed to a value added tax, but the tax in  kind will continue to be collected. A tax in kind on crude oil  and natural gas is not exclusive to China, but rather is the  current practice of the main petroleum-producing countries of  the world. Mainly out of consideration that petroleum is a major  source of energy, the governments of petroleum-producing  countries should, through tax measures, control part of the  petroleum reserves. Now, because of the output of Sino-foreign  cooperative oil (gas) fields, the tax in kind on crude oil is  entrusted to the cooperative oil (gas) fields for selling in a  lump and putting in storage according to the actual sales value.  The principle of collection of a tax in kind is understood and  accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies.    2. After the value added tax was put into effect, its rate  on  crude oil was 17 percent and its rate on natural gas was 13  percent. In order not to increase the tax burden on Chinese and  foreign petroleum companies because of the tax system reform,  the State Council notice decided that the value added tax on  crude oil and natural gas extracted in the Sino-foreign  cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea would be at a rate  of 5 percent. This decision has three advantages for the Chinese  and foreign petroleum companies:    One advantage is that it is consistent with the principle of  China's circulation tax at the 5 percent level on petroleum  resources extracted by foreign countries. This principle has  been accepted by Chinese and foreign petroleum companies, and it  has become an important provision in the petroleum contracts  signed by the Chinese and foreign sides. The second advantage is  that, under the new tax system, when crude oil and natural gas,  on which there is a tax rate of 5 percent, is sold domestically,  because objectively the funds held by the bying side are reduced  (mainly the funds held by the buying side for income tax, the  crude oil and natural gas of the Sino-foreign cooperative oil  (gas) fields and those at sea possess a superiority in the price  aspect. The third advantage is that, because likewise there is  no drawback on the export of crude oil, the crude oil of the  Sino-foreign cooperative oil (gas) fields and those at sea only  bear 5 percent of the circulation tax, and before the crude oil  is exported it bears 17 percent of the domestic circulation tax,  the Chinese and foreign petroleumn companies possess competitive  strength in the export of crude oil.    3. Still according to the existing stipulated collection of  the mining area use fee, the natural resources tax will  temporarily not be levied. The levying of a mining area use fee  confirms to international practice, and it is accepted by  Chinese and foreign petroleum companies. China's collection of  the mining area use fee is at an above-quota graduated fee rate;  at-sea oil (gas) fields in which the annual crude oil total  output does not exceed 1 million tons and the annual natural gas  total output does not exceed 2 billion are exempt from the  mining area use fee. The main purpose of this exemption is to  encourage the development of small oil (gas) fields at sea and  to formulate special policies for them. Similarly, for a  medium-sized oilfield at sea that has an annual output of 1  million tons, if the mining area use fee is levied but  temporarily the natural resources tax is not levied, then it  possesses the advanatage that the Chinese and foreign petroleum  companies at this field will get every year a small sum of money  to help pay the 8 million-yuan tax.    Summarizing what has been said above, because in the past a  preferential tax policy was given to Chinese and foreign  petroleum companies, including the continued retention of  import-export and other preferential policies, the Chinese and  foreign petroleum companies will not, because of this reform of  the tax system, have their tax burden increased; conversely,  because the tax system reform makes China's tax system more  rational, the fact that the level of collection management is  constantly rising and the tax preferences are becoming more  marked is bound to further promote the opening of China's sea  and land petroleum resources.</p>

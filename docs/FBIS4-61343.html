			<p>BFN     [Text] There is dangerous brinkmanship in Bosnia today. In  this situation, the key world community members should take  energetic steps and exert pressure to prevent war and restore  peace there, the Russian President's Special Envoy Vitaliy  Churkin, a deputy foreign minister, declared in an interview  with Interfax on Wednesday.    In his words, pressure should be applied to both sides, the  Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Moslems. "There is a war of  nerves going on at Brcko, a confrontation that, in principle,  could result in a military clash. That is why energetic actions  and pressure are essential. What this really means is that the  sides should sign an agreement that would end hostilities,  disengage the troops, and would enable the UN to deploy its  protection force in former Yugoslavia between the two hostile  factions," Churkin said.    In his words, Russia's proposal to convene a conference on  Bosnia with Russia's foreign minister, US Secretary of State, EC  and UN representatives to take part aims at putting pressure on  the belligerents.    Asked when and where such a gathering could take place,  Churkin replied, "That may be known shortly. The issue has been  discussed by the Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his  American counterpart Warren Christopher upon their arrival in  Cairo to attend a ceremony for signing Israeli-Palestinian  accords on Gaza and Jericho."</p>

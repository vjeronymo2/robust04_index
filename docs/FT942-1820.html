			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Dawson in US restructure Dawson International, the Edinburgh-based textiles group, yesterday said it was restructuring Dawson Home Fashions, its US shower curtain and bathroom accessories business, to return it to profitability. On March 1 the company announced that, following a review of part of the US activities, it was considering the sale of DHF. However, because satisfactory terms have not been agreed, discussions with possible purchasers have ended. A provision of Pounds 12m in the group accounts for the year to March 26 1994 was sufficient, the company said, to meet potential restructuring costs and provisions. DHF's sales in the current year were ahead of budget.</p>

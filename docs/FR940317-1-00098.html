In the absence of such a request, an approval or settlement authority may on his or her own initiative reconsider the quantum of a claim. Reconsideration may occur even in a claim that was previously disapproved in whole or in part (even though a settlement agreement has been executed) when it appears that his or her original action was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the action or subsequently received. If he or she determines that the original action was incorrect, he or she will modify the action and, if appropriate, make a supplemental payment. If the original action is determined correct, the claimant will be so notified. The basis for either action will be stated in a memorandum included in the file.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) An approval or settlement authority may reconsider the applicability of this chapter to a claim upon request of the claimant or someone acting in his behalf, or on his or her own initiative. Such reconsideration may occur even though all parties had previously agreed per &sect;536.84 when it appears that this agreement was incorrect in law or fact based on the evidence of record at the time of the agreement or subsequently received. If he or she determines the agreement to be incorrect, the claim will be reprocessed under the applicable chapter of this regulation. If he or she determines the agreement to have been correct, that is, that this subpart is applicable, he or she will so advise the claimant. This advice will include reference to any appeal or judicial remedies available under the chapter which the claimant alleges the claim should be processed under.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A successor or higher approval or settlement authority may also reconsider the original action on a claim under a or b above, but only on the basis of fraud, substantial new evidence, errors in calculation, or mistake (misinterpretation) of law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) A request for reconsideration should indicate fully the legal or factual basis asserted as grounds for relief.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart F_Claims Arising From Activities of the Army National Guard <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

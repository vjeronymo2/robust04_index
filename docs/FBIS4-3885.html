			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman, April 25 (XINHUA) -- Jordan's lower house  speaker Tahir al-Masri met here today with Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC).    They discussed bilateral ties and the Middle East peace  process.    In his speech at the meeting, which was also attended by the  CPPCC delegation led by Wang and a number of Jordanian  parliamentarians, Masri stressed that Jordan will never be  content unless a just and comprehensive peace is realized in the  region and the rights of the Arab and Palestinian people are  guaranteed.    He also expressed regret over the fact that Israel and the  U.S. -- one of the two sponsors of the Middle East peace process  -- have not made enough efforts to realize a durable peace in  the region.    The speaker said that Jordan will do its utmost to safeguard  Arab rights.    On the democratization process, Masri said that Jordan has  embarked on a democratic process, which includes all aspects  although it is not perfect. "Jordan will not copy Western  democracy, but will introduce one which suits its own tradition  and culture," he noted.    Masri complained that although the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait  ended long ago, sanctions against Iraq have been increasing with  one UN resolution following another. Despite all this, Masri  said, Iraq has accepted all of the demands raised with it,  including some which are harmful to it.    As a result of the sanctions against Iraq, Jordan's only  port  of Aqaba has been blocked by U.S.-led Western naval forces,  inflicting heavy losses on the kingdom, he said.    The speaker appealed to China as well as other countries to  make efforts for lifting the blockade. He asked Wang to convey  the request of Jordan's lower house to China's National People's  Congress and the CPPCC.    In his speech, Wang briefed the hosts on the enormous  achievements China has made in the reform and economic boom in  the past 15 years.    On the Middle East issue, Wang said that China has  consistently supported the just cause of the Palestinian people  and appreciated highly Jordan's endeavor to realize a just and  durable peace in the region.    As one of the five UN Security Council permanent members,  Wang noted, China will continue to make unswerving efforts to  push forward the ongoing Middle East peace process.    Wang expressed profound sympathy with Jordan for its heavy  losses resulted from the Aqaba blockade. He said China supports  Jordan's fair and rational demands and hopes the blockade will  be lifted as early as possible.    On the Iraqi issue, Wang said China has made clear its stand  in the discussions at the UN Security Council. He expressed  sympathy with the Iraqi people who have suffered dearly as a  result of the international sanctions imposed on the country.    Wang, who arrived here Sunday [24 April] heading a 10-member  CPPCC delegation, has met with Jordan's upper house speaker  Ahmad al-Lawzi [spelling of name as received] and Prime Minister  'Abd- al-Salam al-Majali. He will also meet with Jordan's  Minister of Planning Ziyad Fariz and visit a tourist attraction  in Jerash, 44 kilometers north of Amman.</p>

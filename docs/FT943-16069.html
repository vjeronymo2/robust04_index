			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: British Rail Yesterday's figures from British Rail are something of a curiosity. This year's results will be transformed as BR starts to pay Railtrack service charges in place of its own direct costs. But whichever way the cake is cut, the Pounds 350m gulf between operating costs and revenue will have to be narrowed if privatisation is to be a success. While the 7 per cent reduction in costs last year points the way ahead, today's strike is a reminder of the countervailing pressures. Of course, it is possible that savings matching those in other privatised industries can be achieved. But to revive the railways, franchise operators will also have to do better at drumming-up business than BR's current management. The average fare per mile increased 6.5 per cent last year, yet passenger revenue rose by less than 3 per cent. Passenger miles have now fallen 10 per cent over the last five years. Although recession played its part, rail shows no sign of reversing its long-term decline in market share. BR's response has been to raise prices on peak commuter services, where it believes it has a captive audience, and use promotional activity to fill off-peak trains. Given the mixed results of that pricing strategy, the time may have come for some Branson-style innovation.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Blenheim knocked by French downturn Blenheim Group, the exhibitions organiser whose shares have almost halved over the past year, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 45.2m for 1993 after a sharp downturn in its important French business. In the preceding 16 month period to December 1992 it reported profits of Pounds 49.7m. Mr Neville Buch, chairman, said: 'Despite difficult conditions Blenheim has delivered a creditable performance.' Blenheim's shares fell heavily last summer after a Pounds 76m convertible preference share issue in June was followed by downgraded forecasts. The French recession hit Blenheim in the second half with space at its annual shows in France down by 10 per cent and another decline expected this year. Across the group revenues from the existing annual shows rose 4.4 per cent with operating margins rising to 25 per cent on turnover of Pounds 198.7m. However Mr Buch warned: 'Exhibitions are late cycle with space sales responding some 15 to 18 months later than the general economic cycle.' The current year will also be affected by the absence of Batimat, its large biennial exhibition in France, which contributes an estimated 15 per cent of group profit. Earnings per share reached 29.4p in 1993 against 32.4p in the preceding 16 months, including Batimat, or a pro forma 20.1p, without Batimat. A final dividend of 6.85p (3p) gives a total of 10.25p up from pro forma 9p for 1992. Blenheim ended the year with net debt of Pounds 26m including the convertible loan stock and negative shareholders' funds of Pounds 83.9m. The 1993 interest bill of Pounds 5m was covered ten times by operating profit. COMMENT Mr Staffan Svenby, who moved up to managing director in November, has already started to bite into Blenheim's 1980s-style cost base. The programme for new exhibition launches has been halved, some existing shows will be axed and the 800-strong workforce slimmed. But exhibition profits remain highly sensitive to economic cycles - UK profits are now half their peak - and there is nothing Mr Svenby can do about the French economy. Given the long lead time for Batimat, next year's profits will be determined by French business confidence in the next few months and any sign of a double-dip recession will have analysts scurrying to downgrade their forecasts. That explains why the shares, down 5p at 343p, are trading on only 13 times next year's predicted earnings.</p>

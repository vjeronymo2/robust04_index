			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Tec protest about government red tape GOVERNMENT bureaucracy is undermining the ability of senior employers to inject their business skills into the employer-led network of Training and Enterprise Councils, according to an internal report by G10, the group of Tec chairmen who act as a mouthpiece of Tecs with the government. The report summarises the canvassed views of all Tecs on the effects of the 1990-91 budget settlement and priorities in the next white paper on public expenditure. When their government funding was cut last year, Tecs were given greater flexibility in how they spent their budgets. One disquieting finding was that Tecs felt that benefits arising from flexibilities were being eclipsed by the 'ever-increasing bureaucratic burden' falling on them. That was seen to be in direct conflict with the secretary of state's stated objective of vesting the nation's training and enterprise system in private-sector leadership. The report said that Tec boards - which are mainly composed of senior executives from the private sector - had interpreted the government's aim as an invitation to 'use their well-tried business skills' in an attempt to generate a greater return than the public-sector approach had so far been able to deliver. 'In reality, they are finding it increasingly difficult to exert such leadership as they sink into a quicksand of bureaucracy,' the report said. Tec directors 'are in no doubt that if they have to operate in a public-sector system they will do so less effectively than those who practised in it, and the government will have the worst of both worlds.' So far as the issue of funding is concerned, the report said that Tecs believed that a return to the funding levels of 1989-90, adjusted for inflation, was necessary if Tecs were going to make any significant impact. Rising unemployment was causing Tec boards to have doubts as to whether they could satisfy government guarantees of training to the unemployed. There were indications in some areas that employers were reneging on agreements to contribute towards the cost of training unemployed people. That may put increased pressure on Tec funds, the report concludes. In evidence to the House of Commons select committee on employment, Mr Eric Dancer, G10 chairman, called for an acceleration in attempts to reduce bureaucracy. Mr Dancer, chairman of Devon and Cornwall Tec, also called for a minimum three-year operational contract between the government and Tecs to replace one-year arrangements. The annual recontracting process was too lengthy and too complicated and handicapped strategic decisions and investments.</p>

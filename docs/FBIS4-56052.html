			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jergus Ferko: "How the Secret Pact Between </F> Moravcik's and Duray's Coalition Is Being Implemented; No to  Alternative Education -- Yes to School Autonomy?"]    [Excerpts] We have already written about the coalition's  political dependence on ethnic Hungarian parties. Even though  government representatives claim that there is no secret  agreement, facts prove the exact opposite. We have ascertained  that the eight- point catalogue of Hungarian politicians'  demands was the subject of Coalition Council talks  and has been discussed at other important forums as well. The  third point of the secret pact between Moravcik's and Duray's  coalition reads: "To halt the organizing of alternative  education in areas inhabited by Hungarians."    Let us recall: Alternative education (and not alternative  schools as certain gentlemen imprecisely write) is quite normal  in areas with mixed populations in the advanced world. Under  this method, children learn not only their mother tongue but, at  the same time, they also master the state language perfectly  (see, for instance, the bright example of South Tyrol). Under  this policy, some subjects are taught in the mother tongue and  some in the state language. The parents decide what is best for  their children. In Slovakia, however, the national minority  politicians know better than the parents. [passage omitted]    On Wednesday [18 May], Minister of Education Lubomir Harach  recalled Lydia Bencova from the post of director of the  Department for Ethnic Education, without giving any reasons. Is  it possible that the true reason was the dissatisfaction of the  minister's "voluntary" advisers with Lydia Bencova because she  had enforced the project of alternative education? The fact is  that [ethnic Hungarian] deputies V. Bugar, J. Fothy, and A.  Duka-Zolyomi are all very frequent guests at this ministry.  [passage omitted]    In addition to the evidently functioning secret pact between  Moravcik's and Duray's coalition, one can also discover at the  Ministry of Education the phantom of proletarian  internationalism. Virtually all the leading figures of this  government department are distinguished by their "more than  pink" political past (we may still return to this issue in  greater detail in SLOVENSKA REPUBLIKA). Evidently the phantom of  educational autonomy is also present there, which -- as is known  -- represents one of the strategic goals of Hungarian policy in  Slovakia. [passage omitted] After all, it is necessary to also  fulfill the other points of the pact with Hungarian parties.  For example, its point six reads: "To set up minority  departments at the Ministries of Education and Culture, within  the framework of which there will be separate Hungarian  sections...." Educational autonomy is thus beginning to acquire  realistic features. Otherwise, the Hungarians, who hold the  balance of power, might withhold their support, as Miklos Duray  let himself be heard. Whether the Hungarian minority and, more  specifically, Hungarian children, will derive any benefit from  this is, apparently, an altogether different question. It is a  question, for example, also for the president, who should not  keep quiet when the state interests of Slovakia are threatened.</p>

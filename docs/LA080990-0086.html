			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIOLENT WEEKEND LEADS TO 1 DEATH, 3 ARRESTS;  </P> <P> CRIME: RIVAL GANGS ARE LINKED TO 2 DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS. POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING  3 OTHER INCIDENTS TO SEE IF THEY ARE RELATED.  </P> <P> A 19-year-old Atwater man was killed and three suspects were arrested during a  weekend of gang violence that included five drive-by shootings, police said.  </P> <P> Two of the drive-by shootings took place within a block of each other -- near  Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road -- and involved the same two rival gangs, said  Detective James McCann of the Los Angeles Police Department. Police are  investigating the other three incidents to see whether they are related, he  said.  </P> <P> The violence began Friday evening when four members of one gang drove by a  house at 2706 1/2 W. Avenue 34 and opened fire, McCann said. Several rival gang  members inside the house were armed and returned the fire, he said.  </P> <P> During the shoot-out, 19-year-old Anthony Marquez, who was sitting in the  passenger seat of the car, was fatally shot, McCann said. The other youths in  the car drove to his home in the 2900 block of Glenhurst Avenue and left  Marquez in the car in the driveway, telling his mother that Marquez needed  medical help, McCann said.  </P> <P> Marquez died several minutes later, McCann said.  </P> <P> A 17-year-old youth who police say belonged to Marquez's gang has been accused  of murder in Marquez's death. Police held the youth accountable under a  "precarious liability" statute, alleging that Marquez was killed during the  commission of a felony that the youth helped to plan and execute, McCann said.  </P> <P> The youth, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile, is being held in  Eastlake Juvenile Hall and was scheduled to be arraigned this week. He faces  charges of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit assault  with a deadly weapon and firing into an inhabited dwelling, McCann said.  </P> <P> On Monday afternoon, about six youths who police say were members of Marquez's  gang were standing in front of a market at Avenue 34 and Verdugo Road when  several youths from a rival gang drove by in a pickup truck and fired on them,  McCann said. Witnesses told police that four of the six youths on foot were  armed and fired back, he said.  </P> <P> The youths ran into a nearby lot, stashed their weapons in some refuse, then  forced their way into a woman's home at 3322 Verdugo Road and hid inside,  McCann said.  </P> <P> Witnesses told police that they saw a youth with a gunshot wound to his stomach  running away and clutching a gun, McCann said, but police so far have been  unable to confirm the injury.  </P> <P> When police arrived at the woman's house, they were able to get her and her  children out, McCann said, but the youths refused to emerge until about an hour  later when a police SWAT team threatened to enter.  </P> <P> Police questioned 10 youths from the two gangs and arrested two of the six who  had hidden inside the house, McCann said.  </P> <P> Max Figueroa, 21, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a weapon in violation  of his parole, McCann said. A 15-year-old, whose name was withheld because he  is a juvenile, was arrested on suspicion of discharging a firearm in a  negligent manner, carrying a concealed weapon and receiving stolen property,  McCann said.  </P> <P> In another drive-by shooting on Saturday, 20-year-old Johnny Rivera was shot at  a bus stop, McCann said.  </P> <P> Rivera was standing with three friends in front of a 7-Eleven store at Avenue  51 and Figueroa Street about 2:30 a.m. Saturday when several youths drove by in  a black car and fired one shot out the window, witnesses told police. Rivera  ran one block and collapsed where police found him, McCann said.  </P> <P> Rivera was taken to County-USC General Hospital, where he was reported in  stable condition Wednesday.  </P> <P> Police also are investigating two drive-by shootings that took place late  Monday night within a block of Monday afternoon's street shoot-out, McCann  said. No injuries were reported in those incidents, he said.  </P></p>

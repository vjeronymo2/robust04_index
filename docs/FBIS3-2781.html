			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 13 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President  Jiang Zemin told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher here today that better Sino-U.S. relations not only  accord with the common desire of the Chinese and American  peoples but meet the need of world peace and stability.    Jiang made the statement in a 70-minute meeting with Warren  Christopher who is in the third day of his China visit.    Jiang noted that during the past 45 years, the Sino-U.S.  relations have experienced many twists and turns, with both  positive and negative experience to be drawn from.    Practice shows that the Sino-U.S. relations can move forward  so long as both sides view things from a world-wide perspective,  proceed from the fundamental interests of the two peoples,  respect each other, transcend their differences in ideology and  expand cooperation. This will bring benefit to the two peoples  and is favorable to world peace and stability as well.    Otherwise, the bilateral ties will meet with difficulties  and  even suffer setbacks, he said. "We should all bear in mind the  lessons in history."    Recalling his meeting with U.S. President Clinton in Seattle  last November, Jiang said he had told Clinton that the Sino-U.S.  ties is not only a matter of bilateral relations. It should be  viewed in a world-wide perspective and in the context of the  approaching 21st century.    China and the U.S. have common interests on many important  issues, Jiang continued, stressing that the two sides should  increase trust, reduce troubles, expand cooperation and avoid  confrontation.    "President Clinton shared my views. We all agreed that the  Sino-U.S. relations should be handled with a long-term point of  view and considered in a broader perspective. The differences  should be resolved through dialogue and one side should not  impose its views onto the other," Jiang said.    He held that due to different social systems and ideologies,  it is natural that China and the U.S. have differences on some  issues, which should not become obstacles to the expansion of  mutually beneficial cooperation.    As both China and the U.S. are sovereign states, they can  discuss their differences on the basis of equality and mutual  respect, and no one should interfere in the other's internal  affairs, he said.    Concerning the issue of human rights, Jiang pointed out,  "some people in the west are concerned not with the interests  and welfare of the broad masses of the Chinese people but only a  small number of people who attempt to subvert the Chinese  Government and undermine China's stability. This in essence is  not an issue of human rights but a political and legal issue.    The government of every country is bestowed with the  responsibility and obligation of upholding law and order and  maintaining political stability. It is groundless for some  people to accuse the Chinese Government in this regard," Jiang  stressed.    Christopher conveyed President Clinton's regards to  President  Jiang, saying that Clinton is determined to build a broader and  more constructive relations between the U.S. and China.    The two sides should seize the opportunity and take positive  actions to push forward the bilateral ties, said Christopher.    He also briefed Jiang on the U.S. views on human rights, the  most favored nation status, proliferation of weapons and other  issues.    Jiang asked Christopher to convey his good wishes to  President Clinton at the end of the meeting which proceeded in a  "frank and candid atmosphere," according to a Chinese official.    Among those present at the meeting were Chinese Vice-Premier  and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, U.S. Ambassador to China  Stapleton Roy and senior U.S. officials accompanying Christopher  on the visit.</p>

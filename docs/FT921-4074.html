			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Government confirms cuts by employers in training budgets BRITISH employers began to cut training as early as last spring, according to Department of Employment figures published yesterday, Michael Smith writes. The department's annual labour force survey is the first official confirmation that training budgets have been cut during the recession. The survey's findings are likely to embarrass the government in the run-up to the election. Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, accused the government of publishing the figures on Budget day to reduce their impact. The survey figures come when the number of employment and training programmes run by the government has been declining. They will heighten fears that employers may face problems in plugging skills gaps when the recession ends. The government has previously maintained that employers have heeded its exhortations to maintain training budgets. Most independent surveys have supported this assertion, and the Confederation of British Industry has suggested that employers' commitment to training has increased. The survey also charts a 4 per cent decline in the numbers of self-employed in the year to last spring. It also estimates unemployment at 2.3m in the spring last year. The survey estimate for unemployment is based on a definition by the International Labour Organisation. It includes people looking for work as well as those receiving unemployment benefit. The 2.3m jobless total compares with 2.1m registered unemployed at the time  -the government's monthly unemployment figures include only those claiming benefit. The survey shows that the number of employees receiving job-related training in the four weeks prior to the survey was 3.2m in spring 1991, against 3.3m a year earlier - the first decline since 1984. Employers agree that cuts in company training budgets during the previous recession were a significant factor behind the skills shortages of the late 1980s. The survey also shows that the number of people on government employment and training schemes declined by 41,000 to 408,000 in the year to last spring. The decline since 1988 is 112,000. Other findings include: Some 27.9m people were economically active last spring, a fall of 100,000 on the previous year. Of those, 25.6m were in employment, a fall of 600,000 or 2 per cent on the previous year, but a rise of 2.2m since spring 1984. People on government employment and training schemes accounted for 2 per cent of all those in employment. Last spring there were 400,000, or 2 per cent, fewer employees, and 200,000 fewer self-employed, down 4 per cent. However, the number of employees and self-employed increased by 7 per cent and 27 per cent respectively between 1984 and last year. The number of people in non-manual occupations fell by 1 per cent against a 3 per cent decrease in manual occupations. The number of people in trades unions or staff associations fell from 8.79m to 8.54m. The survey is based on interviews with members of about 60,000 private households, conducted between March and May last year.</p>

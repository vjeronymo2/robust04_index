"South Africa is  entering into a period of political crisis never yet before  experienced, and it is doing so with no effective ruling  political party, and with Parliament being side-lined into  irrelevancy," he said in a statement on Wednesday evening.    "We are perhaps rapidly approaching a situation in which the  Machiavellian dictum that `might is right' is going to dominate  over the causes of political fair play and justice itself.    "It is critically important that the social pathology in our  abnormal society be arrested forthwith, and that the  transitionary mechanisms and the transitionary processes  launched by the World Trade Centre negotiations not be allowed  to destroy this country in the name of the search for democracy  and justice."    The kwaZulu chief minister earlier on Wednesday said he was  not aware of kwaZulu police hit-squads in Natal/kwaZulu, and  described claims to this effect as "hideous propaganda".  Addressing a press conference in Ulundi, he said he was  surprised at the claim in a report submitted to the Transitional  Executive Council on Tuesday.    "If there have been hit squads, they have not been run by  myself or set up at my suggestion.    "I would like to have evidence of that because I think it is  just hideous propaganda that is being mounted deliberately," Mr  Buthelezi said.    In his statement later on Wednesday, he said he would seek  legal advice "on what recourse I have got through the courts to  defend my intergrity and to clear my name". He was reacting to  reports he had been personally implicated in violence.    On Tuesday the TEC disclosed that a task group investigating  hit squads in natal had said there appeared to be evidence  linking killer groups to Mr Buthelezi's office.    An interim report submitted by the task group accused staff  in Mr Buthelezi's office of distributing automatic weapons to  certain tribal chiefs.    Disclosures about the hit squad prompted the TEC management  committee to pass a resolution mandating it to take whatever  steps necessary to ensure free and fair elections in Natal. It  was suggested the kwaZulu Police be brought under the  jurisdiction of the South African Police.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Paul Brown: "Diesel `Poses Threat" to Health"] </F>   [Text] The Government has been formally warned by its  health and environment advisers to halt the rise in diesel fumes.    Increasing sales--more than one in four cars are now  diesel--point to the likelihood of taxation being used to cut  demand.    The Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants told  the Government to arrest or reverse the rising trend in diesel  because of evidence linking it to asthma, cancer and other  diseases.    In January, a report highlighted international evidence that  diesel can cause health problems.    But one of the problems for scientists is that other fumes,  especially those from petrol engines, are also implicated in  health studies.    Professor Anthony Newman Taylor, from the Brompton Hospital  in London, said the rise in road traffic had coincided with a  rise in asthma. But this did not mean the two were related, he  added.    A third issue being researched is the issue of pollution in  the home. Oxides of nitrogen from unventilated gas cookers are  far higher inside homes than outside and researchers are  investigating to see whether this has any effect on health.    The Government is collating all its research in the Medical  Research Council's Institute for Environment and Health, based  at the University of Leicester.    Yesterday scientists from the departments of health and  environment said urgent work was required on possible links  between air pollution and increasing respiratory illness. About  2,000 people a year die as a result of asthma.    Guardian Newspapers Limited, May 12, 1994</p>

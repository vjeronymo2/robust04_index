			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Treasury to get Pounds 960m from sale of British Coal's assets The government is to receive nearly Pounds 960m from the sale of British Coal's mining assets, it emerged yesterday as details were announced of the sale of the south Wales region. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said the government had agreed that Celtic Energy, a management buy-out team, would acquire British Coal's south Wales coal company for Pounds 94.5m. He announced several weeks ago that RJB Mining was paying Pounds 815m for the English regions and Mining (Scotland) Pounds 39.4m for the Scottish region plus Pounds 10m for stocks. The Pounds 958.9m total is considerably more than analysts expected when the government invited bids for the regions earlier this year - most estimates were about Pounds 500m. Some believe the successful bidders may have offered too much and risk running into financial difficulties. Mr Eggar said Celtic would pay Pounds 88.4m on completion of the south Wales deal. Of the balance, Pounds 4.9m would be payable with interest in instalments over the three following years. Final payment of Pounds 1.2m is expected in two instalments, with interest, in 1999 and 2000. He said the bid price had been adjusted to reflect developments since tenders were submitted in September or information that was not available at the time. Celtic's bid price following these adjustments still 'represents best value for money'. British Coal yesterday signed an agreement to sell its 67 per cent interest in Inter-Continental Fuels, a coal trading company, to RTZ and Coal Investments. It is also selling its 50 per cent stake in IMC Holdings, which provides consultancy and engineering services to energy and mineral companies, to ICF.</p>

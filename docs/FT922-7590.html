			<p>920518 FT  18 MAY 92 / Reliance raises Dollars 100m in Euromarkets RELIANCE, the petrochemical group controlled by the Ambani family, has become the first Indian private sector corporation to raise equity capital on the Euromarkets. The group confirmed yesterday that it had launched its Dollars 100m (Pounds 56m) issue to help finance a gas cracker three weeks ago and that the offer would close at the end of this week. Bankers involved in the issue claimed that Dollars 400m had so far been subscribed. The disclosure caused surprise because last week - with the share price under pressure in Bombay in the wake of the nation's worst financial scandal  -the group had said that it was planning to launch its issue towards the end of June. The authorised issue is in a range equivalent to Rs250-280 (Pounds 4.90-Pounds 5.50) a share - based on an anticipated price-earnings ratio in March 1993. On the Bombay stock market, Reliance's price recovered to Rs296 on Thursday after dropping to Rs270 on May 12.</p>

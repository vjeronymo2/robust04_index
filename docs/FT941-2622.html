			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Allied tumbles Shock news that Allied Leisure had made heavy interim losses, passed its dividend and lost its chief executive had a predictably shattering effect on the shares. At the day's worst they had slumped 53 per cent, before firming slightly to close a net 16 off at 27p. As well as posting interim losses of Pounds 16.12m, the group also took a Pounds 14.23m restructuring charge. It was announced after the market had closed that the resigning chief executive Mr Richard Carr had sold 1.5m shares. The decline in Allied's two main areas of business, ten-pin bowling and nightclubs, gave rise to worries over First Leisure, although analysts were quick to point out that while sharing the same markets the company differed in management and style. First Leisure slid 15 before recovering to end 8 off at 313p. A rumour early in the session that the George Michael versus Sony case had been settled out of court - later denied by all parties concerned - unsettled music and rental group Thorn EMI. The shares retreated 22 to 1122p. Hotel concern Forte continued strong with sentiment again underpinned by its potential purchase of a French hotel chain, stronger links with the Savoy Group and an improving UK hotel market. The shares added 3 to 260p. Savoy 'A' gained 35 to 1115p. Continued crude price weakness and the forthcoming OPEC meeting kept the pressure on oil stocks, although Enterprise - down 2 to 411p - and BP - off 1 1/2 at 367 1/2 - were resilient. A successful drilling report lifted Exploration Company of Louisiana 13 to 79p, while Goal Petroleum rose 2 to 67p after boosting its year-end dividend from 1.4p to 1.45p. Ms Irene Himona at SGST said: 'I think people are treating the oil price as a temporary aberration which will recover.' Lasmo, expected to report reduced losses next Wednesday, fell 2 to 130p. Standard Chartered rose 22 to 1160p. Swiss Bank is said to have been a keen buyer over the past few days and other brokers have focused on the forthcoming share split which is expected to attract further support. The bank, which is heavily exposed to the Hong Kong market, rose in spite of a 380-point fall in the Hang Seng index, which helped drive HSBC down 37 to 787p and Cable &amp; Wireless 11 to 441p. Barclays held up well, with the market regarding it as a strong recovery stock. The shares fell a penny to 552p. SG Warburg fell 19 to 765, hit by the weakness in bond prices and some profit-taking. A profits warning from double-glazing group Anglian for the year to April pushed the shares down 28 to 287p. Mr Malcolm Brown at agency broker James Capel downgraded his profit forecast by Pounds 1m to Pounds 25.5m. However, Caradon, the second biggest player in the area held steady at 396p. Milk group Unigate was lifted by a buy recommendation from SG Warburg. With the shares currently yielding some 6 per cent, the broker said the stock looked attractive for income funds, The shares bounced 7 to 360p. Unilever was said to be undone by a large line of unplaced stock, the shares trailing 23 to 1058p. McCarthy &amp; Stone put on a penny at 73p after announcing a Pounds 5.5m rights issue. RMC improved 10 to 980p on thin trading: a handful of buyers found the market short. Amersham International added 29 at 1090p. There was vague talk of a share split but it transpired that the price was squeezed up because dealers were short of stock. Mirror Group Newspapers added a penny at 194p as the Monopolies and Mergers Commission gave the go-ahead for the joint takeover of the Independent newspaper. Public relations group Shandwick rose 3 1/2 p to 59 1/2 p, in spite of asking shareholders for Pounds 18.9m via a one-for-two rights issue. SG Warburg believes that while the ex-rights price of the stock is 54.5p, the shares deserve a market rating which would put them 10p higher. Engineering group Lucas Industries closed 4 ahead at 219p, after announcing that Mr George Simpson, formerly chairman of Rover, was to begin his new role as chief executive at the begining of April, a month earlier than anticipated. The group reports interim figures on Monday, and a broker's recommendation boosted the stock earlier this week. Machinery group Molins gained 9 to 558p, after reporting an increase in profits and an improved dividend. Profits improved by Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 49.7m and the dividend was raised by 1.4p to 15.4p. Motor dealer Lex Service ran into profit-takers and the shares eased 4 to 535p. Bargain hunters helped engineering and aerospace company TI resist the poor market trend.

The shares relinquished 7 1/2 to 241p. Eastern Electricity held steady with a slide of 2 to 630p.

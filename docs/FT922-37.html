			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / ANC demands de Klerk stand down THE African National Congress yesterday demanded the resignation of South African president FW de Klerk, saying he had lost control of the police and failed to prevent massacres of blacks, writes Philip Gawith in Johannesburg. A series of attacks on Mr de Klerk came at the mass funeral for the victims of the recent Boipatong massacre. Amid growing anger, a succession of politicians, including members of the ANC's radical rivals, the Pan Africanist Congress and Azapo, found common cause. Joined at the funeral by Mr Jay Naidoo, leader of the country's largest union, they made clear their determination to force Mr de Klerk to concede majority rule by strikes, demonstrations and civil disobedience.</p>

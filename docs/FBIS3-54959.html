			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Aleksandr Galkin and Sergey Vikulin; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Excerpts] [Galkin over video of MiG assembly hall] This  is the Moscow Aviation Production Association named for  Dementyev. It is marking its centennial today. It all began  with the "Duks" bicycle. [passage omitted]    Later the "Duks" plant became the "Znamya Truda," working  exclusively for military aviation during the past decades and  achieving unique productivity and quality.    However, perestroyka, together with a wrongly understood  theory of conversion, almost made the plant lose its aviation  specialization. Strange as it may seem, this giant plant was  saved by the "Aviatika" light biplane, which is being assembled  in the same premises as the awesome MiG-29. [passage omitted]    It has to be admitted that the Russian Government has not  ordered a single aircraft yet. However, it seems that abroad  demand for our aircraft equipment is growing. Although this  path has its problems too.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Growth in investment trusts helps EFM double to Pounds 9.78m A record year for the fund management industry is reflected in good results from Edinburgh Fund Managers, which more than doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 4.75m to Pounds 9.78m for the year ending January 31 1994. A final dividend of 16p was proposed, bringing the total to 22p, an increase of 63 per cent on last year's 13.5p. Earnings per share more than doubled to 37.2p against 16.7p, restated from 18.1p to comply with FRS 3. Turnover grew by 67 per cent, from Pounds 11.1m to Pounds 18.5m, while funds under management expanded from Pounds 2.39bn to Pounds 4.01bn. The increased turnover included new fee income from the acquisition of Target Trust Managers from the TSB, and the takeover by EFM Dragon of the Drayton Asia investment trust. A total of Pounds 590m of net new funds were received during the year, including Pounds 48m from the launch of the EFM Small Companies Trust in August. Investment trusts continue to make the largest proportion of EFM's funds under management, at Pounds 1.74m (43 per cent) against Pounds 1.05m (44 per cent). Discretionary funds accounted for 31 per cent, unit trusts 16 per cent, and private client funds 10 per cent. 'Investment trusts are traditionally a Scottish product and it is very pleasing to see their continued return to favour, particularly among private investors,' said Mr Ross. The group has launched two new investment trusts, focusing on east Asia and Latin America, since the start of this year.</p>

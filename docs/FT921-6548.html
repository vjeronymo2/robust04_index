			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Company News: UAL may take stake in French airline UNITED AIRLINES of the US is understood to have had talks on taking a minority stake in Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT), the French regional airline opening 10 new routes in Europe over the next few months. It is thought to be the only one of the top three US carriers to have done so. UAL joins British Airways in looking at a stake of up to 20 per cent in TAT. Senior executives at TAT have indicated they are in preliminary talks with up to four other carriers, but not American Airlines or Delta Airlines. TAT also announced it was starting all-business class routes in Europe using Paris as a hub. Services include Paris-Milan, from March 9, and Paris-London, from March 30. It is looking for a strong international partner following the disposal last year by Air France, the French national airline, of its 35 per cent stake. Mr Michel Marchais, founder of TAT, said he was prepared to sell 20 per cent of his family's 72 per cent controlling interest to another airline.</p>

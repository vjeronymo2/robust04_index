			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> 1 KILLED, 2 HURT AS CAR VEERS, FLIPS AND CRASHES  </P> <P> A woman was killed and two family members, including her 11-year-old grandson,  were severely injured when their car veered out of control on the San Diego  Freeway, became airborne, flipped over and crashed into a tree.  </P> <P> The accident shut down a section of the freeway for 2 hours. Special heavy  rescue equipment and nearly two dozen firefighters were needed to free the  survivors.  </P> <P> "Investigators said they all would have been fatally injured if they all hadn't  been wearing seat belts," California Highway Patrol Officer Leslie Lazo said.  </P> <P> She said the accident occurred about 11:15 a.m. as the driver, Huyn Sook Cho,  30, of Los Angeles, was southbound on the San Diego Freeway, approaching the  transition to the eastbound Garden Grove Freeway.  </P> <P> Cho, driving a 1988 Hyundai at about 70 m.p.h., tried to change lanes to the  left but saw a vehicle approaching, so she swerved back to her right. The sharp  movement made the vehicle fishtail, Cho lost control and her car veered to the  right, Lazo said.  </P> <P> The car struck a curb and became airborne for about 80 feet, flipping on its  side, she said. The top of the car hit a tree down an embankment and came to  rest on its right side.  </P> <P> The passenger in the right front seat was killed, Lazo said. A coroner's  official identified the woman as Yon-Ok Cho, 65, of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The driver and her 11-year-old son, David Hwang, who was sitting in the left  rear seat, were rushed to UCI Medical Center after they were cut out of the  wreckage.  </P> <P> The boy is in critical condition, the mother in guarded condition.  </P></p>

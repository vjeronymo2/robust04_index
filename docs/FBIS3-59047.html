The campaign, named Action Japan, will focus on trade with  Japan in nine specific industrial areas, Warren told a press  conference at the embassy.    The areas are auto parts, electronic devices, construction,  health care, fashion, textiles, food, environmental and marine  equipment and projects in third world countries, Warren said.    Warren said British exporters should increase their efforts  to successfully enter Japanese markets, which he termed  "strategically the most important" for British firms operating  in Asia.    He said he does not observe "significantly big institutional  problems" in Japan that may hamper the smooth entry of British  firms.    The campaign will replace the Priority Japan Program that  began in 1991 and will expire in March this year, which called  for raising annual British exports to Japan to 5 billion pounds  (7.58 billion dollars).    Such exports totaled about 2.5 billion pounds in 1993,  Warren  said, noting more efforts are necessary both in governmental and  private-sector levels.</p>

[Rifkind] I do not accept the premise of your question. We  announced last August, the NATO Council said last August, that  in certain circumstances, particularly in order to ensure that  aid got through, it might be necessary to contemplate air  strikes. We have the particular problem at the moment in  Srebrenica where a Canadian unit is due to be replaced by a unit  of another country -- that is being prevented, it is right and  proper that we should take action if necessary to achieve that.    [Paxman] But why should Radovan Karadzic take it any more  serious this time than experience has shown he should take it in  the past?    [Rifkind] On the contrary, I think after the announcement by  NATO last August about the possibility of much tougher action if  steps were not taken immediately by the Serbs and other parties  to stop unacceptable behavior, the situation improved.    [Paxman] But it is the case isn't it that any individual  country within NATO would have a right of veto on any bombing  mission?    [Rifkind] I think what you want to see is two things. First  of all there has to be a request from the United Nations itself.  Now NATO -- the countries of NATO -- have agreed that if we are  requested by the United Nations, if it falls within the mandate  that has been laid down, then it is right and proper that we  should respond, particularly if it is the only way of getting  aid through in the circumstances that have been outlined.    [Paxman] A particular concern is expressed by the Canadians  who have troops as you say in Srebrenica, and they are  distinctly lukewarm as far as one can see about the idea of  bombing, because it is their troops that are at risk.    [Rifkind] Well, clearly we would have to take into account  the nature of the situation, and if the people whom we trying to  help were people, who for very understandable reasons, were  unattracted by that particular solution then obviously their  views would carry great weight. We are not talking about  veto's, we are talking about common sense.    [Paxman] Now, for the last few weeks, we have had both  British and French Government's making no more than exploratory  noises about the fact that we cannot keep troops in Bosnia  indefinitely. Now you are talking about possible military  operations in the air. Is the bombing campaign some sort of  prelude to withdrawal?    [Rifkind] We have made it abundantly clear we have every  intention of continuing throughout this winter. It is  absolutely important that we do all within our power to try and  ensure that tens of thousands of people do not starve over the  next few weeks, over the next two or three months.</p>

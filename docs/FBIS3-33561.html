			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National </F> Liberation Army, on talks with the Mexican Government, in San  Cristobal de las Casas on 24 February; from the "24 Hours"  newscast -- recorded]    [Text] I speak on behalf of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN] to inform the people of Mexico, the  people and the governments of the world, and the national and  foreign media about the results of today's meeting with National  Mediation Commissioner Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia and Manuel  Camacho Solis, national commissioner for peace and  reconciliation in Chiapas.    We have resolved 50 percent of the listed demands. We have  already received a satisfactory response to the following points  included on the list of demands presented by the Indian  Revolutionary Clandestine Committee -- General Command of the  EZLN.    One of these points calls for the electrification of the  Indian communities and the redistribution of federal investments  in the State of Chiapas. Another point deals with the impact of  the free trade agreement on the Indian communities. Another  point has to do with health, truthful information -- as we  reported yesterday -- housing, education -- which involves the  construction of schools, school equipment, and the availability  of teachers -- obligatory and official bilingual education in  the Indian communities, respect for Indian traditions and  culture, punishment for anyone discriminating or showing  contempt for the Indians, the food problem, economic support for  the victims of the war and for the widows and orphans of the  conflict, the demands of the women on what should be done so  that the Indians may live in peace, the multiplication and  strengthening of nongovernment human rights organizations, the  need to form -- at the adequate moment -- a national peace  commission with justice and honor that will be in charge of  following up on the agreements reached during these  negotiations, and the channeling of humanitarian aid to the  conflict zone through the authentic representatives of the  Indian communities. This is the last point on which we agreed.    These are the agreements we have reached so far. I repeat:  Fifty percent of the demands presented by the committee have  been satisfactorily met by the commissioner.</p>

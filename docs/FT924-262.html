			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / International Company News: Bank of Spain's governor backs Banco de Santander THE Bank of Spain has rallied to the support of Banco de Santander, which was yesterday forced to guarantee an Pta8bn (Dollars 70.7m) bond as surety against possible fraud charges. Mr Miguel Moreiras, the Madrid monetary court judge, ruled before Christmas that there was 'clear evidence of criminality' in Santander's use, between 1986 and 1989, of an alleged tax avoidance instrument called loan assignments. The ruling stunned the Spanish banking establishment and posed a serious threat to Santander. However, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, the central bank governor, has paid tribute to the Botin family which founded the bank. Mr Rojo described the Botins as 'an exceptionally competent professional family that over the years has developed the Santander group into one of (Spain's) most dynamic and strong institutions.' Santander, which had total assets at September 30 of more than Dollars 53bn, is one of Spain's biggest banks. It owns 10 per cent of the Royal Bank of Scotland and 16 per cent of First Fidelity Bancorporation of the US. A Santander spokesman said that while the amount of the bond ordered by the court was substantial - it is believed to be the highest bond posted in Spain - 'we are certain depositors and investors will view it within the context of our strong balance sheet.' The guarantee was extended by Bankinter, a bank which is also controlled by the Botin family and whose chairman, Mr Jaime Botin, is the brother of Mr Emilio Botin, Santander's managing director, and also deputy chairman of Santander. Within hours of Mr Moreiras' ruling on December 23, Santander lodged an appeal that categorically rejected his definition of loan assignments as bank time deposits that should have been subject to a withholding tax on interest. The cornerstone of Santander's appeal against Mr Moreiras' as yet incomplete investigations is that the loan assignments were not bound by normal fiscal guidelines on deposits until a government decree specifically made them so in July 1989. The scheme, under which the bank sold loans on its portfolio as investments to selected customers, is understood to have been widely practised by other leading domestic banks.</p>

RCRA section 4005(c)(1)(C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C), requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine whether states have adequate ``permit'' programs for MSWLFs, but does not mandate issuance of a rule for such determinations. EPA has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR) that will provide procedures by which EPA will approve, or partially approve, State/Tribal landfill permit programs. The Agency intends to approve adequate State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs as applications are submitted. Thus, these approvals are not dependent on final promulgation of the STIR. Prior to promulgation of the STIR, adequacy determinations will be made based on the statutory authorities and requirements. In addition, States/Tribes may use the draft STIR as an aid in interpreting these requirements. The Agency believes that early approvals have an important benefit. Approved State/Tribal permit programs provide for interaction between the State/Tribe and the owner/operator regarding site-specific permit conditions. Only those owners/operators located in States/Tribes with approved permit programs can use the site-specific flexibilities provided by 40 CFR part 258 to the extent the State/Tribal permit program allows such flexibility. EPA notes that regardless of the approval status of a State/Tribe and the permit status of any facility, the Federal land fill criteria shall apply to all permitted and unpermitted MSWLF facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has applied for a determination of adequacy under section 4005(c)(1)(C) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C). EPA Region I has reviewed Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program adequacy application and has made a tentative determination that all portions of Massachusetts's MSWLF permit program are adequate to assure compliance with the revised MSWLF Criteria. Massachusetts's application for program adequacy determination is available for public review and comment at the places listed in the ``ADDRESSES'' section below during regular office hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although RCRA does not require EPA to hold a public hearing on a determination to approve any State/Tribe's MSWLF permit program, the Region has tentatively scheduled a public hearing on this determination. If a sufficient number of persons express interest in participating in a hearing by writing to the EPA Region I, Solid Waste Section or calling the contact given below within 30 days of the date of publication of this notice, the Region will hold a hearing, in Boston, Massachusetts, on the date given below in the ``DATES'' section. The Region will notify all persons who submit comments on this notice if it appears that there is sufficient public interest to warrant a hearing. In addition, anyone who wishes to learn whether the hearing will be held may call the person listed in the ``CONTACTS'' section below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  All comments on Massachusetts's application for a determination of adequacy must be received by the close of business on June 4, 1994.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 9, 1991, EPA promulgated revised Criteria for MSWLFs (40 CFR part 258). Subtitle D of RCRA, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984 (HSWA), requires states to develop permitting programs to ensure that MSWLFs comply with the Federal Criteria under 40 CFR part 258. Subtitle D also requires in section 4005(c)(1)(C), 42 U.S.C. 6945(c)(1)(C) that EPA determine the adequacy of state municipal solid waste landfill permit programs to ensure that facilities comply with the revised Federal Criteria. To fulfill this requirement, the Agency has drafted and is in the process of proposing a State/Tribal Implementation Rule (STIR). The rule will specify the requirements which State/Tribal programs must satisfy to be determined adequate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA intends to approve State/Tribal MSWLF permit programs prior to the promulgation of the STIR. EPA interprets the requirements for states or tribes to develop ``adequate'' programs for permits, or other forms of prior approval and conditions (for example, license to operate) to impose several minimum requirements. First, each State/Tribe must have enforceable standards for new and existing MSWLFs that are technically comparable to EPA's revised MSWLF criteria. Second, the State/Tribe must have the authority to issue a permit or other notice of prior approval and conditions to all new and existing MSWLFs in its jurisdiction. The State/Tribe also must provide for public participation in permit issuance and enforcement as required in section 7004(b) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6974(b). Finally, the State/Tribe must show that it has sufficient compliance monitoring and enforcement authorities to take specific action against any owner or operator that fails to comply with an approved MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Regions will determine whether a State/Tribe has submitted an ``Adequate'' program based on the interpretation outlined above. EPA plans to provide more specific criteria for this evaluation when it proposes the STIR. EPA expects States/Tribes to meet all of these requirements for all elements of a MSWLF program before it gives full approval to a MSWLF program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> B. Commonwealth of Massachusetts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 13, 1993, EPA Region I received Massachusetts's final MSWLF Permit Program application for adequacy determination. Region I reviewed the final application and submitted comments to Massachusetts. Massachusetts addressed EPA's comments and submitted a revised final application for adequacy determination on August 30, 1993. Region I received additional clarifying information on the Massachusetts MSWLF Permit Program on November 2, 1993 and March 23, 1994. Region I has reviewed Massachusetts's revised application and has tentatively determined that all portions of Massachusetts's MSWLF program meet all the requirements necessary to qualify for full program approval and ensures compliance with the revised Federal Criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public may submit written comments on EPA's tentative determination until June 6, 1994. Copies of Massachusetts's application are available for inspection and copying at the location indicated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the jurisdiction for siting and permitting of solid waste management facilities lies with local boards of health and the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), an agency falling under the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA). The Department of Public Health (DPH) is also given an advisory role in the siting process. Authority for respective roles of the boards of health, DEP and DPH is granted by Chapter 111, section 150A of the Massachusetts General Laws. Region I based its decision of tentative full approval on the current approach for approving the construction and operation of MSWLFs in Massachusetts. This approach includes: (1) A review pursuant to the Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), a public information process that generally involves the submission of an Environmental Impact Report, which must be approved by the Secretary of the Office of Environmental Affairs; (2) a Site Assignment Process, which focuses on determining whether a specific location is suitable for a specific type of solid waste facility (the local board of health is responsible for granting a site assignment in accordance with the procedures and criteria at 310 CMR 16.00); and (3) a Solid Waste Management Facility Permit, a permit that must be obtained from DEP's Division of Solid Waste Management after completing the MEPA process and obtaining a site assignment. The permitting process regulates the design, operation and maintenance, closure, post-closure and financial assurance aspects of a facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Massachusetts regulations require, at 310 CMR 19.021, the repermitting of all landfills existing as of the effective date of July 1, 1990, unless they choose to close prior to July 1, 1992. Furthermore, the regulations at 310 CMR 19.022(1) require the completion of closure of all unlined areas of landfills by July 1, 1995. A recent amendment of MGL c. 111, s. 150A makes the 1995 closure date applicable only to privately owned landfills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The design standard for new and lateral expansions of landfills currently in effect in Massachusetts includes a composite liner system which features: a subgrade layer which must ensure a minimum of four foot separation between the top of bedrock or the maximum high groundwater table and the bottom of the lowermost low permeability layer; a two foot, low permeability, soil/admixture layer having a maximum in-place saturated hydraulic conductivity of 1x10&hyph;7 cm/sec; a minimum 30-mil flexible membrane liner (60-mil minimum for high density polyethylene) in direct contact with the underlying soil/admixture; a drainage/protection layer; and a leachate collection system. Alternative liner designs must meet the performance standard for ground water protection systems found at 310 CMR 19.110 and do so in a manner which meets or exceeds the design standard of that section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The current siting criteria carefully restrict new or expanding landfills from being located in settings that may conflict with the Location Criteria specified in 40 CFR 258.10, 258.11, 258.12, 258.13, 258.14 and 258.16. By currently restricting landfills to such settings, Massachusetts has protected all state drinking water resources, whether surface water or groundwater, from the potential impact of leachate -an approach which EPA has determined to be an alternate to the 40 CFR part 258 requirements, but still as protective as the Federal requirements at 40 CFR part 258. In addition, the Commonwealth's requirements are no less stringent than the requirements set forth at 40 CFR part 258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Massachusetts MSWLF Permitting Program features an unique approach to landfill assessment which includes four parts. The first part is an Initial Site Assessment (ISA), which examines the general history of the site, the types and amounts of waste landfilled, the size of the site and other historical information concerning the site. The second part is a Comprehensive Site Assessment (CSA) to characterize the nature and extent of any contamination that may exist. The CSA, which is used to develop a suitable closure strategy, involves, in its final step, a two-phased risk assessment approach to determine whether corrective action is warranted. The first phase of the risk assessment is called a qualitative risk assessment. The following three pieces of information are analyzed in this phase: the existence of contamination above standards or approved levels; the existence of potential public health or environmental receptors; and the existence of pathways which would serve to link contamination to receptors. If all three are determined to exist in any media (air, surface water, ground water or soil), the second phase in the risk assessment process, the quantitative risk assessment, is invoked as is a round of sampling for all the 40 CFR part 258, appendix II constituents. The third part of the landfill assessment is a Corrective Actions Alternatives Analysis (CAAA), which is conducted to determine the type of cap and any additional remediation measures which will be needed to properly close the sanitary landfill. The fourth and final part of the landfill assessment process is a Corrective Action Design (CAD), in which the landfill cap and any additional remediation measures are designed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Massachusetts covers the landfill assessment requirements in more detail in its Guidance on Conducting Qualitative Risk Assessments at Solid Waste Landfills and Guidance for Disposal Site Risk Characterization and Related Phase II Activities. The revised Landfill Assessment and Closure Guidance Manual (LAC Manual) is applicable to all existing MSWLFs and to all MSWLF permit applications effective July 1, 1993. Massachusetts will implement its MSWLF permit program through enforceable permit conditions. To ensure compliance with the Federal criteria, Massachusetts has revised its current permit requirements through the existing Supplement to Landfill Assessment and Closure Manual. These revisions occur in the following areas: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts is not asserting jurisdiction over Tribal land recognized by the United States government for the purpose of this notice. Tribes recognized by the United States government are also required to comply with the terms and conditions found at 40 CFR part 258.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period and during any public hearing held. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a determination of inadequacy for Massachusetts's program. EPA will make a final decision on approval of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts's program and will give notice of the final determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The notice shall include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all significant comments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 4005(a) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6945(a) provides that citizens may use the citizen suit provisions of section 7002 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6972 to enforce the Federal MSWLF criteria set forth in 40 CFR part 258 independent of any State/Tribal enforcement program. As EPA explained in the preamble to the final MSWLF criteria, EPA expects that any owner or operator complying with provisions in a State/Tribal program approved by EPA should be considered to be in compliance with the Federal Criteria.

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Treasury grants British Library extra cash The Treasury is to put up extra money for the new British Library building in central London in the expectation that the cash will be recovered from contractors. Mr Peter Brooke, heritage secretary, told the Commons national heritage committee yesterday that the Treasury held the contractors responsible for delays and cost overruns. He said the cost of the library would exceed the Pounds 450m ceiling imposed in 1990, at least in the short term. The Treasury had agreed to fund the extra spending, having been convinced that the extra money could be recovered from contractors, whose mistakes in planning and installing equipment contributed to the spiralling cost of the project. Laing Management is the main contractor, but there are dozens of sub-contractors. Mr Brooke said he was confident that, after recoveries, the cost would not exceed Pounds 450m. The alternative was for the British Library to be asked to take possession of a building lacking some of its planned features. MPs on committee were sceptical the government could bank on winning possible legal actions against suppliers to the development, the most expensive government-financed building this century. When the new library was approved by the then Mrs Shirley Williams in 1978 on a site in London's Euston Road, it was costed at Pounds 116m and was expected to be completed by the mid 1980s. Poor building controls by the Property Services Agency, privatised in 1992, and continuous cuts by the Treasury delayed the development until a much smaller building - adding only an additional 76 readers' seats to the 1,100 in the old reading room in the British Museum - was approved. Mr Brooke said he hoped that the British Library could take over the site in 1996. There could then be a further delay of up to two years while the stock of 12m books was brought from almost 20 sites around London. The latest setbacks to the development involve cabling and the sprinkling system. Consultants are assessing the extent of the problem, and the responsibility for malfunctions, and are expected to report in August. The government will then be better able to give a timetable. Mr Brooke denied allegations of illegal practices, involving contractors spinning out the work and repeating installations. He blamed the drip-feeding of cash in the 1980s for the rising costs. Since becoming heritage secretary in 1992, Mr Brooke has increased investment in the project - a move criticised by many in the performing arts who believe that extra funding contributed to the reduction in the grant for the Arts Council in 1994-95. Dr Brian Lang, the British Library chief executive, told the committee that the library wanted to take over a safe, healthy, efficient building but it was not being over-scrupulous about the condition of the fixtures and fittings.</p>

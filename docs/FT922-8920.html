			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / People: Hosking joins CSFB team For a firm with a reputation for macho style, Credit Suisse First Boston has adopted a laudably incremental approach to assembling a European equity research team. Perhaps the final piece in the jigsaw is Lisa Hosking, who joins from SG Warburg. She will work with the London team of 16 sector analysts collected over the past three years from such sources as Salomon Brothers, Banque National de Paris and Drexels. Hosking comes with excellent credentials; she was rated the best international strategist by investors in both the 1991 Extel poll and a recent survey carried out by Institutional Investor magazine. To these achievements she can now add another first: the first researcher to join CSFB as a managing director. Head of equity research Dan Meade says that he has been trying to hire Hosking for more than two years. This may have been the offer she could not refuse. But after six years in Warburg's civilised environment, can she fit in with the hard-driving, hard-selling CSFB credo? An American with a degree in economics from the University of California at Berkeley, she is one of the new breed of mathematical, quantitative strategists. But the lady is no mere technician. In the words of one colleague: 'She has more than enough personality to work with people who are by nature very tough to work with.' ***** Hans Peterson has been appointed a director of INTERNATIONAL SELECT FUND and not of Lazard Fund Managers. ***** Yong Kim is appointed md of HYUNDAI SECURITIES (EUROPE) LTD. Stephen Connelly moves from Merrill Lynch Europe to be its chief financial officer. ***** John Yougman, chairman of Coates Brothers, has been appointed to the board of KLEINWORT CHARTER INVESTMENT TRUST. ***** Nicolas Bowater, a victim of the exigencies of a short-term strategy at his previous employer, has joined the steady Swiss at Credit Suisse Asset Management in the newly created position of marketing director for the private clients division. Two years ago Bowater, now 49, was with the private client side of Mercury Asset Management. With his boss eight years his junior, he was 'a classic headhunter material'. He succumbed to the sirens from the Bank of Bermuda, and the opportunity 'to put my own stamp and authority on the business'. He spent 15 months selling the bank's services from London to non-domiciled clients before it decided it would concentrate its international marketing efforts elsewhere. 'The party moved the goal posts, but I suppose that's life,' says Bowater, who has decided he prefers the long-term approach of the Swiss 'where tomorrow is the year 2000'. Part of his job at CSAM, which manages about Pounds 1bn of private client monies, will be simply to increase the company's name recognition, 'particularly among professional intermediaries'. Buckmaster &amp; Moore (acquired by Credit Suisse) was 'very well known on the private client side' but CSAM has lost some of that awareness.</p>

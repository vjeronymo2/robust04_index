			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Miu Oikawa Dieter] </F>   [Text] Beijing, March 20 KYODO -- Japanese Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa reiterated strong concern Sunday [20 March]  about North Korea's suspected development of nuclear weapons,  saying Japan plans to take "responsible" action if the matter is  brought to the U.N. Security Council.    Hosokawa told a news conference he expressed "strong  concern"  in talks with Chinese leaders that the inspections by the  International Atomic Energy Agency ended insufficiently and the  dialogue between Seoul and Pyongyang failed.    He refused to comment on specific actions Japan will take if  the issue is brought to the Security Council.    "But generally speaking, if some kind of action is decided  at  the U.N. Security Council, Japan will consider a responsible way  to cope," Hosokawa said.    He said China plays an important role because it has deep  relations with North Korea and he strongly urged the Chinese  Government during talks with the Chinese leaders to play a major  role in solving the North Korean nuclear problem.    Hosokawa, currently on a three-day visit to China which  started Saturday, held talks with President Jiang Zemin and  Premier Li Peng prior to the press conference at the Beijing New  Century Hotel.    He said he could have "frank discussions" with the Chinese  leaders on issues such as North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons, Japan-China cooperation in the Asia-Pacific  region, disarmament, arms control and human rights.    Hosokawa said he wants to build future-oriented relations  with China based on Japan's remorse for its wartime actions.    In talks with Li earlier in the day, Hosokawa referred to  his  policy speech in August in which he expressed "deep remorse and  apologies for the fact that past Japanese actions, including  aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable suffering and  sorrow for so many people."    Li welcomed Hosokawa's remarks, telling him it was the "most  frank and sincere attitude" he has ever heard, according to  Japanese officials.    The prime minister told the news conference he agreed with  the Chinese leaders that the two nations will make efforts to  further develop economic and diplomatic relations between the  two sides.    Hosokawa said he did not think the Chinese leaders have  "objections" to his view that human rights are a "universal  value recognized by the international community."    He declined to comment, though, on a row between China and  the United States over China's human rights record.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who visited  China earlier this month, urged China to improve its human  rights record as a condition for extending most-favored-nation  trade status with Beijing.    Hosokawa also declined to comment on specifics, such as the  treatment of pro-democracy activists.    In talks with Li on Saturday, Hosokawa called for  improvement  in China's human rights record by referring to a declaration  adopted at an international conference on human rights held last  June in Vienna.    The declaration notes that promotion and protection of human  rights are legitimate items for concern for the international  community.</p>

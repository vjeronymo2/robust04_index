			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 2 (BTA) -- In an interview for the  Panorama political show this evening President Zhelyu Zhelev  harshly criticized the government of economist Professor Lyuben  Berov (not affiliated to any party) which was formed in December  1992. He also stated that he was withdrawing his support from  this cabinet.    "15 months after taking the lead this government has got  nowhere with privatization and has failed to carry out the  priorities of its programme for which it was appointed by  parliament. No real investments have come to Bulgaria during  this period and we are still at the bottom of the list as far as  foreign investments in Eastern Europe are concerned," the  president pointed out. He said that not a single project had  been carried out or even launched, and cited projects for which  even competitions had been opened: a Kalotina -- Kapitan  Andreevo motorway (linking the western and the southern border),  a tunnel under Stara Planina (which divides northern from  southern Bulgaria), a new airport in Sofia, and a new bridge  over the Danube (the only existing bridge links Rousse with  Giurgiu). According to the president, the land reform has come  to a standstill and in reality only 25-30 per cent of the land  has been returned to its owners. "And, to top it all, here is  the financial destabilization: fluctuations that have to do  with the rise of the dollar and the prices, which undermine  social stability," he added.    "Under these circumstances I cannot but reconsider my  attitude to this government and withdraw my support from it,"  the president stated. It is not the president, it is parliament  who decides what government will be ruling this country, he  said. "But when the actions of the government start to threaten  peace and stability, I cannot regard that with indifference," Dr  Zhelev pointed out. His personal attitude to Professor Berov is  unchanged: "He is an honest, upright, decent and ethical  person". "The point is that this government is much to the  liking of the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) as it gets a  chance to do what it has always wanted to: govern without  shouldering the political responsibility for it," said the  president.    He stated that he was not holding any talks on the formation  of a new government, for that is beyond his prerogatives. He  said that it was normal for the parliamentary and  non-parliamentary forces to seek to meet with him.</p>

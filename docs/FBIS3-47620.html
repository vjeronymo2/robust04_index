			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Myong-hwa] </F>   [Text] The National Unification Board (NUB) has been  undergoing subtle but significant changes with the arrival of  new Deputy Prime Minister and Unification Minister Yi Yong-tok  last December.    Unlike his predecessor Han Wan-sang, who was criticized for  being a "sentimental unification proponent," Yi is voicing his  negative opinions on North Korea, especially on human rights  conditions there.    Yi, 68, seems fully aware of the hardships Han faced during  his 10-month-long tenure. Former Unification Minister Han was  frequently criticized by conservatives within the government and  the National Assembly for his sympathetic posture toward the  North and was finally dropped from the new cabinet lineup.    "So far, the new deputy prime minister is doing a fine job,  coordinating the views of the NUB, the Foreign Ministry, and the  Agency for National Security Planning on inter-Korean issues,"  an NUB official said.    Opposition lawmakers and some government officials, however,  expressed deep concern over Yi's hard-line stance on North  Korea, especially concerning his recent remarks on the North  Korean human rights situation.    Early this month, Yi told reporters that it's about time  North Korea recognized universal values, such as respect for  human rights and welfare, raising the possibility that Seoul  will take up the matter when inter-Korean dialogue resumes.    "North Korea must also ride the global trend of  reconciliation and co-prosperity, and for this we must tell the  North Koreans things that may sound harsh to their ears," Yi  said firmly in his first message to the public as unification  minister.    Noting that the most important human rights problem facing  both South and North Korea is the issue of separated family  members, he said it is shameful for all Koreans that these  people still do not know whether their beloved are alive or not.    "Meetings alone are no longer enough, we must make this  relationship move forward to a higher goal," he said. "If they  don't agree on our principle, we won't respond unconditionally  to their proposal for a meeting."    Since then, Yi has faced sharp criticism from opposition  lawmakers and the press, who fear his remarks might over-shadow  the ongoing nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, now  seemingly near a conclusion.    Rep. Cho Sun-sung of the main opposition Democratic Party, a  well-known expert on international affairs, accused Yi of having  "acted counter to common sense" by making the remarks, that  would be of no help for improving South-North relations at this  sensitive time.    Rep. Han Kwang-ok, a member of the party Supreme Council,  asserted that Yi's statement put in doubt his desire to achieve  national unification.    Yi again echoed the importance of change on the part of  North  Korea Jan. 11. During his visit at the Office of Five Provinces  of North Korea, located in downtown Seoul, he asserted that it  is high time for the North to change. "Unification will be  realized only after North Korea becomes different," he said.    Yi further said if he met North Koreans in near future, he  would describe to them the future unified Korea with respect for  personal rights, guarantee of freedom and flow of justice, and  ask them to make efforts to achieve making it.    The NUB under Yi's leadership is reportedly studying  multi-prong ways to address to the human rights conditions of  North Korea step by step in the future.    In initial stage, according to the NUB sources, the  government plans to call for improved human rights conditions in  the North in cooperation with international human rights  organization like the Amnesty International and the  International Committee of the Red Cross.    Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to  allow, for example, visits by human rights inspectors and to  stop torture and all other forms of maltreatment of prisoners.    On this stage, efforts could be made to resolve the  dispersed  family question on a priority basis without linking it to  political questions, the sources said.    But some NUB officials complained the new unification  minister puts "too much emphasis" upon the resolution of the  dispersed families problem. They feared that the NUB might end  up as an agency dealing with personnel and commodities exchanges  between the two sides, if Yi continues such policy.    They say that Yi, a native of Kang-so, South Pyongan  Province, now in North Korea, who himself was separated from his  family during the 1950-53 Korean War, appears too personally  involved with the dispersed family issue.    Taking issue with Yi's recent remarks, North Korea strongly  warned Jan. 7 that inter-Korean relations will fall into  critical condition if Unification Minister Yi repeats such  remarks.    North Korea insisted that the South has tried to heat up  confrontation between the South and the North by newly raising  the issue of human rights in North Korea. It even threatened  that the new unification minister of the South will never be  allowed to set foot inside the North.    Estimates on Yi's moves may vary but most people seem to  agree the human rights situations in North Korea would be a main  topic in inter-Korean negotiations in the not too distant future.</p>

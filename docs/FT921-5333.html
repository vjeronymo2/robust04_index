			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Pension fund trustees face stiff rules: MPs to propose reforms in line with regulations for company directors PENSION FUND trustees would be subject to the same strict rules as company directors under proposals for sweeping pension law changes to be put forward next week by a cross-party parliamentary committee. The select committee on social security, which has been looking into the disappearance of hundreds of millions of pounds from pension funds controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, will cite Companies Act rules requiring an annual general meeting for members, timely release of annual accounts and the requirement that company directors be 'fit and proper' people. It will urge that a new pensions law translate these rules into requirements for trustees. Also, the committee will recommend that the remit of the Occupational Pensions Board, which oversees some aspects of pensions operations, be extended to cover all the assets of occupational pension schemes. At present the board is only required to determine that each scheme has enough assets to pay the small portion of workers' pensions which would otherwise be covered by the state. For the great majority of UK pension funds which have 'opted out' of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme, that portion is no more than 20 per cent of a worker's pension. MPs on the committee are expected to agree today a report which calls for a Royal Commission or lower level inquiry following the failure of regulators to stop Mr Maxwell from raiding pension funds of the companies he operated. Separately, the Department of Social Security is understood to be taking steps to organise an inquiry, just below the level of a Royal Commission, into pension fund legislation to be announced after the general election. The committee is expected to condemn the City regulatory authorities for being intimidated by Mr Maxwell. They believe there was a vacuum in the regulatory system which justifies a radical overhaul after the general election of UK pension legislation. The report is expected to call on the Securities and Investments Board, the City watchdog, to review the activities of the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation which allowed Mr Maxwell to control a fund management company that gave him personal access to his employees' pension funds. Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the committee, moved to quell speculation that the report would recommend compensation for Maxwell pensioners. The MPs have run out of time before the election for a full inquiry into the role of banks in the affair. 'At the centre of the inquiry has been concern for Maxwell pensioners, and we are anxious not to raise expectations about compensation which we could not fulfil,' he said.

			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRADITION WITH A TWIST;  </P> <P> BOLD COLOR AND EASY SHAPES GIVE CLASSIC MENSWEAR A SHOT IN THE ARM  </P> <P> JUST WHEN MANY MEN WERE thinking their wardrobes had been finalized in a  classical mode -- Brooks Brothers, jeans or L. L. Bean -- an unstoppable design  force is moving in and shaking things up. In the same way that architects  Michael Graves and Frank Gehry add iconoclastic colors and shapes to classical  forms, designers are adding modernity without forsaking their strengths.  They're infusing the classics with bold color. They're relaxing the traditional  silhouette. And they're showing sophisticated combinations of fabrics.  </P> <P> The man who, in the past, stretched his style at the office with a yellow or  red power tie will probably be the first to try the bolder, 3 3/8-inch print  ties reminiscent of the '40s or a tie with buttonholes that attach to the  buttons on his shirt. Men who first experimented with colored dress shirts will  now choose shirts with fine details such as muted stripes in purple, teal or  orange, hand-carved bone buttons or brightly colored solids in silk or fine  cotton. Tasteful alternatives to ties and shirts are cashmere polo sweaters or  mock turtlenecks.  </P> <P> The standard blazer and three-button jacket also are evolving. A stalwart  traditionalist, Ralph Lauren introduced a relaxed sack suit with three buttons,  a single vent and flat-front pants in his fall, 1988, collection. This  conservative shape triggered a fast-moving trend that calls for all jackets to  be roomy but not sloppy and have softer, rounder shoulders.  </P> <P> Although trimmer than the baggy shapes of the past, pants this season have a  relaxed, yet elegantly draped look.  </P> <P> While the classic silhouette is still basically intact, designers are taking  liberties with color. Even Giorgio Armani, who usually works with neutral  colors, is combining red or orange scarfs and vests with subdued tones. The  guideline for making the look work: The bolder the color, the simpler the  shape. If the silhouette is avant-garde, keep the color discreet.  </P> <P> Fall menswear is also sparked with costly fabrics such as cashmere and silk.  Fortunately, there's a way to avoid expensive blunders while adding a touch of  style: Invest in separates. A tobacco-color jacket, for example, works well  with gray or black slacks. A bright tie or vest in a luxury fabric will add  after-hours flair. It is a liberated personal style that befits the advent of  the '90s.  </P> <P> (Photographed by Diego Uchitel; stylist: Robert Trachtenberg / Cloutier;hair  and grooming: Edward St. George / Cloutier; models: Barry Dillard / Omar's Men  and Albert Solis / Omar's Men.)  </P></p>

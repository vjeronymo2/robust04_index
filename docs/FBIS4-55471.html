The report  reads: ``The Slovak Republic's foreign trade turnover reached  the value of Sk90.852 billion in the first quarter of the year  and was 22.4 percent higher than in the same period in 1993.  This transpires from a Slovak Statistical Office analysis of  the development of the Slovak Republic's foreign trade in the  first quarter of the year.    ``In the first quarter, the Slovak Republic had a balance of  trade surplus mainly with the countries of the European Union.  The surplus amounted to Sk1.642 billion. The Slovak Republic's  surplus with the FRG alone amounted to Sk2.341 billion and with  the Netherlands to Sk102 million. The Slovak Republic also  registered a foreign trade surplus with the countries of the  Central European Free Trade Association. The surplus with these  countries amounted to Sk3.929 billion, of which trade with the  Czech Republic accounted for Sk2.206 billion and trade with  Hungary for Sk1.821 billion.    ``In the first quarter of the year, the Slovak Republic had  a  balance of trade deficit, in particular with the countries of  the European Free Trade Association. The deficit with these  countries reached Sk1.013 billion, with Austria accounting for  the biggest part of this deficit--Sk537 million. In its trade  with Russia in the same period, Slovakia had a deficit of  Sk8.867 billion and in its trade with Ukraine a deficit of Sk112  million.    ``Compared with the first quarter of 1993, the Slovak  Republic's exports to the FRG went up 47.8 percent, to Hungary  40.3 percent, to Austria 22.8 percent, to Italy 73.4 percent,  and to Poland 16.7 percent. On the other hand, Slovak exports  to the Czech Republic were 7.3 percent lower than in the first  quarter of 1993, exports to the Russian Federation declined 0.1  percent, to Ukraine 38.5 percent, to China 81 percent, to  Romania 41.9 percent, and to Bulgaria 40.1 percent.'']</p>

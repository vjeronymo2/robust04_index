			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Receivers issue warning in wake of staff-rights ruling Pressure is mounting among insolvency firms for clarification of employees' rights in receiverships following a controversial court ruling last week. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday that it had already shed staff in one company that entered receivership this week as a result of the Court of Appeal ruling. The verdict in the Paramount case suggests that under UK insolvency law receivers and administrators must re-employ staff on new contracts within 14 days of their appointment, or assume all the existing employment obligations. The unexpected effect is to rank substantial additional employment costs above other creditors, and may prompt receivers in any new appointment to fire a large proportion of the workforce before the 14-day limit is exceeded. Mr Mark Homan, head of insolvency at Price Waterhouse, said yesterday: 'We are still in a state of shock.' He warned that the effect of the ruling could be to delay further pay-outs on existing receiverships. Mr Chris Hughes, head of insolvency at Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the effect of the ruling on receivership cases was unclear, but that insolvency firms were worried that they could be forced to lay off staff in all cases. 'The law appears to have been thrown into the melting pot by the judgment. It has caused some concern, and it needs to be clarified quickly,' Mr Hughes said. The insolvency profession is studying the details of the ruling and may attempt to bring an early case on appeal in order to clarify its implications.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Macedonian Council of Australia has called for a  nationwide campaign of civil disobedience against the federal  government's use of the term Slav Macedonians. The term refers  to members of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.    The council has called on Australia's 200,000 Macedonians to  oppose the federal government's move. The council wants members  filling out official forms to use only the term Macedonia when  describing their country of birth and for appeals to be lodged  if government agencies failed to recognize the term.    South Australia's spokesman for the Macedonian Council,  Alexander Glevchev, admits the campaign may force hardship upon  members of the community.    [Begin Glevchev recording] Hardship is a relative term when  you are a Macedonian person. We came out here many years ago --  our people escaping prosecution, starvation, and war. This  hardship could be minor in relevance to that. [end recording]</p>

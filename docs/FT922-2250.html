			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / People: Watson ends family monopoly of Waddington While the game may be over for Robert Maxwell's tangled web of companies, Victor Watson (right), the chairman of Waddington who yesterday announced his plan to retire in 1993, can claim to have fingered the publishing baron almost a decade ago. Watson, the last in a line of Watsons at the Waddington helm which started in 1913, successfully fended off two bids from Maxwell, partly because of the discovery by his advisers Kleinwort Benson of the publisher's murky Liechtenstein connections. Watson fought off two other bids during his 40 years at Waddington: from Mordon in 1965 and Norton Opax in 1983. The latter, says Watson, was the spark for Maxwell's first attempt on Waddington. 'He was like a shark who smelled blood,' Watson once said. His stalwart defence of the games-to-packaging company is in keeping with family tradition. His grandfather, a Leeds lithographer, originally rescued Waddington from liquidation in 1913. Watson's father - and predecessor as chairman - later revived an again-flagging Waddington by inventing a machine to mass-produce playing cards. Watson Jr, now 63, plans a working retirement on the boards of, among others, Yorkshire Television and John Foster and Sons. Although his successor has not been named, former chief executive and ex-England rugby captain, David Perry (left), has been appointed deputy chairman. ***** John McKeown, managing director of Ansells, Allied-Lyons's Birmingham-based pub company, is to resign the position to concentrate on his role as retail services director for the group's retailing division. McKeown, who joined the group in 1972, will be responsible for identifying and implementing best retailing practices throughout the sector, which covers Allied's international franchise business, UK pubs and off-licences. He will also be directly responsible for acquisitions, purchasing and leisure machines across the UK pub operations. ***** Martin Grant, who joined Allied from Whitbread two years ago, and at present heads Ansells' retailing operations, will succeed McKeown as md of the pub company. ***** John Camden, chairman of RMC Group, is to relinquish his executive responsibilities to the group md Jim Owen, but will continue as non-executive chairman. ***** Henry Drea and Edwin Stallard have been appointed to the board of AVONMORE FOODS. ***** John Sandiford has been appointed a director and company secretary of SERIF COWELLS. ***** Terry Arthur has been appointed an independent trustee of the board of WIGGINS TEAPE PENSIONS. ***** Alastair Channing, deputy md of Associated British Ports, and James Shaw, md of Grosvenor Square Properties, have both been appointed to the board of ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS. ***** Michael Smith has been appointed to the board of BOWATER. ***** Nicholas Hodges, md of LIG's European division, has been appointed a director of LONDON INTERNATIONAL. ***** Peter Robinson has been appointed chief executive of BIWATER. ***** Brian Whitford has been promoted to md of RACAL HEALTH &amp; SAFETY. ***** Bob Dodd has been appointed to the board of MOBIL OIL COMPANY as director, personnel. ***** George Van Sant is relinquishing his role as director, employee relations and personnel matters of LAWSON MARDON Group, Europe, and is appointed a director of LMG Smith Brothers. ***** James Schemenaur, president and chief executive officer of BARRY WEHMILLER INTERNATIONAL's Inex Vision systems division, has been appointed to the main board.</p>

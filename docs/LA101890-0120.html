			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN MADE BOMBS FOR GANG'S USE, POLICE ALLEGE  </P> <P> A 19-year-old gang member arrested this week on suspicion of manufacturing and  possessing explosive devices was believed to be making the bombs for a  Glendale-based gang, and for possible use against a rival gang, authorities  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Arash Forouzanfar was arrested Tuesday in Glendale after an extensive  investigation, said Glendale Police Sgt. Don Meredith.  </P> <P> Detectives in Glendale and Los Angeles received information five months ago  that a Glendale gang was attempting to add bombs to their arsenal, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Police said there were two bombings in vacant lots in Glendale in January and  August and they are believed to be the work of Forouzanfar, or members of his  gang. No one was injured in those blasts, which occurred in isolated areas.  </P> <P> "We believe they were tests," Meredith said. "Our investigators believe any  intended targets would have been that of a rival gang."  </P> <P> Forouzanfar was described by police as being of Iranian descent, but was a  member of a primarily Latino street gang active in Glendale and Northeast Los  Angeles. Officers declined to name the gang or to speculate who the targets of  any future bombings would have been.  </P> <P> Police on Tuesday searched four locations frequented by Forouzanfar. In a house  in the 1000 block of Harvard Road in Burbank, bomb squad officers found two  complete explosive devices, chemicals and materials that could have made  "several other bombs," Meredith said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Lt. Herb Seitz said the devices were "absolutely dangerous.  We are not talking about Molotov cocktails."  </P> <P> Investigators believe Tuesday's arrest dealt a fatal blow to plans by  Forouzanfar's gang to use bombs against rival gangs.  </P> <P> "As far as I know we have recovered most, or all, of these devices," Meredith  told United Press International.  </P> <P> Forouzanfar will be arraigned today in Glendale Municipal Court. He remained in  jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.  </P> <P> Meredith said there could be more arrests in the case, but stressed that  authorities believe Forouzanfar is the leader of the effort to add bombs to the  gang's arsenal. The sergeant said Forouzanfar's gang was the only one suspected  of manufacturing explosives.  </P></p>

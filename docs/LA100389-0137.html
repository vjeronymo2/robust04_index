			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMMUNISTS TO RENAME POLISH PARTY  </P> <P> Polish Communists today voted overwhelmingly to transform -- and rename --  their party after their loss of power to the Solidarity movement.  </P> <P> Politburo member Leszek Miller told the Central Committee that a plebiscite by  the membership on the future of the Polish United Workers' Party, the official  name of the Communist party, had produced a landslide vote for change.  </P> <P> The result means that the 41-year-old party, formed to impose Stalinism on  postwar Poland, will probably cease to exist in its current form in a few  months.  </P> <P> Party leaders have already proposed renaming it the Polish Socialist Labor  Party.  </P> <P> Miller said 1.1 million of the party's 2.2 million members took part in the  plebiscite on the future of the party and 72.1% voted yes to the question: "Are  you, comrade, for transformation of the Polish United Workers' Party into a new  party with a new program, statutes and name?"  </P> <P> The results did not define the shape or name of the new party, which will be  decided at a special congress that Miller proposed for Jan. 27.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LEUZINGER HIGH SECURITY CHIEF'S SON LED PROTEST;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: WALKOUT ORGANIZER SAYS RUMORS OF RACISM MADE HIM FEAR FOR HIS  FATHER'S JOB. SCHOOL OFFICIALS PLAN TO MEET WITH STUDENTS TODAY.  </P> <P> As Bert Best, the head of security at Leuzinger High School, worked frantically  to herd protesting students out of the street and back onto campus this week,  his son, Bert Best Jr., was explaining to the media how he and a handful of  other students had organized the walkout.  </P> <P> For the 18-year-old Best, the reasons for this week's protests in the Centinela  Valley Union High School District were personal: He was a son sticking up for  his father in the wake of rumors that black employees were in danger of losing  their jobs.  </P> <P> Best said he had heard about the race-related incidents and rumors that have  surfaced in the district this school year. One rumor was that Ken Crowe, the  popular principal of Hawthorne High School, was on his way out.  </P> <P> Crowe, one of two minority principals in the four-school district, announced  his resignation last week after the school board told him that he would be  reassigned. He changed his mind after the protests broke out. However, the news  that the school board had taken action against Crowe surprised and frightened  the teen-ager.  </P> <P> "I just know if (school board members) can get Ken Crowe, you can't be sure  who's next," Bert Best Jr. said. "It could be my dad."  </P> <P> The students who walked out of Leuzinger and Hawthorne high schools this week  said they were frustrated by months of lingering rumors of racism, angered by  Crowe's planned transfer and concerned about who could be next.  </P> <P> The demonstrations were planned Sunday night at the home of the security chief  and his son.  </P> <P> Malcolm Ratliff, 17, one of the organizers, said he met with the younger Best  and a few other friends to plan the protest and divide up duties Sunday night.  About 400 flyers, some of them handwritten, were distributed Monday morning to  notify students, he said, and the rest depended on word of mouth.  </P> <P> Bert Best Jr. said he kept the protest a secret from his father because "I  didn't know how he would feel."  </P> <P> His father, who declined to say what he thinks of his son's involvement, said  he found out about the walkout Monday morning along with other school  officials. He said he was not involved in the protest and did not know anything  about claims by some students that Leuzinger security guards urged them to join  Monday's protest.  </P> <P> "I'm supervisor of security," the senior Best said. "Why would I want a massive  exodus of two to three thousand students causing chaos in this school?"  </P> <P> Students launched the first protest at Leuzinger on Monday morning and then  marched to Hawthorne High, where their numbers swelled to about 2,000. On  Tuesday, about 500 students walked out of Leuzinger, while police officers  prevented all but about 50 students from leaving Hawthorne High.  </P> <P> School board members have repeatedly denied that the district intends to fire  minority administrators and have called for the state Department of Education  to look into the district's racial tension.  </P> <P> But protest organizers maintain that the school board has not been open with  the community. They were particularly upset Tuesday when the school board  canceled a press conference called by Supt. McKinley Nash to air the students'  grievances.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the school board agreed to meet with student representatives at  the two campuses today. Nash said the meetings, to be closed to the press, will  give students an opportunity to discuss their concerns with him, the board  members and school principals.  </P> <P> Nash said he expects no more walkouts.  </P> <P> "It's over now. It's over," he said.  </P> <P> Officers from several law-enforcement agencies were stationed at both campuses  Wednesday but reported no disturbances. Hawthorne police, who had threatened  students with arrest if they left the campus, referred eight Hawthorne High  students to the truancy office Wednesday.  </P> <P> There were no arrests at Leuzinger. However, students later said that four  demonstrators were suspended and about a dozen others were told to leave the  campus for the rest of the day during a brief sit-in at Leuzinger on Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> Student organizers said they were delighted that hundreds of students joined in  their cause, but they reluctantly admitted that many were hangers-on who were  using the walkout as an opportunity to skip class en masse.  </P> <P> Ratliff estimated that only 25% of the hundreds of students who walked out of  Leuzinger this week really understood what they were protesting. "For every  serious protester, there are a few others who are just partying," he said.  </P> <P> That alone was enough to keep some concerned students away.  </P> <P> Yahira Silvera, a 15-year-old Leuzinger sophomore, participated in the Monday  protest but decided to attend classes Tuesday. Silvera said she realized that  many of the students were not serious about the protest when they walked out of  a special assembly called Tuesday to discuss student concerns.  </P> <P> "We had an assembly to talk it out, and most people didn't want to hear,"  Silvera said. "They wanted to get on TV or miss class."  </P> <P> Security officials, who locked the gates at Leuzinger High on Tuesday to keep  television cameras out, agreed that media attention played a role in egging the  students on.  </P> <P> When students ran out the front doors of Leuzinger on Tuesday morning, the  guards said, they headed straight for the television cameras.  </P> <P> One student said he was interviewed by the media six times Tuesday. Ratliff  wore a suit to school Tuesday for his television appearances.  </P> <P> Students had even mastered the language of the media.  </P> <P> "Want a sound bite?" one protester yelled to a cameraman.  </P> <P> "I've got the scoop," another added.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Bert Best Jr. said he was encouraged by the size of the protests  and hopeful that the school board would address the students' concerns.  </P> <P> "Very few (student protesters) know what's going on," Best said. "Half of them  are just out here missing class. But there are a lot of people that do  understand. That's what matters."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Hugo Martin and George Hatch contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHRONOLOGY OF ESCALATING TENSION  </P> <P> March, 1988: The school board promotes Ken Crowe, assistant principal and  former dean of students at Hawthorne High, to principal.  </P> <P> April, 1989: Crowe confiscates a mannequin designed to look like a dead black  man from a white film teacher, who says it was a teaching aid.

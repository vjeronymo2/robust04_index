			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: New company seals Daf trucks rescue THE rescue of the Daf medium and heavy truck operations in the Netherlands and Belgium has been sealed with the official incorporation of the recapitalised successor company, Daf Trucks. The new company has a workforce of around 3,500, with 2,750 at Eindhoven in the Netherlands, a few in sales and service elsewhere in Europe, and 750 at Daf Trucks Flanders in Westerlo, Belgium. When Daf collapsed into receivership last month it had a workforce of 12,650 including 5,500 in the UK, 5,000 in the Netherlands and 1,500 in Belgium. Part of the top management is unchanged. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the management board of the failed Daf group, has been appointed president of Daf Trucks, while Mr Rico Dietz, Daf director of product development is to be Daf Trucks' operations director with responsibility for product development and production. Directors for finance and sales and marketing are to be appointed 'as soon as possible', while the supervisory board is expected to be formed within two weeks. Daf Trucks said sales and service subsidiaries would be established in several of the main west European markets with independent importers appointed elsewhere. The product range of the new company will be concentrated in the medium and heavy duty sectors with the 65/75/85 series and the 95 series for long distance haulage. Daf Trucks said the possible inclusion of the UK-built Leyland Daf 45 light truck in its range was 'under discussion'. Such a deal with Daf Trucks is vital for the survival of the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland in the north of England where a management buy-out is being planned.</p>

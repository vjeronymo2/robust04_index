			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Brussels postpones action on energy monopoly THE European Commission has delayed plans to take six EC countries to the European court over their respective energy monopolies, Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, said yesterday. The Commission decided to postpone its court action after two of the countries, France and the Netherlands, said they would review their national legislation. The proposed court action was a significant step for the Commission towards opening the EC energy market to competition. In May, Mr Van Miert challenged entrenched monopolies in some countries for the import and export of electricity and gas. The Commission planned to take the six countries to court, alleging that, under EC law, statutory monopolies over the import and export of electricity in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Ireland and Spain, and for gas in Denmark and France were illegal. The Commission had previously asked for more information on the monopolies and given warnings they could be illegal, but had been strongly opposed by the six countries. Previous charges against three further member states have since been dropped. In an interview with the FT newsletter EC Energy Monthly, Mr Van Miert said the Netherlands and France have confirmed their willingness to move on the issue. After a heated national debate, the Dutch announced that Article 34 of the Electricity Act which grants monopoly import and export rights to the SEP, the central power board, will be removed. France, under the new conservative government of prime minister Edouard Balladur, has now said it intends to review the monopoly powers of state-owned Electricite de France and Gaz de France. Welcoming this movement, Mr Van Miert said: 'Since this is such a touchy issue in some member states I think the willingness, confirmed in writing, to change things is really a considerable step.' The hope is now that the other four countries will also decide to re-examine their positions, making court action unnecessary. But he warned: 'If it appears that this is just a time-gaining device this will not stop the Commission from then taking action.' The whole issue of energy market liberalisation will be the subject of intense debate later in the year, when the Commission hopes to reach agreement on a proposal to further open up the energy sector to competition.</p>

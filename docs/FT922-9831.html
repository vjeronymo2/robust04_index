			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Management: Lean regime for a fitter future - The transformation of Nestle For a company which has a reputation for Swiss conservatism, Nestle has developed a remarkable habit of stirring things up. Controversial takeovers in the US, UK and Italy of famous brand companies such as Carnation, Rowntree and Buitoni have now been followed by an even bigger cause celebre: this year's successful battle royal in France for Perrier, against the Italian house of Agnelli. While the outside world had its eyes glued on the Perrier saga, Nestle's stirrers were hard at work on a much quieter but more important front: themselves. Or, more precisely, the way their 1,600-person head office is organised, and the methods by which it wields influence over Nestle's vast empire in more than 100 countries. One top manager at the normally placid corporate headquarters in Vevey, on the banks of Lake Geneva, calls the reorganisation 'the biggest revolution at Nestle for 30 years'. Not surprisingly, he says that 'it provoked a lot of internal resistance when it was first announced' - both at head office and out in the markets. Appropriately for the manufacturer of a product line called Lean Cuisine, the purpose of the reorganisation is to make Nestle slimmer, faster and more coherent. From a belt and braces giant which one of its critics complains 'is rarely first with any new product', the company is trying to turn itself into a low cost, fleet-footed innovator. Not only that, but with the regionalisation of markets in Europe and elsewhere - in some, though not all, product lines  - Nestle also wants to overcome its version of the eternal 'not invented here' syndrome. This besets companies in many industries, but nowhere more than in food, where the phenomenon encourages managers in one country to be slow to introduce products which have been successful in others. To accomplish this ambitious transformation, Nestle has taken five main actions: It has abandoned its proud but outdated history of organising its head office, and some of its country companies, on the basis of strong, functional departments such as financial control and production. Instead of allowing such specialists complete control of virtually everything that is done out in the field, most of their empires are being cut back to the bone. Some of their members have been transferred to seven newly-created 'strategic business units' (SBUs). Each of these has worldwide strategic (but not operational) responsibility for a particular set of businesses; one will deal with coffee and beverages, for example, and another with food. With a full range of functional expertise now integrated under their command, including research co-ordinators as well as production and marketing staff, these SBUs will practise what is known in management parlance as 'product management'. Though arch-rivals such as Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble mastered this activity decades ago, Nestle has never quite managed to do so. The SBUs replace Nestle's previous, half-hearted HQ effort at product management. This took the form of units misleadingly called 'product divisions'. In fact, they were merely advisory think tanks, mainly about marketing. 'Their managers had a very frustrating time - they had no way of imposing anything,' says Reto Domeniconi, Nestle's finance and administration director, who has overseen the head office reorganisation project. The only functional department which is not being dismembered is research and development, although its co-ordinators are being moved to the SBUs. Most of its other staff are already decentralised around the world. On the operational front, it is giving its regional management units much greater clout than before over the country companies beneath them. In the past, Nestle's regional managers had inadequate staff to exercise their influence properly, even though all communications between head office and country companies had to go through them. As a result, they were 'drowning in paper' as one insider puts it. Caught between powerful countries and muscular functional barons at headquarters, the various zone managements became bottlenecks in the decision making process, rather than the weighty players they were supposed to be. Now they, like the SBUs, will the previous HQ functional departments. The European zone will also have special transnational co-ordination groups for selected products, such as confectionery and petfood. As a result of these changes, Nestle is in the process of cutting the size of its headquarters by more than 12 per cent from the 1,600 registered last October. The original target was lower, but initial experience with the new organisation has shown how many - or few  - people are actually needed. Of the 200-job reduction, about 30 will be transferred to country managements. It is encouraging the principle of 'business asymmetry': the idea that each business unit can be organised differently, depending on its particular characteristics and needs; its degree of novelty or maturity, its market share, its technology-intensity, and so on. Previously the functional barons at headquarters enforced a blanket 'Nestle way' of doing things. This encouraged functional excellence, but it also landed many businesses and countries with cost structures and decision making procedures that were totally unsuitable. The production function, probably the most powerful in the company, was especially at fault here. One insider complains of its 'cumbersome gold tap and bath plug mentality'. In essence, Nestle's reorganisation is a customised variation on an eternal organisational challenge which besets all companies of any size: constant tension between centralisation and decentralisation. There is no single 'correct' combination of the two: it varies according to circumstances and over time. Nestle's reorganisation is summed up with characteristic Italianate gusto by Camillo Pagano, its much respected former marketing chief, who has just retired. 'We needed to find the right balance between the dogma of the Vatican and the energy of the periphery,' he says. For the moment, anyway, Nestle may possibly have done so.</p>

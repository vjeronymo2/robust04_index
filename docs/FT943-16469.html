			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Rothschild to put Sizewell case Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity generation company, is to hire NM Rothschild to help it make a case for building a second pressurised water reactor at Sizewell. Yesterday the group described the merchant bank as 'market leader in all areas of utility financing'. It added that the funding of another reactor would be kept separate from the issue of privatisation, for which it has already hired Morgan Stanley. Nuclear Electric, which will tomorrow report operating profits of about Pounds 760m for the year, said that privatisation remained its priority. But in the light of the government's nuclear review it needed to look at the future needs of the UK. One PWR at Sizewell in Suffolk would replace all six of the old Magnox reactors that will be taken off line in the next 10 to 12 years. Last week the group outlined an option for financing a new Sizewell power station which would require an initial government subsidy of up to Pounds 1bn. This would help it to offer a rate of return, between 11 and 12 per cent, that would attract private sector investors to fund the rest of the Pounds 3.5bn cost.</p>

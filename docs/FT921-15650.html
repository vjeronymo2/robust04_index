			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Little room for City excuses over Maxwell The collapse of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's empire will ultimately be more damaging to the City of London than any other scandal of modern times. The damage should not be measured just in terms of losses suffered by his creditors, although these are likely to be enormous - about Pounds 1.5bn for the bank lenders alone. Banks which lent him the money were foolhardy. Merchant banks which advised him - and gave him public support - were negligent, on the most generous interpretation of their behaviour. Yet again the accounting profession has failed to protect the interests of independent shareholders in a public company. The UK regulatory system has shown itself wide open to abuse. Indeed, the scandal may be as bad for the City's international standing as last year's House of Lords decision to invalidate banks' swap transactions with local authorities. In the swaps case, foreign banks complained that UK law had been shown to be inadequate in a fundamental sense for markets - financial deals, struck in good faith, were not enforceable. Now their complaint is about the glaring loopholes in the regulatory system. The question they ask is germane. How could an individual, Mr Maxwell, have been allowed such power over two substantial public companies that he was able to plunder more than Pounds 1bn from the accounts of the public companies and their pension funds? In the case of the biggest public company, Maxwell Communication Corporation, his power was unlimited. Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm acting as MCC's administrator under UK insolvency laws, has discovered that the board of MCC had delegated all its authority to Mr Maxwell, who could do what he liked to the company and its assets without deferring to anyone. As for the pension funds, Mr Maxwell took full advantage of legal niceties and his powers were almost as great. Perhaps the banks were foolish not to have inquired more deeply into these arrangements before lending him money. But MCC's non-executive directors and the independent trustees of the pension funds were worse than foolish. They were unable to fulfil their proper functions of representing the respective interests of independent shareholders and pensioners. In those circumstances, they should not have taken the Maxwell shilling. Most damaging to the reputation of anyone who worked for Mr Maxwell, or lent him money, is the fact that they had been warned of the risks. Price Waterhouse, which has had its reputation blotted by its role as auditor to the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, should gain some credit for this. In 1970, the accountants produced a report on Mr Maxwell's gross overstatement of the profits and assets of a public company, Pergamon Press. PW's analysis was the backbone of an inquiry by the then Board of Trade. Bankers have been saying recently that too much has been made of Mr Maxwell's misdemeanors in the late 1960s and the subsequent statement by the Board of Trade that he was unfit to be the director of a public company. Their only possible excuse for this is that they have never examined publicly available records. Copies of PW's report are available from the accountants' offices, but PW says no one had asked for one in 15 years until the Financial Times did this week. The most startling aspect of the PW report is that it could almost describe Mr Maxwell's plundering of his public companies in recent months. Maxwell family companies carried out vast numbers of secret transactions with Pergamon. Then, as more recently, Mr Maxwell was adept at hiding the beneficiaries and controllers of these companies. The deals were dubious, to put it mildly. Pergamon sold stock and assets to the private companies at inflated prices, in an attempt to boost profits. But payment was not always made immediately by Pergamon. In addition, contracts would sometimes be drawn up for Pergamon to re-acquire the stock or assets, protecting the private companies from loss and creating future liabilities for Pergamon. PW identified that Pounds 1.7m - Pounds 14m at today's prices - was owed to Pergamon by six of Mr Maxwell's private companies. It feared that most of this would not be recoverable. Pergamon was forced to write off most of this sum, just as MCC is expected to write off hundreds of millions in cash and assets transferred to Maxwell private interests. In other words, there was plenty of evidence that Mr Maxwell was not to be trusted with other people's money, and should not have been given unfettered control over public companies' assets worth hundreds of millions of pounds. However, the failure of most City firms to remember the Pergamon episode is not surprising. It is perhaps another version of short termism - their obsession with making near-term returns on their investment and their inability to take a long-term view of the conduct of their clients. But the behaviour of three companies is bizarre. National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies today, was Pergamon's clearing bank. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank whose subsidiaries and affiliates provided vital support to Mr Maxwell in the 1980s, led the campaign against him in 1969 on behalf of Leasco, the potential buyer of Pergamon. Finally, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte was appointed by Pergamon as its auditor after Mr Maxwell was ousted from the company - and went on to be employed by Mr Maxwell as his auditor at MCC. These three have no excuses.</p>

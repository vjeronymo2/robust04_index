			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Kolokoltseva, Aleksandr Bekker report in the </F> "Council of Ministers" column: "The Premier Is Unhappy With the  Ministers' Discipline. He Told Them So Without Witnesses"]    [Text] At yesterday's session of the Council of Ministers  Presidium the Russian Government deemed "unsatisfactory" the  general state of discipline in ministries and departments.  INTERFAX, citing government sources, reported in particular  that out of 296 presidential directives to ministries and  departments only 156 were executed in full. As SEGODNYA's  correspondents have learned, Premier Chernomyrdin's statement  was couched in extremely sharp tones. This must be why  journalists were not allowed into this session while the  "chosen" press learned about the results of the presidium  session from Mr. Grishin, deputy chief of the government press  service.    Although one of the reasons for the premier's sharp tone was  apparently his "grudge" against the vice premiers who had  earlier twice disrupted the meeting, the course of the session  shows that Viktor Chernomyrdin is in full control of the  situation and can allow himself such a style in dealing with his  cabinet. According to Mr. Grishin, the performance of the  Economy Ministry, the Finance Ministry and the State Property  Committee [Goskomimushchestvo] was criticized most toughly.  According to some reports, emergency conferences were held in  the latter two departments immediately following the end of the  session. Mr. Grishin also said that the government decided to  reprimand and reprimand severely "a number of high-ranking  officials." Furthermore, according to SEGODNYA's sources,  Anatoliy Chubays was advised to remove Valentin Sychkin as  deputy head of Goskomimushchestvo, which is effectively equal to  his dismissal. In early 1993, however, Mr. Chubays managed to  stand up for two of his deputies: Dmitriy Vasilyev and Petr  Mostovoy, whose resignation Viktor Chernomyrdin demanded  immediately after his confirmation as premier. Mr. Sychkin is  in charge of Goskomimushchestvo divisions dealing in real  estate, including Moscow real estate. According to Mr. Grishin,  the decision about the dismissal of other highly placed  executives (the reference is apparently to First Deputy Economy  Minister Andrey Shapovalyants) was postponed until their return  from business trips abroad.</p>

So said Army General Pavel Grachev, Russian defense  minister, to his U.S. counterpart William Perry during a  telephone conversation Monday evening. The conversation over  the "hot line" was conducted by the Russian defense minister  from his office and lasted around an hour.    It was the latest in a series of extraordinary telephone  contacts devoted to the situation around the Bosnian capital.  Army Gen. P. Grachev expressed concern that he still is not  clearly aware of the Bosnian Muslim side's intentions as regards  the fulfillment of NATO's demands and in particular with regard  to the Russian contingent's presence in Sarajevo. He voiced  misgivings that provocations against Russian servicemen might  bring a drastic deterioration in the situation and disrupt the  efforts being made by Russia and the NATO countries. In this  connection Pavel Grachev suggested that the U.S. side consider  Russia's proposal for a U.S. military contingent to be sent to  Sarajevo and stationed on Muslim-controlled territory.    According to Army Gen. P. Grachev, W. Perry promised to  brief  President Bill Clinton on this proposal. However, the Pentagon  chief deemed it necessary to stress that the White House does  not as yet have any plans to send its contingent to Bosnia. At  the Russian defense minister's request his U.S. counterpart  briefly explained the NATO Council's stance on the question of  the Serbian side's fulfilment of NATO's demands, which  effectively boils down to the idea that, if the Bosnian capital  is threatened again, that may be sufficient cause for bombing  raids. Without rejecting that approach, Army Gen. P. Grachev in  turn again emphasized the immutability of Russia's position,  which considers air strikes on any of the conflicting parties'  facilities to be intolerable.    At the close of the conversation the ministers expressed  their satisfaction with the level of mutual understanding and  cooperation. It was agreed to continue their contacts on Bosnia  once a week.    When asked by journalists whether the threat of bombing  should be considered to have been removed once and for all,  Pavel Grachev replied that he thinks air strikes "unlikely." As  for the additional contingent from Russia that will be sent to  Sarajevo if the State Duma gives its approval, according to the  Russian minister, it "will not necessarily be manned by airborne  troops." Units of the 27th and 46th Motorized Rifle Divisions  have been trained to perform peacekeeping functions [K  vypolneniyu mirotvorcheskikh funktsiy podgotovleni.... NB: an  alternative reading could be "Units of the 27th and 46th  Motorized Rifle Divisions have been readied to perform  peacekeeping functions].</p>

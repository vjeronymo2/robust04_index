			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Hedley Thomas] </F>   [Text] Secret accounts holding millions of dollars used by  the Mafia to bribe Italian politicians, judges and police have  been traced to Hong Kong and are set to be exposed, legal  sources said yesterday. The territory has become a focal point  for Italy's corruption investigators as they zero in on public  figures who switched bribes from Rome to numerous company  accounts in Hong Kong.    The man heading the inquiry, Judge Antonio Di Pietro, has  asked the Legal Department for permission to expose the graft to  a "blowtorch of scrutiny", a source told the SOUTH CHINA MORNING  POST. Judge Di Pietro, who requires a constant security cordon  because of his prominence and success as Italy's numero uno in  the "Clean Hands" inquiry, needs the green light from the Hong  Kong Government before he can press ahead.    "A Hong Kong judge will hold a hearing in chambers soon to  decide whether to grant the request to investigate company  accounts and question their directors in the territory," the  legal source said. "We understand that Judge Di Pietro will be  visiting Hong Kong and he will attend the hearing in chambers.  Lawyers in Hong Kong will have been instructed by the Court of  Milan to proceed with it," the source said.    Providing the proper procedure is followed and supporting  documents from the Court of Milan are all in order, the Hong  Kong judge would usually grant the request under the terms of an  international mutual legal assistance treaty.    A massive web of corruption spanning a generation of  Italians  and embroiling hundreds of elite figures including five former  prime ministers has been steadily undone since "Clean Hands" was  launched two years ago. The cost of exposing the graft tainting  Italy's judiciary, police force, parliament and private sector  has been severe, with mob retaliations including the murder of  Mafia-busting Judge Paolo Borsellino and five bodyguards.    Judge Di Pietro told an Australian Institute of Criminology  conference on Thursday that his investigations were particularly  concentrated in the territory where about 20 companies had been  operating on behalf of Italian politicians. He said Hong Kong  was favoured by politicians for holding and laundering funds,  much of which was switched to the Bahamas and Liechtenstein.    Singapore and the Cook Islands have also come under Judge Di  Pietro's focus as transit points for tainted cash. "We have  found a common denominator in these kinds of inquiries. The  utilisation of funds which were offshore or in countries with  legislation that was open to this kind of exploitation," he  said. He said the front companies involved were not only  Italian, but also multi-nationals and other foreign ventures.    A diplomat in the Italian Consulate in Hong Kong, Davide  Lacecilia, said he had no knowledge of the inquiry in the  territory. Judge Di Pietro worked independently of Italy's  consulates, he said.</p>

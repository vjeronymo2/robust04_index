			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Rebuilding careers will be hard THE businessmen acquitted in the Blue Arrow trial are likely to find rebuilding their careers an uphill struggle, although they are not without friends in the City. Mr Jonathan Cohen, 48, Mr David Reed, 44, and Mr Nicholas Wells, 37, are of an age and experience in which they could theoretically return to their pre-trial jobs as corporate finance directors. Mr Martin Gibbs, 62, took retirement in 1989. Headhunter Mr Nicholas Crossthwaite said the obstacle was not so much the public perception of the defendants as the way the City has changed since they were arrested and the narrowing job opportunities in the finance sector generally. 'They have shown good skills in the past but the market is against them,' Mr Crossthwaite said. 'Corporate finance activity is 50 per cent of what it was. People think twice now before they hire because money is tough.' Among those who have consulted headhunters in recent months is Mr Stephen Clark, the former Blue Arrow defendant who was acquitted at the direction of the judge at the trial's halfway stage in October last year. Mr Clark was group finance director at County NatWest until he was suspended on publication of the Department of Trade and Industry report in July 1989. He left the company by mutual agreement in December last year. He now says: 'Certainly in my case, being totally vindicated in a central criminal court has not left me without a considerable challenge to re-establish my career.' He is now a consultant on a securities-related project with Cripps Harries Hall, the solicitors, and has worked as a fund-raiser for the Urban Learning Foundation charity. Two of the defendants acquitted yesterday, Mr Cohen and Mr Wells, found similar consultancy jobs during their trial. However, 10 months of answering advertisments, tapping personal contacts, and visiting headhunters like Mr Crossthwaite has not got Mr Clark the job he most wants - a similar position to the one he used to hold at County NatWest. He accepts that involvement in a well publicised fraud trial has not made the search for work any easier. Former employers of the defendants yesterday mixed sympathy with a sense of relief at the court decision, but none would commit themselves to rehiring their former employees. National Westminster bank, County NatWest's parent, said in a brief statement: 'This affair has cast its shadow over these men and particularly over their families for several years. 'We are naturally very pleased that it has now been concluded for them.' Mr David Parish, vice-chairman of Charterhouse Bank, said of Mr Cohen: 'I wouldn't want to be drawn on Jonathan's personal employment prospects, although I personally have got a lot of time for him.' He added that the decision ought to lead to the removal of any bar imposed on Mr Cohen by City regulators. The Securities and Futures Authority, which approves advisers on securities and corporate finance, said it would review the position of the Blue Arrow defendants if they sought recognition. The four can take some comfort from the fact that not all the figures caught up in the recent high-profile City scandals have been forced out of the financial industry. Mr David Mayhew, a senior partner at Cazenove, the stockbroker, was able to continue work while charges in the Guinness affair hung over him, thanks to special dispensation from the SFA. Mr Charles Villiers, charged in the Blue Arrow affair, continues to work as head of corporate development at Abbey National. As one City banker put it last night: 'We are a broad church. There is a general feeling that the trial has been ridiculously handled and the defendants deserve some form of rehabilitation.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 17 KYODO -- Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's  largest computer maker, said Thursday [17 February] it has  developed an improved version of the so-called quantum effect  transistor which has both logic and memory functions in addition  to the usual on-off function.    With this special effect the multi-emitter  resonant-tunneling  hot electron transistor (ME-RHET) will help reduce the number of  components of computer chips to about one-ninth, Fujitsu  officials said.    For example, a pilot type of this transistor coupled with a  resistor can perform on par with a circuit of 18 ordinary  transistors and resistors, they said.    The new transistor is one of the major fruits of a project  supervised by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.    In line with the project aim of developing ultra-small,  quantum- effect device fabrication technology in the near  future, Fujitsu released the first version of the transistor in  1985, the officials said.</p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / International Company News: Indian Airlines chief quits after row with ministry INDIAN Airlines, the troubled state-owned carrier, has been thrown into confusion by the sudden resignation at the weekend of Mr L. Vasudev, the chairman and managing director. Mr Vasudev's departure comes at a time when the airline has been widely criticised for its records on safety and strikes, and its heavy financial losses. The immediate cause of Mr Vasudev's departure was a row between him and Mr Ghulam Nabi Azad, the aviation minister. In a letter, Mr Vasudev accused the ministry of 'systematically undermining' his role as chief executive. Mr Vasudev took office only last July, when the chairmanship had been vacant for more than six months following the resignation of his predecessor over the handling of a pilots' strike in late 1991. He also ran into trouble with the pilots who went on strike for higher pay in December 1992 during the peak season for foreign tourists and business travellers. Mr Vasudev tried to break the strike by hiring Tupolev jets and crews from Uzbekistan Airlines. He wished to instill commercially-minded management practices into the airline, which is facing increasing competition from fledgling private carriers. The attempt collapsed when a Tupolev crashed in January at New Delhi airport. No-one was seriously hurt, but the government forced the airline to accept the pilots' demands. However, in the last month, two Indian Airlines jets were hijacked, prompting an investigation into security standards, and 53 passengers were killed when another aircraft crashed at Aurangabad, in western India. Accident investigators are examining whether the aircraft, an ageing Boeing 737, had been in fit condition to fly and whether it had been overloaded. In his resignation letter, Mr Vasudev says the airline management's 'abject surrender' in the strike led to 'rank indiscipline in the organisation' and the 'greatest casualty of indiscipline' was safety.</p>

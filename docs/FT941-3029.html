			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Riot police oust Vladivostok's mayor The elected mayor of Russia's far eastern city of Vladivostok was forcibly removed from office by riot police yesterday after a raid on his office. The move, officially described as the culmination of an investigation into allegations of corruption, brings to the surface simmering disputes over reform policies in a city where the growth of a free economy has been more marked than any other in Russia, but where the state factories which provide the bulk of employment fear collapse and where the population recorded some of the highest votes for the ultra-nationalist and communist parties at the parliamentary elections last December. Mr Victor Cherepkov, elected mayor last year, was removed from the mayoral building early yesterday by some 50 OMON riot police - though later reports say he was not imprisoned and a local television report showed him lying on a bed after suffering a heart attack. The deputy mayor, Mr Vladimir Gilgenberg, was carried out of the building, according to the Tass official news agency. Mr Cherepkov, a former submarine captain, has been charged with bribery, according to Mr Veniamin Chichayev, an aide to the regional prosecutor. Mr Cherepkov has denied the corruption charges and says that political enemies have been trying to remove him before next Sunday's elections to the regional legislature. Mr Sergei Filatov, chief of staff to President Boris Yeltsin, told Tass in Moscow that the mayor had barricaded himself in his office and surrounded himself by armed men. 'It seems his supporters were following the example of the White House rebels,' he said, referring to the battle around the Russian parliament last October. Vladivostok's stock market, the most active in Russia, has boomed in recent months - by trading shares in privatised companies. Vladivostok has led the country in privatising its enterprises - but, in doing so, has appeared to trigger a reaction from the state plant directors who see their power base eroding and from workers who fear unemployment. Mr Cherepkov has been feuding for months with the Moscow-appointed governor of the Maritime Territory, Mr Yevgeny Nazdrazenko - who initiated the allegations of corruption. Mr Nazdrazenko yesterday appointed Mr Konstantin Tolstoshin, the unsuccessful candidate in last year's mayoral race, as acting mayor. Some 300 demonstrators turned out in support of Mr Cherepkov yesterday morning, carrying placards reading 'No to lawlessness' and 'Shame on the provocateurs'. Mr Vladimir Chilo, an engineer, said: 'The city is getting impossible to live in. It is drowning in dirt and no one does anything.' 'While these officials are fighting, the city is falling apart,' said Mr Vladimir Timoshenko, a taxi driver. Mr Cherepkov is considered a reformer and has spoken in favour of closer ties to the west. Mr Nazdrazenko also is believed to be pro-reform and the mayor's removal appeared initially to be part of a local dispute. Vladivostok, the base for the Russian Pacific fleet, was a closed city until two years ago. Close to the Chinese border, its economy has been buoyed by trade with its huge neighbour - but the success of Chinese traders in the city and the surrounding region has also stimulated discontent and calls for border controls.</p>

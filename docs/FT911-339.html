			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television After all the work to bring us pictures of eastern Europe after Marxism, the thought of a personal document from Czech film maker Martin Chlupac is attractive. In Open Space (7.40 BBC2) he explains how the Czechs can now afford to buy only a twentieth of the country's property, and how the new Skoda, being developed with Volkswagen, is too expensive to sell in its own country. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) investigates the fatal virus diseases which have emerged since the 1970s: is there a connection between Marbur disease, Lassa fever, and Aids? Some American scientists are convinced there is a common thread and are trying to find a means of control before the next virus results in an epidemic. The C4 series Watching The Detectives (9.00) goes to New York for a profile of the city's 'toughest and most decorated ex-policeman turned private eye', Bo Dietl. For Panorama (9.30 BBC1) Tom Mangold has spent three years investigating '20 years of obsession and betrayal'. He tells the story of James Jesus Angleton, the CIA's counter-intelligence chief during the cold war. In Film 91 (10.30 BBC1) Barry Norman talks with Dirk Bogarde about his new film 'These Foolish Things'.</p>

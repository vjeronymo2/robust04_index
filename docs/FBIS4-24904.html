			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheel Kohli in London] </F>   [Text] The London Stock Exchange (LSE) and leading British  securities house Smith New Court will be beefing up their  programme to capture Chinese business when a high-level  delegation from the Shenzhen stock exchange and senior company  directors visit London next week.    Both the LSE and Smith New Court are regarded as having  suffered during the second batch of 22 Chinese state listings,  because British securities houses have not been able to win much  business.    All secondary listings outside Hong Kong have been targeted  for New York rather than London.    Privately, British securities firms have been smarting from  the bias that appears to have been shown to U.S. firms, such as  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which have done well out of  the present tranche of H share listings.    In the three-day trip high-ranking state officials, led by  Shenzhen vice-mayor Zhang Hongyi, will meet LSE officials and  Smith New Court's chairman Sir Michael Richardson and chief  executive Michael Marks.    Liu Xinhua, the deputy commissioner for the Shenzhen  Securities and Exchange Commission, and Yu Guogang, the deputy  chief executive of the Shenzhen stock exchange, will be part of  the delegation.    In addition, directors from some of Shenzhen's largest  listed  companies will also be attending, including Liu Fengyi, director  and vice-president of the Shenzhen SEZ [Special Econmoic Zone]  Real Estate group, and Chen Pingan, director and vice-president  of China Bicycle Co Holdings.    They will arrive on Sunday morning and will stay until  Wednesday, when the U.S. stockbroker Merrill Lynch is flying the  delegation to New York for a similar exercise.    Henry Ingrouille, the London exchange's international  relations analyst who will be helping to host the visiting  delegation, said London was quickly learning from its mistakes  in not encouraging Chinese companies to list earlier, and was  now trying to rectify the situation.    The LSE will be stressing the similarity between its listing  requirements and that of Hong Kong, given that Hong Kong's  system was based on London's.    However, Mr Ingrouille admitted that the stock exchange had  sometimes been the victim of circumstance beyond its control.    "There is the political Hong Kong factor. We do get varied  messages. Some times we are told that it has no bearing, and  then we are told more informally that it does have an impact."    He said that in recent months there had been much greater  interest from Chinese companies regarding listing in London,  although he admitted that the exchange would be too late to  benefit from the present group of 22 state companies that had  been lined up for flotation.    Chinese companies are showing an increasing awareness of the  capital raising ability of London. Presently there are three  bonds fully listed on the exchange, issued by China, the  People's Bank of China, and the People's Construction Bank.    Richard Margolis, head of Smith New Court in Hong Kong, said  the delegation included seven Chinese companies, including China  Bicycle and Shenzhen SEZ Real Estate, and they would be giving  presentations at a meeting of the stockbroker's institutional  clients.    London's present efforts appear to have begun to pay off,  and  privately exchange officials expect to see secondary listings of  Chinese companies in London within the next year.    Nigel Atkinson, the exchange's head of listings, has just  returned from a trip to China, having secured a memorandum of  understanding with the Shanghai stock exchange.    Moves are presently afoot to set up a more wide-ranging  arrangement with the Chinese Securities and Regulatory  Commission.</p>

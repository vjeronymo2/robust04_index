			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Cartels appear to be forever: The diamond market has been stabilised There is an almost tangible feeling of relief in the diamond-cutting centres of Antwerp, Bombay and Tel Aviv, because the diamond producers' cartel run by De Beers of South Africa has regained its tight grip on the market. Only a few months ago, a large number of unwanted stones was flooding the market, and there were fears that rough (uncut) diamond prices might collapse. But now traders suggest that prices are getting firmer, and there are shortages of particular types of polished stones. 'Rough (diamond) buyers say the market is now in balance rather than a buyer's market as it was a few weeks ago,' says Mr Mark Cockle, editor of Diamond International, the trade publication. A few traders suggest that De Beers' first rough diamond price increase since a 5.5 per cent rise in March 1990 is not far away. However, both diamond producers and De Beers itself have incurred considerable financial pain to return the market to stability. Sales by the group's London-based Central Selling Organisation, which controls at least 80 per cent of world trade in rough diamonds, fell 13 per cent from the 1991 level to Dollars 3.147bn last year - the lowest for five years. De Beers warned last summer that it might cut its 1992 dividend in March, and industry observers say it used up all the Dollars 800m cash it had in the bank at the end of 1991 and was forced to borrow. Mr Harry Oppenheimer, whose father founded De Beers and sister company the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, and whose family still effectively has control, said recently: 'Paying dividends is a high priority, although in the nature of De Beers not necessarily the highest. The highest priority is keeping the money together to protect the diamond industry so that we'll continue to pay dividends for another 100 years.' Apart from its own production in Namibia and South Africa, De Beers has contracts to sell most of the rough diamonds produced by Angola, Australia, Botswana, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Tanzania and Zaire. It operates a 'buffer pool', stocking diamonds in bad times and liquidating stocks when demand runs ahead of supply. Rough stones are released to the market in a controlled stream, through 'sights' offered by the CSO 10 times a year to about 160 carefully chosen buyers. De Beers offers the quantities and types of diamonds that its market intelligence network indicates the market can absorb. Each buyer is offered boxes of diamonds costing between Dollars 500,000 and Dollars 25m and has to accept or reject them all. Traders maintain that the CSO reduced the value of diamonds on offer at each of the last five sights of 1992 to a total of about Dollars 300m - low by recent standards. At the same time, De Beers told diamond producers to cut their previously agreed deliveries by 25 per cent (permitted under CSO contracts at times of stress), which means the company's stockpile is not growing at such a fast rate. Last year De Beers also had to cope with an unexpected flow of rough diamonds from Angola where, at its peak, about 50,000 private enterprise diggers were picking stones from dried-up river beds. The stones were smuggled out of Angola, mainly to Antwerp, where De Beers tried to buy them. At the height of the rush, De Beers' buyer in Antwerp spent nearly Dollars 40m in one week. The group estimates that about Dollars 500m worth of stones was smuggled out of Angola last year, representing a 10 per cent addition to world supply. This compares with Angolan production of about 1m carats of rough diamonds worth about Dollars 100m in 1991. Renewed political tension and war in the country recently has stopped the smuggling and even brought an end to the government's own diamond production. Rumours of substantial smuggling out of Russia have also dogged the market. However, De Beers says the five-year marketing contract signed in 1990 with the then Soviet Union allowed 5 per cent of production to be sold outside the cartel. The rough diamonds surfacing in Moscow for export to the west outside the cartel's channels are mainly from this source, according to De Beers. When the contract was signed, De Beers advanced the Soviet Union a Dollars 1bn loan, and Soviet diamond stocks were moved from Moscow to London as collateral. De Beers says that, in spite of the subsequent political changes, Russia has kept its side of the deal and paid interest on the loan on time. Mr Michael Coulson, analyst at the Credit Lyonnais Laing financial services group, says it is good news for the diamond market that stability has been achieved at CSO sales levels above those seen through much of the 1980s (see chart). But he suggests there will have to be substantial growth in demand - about 6 per cent a year following a 'recovery' year with 12 per cent growth  -to absorb all potential supply by the late 1990s. Ironically, much of the extra supply is coming from De Beers's new R1.1bn Venetia mine in the northern Transvaal which, when in full production later this year, will become South Africa's biggest diamond mine. Mr Coulson says: 'Some suggest it won't be until 1998 that the market will be entirely in balance - and the CSO will still be left with a substantial diamond stockpile to finance.' De Beers is looking east to help mop up the extra supply. Having developed the Japanese appetite for diamonds virtually from scratch over the past decade, the company is looking to new markets in China and India by the end of the 1990s.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Washington in steel row THE US was yesterday subjected to a barrage of criticism from trading partners over its decision last month to impose swingeing anti-dumping duties on imports of steel from 19 countries, including seven EC member states. The issue will be pressed by Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, when he meets Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, in Washington tomorrow. Sir Leon will also be taking up the US threat to shut EC companies out of bidding for federal contracts, and the continuing standoff in the Uruguay Round global trade talks. At a stormy meeting of Gatt's governing council, the US anti-dumping, and earlier anti-subsidy, duties on steel were variously described as 'unwarranted and unjustified', 'unfair', 'disturbing' and a threat to world steel trade and the Uruguay Round. The EC, which said the duties were the latest measure in 'a massive assault on the world steel market' by the US, has already sought talks with the US as the first step to a formal Gatt complaint. Brazil, which put the item on the council agenda, said it too had sought consultations. Support came for renewed talks on a Multilateral Steel Agreement, which would phase out steel tariffs in return for elimination of most subsidies. MSA talks broke down last spring but are scheduled to begin afresh later this month. Gatt members were angry that the anti-dumping duties, provisional until the US International Trade Commission rules on whether dumping has injured US producers, relate to imports already covered by voluntary restraint arrangements. Over 80 anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits were filed by US steel makers weeks after the 10-year-old VRAs expired after March 1992. Gatt's council yesterday approved membership terms for the Czech and Slovak republics, which separated at the end of last year, and granted Azerbaijan, the former Soviet republic, observer status. Swaziland has become Gatt's 106th member. Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

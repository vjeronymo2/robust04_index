			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> DEFENSIVE EFFORT POWERS BELL-JEFF TO 1ST-ROUND WIN OVER MIRALESTE  </P> <P> A hawking defense and a high-scoring offense powered Bell-Jeff High to the  final of the Southern Section 1-A Division playoffs last year. The Guards used  those same elements to defeat Miraleste, 73-53, in a first-round game of the  2-AA Division playoffs Wednesday night at Bell-Jeff.  </P> <P> Trailing, 11-10, at the end of the first quarter, Bell-Jeff outscored  Miraleste, 20-9, in the second quarter. The Guards forced 14 of Miraleste's 32  turnovers during the period and made 10 of 16 shots from the field.  </P> <P> "We switched up our defenses on them," Bell-Jeff Coach Joe Dunn said. "And it  seemed to confuse them."  </P> <P> The Guards went from a halfcourt trap to a fullcourt man-to-man defense that  led to several easy baskets. In addition, Nick Sanderson scored eight of his  game-high 30 points in the second period after going scoreless in the first  quarter.  </P> <P> "Nick was forcing some shots early in the game," Dunn said. "But we got our  double screen in the lane going in the second quarter and he's hard to stop  then."  </P> <P> Bell-Jeff (20-4), which snapped a two-game losing streak, also outrebounded the  taller Marauders, 29-22.  </P> <P> Sanderson had nine rebounds and guard Chris Dyer had eight to go with 13 points  and five assists.  </P> <P> In other first-round games:  </P> <P> 5-AA DIVISION  </P> <P> St. Monica 79, Royal 56 -- John McFarland scored a game-high 23 points,  including 10 in a pivotal third quarter, to lead St. Monica (20-5) at home. St.  Monica outscored Royal, 22-11, in the third quarter to overcome a 35-33  halftime deficit.  </P> <P> J. P. Ouellette and Russell Myers each had 18 points for Royal (12-13), which  made its first playoff appearance in 17 years.  </P> <P> 4-AA DIVISION  </P> <P> Crespi 51, Warren 48 (2 OTs) -- Crespi survived a tough Warren match-up zone to  advance to the second round with the win at home. Ken Lynch scored 18 points  and had 10 rebounds. Chris McGee had a chance to give Crespi (11-11) the win in  regulation but missed a 15-foot jump shot at the buzzer.  </P> <P> McGee, who scored 11 points, hit a three-point shot with 34 seconds left in the  first overtime to send the game into the second extra period.  </P> <P> Westlake 70, Whittier 57 -- The Warriors scored 14 unanswered points at the  outset and Kurt Schwan scored a game-high 29 points and had 11 rebounds to lead  host Westlake.  </P> <P> Jeff Maurer added 16 points for Westlake (16-9), which converted 18 of 37  field-goal attempts (48.6%).

			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUEBEC PANEL BARS BID FOR BIG BLOCK OF CINEPLEX STOCK  </P> <P> The Quebec Securities Commission on Tuesday turned down Cineplex Odeon Chairman  Garth H. Drabinsky's bid to buy -- with other investors -- a 30% stake in his  company from the Charles R. Bronfman family. The ruling dealt a serious blow to  Drabinsky's hopes of seizing control of the movie theater concern without  making a tender offer to other shareholders.  </P> <P> On another front, however, the regulators' decision gave no clue as to how  several other thorny issues affecting the Toronto company will be resolved. The  company has been in turmoil ever since its largest shareholder, MCA Inc., told  a Canadian court last week that MCA and Bronfman representatives on the  Cineplex board had been "extremely critical" of management's financial  reporting practices.  </P> <P> The MCA allegation has potentially embarrassed the powerful Bronfman clan as it  attempted to get out of its Cineplex holdings. The Bronfmans have three  representatives on Cineplex's 16-member board and, like MCA, have a seat on the  audit committee. If the sale to Drabinsky collapses, analysts privately ask  whether the Bronfmans can sell to another group or in the open market if the  family has inside information of an adverse nature about Cineplex's accounting.  </P> <P> The upshot could be a long battle for control, creating a situation that  invites a change in management or ownership of the 10-year-old company.  </P> <P> Some analysts have even speculated that the Bronfmans and MCA might band  together to call for Drabinsky's resignation or try to unseat him at Cineplex's  annual shareholders meeting scheduled next month. But under the terms of its  standstill agreement with Cineplex, MCA must use its 33% voting stake to fill  its own five seats on the Cineplex board and has no role in electing the other  directors.  </P> <P> Neither the Bronfmans nor Drabinsky provided any clues Tuesday about their next  actions, but they are expected to meet with other Cineplex directors on  Thursday at a board meeting that could prove crucial to Cineplex's future.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Match Offer  </P> <P> MCA has urged the board to form a committee of independent directors to weigh  Drabinsky's plan to seize control. Interestingly, in a letter made public at  the Securities and Exchange Commission, MCA also urged the Cineplex board to  find out whether other parties might be interested in making a bid for the  company -- and took pains to express its own lack of interest in acquiring  control.  </P> <P> If, however, another party makes an "acceptable" bid for Cineplex or any of its  U.S. movie theaters, MCA appears to have the right, under its standstill  agreement, to match the offer and acquire the U.S. theaters in question.  </P> <P> The Cineplex board was scheduled to meet last Thursday, but the meeting was  canceled by Drabinsky, sources said. That same day, MCA Vice President Charles  S. Paul went into a Canadian court and submitted his affidavit that disclosed  MCA's criticisms of Cineplex management, winning an injunction against the  Drabinsky group to prevent its purchase of the Bronfman stake.  </P> <P> Cineplex had the injunction set aside early this week, but the Quebec  Securities Commission ruling has effectively granted MCA's wish to halt the  deal. MCA won't appeal the ruling that set aside the injunction, said Ian  Currie, a Toronto attorney who represents MCA. According to Currie, his client  is now "waiting to see what happens, the ball being in (Drabinsky's) court."  </P> <P> Neither Drabinsky nor Bronfman attorney Michael Vineberg of Montreal returned a  reporter's phone calls.  </P> <P> Mark Hayes, a Toronto attorney who is representing Drabinsky, said his client  is not expected to appeal Tuesday's decision by Quebec regulators. "The QSC  ruling is fairly clear. As far as I know, our clients are going to abide by  it," Hayes said.  </P> <P> In the ruling, the Quebec regulatory agency said it rejected the Drabinsky  group's request to acquire the Bronfman stake because, in its opinion, it  "would be detrimental to the protection of investors and to the proper  functioning of the securities market." The commission also refused to grant an  alternative proposal put forth by the Drabinsky group that would have allowed  it to acquire a smaller stake of 5 million shares. The commission ordered the  group to resubmit any new proposed agreement related to the Bronfman holdings.  </P> <P> Cineplex stock closed Tuesday at $13.125 a share, down 25 cents, in composite  trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGMENTS ON THE KCBS 'OFFICE ROMANCE'  </P> <P> When Bree Walker says "I don't think it has anything to do with my  news-gathering abilities . . ." in defense of her apparent adulterous actions,  it reminds me of Gary Hart.  </P> <P> He used the same words in a vain attempt to defend his ability to run the  country after being accused by the press and finally admitting the adultery  during a presidential campaign.  </P> <P> It's time the Fourth Estate stopped having it both ways. If you are going to  call politicians to judgment on moral grounds, you must open yourselves to  moral scrutiny.  </P> <P> If I have a right to know the integrity of my political representatives as  defined by their personal lives, I have a right to know the same of my  journalistic representatives.  </P> <P> After all, the fact is that journalists have as much influence as politicians  over the life of the average citizen.  </P> <P> BARRY COLMAN, Long Beach  </P></p>

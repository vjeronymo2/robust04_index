			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Big fall in construction orders: Retail sales growth slackened in May, CBI survey shows The uneven pace of Britain's economic recovery was highlighted yesterday by a marked decline in construction orders in the three months to April, and signs of an unexpectedly subdued growth of retail sales in May. A big fall in British construction orders for road, rail and other infrastructure projects this spring has prompted concern that the pace of the building and civil engineering recovery may be starting to slow as public spending cuts begin to take effect. At the same time, the Confederation of British Industry's latest survey of distributive trades showed a drop in the numbers of retailers reporting year on year growth of sales in May compared with April. The fall disappointed City analysts, who expected the survey to show a continuation of April's strong sales growth. But the CBI pointed out there was little sign that the tax increases in April had significantly dented consumer demand. Economists are awaiting news today of last month's unemployment trends and tomorrow's official retail sales data to establish the state of the recovery. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will outline in his Mansion House speech tonight how he hopes to maintain steady growth with low inflation. Figures published yesterday by the Environment Department showed that the value of infrastructure orders at constant 1990 prices fell by 39 per cent during the three months to the end of April compared with the previous three months. Infrastructure orders also were a sixth lower than during the corresponding period last year. Construction orders overall fell by 14 per cent compared with the previous three months although they remained 6 per cent higher than during the corresponding period in 1993. More encouraging were rises in private industrial and commercial orders which increased by 16 per cent and 26 per cent respectively compared with a year ago. Private housing orders were also 17 per cent higher than a year ago although 3 per cent lower than during the previous three months - providing further evidence of a recent wobble in the housing market recovery previously reported by building societies and estate agents. A sharp decline in infrastructure orders had been expected following the bunching of large contracts placed for the Jubilee Line extension towards the end of last year. The fall, however, was greater than expected according to the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors which said it 'had not expected the year-on-year decline to reach double figures'. Road orders in current prices fell by 18 per cent to Pounds 470m compared with the previous three months. Orders worth Pounds 69m in April were the lowest monthly total since June last year.

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / French company licenses abortion pill for US trial THE French pharmaceuticals company Roussel-Uclaf has agreed to license its controversial RU-486 abortion pill to the Population Council, a New York-based non-profit group, for tests and production in the US. The company has been particularly reluctant to market the drug in the US, because anti-abortion groups have threatened to boycott its other products. The US Food and Drug Administration complained that Hoechst, Roussel-Uclaf's German majority shareholder, blocked the licensing of RU-486 to another US producer.</p>

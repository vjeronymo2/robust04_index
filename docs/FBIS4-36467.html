			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aluf Ben and 'Aqiva Eldar] </F>   [Excerpts] The United States is drafting its own proposal  for an Israeli-Syrian peace arrangement, in an attempt to break  the impasse in the peace negotiations between the two countries.  Information recently obtained by senior officials in Jerusalem  indicates that the U.S. peace team is now formulating the U.S.  position on issues disputed by Jerusalem and Damascus, although  the administration has not decided yet whether the U.S.  intervention should start as soon as during Secretary of State  Warren Christopher's upcoming shuttle tour scheduled for the end  of June, or whether it would be preferable to wait till the end  of the summer.    It was further revealed that yesterday, senior U.S.  Administration officials told Israeli officials that Damascus  had encouraged Jordan to launch normalization moves with Israel  at once, in a bid to prepare the ground for Syrian advancement  toward a peace agreement with Israel. [passage omitted]    Information reaching Jerusalem indicates that the emerging  U.S. Administration proposal is based on the premise that Israel  will withdraw from the entire Golan Heights; it focuses on  detailed specifications of security arrangements, normalization  steps, and arrangement implementation timetables.    The administration is currently weighing whether  Christopher's upcoming tour is the right time to present the  U.S. position. According to information received in Jerusalem,  Dennis Ross favors immediate U.S. intervention, while the  secretary of state prefers to let Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin  and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad "stew in their own juices"  for two or three more months, until they either agree to  relinquish their rigid stances or ask for U.S. intervention in  the negotiations.    U.S. and Israeli sources are convinced that Syria is behind  the positive change in Jordan's stand at the tripartite talks in  Washington. They believe that President al-Asad does not want  to launch rapprochement steps with Israel before Jordan, and his  positive signals to Jordan gave rise to expectations for a  crucial development in the upcoming meeting between President  Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.

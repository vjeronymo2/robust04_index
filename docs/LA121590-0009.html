			<p><P> December 15, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY  </P> <P> Please, oh please, Marshal Phillips, stop blaming me, then everyone but the  individual for personal misfortune. In his column about AIDS, Phillips blames  the high infection rate among gay males to have partly resulted "by society's  lack of support in promoting stable couples among that population."  </P> <P> What about the other part -- the part about personal responsibility? Sorry, but  I am not taking the blame for one more AIDS victim, drug addict, illiterate  dropout, criminal or greedy deviant.  </P> <P> As is easy to see, society is deteriorating at a frightening rate, producing  and looking the other way at these weaknesses. And the rest of the population  is forced to carry the burden of every over-aged, irresponsible crybaby who  squeals. Enough!  </P> <P> SUSAN DRACOULES, Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

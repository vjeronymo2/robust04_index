			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Economics Notebook: A cool look at the costs of global warming THE environment is a bit like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire cat where economic policy-making is concerned. Environmental arguments loom as large as life if they can be used to bolster the case for unpopular measures. At other times, however, the environmental cause fades even when it may be vitally important to the future physical and economic welfare of the nation concerned. Take two recent examples. In his March Budget, Britain's chancellor Mr Norman Lamont cited last year's agreement in Rio de Janeiro on a new UN convention on climate change as the reason for imposing value added tax on domestic fuel and power from 1994 and for UK government plans to increase road fuel duties by an average 3 per cent a year in real terms in future Budgets. Less than a month later, Mr Lamont was in Tokyo at the Group of Seven finance and foreign ministers' meeting to decide western help for Russia. Although Mr Lamont's Budget speech had referred to the possible need for further co-ordinated international action on global warming, he and his G7 colleagues failed to consider any such plan when working out how best to help Russia. Admittedly, Russia's problems of slumping output, incipient hyperinflation and policy gridlock were and are pressing. Moreover, the perceived need of the West to provide speedy support for President Boris Yeltsin probably precluded an elaborate link between western support for economic reform and action to clean up Russia's environment. But Mr Lamont's Budget speech referred to the Rio convention on climate change as a 'milestone in international efforts to halt global warming'. If it is that important, it clearly merited being taken into account in the discussions over Russia's economic policy. The reason why is spelt out in a recent work* from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. This makes clear that efforts to control global warming by limiting the emission of greenhouse gasses cannot succeed if they are confined to the industrial countries. Russia and the other former communist countries of the Soviet Union and eastern Europe have - alongside India and China - a key role to play in limiting the output of carbon dioxide, the most important man-made greenhouse gas, in the next 50 years. Using an econometric model, known as GREEN, the OECD has concluded that its 24 industrialised member states would need to cut emissions by 44 per cent compared with the level that could be expected on a 'business-as-usual' basis if they were to act alone in the spirit of Rio to stabilise their CO emissions at 1990 levels in the period to 2050. But this effort, which would inevitably cost output, would reduce world emissions by only 11 per cent from what they would otherwise be. 'Thus', the OECD says, 'action to tackle the climate change issue must involve the major non-OECD countries emitters - China, India and the former Soviet Union.' At first sight, Russia is not the biggest problem. On a business-as-usual basis, the OECD projects that China and India, with their much larger populations and relatively unsophisticated technologies, will increase carbon emissions by an annual average of 3.7 and 3.9 per cent respectively in the period from 1990 to 2050. By contrast, the growth of carbon emissions in the former Soviet Union is projected at 1.4 per cent a year on average. In the OECD area, emissions would grow by 1 per cent a year if no action is taken. On the other hand, Russia and the other former Soviet republics top the international league table for subsidising domestic energy prices. The OECD study makes clear that only the western industrial countries actually tax energy. Coal prices in China and India are kept lower than marginal costs. At the time of writing, the administered oil prices in the former Soviet Union were only a tenth of the world prices because recent increases in the official oil price had been offset by successive rouble devaluations. Russia's domestic oil prices have fluctuated wildly in relation to the world price in recent months but are now estimated at only 4 per cent of world prices compared with about one third last autumn. The OECD study estimates that worldwide energy subsidies (net of taxes in the industrial countries) amount to Dollars 235bn (Pounds 152bn) in 1985 prices and exchange rates, which is equivalent to a subsidy of Dollars 45 per ton of carbon pumped into the atmosphere. Subsidies in the former Soviet Union alone totalled Dollars 163bn, an implicit subsidy of Dollars 175 a ton of carbon produced, it says. Eliminating energy subsidies worldwide could go a long way to cutting carbon dioxide emissions. Calculations based on the GREEN model suggest that such a reform would cut world emissions by almost 20 per cent below business-as-usual levels in 2050 while also raising the real income of many non-OECD countries by improving the efficiency with which energy resources are used. US and UK officials argue that the International Monetary Fund's economic reform programme for Russia should go some way to reducing such subsidies as Russia brings its energy prices into line with world market levels. But if - and it may be a big if - we are to take global warming seriously, it is difficult not to conclude that the G7 missed a trick in its recent negotiations in Tokyo. Although it is always possible to dispute the assumptions behind, and results from, econometric exercises such as GREEN, the OECD's figures suggest that a huge effort will have to made in both the industrialised and non-industrialised countries to limit emissions of greenhouse gases. Making the environment a clear part of the G7 assistance for Russia would have provided a useful precedent for the international co-operation agreements that will be needed to turn the aspirations of last year's Rio earth summit into reality. *The economic costs of reducing CO emissions.

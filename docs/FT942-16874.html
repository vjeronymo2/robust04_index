			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / European groups plan replacement jet for Concorde: Companies seek aid for Pounds 10bn project Europe's three leading aerospace groups are to join forces in a feasibility study for a supersonic passenger aircraft to succeed the Anglo-French Concorde. British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Germany's Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) hope that their study will lead to the production of an aircraft for the second half of the next decade. They will be seeking cash aid from national governments and from Brussels for the project, which is estimated to cost the makers as much as Dollars 15bn (Pounds 10.20bn) for a maximum demand of 1,000 aircraft. One company said the project, the European Supersonic Research Programme (ESRP), needed Dollars 100m a year in initial investment. Two of the three companies, BAe and Aerospatiale, designed and built the existing Concorde. While that project was loss-making and abandoned with only a handful built, the aircraft has proved a success story for British Airways, which operates seven of the 100-seat aircraft. The normal Concorde return fare between London and New York is more than Pounds 5,000 and the airline takes more than Pounds 150m a year in ticket revenues from its small fleet. Concorde is limited, however, to North Atlantic routes because of its 3,720 miles range. Since the aircraft's development in the 1970s, the growth of Asian economies has created a market linking Europe and east Asia and across the Pacific, which requires an aircraft with greater range. The outline specification for the ESRP calls for an aircraft with a range of 6,200 miles, seats for 250 passengers and a speed of Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. BAe said that if the project went ahead, an aircraft could be flying by the second half of the next decade. 'We want to keep Europe's lead in supersonic passenger aircraft,' the company said. The ESRP companies would share research costs equally in the project, which would focus on materials, engines, systems and aerodynamics, according to Dasa, the loss-making Daimler-Benz subsidiary that holds the German stake in the European Airbus. The three companies have been part of an international aircraft development study group embracing US, Japanese, Italian and Russian companies, Dasa said. But the trio has now decided to press ahead with its own design. BAe said it spent less than Pounds 5m on pre-feasibility study research last year. It has been in discussion with the UK Department of Trade and Industry about assistance for the new project. It said that research for the engine for a Concorde successor was 'a parallel project' involving the UK company Rolls-Royce, one of the world's three main manufacturers of commercial aero engines. Spin-offs from the project could include technology for use in future subsonic passenger aircraft, Dasa said.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Firstland makes Pounds 5m move into packaging FIRSTLAND Group proposes to buy Gelpack Industrial, a private industrial packaging company, for Pounds 4.8m under a reorganisation that will transform the USM-quoted oil and gas company into a packaging business listed on the main market, writes Walton Morais. Firstland, suspended since September 15 pending the reorganisation, will change its name to Britton Group and fund the acquisition by a placement of 102m new ordinary shares with private and institutional investors to raise Pounds 5.1m before expenses. Mr Simon Beart, finance director, who with Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, led a management buy-in last March with the aim of diversifying into an industrial group with stable earnings, said Gelpack was involved in a low-volume, high-margin niche sector of a growing market. It had been showing strong growth in pre-tax profit recently, jumping from Pounds 214,000 in the year ended June 30 1990 to Pounds 706,000 in 1991 and Pounds 1.05m in 1992. Turnover expanded from Pounds 7.93m to Pounds 11.03m and Pounds 11.55m. Firstland will want to dispose of its remaining oil and gas business quickly; probably below the estimated book value of Pounds 3m for its operating oil and gas wells in Oklahoma and the Gulf of Mexico. The reorganisation will include a capital reduction and elimination of the deficit on the profit and loss account. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the directors intend to recommend a final dividend payable in mid-1993 for the year 1992. For the first half Firstland reduced its loss from Pounds 455,000, which included a Pounds 285,000 exceptional charge, to Pounds 87,000, on turnover of Pounds 201,000 (Pounds 233,000). Losses per share were 0.34p (2.05p).</p>

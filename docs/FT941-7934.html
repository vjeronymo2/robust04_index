			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Need for subsidies will threaten rail network Sir, Having been one of the few national newspapers actively supporting railway privatisation, the Financial Times can hardly complain if it doesn't like the way it is turning out ('Selling the railways', February 21). Far from the new track charges meaning that 'fewer of the franchises will be profitable without public subsidy', they mean that 23 out of the 24 are already loss-making. The exception, to no-one's surprise, is Gatwick Express. I say already because the new train leasing charges have yet to be announced. I calculate that these will add a further Pounds 600m to operating costs. Thus, not only will all franchises have to be subsidised, they will have to be heavily subsidised. And while, as you point out, it is a money merry-go-round, the grant needed to get the merry-go-round turning will be more than over Pounds 2bn, roughly double the present Public Service Obligation (PSO). This perceived doubling of railway subsidies must present a serious threat to the future stability of the network since it suggests that railways are an irredeemably inefficient form of transport, reinforcing existing prejudices in certain quarters of Whitehall.

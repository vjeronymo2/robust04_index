			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Prosperity Party [RP] General Chairman Necmettin  Erbakan, in Adil Ekonomik Duzen [Just Economic  Order], the book he wrote in 1991, proposed "miraculous  prescriptions" in explaining the economic system they would use  if they assumed power. He included solutions peculiar to  socialist economies in the system, in which everyone would have  retirement insurance without making payments, interest is  described as oppression, and prepaid vouchers and low prices are  promised. The book contains radical changes in everything from  taxation to unemployment prevention without mentioning where the  resources would come from to do it.    Some of Erbakan's economic prescriptions follow:    --How the slavery system exploits us: Our  diagnostic brochure explains clearly that the slavery system  exploits us through the five germs of interest and capitalism.  These germs are: the interest germ, the unfair taxation germ,  the mint germ, the exchange rate germ, and the credit system  germ.    --Basic principles of the Just Economic Order: As  known, a mathematical system is expressed in basic terms that  describe the system. For example, Euclidean geometry is based  on three fundamental axioms, whereas Lobachevski geometry is  based on three different axioms. Numerals, of course, are based  on four axioms.    Likewise, there are basic principles that allow a game of  checkers to be played, just as there are basic principles  exclusive to chess that allow that game to be played.    (These two kinds of geometry are different from each other  from the standpoint of the postulates -- accepted basic truths  -- that comprise their foundations. This is especially clear in  the "parallel postulate": Euclid--In the ancient  Greek geometry of 4 BC, only one parallel may be drawn to a  straight line from a point outside it.  Lobachevski--In the geometry of the 18th [as  published] century Russian Academy of Science, it is possible to  draw an infinite number of parallels to a straight line from a  point outside it.)    --Regulatory services: In the Just Economic Order,  the state also provides regulatory services for basic economic  goods. In the Just Economic Order, for example, a Wheat  Foundation would take the place of today's Soil Products Office.  This organization is renamed as a foundation because it  renounces any goal of profit and becomes an organization solely  for the service of the citizen. This foundation would be  organized at the city level throughout the entire country.  Anyone who had wheat and wished to sell it would give the wheat  to this foundation and receive payment at that day's price. Or  anyone wishing to buy wheat would pay at the current price and  receive as much wheat as he wanted.    --"No interest" principle: There would be no  interest in the Just Order. For interest is unfair and  oppressive. The man who accepts interest is like the man who  drinks the tears and consumes the flesh and blood of the poor  and needy. One who drinks blood is a vampire. The reasoning  offered in order to suppress these facts and, knowingly or  unknowingly, defend the capitalistic interest system is:    "Money is a special commodity, because a great deal of  expense is gone to and effort expended to preserve its stability  and value. Property is rented, so why shouldn't money be rented  also? Interest is something like rental and, therefore, is  right, as capital is an element of production."    --Principle of money as equivalent of land, plant,  standard commodity, gold and foreign exchange: It is  possible to divide goods which may be bought and sold into four  groups in the Just Order. They are land, plant, standard  commodities, and gold and foreign exchange, or precious minerals  and values, which have been offered for sale. Whatever the  amount at which these are offered for sale, money exists in that  amount to purchase them. Money cannot be poured into the  marketplace in exchange for anything else than these goods which  may be bought and sold.    --Work on credit: Suppose a sewing machine  operator makes 5 million Turkish liras a month under the Just  Order. I would hire these people and put them to work. The bank,  or the state, would pay their salaries and I would be the  borrower as the entrepreneur, the owner of the factory. I would  then sell the clothing I produced and pay my debt.    --Hold credit: I have some wheat. Prices are cheap  right now, and I'm thinking prices will be higher in 3 months,  so I deliver my wheat to the wheat foundation on condition [of  future sale]. I receive, for example, 80 percent of the present  price as credit on the wheat being held. When prices increase 3  months later, I say that I'll sell my wheat at today's prices, I  get the rest of the price at that time and I'm paying off the  hold credit I received.    --Paid tax-equivalent credit: If someone has  occasion to receive income from the state, he may receive credit  in accordance with specific criteria and under specific  conditions from the state, depending on the income in question.  The name of this credit is "paid tax-equivalent credit."    --What is taxation?: All taxes, funds, and  deductions that have been imposed under various names are  totally unfair and all of them must be abolished.    --Social security: A person receives the  compensation that is right for the amount of time he works. When  he is unemployed, he receives unemployment compensation. When he  wishes to retire, he receives retirement compensation. Suppose a  worker receives 5 million liras a month while employed, 4  million liras when unemployed, and 3 million liras when he  retires. There is no need for this person to wait until a  specific age to retire and receive a retirement pension. If he  wishes, he may retire and opt for the retirement pension. If he  desires to work again later, he may return to active working  life.</p>

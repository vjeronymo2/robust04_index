			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEATH OF WRITER EDWARD ABBEY  </P> <P> It was with great sadness that I learned of the death of author Edward Abbey. I  will not be able to think of the arid beauty of northern Arizona or Utah's  Canyonlands without his writings coming to mind.  </P> <P> I hope that his publishers will release the draft of his last novel. A sequel  to "The Monkey Wrench Gang" will be welcomed with open arms.  </P> <P> Thank you, Mr. Abbey, for your thought-provoking plots and rich characters that  will continue to defend the red rock country from the fences and pavement of  land developers, and rest assured that Hayduke lives!  </P> <P> BRUCE NOLTE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

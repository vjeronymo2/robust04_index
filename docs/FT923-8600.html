			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sprungli rejects top job rumours MR RUDOLPH Sprungli, chairman of Lindt und Sprungli, said that neither he nor his new wife would take over the position of chief executive of the fine chocolate group. 'Giving my wife, Alexandra Sprungli-Gantenbein, operative responsibility in the management is not being considered,' Mr Sprungli said in a statement. Speculation that he himself would become chief executive was also wide of the mark. Mr Sprungli, 72, was responding to speculation in the Swiss press that his new wife, who is 28 years his junior, would become chief executive as early as next month. The former chief executive, Mr Ulrich Geissmann, resigned last week after the Sprungli's marriage was announced. Last May, when the couple's engagement became known, allegations were made that Mrs Gantenbein, a sometime adherent of an obscure theosophical sect, had improper influence on the appointment of Lindt &amp; Sprungli executives. A study by accountants KPMG found that she had influence but that decisions were made by responsible directors. Mr Sprungli said in his statement that she had never worked for the company, but had only been his personal adviser on personnel matters. Lindt &amp; Sprungli shares remained unusually active on the Zurich Stock Exchange yesterday, but closed down only SFr100 at SFr12,900. Last Wednesday, they sank to SFr10,900 following the resignation of Mr Geissmann.</p>

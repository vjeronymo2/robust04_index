			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Anger over Fondiaria L1,058bn rights issue INSURANCE analysts have voiced almost unanimous disapproval to Monday night's surprise announcement of a L1,058bn (Dollars 724.16m) rights issue by Fondiaria, Italy's third biggest private-sector insurer. The insurer reported 1992 group losses of L578bn. 'This is a return to the bad old days of ignoring minority shareholders, just at a time when Italy is supposed to be changing,' said one angry London-based broker. Shares in Fondiaria, controlled by the debt-laden Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, fell sharply in Milan yesterday in response to the 2-for-1 rights issue, priced at L6,500 a share. Fondiaria stock fell by over 10 per cent to L24,101 from L26,843 as investors cut their losses by selling their holdings. The rights issue, which will halve Fondiaria's total group debts of L2,368bn, is seen as a barely veiled debt-for-equity swap by Ferfin's five main creditor banks, which are underwriting the deal. Gaic, the listed holding company which owns about 40 per cent of Fondiaria, is not expected to take up its rights. Gaic is 80 per cent-owned by Ferfin and the heirs of Mr Camillo De Benedetti. Ferfin owns about 11 per cent of Fondiaria independently of Gaic. Neither is thought to be in a position to acquire additional shares. On that basis, the five underwriters - Mediobanca, Banca Commerciale Italiana, Banca di Roma, Credito Italiano and Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino - will end up with about 30 per cent of Fondiaria. The underwriters' stake could be appreciably higher if minority investors in Fondiaria fail to take up their rights. Separately, Mediobanca owns about 15 per cent of Fondiaria, while Generali, the Italian insurer with which it is closely allied, has about 7 per cent. The fact that the rights issue is roughly the same size as Fondiaria's L1,105bn group debts to banks has reinforced fears that control is effectively being transferred to Ferfin's main bankers without launching a public tender offer, in the first step in the gradual dismemberment of the Ferruzzi empire. Such transfers of control have been made more difficult under new stock market rules, but remain possible. Although Fondiaria's future is still unclear, the group is not expected to survive in its present form in the long term. Separately, shares in Ferfin and its subsidiaries continued falling heavily on the Milan stock exchange, bringing down the stock of the group's five main creditor banks and most of the market in their wake. Trading in Montedison, Ferfin's main industrial operation, was suspended for the second day running as dealers failed to fix a price between vendors and purchasers owing to the weight of selling pressure. The stock was eventually fixed at L779 for a fall of 20.1 per cent. Shares in Ferfin also plunged, by 10.4 per cent to L593.5 from L662.3 on Monday, while the Gaic holding company, which controls the Fondiaria insurance group, quoted at L815 on Monday failed to find a price.</p>

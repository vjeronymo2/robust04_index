			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / African to head UN food agency AN AFRICAN has been chosen to head the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation for the first time in its 48-year history after a Chilean rival withdrew and urged his backers to keep the post 'in the developing world'. Mr Jacques Diouf of Senegal was elected as director-general of the FAO, which is the largest of the UN's specialised agencies. He won an eight-cornered contest on the sixth ballot of FAO-member countries at the organisation's general conference after a marathon session of nine hours' balloting. Mr Diouf, 55, takes up his post on January 1 to succeed Mr Edouard Saouma of Lebanon, director-general for the past 18 years. Mr Diouf defeated Australia's former secretary of industries and energy, Mr Geoffrey Miller, who had been backed by the US and other industrial powers. Before the sixth and final ballot was held, Mr Juan Figueroa Yavar, the Chilean minister of agriculture, announced that Chile and Senegal had made an agreement to support each other's candidates if necessary to ensure that the new FAO director-general came from the Third World. Mr Diouf has been Senegal's ambassador to the UN in New York since May 1991 and was previously secretary-general of the Central Bank for West African States. A UK government official said that Britain had supported Mr Miller in the voting because it believed he was the best candidate to reform the FAO and restore credibility dented by the personal style of Mr Saouma who manipulated the rules to get himself re-elected for three consecutive terms amid mounting criticism of his leadership. But he felt there were benefits in having an African at the head of FAO at a time when Africa faced the most serious problems.</p>

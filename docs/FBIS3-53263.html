			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Bassam Abu-Sharif, Yasir 'Arafat's </F> adviser, by Mira Avrekh in Paris "this week"]    [Text] "'Arafat has no choice. He must first prove to the  Palestinians that the step he is taking serves their national  interests. Only after he succeeds in doing that will he be able  to reduce the influence of his opposition, of the opponents of  peace. I think his current obstinacy is a mistake, but so is the  big fuss the Israelis are making over petty issues."    The speaker is Bassam Abu-Sharif, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser,  who has long been at the PLO leader's side. "The problem is not  'Arafat," he told me this week in a meeting in Paris. "The  problem is that the Palestinian negotiators give the Israeli  representatives the impression that what they agree on is final,  and they fail to explain to them that they do not have the final  say and that they must get the approval of the PLO leadership.    "True, 'Arafat is in charge of implementation, but he can  act  only according to the decisions of the PLO Executive. 'Arafat  must comply with the PLO constitution, just as Yitzhaq Rabin is  accountable to Israeli law.    "In my opinion, neither 'Arafat nor Rabin are to blame. Each  of them is entitled to see and explain the problem his own way.  Let me give you an example: The Oslo agreement refers to  `Jericho'; not `the city of Jericho,' but just plain `Jericho.'  'Arafat reads this as the Jericho area, while Rabin takes it to  mean the city of Jericho."    [Avrekh] "If so, what is the solution?"    [Abu-Sharif] "Seeing that both the Israelis and the  Palestinians decided on peace, I do not think time should be  wasted on minor issues."    [Avrekh] "How would you settle it?"    [Abu-Sharif] "Personally, the problem of the autonomous area  of Jericho is completely marginal, I would even say irrational.  After all, we decided in principle that Israel will get out of  the area in exchange for a far bigger goal -- that is, a Middle  East common market." [end Abu-Sharif]    I met with Abu-Sharif in a small apartment, put at his  disposal by a friend, on the 19th floor of a building  overlooking the Seine and the Eiffel Tower. Abu-Sharif is  recovering from an ear operation to restore the hearing  faculties he lost about 20 years ago when a package sent to him  blew up in his hands. At that time, he was considered a senior  Fatah terrorist, and it is assumed that the parcel was sent to  him by the Israeli Mosad. This man, whose face was disfigured,  nevertheless went on to become an ardent "dove."    The door of the apartment was opened carefully, just a few  centimeters, by a blond French security officer with a  walkie-talkie in his hand. Next to him was another Frenchman  armed with a gun. Two other French security men were inside the  apartment. The French Government sees to Abu-Sharif's security  during his stay. Whenever he leaves the apartment, his  entourage includes two cars, both of them carrying French  bodyguards.    The lounge is filled with smoke. There are large ashtrays  and glasses of whiskey on the tables, and dozens of well-wishers  calling on him after his operation: Palestinians; Lebanese  working for UNESCO; a Jordanian guy who came especially from  Amman; a rich Saudi who is a close friend of multimillionaire  Adnan Khashoggi; many Frenchmen, such as the adviser of the  mayor of Paris who returned that very same day from a visit to  Syria and Iraq. As soon as I was introduced as an Israeli  journalist, everybody wanted to talk and to exchange views about  the Israel-PLO peace process.    The phone rang continuously: Tunis, New York, Frankfurt, and  again Tunis; the president of Yemen wants to speak to  Abu-Sharif; then it is Madrid, Rome. Suddenly, a female friend  calls out: "Bassam, it is Tunis on the line! The president  wants you!" Abu-Sharif immerses himself in a long talk with  'Arafat.    [Avrekh] "Some say you are `out,' that you are no longer  part of 'Arafat's closest circle."    [Abu-Sharif] "Nonsense! He asked me to pack my things and  accompany him to Jericho. I asked him whether he would like me  to leave before him in order to prepare the ground for his  arrival. He replied: `No, I want you by my side when it is  time to go'."    [Avrekh] "If so, where did the rumors come from?"    [Abu-Sharif] "Neither I nor my friends can be out. We are  the founders. I am never far from the center of action, and  that will also be the case in the future."    [Avrekh] "Why did 'Arafat not take you along to the signing  ceremony in Washington?"    [Abu-Sharif] "It was beneath me to ask. My job is to  promote the process of peace negotiations, and that is far more  important than attending ceremonies. In the future, too, my  duties will keep me away from ceremonies. After all, it is a  known fact that I was the first Palestinian who pushed for  negotiations with Israel. I have been the key figure pushing  for such negotiations since 1988." [end Abu-Sharif]    One may quite safely assume that Abu-Sharif harbors a  certain  amount of resentment toward 'Arafat, who failed to send him to  Oslo as one of his representatives, take him to the ceremony in  Washington, or give him a job on the negotiating delegation. If  such resentment exists, however, Abu-Sharif goes to great  lengths now to show it in any way.    [Avrekh] "How big is the camp within the PLO that supports  you and your views?"    [Abu-Sharif] "A camp? There is no defined camp. We are the  mainstream of the PLO. There are thousands who agree with me,  and I am not necessarily talking about PLO members; I am talking  about academics, technocrats, young and talented Palestinians.  They are all in favor of peace. They are fed up with the  bloodshed, just as Israelis are. They are eagerly waiting  elections in the territories."    [Avrekh] "What do you think should be the next step in the  process?"    [Abu-Sharif] "What is most important now is to establish  institutions, to determine economic plans and form economic  institutions manned by talented Palestinians. We have thousands  of such youngsters, university graduates. Unfortunately, there  is a serious dispute in our ranks over this issue. Some PLO  leaders do not realize that if they fail to include high-caliber  Palestinians, even if they are not members of the PLO, they will  not be able to make progress. They must realize that the PLO is  an organization, while the Palestinians are a people.    "It is important not to waste time and energy on petty  quarrels, on a meter here or there, and focus on strategic goals  -- namely, the solidification of economic cooperation in the  entire region. I am talking about a common market made up of  Israel, the Palestinians, and the other Arab states."    [Avrekh] "But the fact remains that the PLO has not yet  presented any plans or set up economic cooperation institutions  in the territories. Has 'Arafat drafted any economic plan?"    [Abu-Sharif] "In my opinion, one of the mistakes of the PLO  is that it is having a hard time moving from revolution to  statehood. There is an enormous difference between an  organization and a country. Ben-Gurion, too, was forced to  abolish prestate underground organizations such as the Irgun and  the Palmah, because he knew it would be impossible to found a  state with so many political movements."    [Avrekh] "What is the main obstacle to progress in the peace  process?"    [Abu-Sharif] "I am sorry to say that many people, both Arabs  and Israelis, do not see the situation clearly. Only a few have  the necessary vision. Shim'on Peres is an example of a man with  such vision, and there are also a few Palestinians; however, the  lack of vision of many people is what is causing problems in the  negotiations."    [Avrekh] "Does 'Arafat realize that he might `miss the  train'?"    [Abu-Sharif] "The peace process will not stop. When all is  said and done, both we and the Israelis want to promote it.  Nonetheless, the Israelis must realize that the Palestinians are  Israel's bridge to the Middle East, while the Palestinians must  see that the political plan they yearn for can only be attained  through cooperation with Israel. Three-sided cooperation is  needed at this stage between Israel, Jordan, and the  Palestinians. This will constitute the first step toward a  Middle East common market."    [Avrekh] "But does 'Arafat understand that through his  behavior over the past few weeks he has been sabotaging the  chances of realizing the ideas you have just described?"    [Abu-Sharif] "Peace and its implementation can no longer be  killed by anybody. Whoever tries to do so will disappear.  'Arafat knows that very well. After all, he had the courage to  step forward and extend his hand to Rabin."    [Avrekh] "You have stressed the importance of economic  cooperation several times. I have heard that you are now doing  business with Adnan Khashoggi. Is that true?"    [Abu-Sharif] "Let me tell you something funny. I first met  Khashoggi here in Paris. I was staying in a hotel that has  three suites: Khashoggi was in one, I was in another, and  Ari'el Sharon was in the third. Khashoggi conducted 'shuttle  trips' between Sharon's suite and mine in a bid to attain  negotiations about Gaza. Sharon was prepared to give the Gaza  Strip to the Palestinians, but the PLO would not agree to an  arrangement that included only Gaza, which Sharon insisted on  seeing as the final solution. Nothing came of it.    "I have since met with Khashoggi on a number of occasions,  all of them at President 'Arafat's instructions and never for  private business. For example, I met with him shortly before  the Gulf war. He was running back and forth between Saudi Arabia  and Iraq in an attempt to prevent the war."    [Avrekh] "Does everybody in the PLO agree with 'Arafat's  moves?"    [Abu-Sharif] "As is known, the PLO is made up of various  organizations. Each one of them, however big or small, is  independent. The largest and strongest of them is Fatah, which  has a huge majority in the PLO. That is why any internal  argument in Fatah automatically becomes a PLO problem.    "Yes, everybody accepts the plan in principle, but there are  differences about the implementation, just as there are  arguments between Rabin and his cabinet ministers. That is  legitimate.    "There have always been differences within the Fatah  leadership. The point is that when such conflicts break out at a  time of delicate political negotiations, they stand out more  than they ordinarily would. At the same time, it is clear to  all that 'Arafat is the indisputable leader of Fatah. To wit,  although the last Fatah congress passed a resolution to the  effect that everybody should compete for his position, it was  unanimously decided that 'Arafat would not have to compete and  would remain the No. 1 man."    [Avrekh] "Somebody told me that Abu-Mazin [Mahmud 'Abbas]  was five votes short of reelection and almost did not make it.  Suddenly there was a power outage, the computer went down, and  'Arafat announced that Abu-Mazin had been elected. How true is  this report?"    [Abu-Sharif] "If what you heard is true, 'Arafat did it  because he supports the peace process and needs the votes of all  those who support it, such as Abu-Mazin (laughing). But you  should not infer from this that they always see eye to eye.    "Nonetheless, it proves that 'Arafat is the man who calls  the  shots. However you look at it, 'Arafat is the man who runs  Fatah and the PLO. In spite of all the complications, he is the  man who can deliver the goods, and he will do so."</p>

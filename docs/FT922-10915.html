			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UWP triumphs in St Lucia election MR John Compton is to be sworn in this week as prime minister of St Lucia for a third consecutive term, following the victory of his United Workers Party in a general election on Monday. Preliminary results have given the UWP 11 of the 17 seats at stake, with the others going to the St Lucia Labour party led by Mr Julian Hunte. Mr Compton overcame damaging allegations during the campaign that he had been having an affair with an 18-year-old schoolgirl for the past four years. While not denying the claims, the prime minister said they were part of a 'smear campaign' and that what he did in his private life was a matter only for himself and his family. Mr Compton has indicated that this would be his last term. His victory has cleared the way for St Lucia and the other Windward Island nations ' Grenada, St Vincent and the Grenadines and Dominica - to create a political union. He pledged to hold a referendum on a European Community-style political union by the end of the year. Mr Compton argues such a union is needed to help the islands compete economically. Political unity is supported by Mr Compton, but not by Mr Hunte who had threatened to withdraw St Lucia from moves towards a federation.</p>

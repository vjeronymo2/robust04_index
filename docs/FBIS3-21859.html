The law was amended to say that "any activities linked to  drug production, manufacture or trade, will be considered as  conniving with the enemy," the source said.    Those found guilty of espionage already risk the death  penalty, but convicted drug dealers previously only faced jail  sentences.    Drug addicts are not affected by the change, and if found  guilty still face a maximum penalty of imprisonment for  rehabilitation programmes, the official added.    Libyan leader Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi accused the United States  and Israel in January of propagating drugs in Arab countries in  "a cold war aimed at destroying them."</p>

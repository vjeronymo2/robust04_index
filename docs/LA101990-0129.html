			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> STUDENTS GET TRIAL RUN AT PARENTHOOD  </P> <P> Mike Hendricks and Kim Zehner waited nervously in the lobby of South Coast  Medical Center for space to be cleared in the hospital's maternity ward. Zehner  fiddled with a baby blanket and pajamas while Hendricks calmed her with  soothing words.  </P> <P> "I got these (clothes) off my doll," said Zehner, a high school junior. "Yeah,  we want to keep the baby warm," added Hendricks before donning a flannel robe  and accompanying Zehner down the long hallway to the maternity ward.  </P> <P> Just 45 minutes later, Zehner was wheeled out of the hospital with 5-pound  identical twins, one on each arm -- 5-pound sacks of flour, that is.  </P> <P> The medical center distributed the flour sacks to 23 Laguna Beach high school  students as part of a weeklong project to teach teen-agers the realities of  parenthood.  </P> <P> The students, who are part of a decision-making class called Choices and  Challenges, must keep their "flour babies" with them at all times and simulate  the daily chores of parenting: changing diapers, buying supplies, finding child  care and, of course, feeding.  </P> <P> "I want you to go home tonight and set your alarm for every two hours, because  that's when your baby will require feeding," Kathy Higgs, a hospital staff  member who leads real parents in prenatal exercises and parenting classes, told  the students. "I also would like you to be up at 5 a.m. to start your day  tomorrow morning."  </P> <P> Higgs orchestrated Wednesday's "birth" along with Laguna Beach High School  teacher Art Smart and the Laguna Beach Chamber of Commerce. Tuesday, Higgs came  to the students' classroom wearing a borrowed maternity gown and gave students  a first-person account of her pregnancy, as well as sample breathing exercises  and other prenatal training. On the day of the delivery, students toured the  maternity ward, viewing the obstetrics lab and the nursery where newborns are  kept for observation.  </P> <P> While most high schools have similar parenting classes that involve eggs or  other fragile objects, Smart said he decided to use the heavy sacks of flour to  make a point about parenthood: It's not all fun.  </P> <P> "Five pounds becomes cumbersome, especially for students who have cheerleading  or track practice. It's exciting now, but after the honeymoon wears off, then  reality sets in," Smart said.  </P> <P> In addition to carrying their offspring at all times on school grounds,  students will also be required to research the cost of food, clothing, medical  attention and child care, Smart said.  </P> <P> The unusual project elicited jokes and giggles from the class of seniors and  juniors, but most students said that carrying the sacks of flour for the next  week will be a valuable exercise.  </P> <P> "If I really had a kid, I'd probably have to drop out of school," said  16-year-old Tom Wilkerson. "My parents wouldn't like that too much."  </P> <P> "It's a little strange," added Gordana Jurilj, an exchange student from  Yugoslavia. "I think it's really good having these classes."

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Rules change will help film industry cut tax bill FILM-MAKERS will be be allowed to apply new techniques of accounting to help reduce their tax bills under guidelines issued by the Inland Revenue yesterday. An updated statement of practice for the film industry shows that it will be able to write off costs against tax far more quickly than current regulations permit, and to improve cashflow. The statement lays down rules first promised in the 1992 Budget. They are designed to boost the British film industry and to bring it in line with the more generous tax allowances permitted in other countries. It provides details of what expenses will be eligible for accelerated relief, and the time limits on applying for tax relief under the new arrangements. The statement permits pre-production or preliminary expenses to be written off pound-for-pound against tax as they are incurred. Previously these could be set against tax only when a decision had been taken on whether a film would be made, which could be one or more tax years later. To be eligible these preliminary expenses must be reasonably said to have been made to enable a decision to be taken on whether or not to go ahead with the film. The statement also allows film companies to write off all production costs in three years at 33.3 per cent a year. That compares with the previous 25 per cent a year of remaining costs for capital expenditure, and over the life of the film for revenue costs. Film companies wishing to adopt the new methods must make a claim in writing to the local inspector of taxes within two years of the completion of the film. To be eligible films must be qualified as British or EC-based by the Department of National Heritage under the 1985 Films Act. The film industry has in the past said that it is at a disadvantage to other sectors because it has to incur so many costs long before it receives the revenues on films. That has made it extremely difficult for independent companies to operate.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Information Minister Safwat al-Sharif has affirmed  that President Husni Mubarak is trying to achieve inter-Arab  reconciliation to overcome the repercussions of the Gulf war and  find a new formula to end Arab differences and face the  challenges of the Arab nation under the new economic and  international order, in particular the GATT agreement and  increased acts of violence and terrorism, within the framework  of the new concept of pan-Arab security.    In statements made exclusively to AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I, the  information minister said that pan-Arab security requires a  decisive stance to review the current formula, which no longer  consists of military security, stockpiling of weapons and  arsenals, or mobilization of troops. He said that the new  formula is centered on economic, political, military, security,  media, and educational areas.    Safwat al-Sharif noted that the GATT agreement, acts of  violence and terrorism, and cultural confrontation targeting the  identity of the Arab nation are the main reasons why a new  concept of pan-Arab security is necessary.    Responding to a question on the Egyptian role in the new  formula, the information minister affirmed that President Husni  Mubarak's meetings with King Husayn of Jordan and Yemeni  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih focused on how to overcome Arab  differences and find a way to implement the new pan-Arab  security plan.    The information minister said that Egypt, led by Mubarak, is  the nerve of pan-Arab security and the force behind the Arab  nation in the areas of education, manpower, economy, and  military. Al-Sharif described the current formula of pan-Arab  security as a fragile one based only on the bonds of language  and history. He warned about the challenges and dangers of the  future awaiting the Arab nation.    On the acts of violence in the Arab region and the export of  terrorism by Arab countries, the information minister said that  terrorism is also present in those countries that are currently  exporting it. He demanded inter-Arab cooperation to confront  terrorism by using all possible means to bolster security in the  Arab region.    Regarding the pan-Arab security project recently proposed by  the Arab League, the information minister said that this  project, with some amendments and modernization, increases the  Arab nation's ability to confront future challenges. He  affirmed that current developments make it essential that Arabs  overcome their differences and erase the effects of the Iraqi  invasion of Kuwait.</p>

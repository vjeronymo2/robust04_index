			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Bankers mull over a Pounds 5bn debt financing puzzle - Treasury plans to sell utility loans THE UK government's plan to sell up to Pounds 5bn of loans made to privatised utility companies presents bankers with one of the most teasing corporate finance puzzles since the privatisation programme was first hatched in the early 1980s. Last week, Baring Brothers was appointed to advise the Treasury on the sale, following a competitive tender involving around a dozen banks and securities firms. Barings must now come up with a strategy by which the government can realise cash from its hotch-potch of loan assets. The project has an air of urgency. The government has budgeted on raising Pounds 1bn this fiscal year, reducing the public sector borrowing requirement and the amount it must borrow from the gilts market. The loans range in size from a substantial Pounds 350m loan to National Power due for repayment in 1998, to small loans of less than Pounds 50m to regional electricity companies. Some must be repaid next year; others do not mature until 2008. Although the assets themselves are complex, bankers said the government has three simple options: The debt can simply be offered for sale to investors in its current form, since most is already structured as securities which are easy to trade. The main problem with this approach is that the loans carry interest payments of up to 13.2 per cent, reflecting interest rates when the companies were privatised. If the paper was sold directly to investors it would need to be priced substantially above par redemption value - perhaps 107 or 108 per cent of face value. Many investors are unwilling to buy bonds above par. UK taxpayers, for example, would pay full tax on the interest income from high coupons but would receive no deduction for capital loss when the bonds were redeemed at par. Continental European investors are also reluctant to buy bonds trading at a premium to face value. Moreover, some of the debt - notably the Pounds 2.2bn loans to British Telecom - is in the form of registered securities, rather than bearer bonds favoured by international investors. Again, this limits the number of potential buyers. One merchant banker commented: 'Everything has a price, but selling most of this debt directly to investors may not be the most price-efficient solution.' The debt could be repackaged into a more palatable form either by the government or an investment bank. For example, the debt could be injected into a special-purpose company which would issue bonds secured on this underlying holding. The special-purpose company could then offer securities in a form favoured by investors: bearers bonds with coupons matching current interest rates and priced just below par. Against this, the costs of repackaging debt are prohibitive. The special-purpose company would have to issue a larger principle amount of current coupon bonds than the face value of the underlying debt: Pounds 110m paper priced at par could be secured on Pounds 100m bonds trading at 110. To achieve this, an investment bank could write a series of interest rate swaps with the special-purpose company. But this type of exercise is costly and would erode any gains from issuing more attractive, repackaged bonds. The debt could simply be offered to the utility companies companies could either refinance the debt with new bonds or redeem it out of cash-flow. Indeed, many of the loans oblige the government to at least consult the companies before it acts. Loans to the regional electricity companies (Recs) give them the pre-emptive right to buy back the debt before the government sells to a third party. There would be little real cost-saving for the utilities even if the debt could be refinanced in the bond market at lower interest rates. In the case of the Recs, the price they would pay for the debt is set by a formula agreed at the time of privatisation. Hence, the companies would have to pay a premium to face value, just like any other buyer. This could also lead to tax problems. The utilities receive tax relief on high interest payments, but get no relief on the premium above face value paid to the government to redeem the debt early. It may be possible for some utilities to buy back the debt via an off-shore subsidiary set up in a jurisdiction where the premium is tax deductable. But, again, there are costs in setting up such an arrangement. Against this, treasurers may see value in redeeming the government loans out of cash-flow or bank credit lines and refinancing later, at a time of their own choosing. This way the companies will regain the initiative, even if it means paying a premium for control.</p>

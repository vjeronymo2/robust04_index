			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [G. Lopez Alba report: "Polls Used by Government Show </F> People's Party Two to Five Points Ahead of Spanish Socialist  Workers' Party"]    [Text] Madrid -- The People's Party [PP] currently has a  2-5 percent lead over the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party]  in voting intentions, according to the polls used by the  government. This lead is cut for predictions for the European  elections, although polls carried out by the PP give it a lead  in this case of between five and seven points. Elements in the  PSOE believe that, after the European elections, [Prime  Minister] Felipe Gonzalez will have to change the composition of  his government.    Before it was the economic crisis, now it is corruption.  According to all the opinion polls -- those used by the  government and those commissioned by Jose Maria Aznar's PP --  while voting intentions for the PSOE continue to follow a  downward trend, those for the PP continue to rise.    The opinion polls the government is working with give the PP  a two to five point lead in voting intentions if a general  election were to be held now. However, government sources state  that voting intentions were "somewhat better" when the people  polled were asked how they would vote in the upcoming European  elections on 12 June.    This evaluation, however, contradicts the polls used by the  PP. PP sources put its lead for the European elections at  around five or six points, which would give it a cushion of 20  to 28 seats.    It is clear from the government polls that the main cause of  the Socialists' electoral decline is their loss of credibility  resulting from the corruption scandals. In this respect, our  sources indicate that, although the people polled can still not  clearly see the signs of economic recovery, they are beginning  to "feel" it. With regard to corruption, government sources  admit that "at times we have reacted too slowly" in the face of  corruption allegations.    Despite the fact that the results of the polls are not very  promising, the Socialists are confident that they can avoid the  European elections being an electoral catastrophe with wider  implications for the national political situation.    Elements in the PSOE believe that, after these elections  Felipe Gonzalez will have to reshuffle his cabinet to give fresh  impetus to government action -- something that the Guerristas  [Alfonso Guerra supporters] demanded after the federal congress.    Representatives of the group headed by PSOE Deputy General  Secretary Alfonso Guerra still believe that the inclusion of a  Guerrista in the government would contribute to a faster healing  of the party's open wounds.    Certain Socialist leaders also believe that this government  reshuffle should be followed by the decision to hold a vote of  confidence in parliament, although this would mean forcing the  Catalan Convergence and Union [CiU] party to again demonstrate  its support for the Socialist government.</p>

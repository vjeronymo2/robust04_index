			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets: Mexico rallies 1.9% Stocks finished a net 1.93 per cent higher after one of the busiest sessions of the year following a shock government adjustment of the new peso's trading band with the dollar, allowing a devaluation of up to 13 per cent. At one stage the market had gained 7.5 per cent, but moved back towards the close as investors juggled portfolios, mainly moving out of stocks with heavy dollar-debt burdens and light dollar incomes. The IPC index was finally 43.06 up at 2,274.17. Volume was 153.8m shares worth 1.9bn new pesos. The government explained that it had agreed to devalue the peso against the dollar in response to the pressure that had been caused to the country's financial markets as a result of instability in the southern state of Chiapas. Officials added that Mexico would be able to meet its economic goals in 1995, and that the devaluation would be re-evaluated within the next six months. Sarah Lavers, head of research at LatInvest in London, commented that the announcement was basically good news. It would make the country more competitive, and remove uncertainty, although there would be a cost in terms of the government's own credibility.</p>

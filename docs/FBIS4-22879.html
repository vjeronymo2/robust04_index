			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by G. I. Puzikov, I. V. Taratynov, Giprouglemash; </F> UDC 621.651:622.232.8]    [Abstract] Giprouglemash and the Bryansk Machine Building  Company are designing pumping units and stations for mechanized  supports, water removal systems, water injection units used in  coal beds, and high-pressure irrigation systems. The series of  pumping stations features pressures from 20-63 MPa, and a  delivery rate of 30-400 l/min. The series has 22, 37, 55, and  110 kW models. Gravitational extraction is used in the filtering  system. These pumping stations consume less power than their  predecessors and are half the weight. Their most vulnerable  parts (for example, the plungers) are reinforced for a longer  lifetime. Figures 2.</p>

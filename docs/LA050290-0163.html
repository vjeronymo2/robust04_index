			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> $1.2-TRILLION BUDGET DRAFT OKD  </P> <P> The Senate Budget Committee today adopted a Democratic-proposed $1.2-trillion  budget for 1991 that cuts defense spending $9.9 billion below what President  Bush wants.  </P> <P> The package was adopted on a vote of 14 to 9, with all of the committee's  Democrats joined by a single Republican -- Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) in  voting for the measure.  </P> <P> The proposal mirrors the plan passed by the Democratic-controlled House on  Tuesday. Both packages are seen by many lawmakers as a prelude to possible  negotiations between the White House and the Democratic majorities in Congress  on a spending plan for the next fiscal year.  </P> <P> The proposal claims to reduce next year's deficit by $43 billion by taking  credit for $13 billion in defense cuts, $13.9 billion in new tax revenues, and  $6.2 billion in new user fees and other receipts. The growth of benefit  programs such as Medicare would be slowed by $5.6 billion while other domestic  and foreign aid efforts would be cut by $3.5 billion.  </P></p>

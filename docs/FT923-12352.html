			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Bull market on the horns of dilemma / Tracing the up and down fortunes of the UK market since the Crash of 87 FIVE YEARS is a long time to have travelled without getting anywhere, but investors who put money into equities at this time in 1987 this week have to face the fact that they have seen a loss on their capital. The long bull market in UK equities which began in mid-1982 reached its peak on July 16 1987. The FT-All Share then stood at 1238.5. It was 1190.6 at Thursday's close this week, after a short-lived push in May this year to 1326.4. Over the five years the casino characteristics of the stock market have been glaringly apparent, with smart gains to be had, depending on your timing. If you waited until after the October 1987 crash to buy stocks, when the FT-All share index was around 800, and sold in mid-1989 when it rose to over 1200, you would have seen a rise of 50 per cent for the 18 month period and a real return of 38 per cent, according to Paul Walton, UK equity strategist at brokers James Capel. There were even higher real returns - 40 per cent - for speculators who bought into the market at the end of 1990 and sold in May this year, when the index exceeded its pre-crash peak. The Conservative victory in the April election this year pushed the index up but it has since fallen because of the economy's failure to recover. For investors who were not able to play the market with such precise timing, life has been at turns nail-biting and frustrating. Our four portfolios (story below right) have all shown losses over the first six months of this year. The FT-All share has fallen by 31 per cent in real terms over the five years to Thursday, and even those who bought shares after the crash and held them will have seen the market barely rise in real terms. It can be argued that five years is not long enough to be a truly long-term investment, but the law suggests otherwise. Collective funds are legally obliged to quote five year performance figures, which are now very unflattering. They will improve greatly from October when the market at the time of the Crash becomes the unexacting yardstick. Over 10 years the picture is very different. BZW's equity price index stood at 2403.8 at the end of 1981 and rose to 8938.6 at the end of last year. The annual average real return during that period was 13 per cent (gross income reinvested) compared with 8.4 per cent for gilts. The conventional wisdom is that the market was overvalued in 1987 and was 'corrected' by the October crash. Now, according to that same wisdom, the market is cheap. But even if the market is cheap, is it worth buying? With inflation now down to just below 4 per cent and expected to fall further, and with high real interest rates, fixed-interest investments look an attractive alternative. These are examined in our Quarterly Review of Personal Finance. Investment institutions have acted accordingly. Norwich Union switched Pounds 1bn out of equities and into fixed-interest stocks last September. In a publication, 'Investment Strategy in the 1990s', it argued that, over the next couple of years, 'it is possible that fixed interest could outperform equities as inflationary pressures and yields fall.' In the longer term, it expected equities to outperform fixed interest investments, although by a lesser margin than in the 1980s. Experts are divided on the outlook for the market. Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association, also expects increased demand for bonds and foresees more bond unit trust launches as a result. However, he believes that the behaviour of the stock market over the five years was an aberration caused by the government's tough anti-inflation policy. He expects a slow but steady rise in the market in the next five years. This view is not shared by Jeremy Alford of Whittingdale, a specialist bond investment company, who thinks that high real interest rates cloud the outlook for equities. The decision by the Bundesbank to raise its discount rate will have reinforced this argument. However, Dick Barfield, of Standard Life, expects returns from gilts to trail about 2 percentage points behind equities in the next five years. The gap between the two has narrowed - the yield ratio (the relationship of gilt to equity yields) peaked on the eve of the Crash at 3.3 times and is now down to 1.8. Like NU, Barfield does not expect the high returns of the bull market to be repeated in the 1990s. He nevertheless expects 'decent real returns' of about 7 to 8 per cent from equities in the next five years - a figure which takes in a revaluation of the market because of what he views as its cheapness today. Walton takes a contrary view to that of Norwich Union. He expects a 25 per cent rally in equities, supported by corporate earnings growth, over the next 18 months. This would push the FT-All share to 1600. However, after that he sees a flat period with total returns for equities at 9 per cent compared with gross redemption yields of 8 per cent on bonds. He says: 'When equities and bonds look equally attractive, the old rules apply  -put your money 50-50 into both.'

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Arts: 'MSM' by DV8 - Theatre MSM at the Nottingham Playhouse is dance theatre about men having sex in public lavatories. It takes its title from the psychologists' term for men who have sex with men, and its material from 50 interviews collated by the Physical Theatre Company, DV8. It represents a joint production between the Nottingham Playhouse and the Royal Court Theatre. At 95 minutes, the piece outstays its welcome, all gurgling cisterns and chance sexual encounters. The action pieces together observations, confessions, stories and anecdotes from the world of 'cottaging' where men meet sexual partners in public lavatories. The dank brickwork and acrid disinfectant bring promise of momentary satisfaction. The show starts with a man loitering outside, while above and behind him, naked men appear in slow erotic entwinements. The stage opens into the lavatory set. The design (Michael Howells) manages to make the cubicles and dripping taps more than stage machinery. It allows the seven actors to emerge over or through tiled walls, to hang upside down or stretch languorously against the cool black partitions. The staging stays unpredictable; panels open for a leg, hand or head to pop through into the action. The porcelain hardware moves around, enabling the players to station themselves ready for the baffling and subtle courtship manoeuvres. The stories engage to a degree; but because they relate the interviewees directly, they are short on the psychology of motivation: 'I'm so desperate,' says one 35 year old, 'I run to get there quicker; I'm disgusted with myself; I have sex with complete strangers.' The play never asks why. Another nameless character says: 'Cottaging is ninety per cent waiting; if you have patience, you can have a lot of fun; it was an escape from a two-dimensional existence . . . it was exciting.' In which case, some existence, some excitement. Another says: 'my best experience was in a cubicle in Torremolinos', seeming sad rather than funny. MSM is appropriately choreographed, with sensual slow figures and hanging movements which stretch the male torso the way Renaissance painters did to women. The physical action remains tense, controlled and pent up. The director Lloyd Newson concludes with a requiem sequence suspended high over the stage. But the play never makes clear whether these men are to be praised for their courageous honesty, or pitied for their addictive weakness. It lacks political edge, never outlining the laws against sex in public places, and only briefly touching on the health issues involved in massive promiscuity. MSM also needs the psychological edge it claims in the programme notes, preferring to shock with How? rather than ask with Why?

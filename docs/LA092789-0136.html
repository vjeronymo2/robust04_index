			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CBS'S AFGHAN WAR FOOTAGE CALLED A FAKE  </P> <P> The "CBS Evening News" broadcast fake combat footage and false news reports of  the war in Afghanistan during the mid-1980s, it was reported today.  </P> <P> Most of the footage was shot by cameraman Mike Hoover, who allegedly staged  scenes of guerrilla sabotage and made a Chinese-built Pakistani jet on a  training run appear to be a Soviet plane bombing Afghan villages, according to  the New York Post.  </P> <P> CBS was seriously concerned over the charges but was not sure how to  investigate, the newspaper quoted CBS sources as saying. "It's hard to question  Afghan rebels," one of the sources said.  </P> <P> During award-winning news broadcasts on Nov. 12 and 13, 1984, anchorman Dan  Rather said Hoover had been on hand for "the largest sabotage operation of the  war." Videotape shot by Hoover showed Moujahedeen rebels purportedly blowing up  pylons to cut power to Kabul.  </P> <P> The actual sabotage, however, took place 12 days before Hoover arrived on the  scene, the newspaper said. Etabari, an Afghan serving as the cameraman's  translator, told the newspaper that Hoover persuaded guerrilla leaders to order  about a dozen rebels to return to the site so he could stage the sabotage.  </P> <P> "He told the Moujahedeen to destroy pylons that were already destroyed. It was  completely wrong. It was just for the movie," Etabari was quoted as saying.  </P></p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Russia urges 'trade not aid' treatment - Moscow's call to be regarded as normal - with help from friends PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin and his government are demanding an end to trade 'discrimination' against Russia as it struggles to switch to a market economy and Mr Yeltsin intends to make the point when he meets leaders of the Group of Seven industrial countries at their Tokyo summit next week. 'We want Russia really to become an equal member of the world financial and trading community,' says Mr Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister responsible for Russia's foreign economic relations. In the past few weeks, Russia has demanded rapid admission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and refused to sign a partnership agreement with the European Community on the grounds that it provides insufficient access for Russian goods and services to EC markets. Last week, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian prime minister, called off a visit to the US in protest against sanctions imposed by Washington because of a Dollars 350m Russian contract to supply rocket engines to India. According to Washington, the deal violates international agreements to limit the proliferation of missile technology which India says it needs for a peaceful space programme. Russia says the US simply wanted its companies to get the deal. Closer to home, Russia is demanding that western loans be given to other newly-independent former Soviet republics to pay for Russian energy supplies. The beauty of this scheme, which the west does not even want to discuss until the Tokyo summit is out of the way, is that Russia would get new western funds while the other republics would get new debt. 'The fact that Russia is negotiating aggressively on trade shows that it's becoming a normal country,' said one western diplomat. 'The controversy arises from the fact that it expects better than average treatment as part of western support for reforms.' Some of the Russian complaints about discrimination are a negotiating tactic since even Russian officials acknowledge that they do not want to expose the country to foreign trading competition all in one go - which is what speedy admission to Gatt, for instance, would imply. But public posturing notwithstanding, Russia's demand for 'trade not aid' threatens vital western interests in a way which earlier forms of assistance have not. The conflict is particularly acute for the EC, Russia's close neighbour and biggest trading partner, which needs to reconcile the desire to help Russia with pressure to protect EC jobs and companies from competition from the east. Access to western markets happens to be one of the most effective forms of support the west can give Russian market reforms. It enables Russian enterprises to help themselves rather than demand subsidies from the government. It avoids the risk of Russia's inefficient state bureaucracy squandering direct grants from western governments. It also makes western demands for faster market reforms in Russia more credible. 'Jeffrey Sachs (the Harvard professor turned Russian economic adviser) is telling the Russians to restructure or close down their factories. I say we should close ours,' said one western diplomat. However, controlled domestic energy prices, the fact that many Russian enterprises have only a poor idea of what their costs are and the desire of many to make precious hard currency by pricing their exports cheaply, are all presented by western competitors as arguments for maintaining restrictions on imports from Russia. Exports of natural gas and oil needed by western Europe account for the fact that Russia has a trade surplus with the EC. But while there is no demand for most Russian industrial goods, the few which are in demand face restricted access on the grounds that Russia is not yet a market economy. The EC operates quantitative restrictions on steel and textiles, and in effect limits imports of enriched uranium by requiring a licence for each deal. It is soon to decide whether to slap anti-dumping duties on Russian aluminium imports, which last year sharply drove down western aluminium prices and hurt western producers. But with much of the EC steel industry already in the throes of painful restructuring, and no similar changes yet in evidence in Russia, even free traders within the European Commission, who are sympathetic to Russia's case, say it must make more progress with market reforms to obtain better access. In that spirit, Sir Leon Brittan, the commissioner responsible for foreign economic relations, says a review clause contained in the co-operation and partnership deal could transform it into a free trade agreement in three years. Trade could certainly be useful as an incentive for Russia to speed up domestic reforms. In a move which should help strengthen Russian manufacturers' case in the face of accusations that they benefit from unfair energy subsidies, the government plans to free coal prices from today and domestic oil and gas prices by the end of the year. Russia is also putting the finishing touches to a market-sharing compromise with the US and the EC which could show the way in other sectors and will give it the right to conduct 12 commercial satellite launches between 1995 and 2000. This is despite fears at western Europe's Arianespace that it could be wiped out by Russia's ability to conduct launches at half its cost.</p>

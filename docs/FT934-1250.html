			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / International Company News: Skopbank to receive more state support Skopbank, the biggest casualty of Finland's banking crisis, is to receive a further FM350m (Dollars 60.5m) in state aid so that it continues to meet capital adequacy requirements. The new injection means the bank has received FM17.03bn in government assistance since it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991. The government guarantee fund, which has been responsible for Skopbank since June 1992, warned that the bank might need further support next year, even though its performance has improved substantially during 1993. Credit losses are expected to be 40 per cent lower in 1993 than the FM2.8bn level struck last year. In the first eight months the group made a FM870m operating loss after credit losses reached FM885m. Skopbank's role as the central bank of the Finnish savings banks has been reduced following the sale of the Savings Bank of Finland to four other banks.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> UC NURSES APPROVE PAY RAISE CONTRACT  </P> <P> Registered nurses at UCI Medical Center in Orange will receive a 3% raise  retroactive to Nov. 1 and another 3% raise May 1 under a statewide contract  approved this week by about 7,200 nurses working for University of California  hospitals and clinics.  </P> <P> The previous contract for the nurses expired Nov. 1 but was extended during  negotiations between the university and the California Nurses Assn.  </P> <P> The two-year contract allows for wages to be renegotiated after one year.  </P> <P> All UC nurses work under the same basic contract, but each hospital and clinic  has a separate pay scale.  </P> <P> Differing pay rates have long been a point of contention for UCI nurses, who  for several years have sought to earn the same pay as other nurses in the  state. The starting pay for nurses at UC San Francisco Medical Center, for  instance, is more than 20% greater than for nurses at UCI Medical Center.  </P> <P> When contract talks stalled late in October, UCI nurses held an impromptu  one-day sickout to protest pay offers. The job action reportedly was the only  one statewide during the contract talks.  </P> <P> The sickout, by an undisclosed number of nurses, forced the hospital to close  its trauma center for about 12 hours.  </P> <P> Under the new contract, UCI Medical Center nurses will also receive extra pay  for working evening and night shifts and nurses with specialized training will  earn an extra $100 a month.

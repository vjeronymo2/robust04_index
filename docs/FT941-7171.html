			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney's cut lifts aluminium Pechiney, Europe's biggest aluminium producer, yesterday joined the international groups pledging to cut world-wide annual output to bring the market back into better balance. The French group will cut output by 12 per cent or 120,000 tonnes for at least 18 months, starting in April - a move that will include the long-expected permanent closure of its smelter at Venthon in France. Pechiney previously indicated that it would contribute to the global reduction in output but its cuts are bigger than the market expected. The three-month aluminium price, which had been languishing at Dollars 1,290 a tonne on the London Metal Exchange before Pechiney's news, revived to close at Dollars ,314.50, up Dollars 12. But it remained well below the recent 18-month peak of Dollars 1,331 a tonne. Cuts announced so far by western producers total roughly 830,000 tonnes for a full year, according to Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group. This would have little impact during the first half of 1994, he suggested, but would reduce western production from 14.977m tonnes last year to about 14.3m in 1994. Mr MacMillan remained sceptical about the ability of the Russian government to persuade the republic's smelters to make all the cuts promised by trade delegates at a meeting last month in Brussels: 200,000 tonnes by April and then another 300,000 in the next three months. He said there was unlikely to be any substantial boost to aluminium demand before 1995. But then it could be very strong and stocks, now standing at record levels, might start to fall quickly - if aluminium smelting capacity remained shut. The Russian industry welcomed Pechiney's announcement and suggested that it would enable talks between some major aluminium-producing nations in Canada next week to make substantial progress. The meeting in Ottawa will assess progress made since delegates in Brussels agreed that producers should push ahead with global output cuts of at least 1.5m tonnes or about 10 per cent of world production. The Russians previously have been critical of Pechiney's vacillation because, like many others in the industry, they believe the French group was mainly responsible for persuading the European Commission to impose restrictions on aluminium imports from the former Soviet Union to European Union countries.</p>

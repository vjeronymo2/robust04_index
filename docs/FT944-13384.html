			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Market awaits ICI news There is still a conviction among London's financial community that ICI is the symbol of Britain's industrial well-being and the market hung fire ahead of the chemical giant's third-quarter figures today. The FT-SE 100 closed flat and ICI were virtually unchanged at 799p as the stock market waited for what one dealer described as: 'The most sensitive figures for three years, both for ICI and for the market.' The range of forecasts for the company's pre-tax profits is unusually wide reflecting the divergent views on the direction of the UK economy. The bulls, who believe the company might produce profits as high as Pounds 145m, argue that the rise in commodity prices will be reflected in ICI's figures before being passed through downstream companies such as BTR and Yule Catto to be reflected in the economy as a whole. The bears, who are looking for around Pounds 120m, believe that the pick-up in commodity prices has already been factored into the market - ICI shares have outperformed the FT-SE A All Share Index by more than 15 percentage points since the beginning of March - and the stock is due for a correction.</p>

The measure will save the executive branch  approximately 205 million bolivares and is expected to save the  nation 410 million bolivares.    Presidency Secretariat Minister Andres Caldera personally  announced the decision, which proposes a reorganization of the  ministry to make it a secretariat again. The ministry will  reassign 14 organizations under its authority to other  ministries. The goal is to set an example for the austerity and  administrative efficiency policy announced by the government.    [Begin Presidency Secretariat Minister Andres Caldera  recording] As for the internal reorganization, it is  appropriate to mention first the modernization and  simplification of the General Directorate for Management and  Services; the creation of a presidential advisory office; the  creation of a unit to follow up on presidential decisions, a  duty ascribed to the Council of Ministers secretary within the  presidency's private secretariat; the creation of a state  advisory unit within the legal consultative office to render  public services, such as the publication of decisions and the  compilation of laws and decrees; and the strengthening of the  internal auditing office by creating an oversight mechanism for  the control of assets and services and for administrative  investigations. [end recording]    Venezolana de Television [VTV], which is currently under the  Ministry of the Presidency Secretariat, will be transferred to  the Central Information Office [OCI]. OCI Chief Guillermo  Alvarez Bajares announced the approval of a budget for the  state-owned television channel. He also announced the cabinet's  decision to annul Decree 3,081 creating the Channel 5  Foundation. Alvarez Bajares explained that the executive branch  is determined to fully support VTV, and a special study will be  undertaken to decide Channel 5's future.

Annul Decree 3,081 dated 22 July 1993  and published in LA GACETA, the official newspaper of the  Republic of Venezuela, in edition 35,269 dated 6 August 1993.

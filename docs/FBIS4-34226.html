			<p>BFN     [Text] Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), 15 Jun (EFE) --  Forty American human rights organizations today asked Uruguayan  President Luis Alberto Lacalle to review his decision to allow a  private television monopoly in his country.    The human rights organizations' petition agrees with another  petition signed by 23 Latin American, Spanish, and Portuguese  newspaper directors who participated in a press seminar in  Cartagena de Indias, where the Fourth Ibero-American Summit is  being held.    Luis Alberto Lacalle signed a decree three months ago  approving cable television operations by a private group that  dominates Montevideo's three open channels.    A communique issued by these human rights organizations  points out that the presidential decision, which is under  congressional investigation, "effects the right to gain  information and to report with no other restrictions than those  established by law."    The communique bears the signatures of representatives from  the Latin American Institute for Alternative Legal Services  [Instituto Latinoamericano de Servicios Legales Alternativos]  (ILSA), the Peace and Justice Service (Serpaj) of Argentina, and  the Caribbean Human Rights (CAR) organization of the Caribbean  English-speaking countries.    The human rights organizations, all of them  non-governmental,  met in Cartagena de Indias to review the policies currently  implemented by the Latin American countries while their  respective heads of state and heads of government were holding a  "summit."    Newspaper directors, including those of LA REPUBLICA of  Montevideo and EL PAIS of Spain, stressed that Lacalle's decree  "is unprecedented in the Ibero-American community."    In this regard the newspaper directors stressed that  Ibero-America "does not report a single country in which there  is a private monopoly on open television and cable television."</p>

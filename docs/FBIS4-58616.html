			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division.  After studying the notes for the 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March  1995] national budget for five days, yesterday morning the  Majles approved 85 budget notes. Likewise, yesterday afternoon  the Majles studied the notes appended by the Majles commissions,  which are presented below for our esteemed readers.  <H5>  Majles Speaker's Remarks </H5>   'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, speaker of the Majles, gave a short  speech yesterday concerning International Jerusalem Day. He  said: This year we are staging the Jerusalem Day demonstration  at a time when right in the blessed month of Ramazan the  children of Jerusalem and our dear Muslims were slaughtered by  the Zionists right beside the chaste grave of the hero of unity,  Ibrahim Khalil (peace be upon him), as they were doing their  prayers and prostrations.    The speaker said the Jerusalem issue is not only for the  nation of Palestine or the Muslim Arabs. Jerusalem belongs to  all the Muslims of the world. The aggression and occupation of  Jerusalem was aggression against the Muslim world. Therefore,  the Muslim world must rise up to liberate sacred Jerusalem and  liberate the foremost Muslim shrine from the usurper occupiers.    Of course, in the beginning world imperialism, criminal  America, and the Zionists tried to view this issue as pertaining  only to the Arabs and the Arab-Israeli war and to set up peace  between the Arabs and Israel in order to continue the occupation  and stabilize the Zionist government. Then they gradually  lowered the issue from an Arab-Israeli issue to one involving  only the Palestinians and Israelis. Recently they have limited  it even more and have confined it to the al-Fatah organization  and Israel, and finally, with the signing of the peace agreement  with 'Arafat, they summarized it as the solution to the issue of  the occupied territories.    In the same regard the Majles speaker said: I have often  told  these dear and great religious crusaders from the intifadah and  the Islamic Jihad when they came to the Majles and we met that  if, God forbid, they abandon the Palestine and Jerusalem issue  one day, they must definitely know that we will not abandon it.  For us the Jerusalem issue is one of aspirations and belief.    Nateq-Nuri explained that to liberate sacred Jerusalem all  Muslims must arise. Continuing, he said: This year especially it  should have become clear to the Muslims and the governments of  the other Islamic nations that the nature of the ones seeking  dominion is that if you take one step back, they will take a  step forward and boldly continue with their crimes.    Continuing, the Majles speaker discussed the shameful  Gaza-Jericho Treaty, the fact that Israel has not retreated a  single step and the silence of the United Nations, the Security  Council, and the supporters of human rights towards the  slaughter of the Muslims of al-Khalil. He said: The Islamic and  Muslim nations must adopt this as a basic thesis, acquire  solidarity, and declare their anger at these terrifying crimes  by attending the Jerusalem Day demonstration.  <H5>  Legislation </H5> <H5>  Tuesday Night's Majles Legislation </H5>   Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division.

The sum of 100 percent of the amounts deposited will be  given  to the National Rural Cooperatives Organization to be spent  building silos and multipurpose warehouses.  <H5>  Proposal To Eliminate Note 55 </H5>   Some of the deputies proposed eliminating Note 55. Speaking  in opposition, Mr. Nowbakht said: Last year during consideration  of the budget, I had the honor of a visit with the exalted  leader. He gave special emphasis to the fact that in the 1372  budget we have an outstanding place for fighting the cultural  invasion.    He added: This guidance caused the above note to be  presented  by the deputies. The blessings of this guidance were that in our  responsible cultural organizations such as the Voice and Vision  organization we have seen the start of the third channel, Payam  radio, the province network and other things. In the Ministry of  Education and Training we have 50 cultural societies, various  video clubs, and special youth programs.    If we want to strengthen these organizations to fight the  cultural invasion, if this note is eliminated, how can these  credits be increased?    Continuing, Mr. Rahmani, speaking in support of the proposal  to eliminate, said: The comments from the leader of the  revolution were made under conditions when the budget was almost  closed and was before the Majles. Really, when this year the  government had the opportunity to include this note in the form  of rows, why was it presented to the Majles as an item outside  the program? On the other hand, should everything be spent in  connection with cultural problems?    The expert from the joint commission then announced his  opposition to this proposal. He said: Last year when 54 notes  were approved in open sessions, a proposal was made by a group  of deputies to the effect that Note 55 is for the purpose of  fighting the cultural invasion.    The Plan and Budget Commission expected that this year when  the government presented the budget it would not bring Note 55,  but instead would provide the credits for this sector. We also  believe that this budget writing is against the interest of our  country. It is not appropriate for us to approve all the notes  and then at the end to say that you should give 1 percent of the  money for some other purpose.    The government representative also discussed the elimination  of Note 55. He said: It is not sufficient reason that if we had  a real budget-writing system we would be able to solve all the  problems and this would also be solved.    Last year, for the purpose of defending the issue of  opposing  the cultural invasion and following the exalted leader, the  Majles made a symbolic move, and it allocated a figure from all  the budgets for this purpose.    He added: If we eliminate this note this year what will  happen? Some projects that are half-complete will remain in that  state. You who are speaking of elimination, what will the  replacement be? After the completion of the remarks in favor and  in opposition and the comments from the representatives of the  commission and the government, the proposal to eliminate Note  55, which was set in the budget to fight the cultural invasion,  did not receive a passing vote.  <H5>  Note 55 </H5>   To fight the cultural invasion and alleviate deprivation, to  make efforts towards the nation's self-sufficiency, the Credit  Allocation Committee is required at the time of allocating  credits to deduct 1 percent of all the country's general  revenues for 1373 (with the exception of sums whose disposition  has already been determined by the time of this note, credits  for education and training, higher education and research,  health care and treatment, food and defense) and add them to the  following rows:    1 - Sixty percent of the aforementioned amount will be  given to the office of the president of the republic to be spent  under the supervision of a council chaired by the president of  the republic and with the minister of education and training,  the minister of culture and Islamic guidance, the minister of  culture and higher education, the minister of health care,  treatment and medical education, and the chiefs of the Plan and  Budget Organization, the Physical Training Organization and the  Islamic Propaganda Organization as its members, specifically for  the implementation of suitable projects to fight the cultural  invasion, and a report on its performance will be sent to the  Islamic Council once every three months.  <H5>  Note 56 </H5>   The universities and institutions of higher learning and  research affiliated with the Ministry of Culture and Higher  Education are authorized to collect from applicants who are real  persons and legal entities and deposit into the treasury as  specialist revenue the revenues derived from the following  activities: conducting night classes, conducting special  classes, consulting, executive and expert services, treatment,  veterinary, technical, laboratory and factory services, printing  and reproduction, the sale of books, publications, the results  of technical research and production information, the sale of  agricultural crops, livestock and the like and the sale of  educational, research, cultural, athletic and welfare services,  in accordance with a tariff to be approved by the board of  trustees.  <H5>  Note 57 </H5>   To improve quality and support and to encourage exports of  products from conversion industry agricultural factories, the  Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs is required to take 1  percent of the domestic sales of products from these types of  factories for the year 1373 and to deposit it into the general  revenues account.  <H5>  Note 58 </H5>   The Law on Collecting Some Government Revenues and Spending  it on Specific Items enacted in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March  1991] and the orders pertaining to the collection of general  revenues given in the Islamic Republic of Iran's First Five-Year  Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan Law will remain  in force in the year 1373 until enactment and mandatory  implementation of the Bill on Collecting Some Government  Revenues and Spending It on Specific Items and the Second  Five-Year Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan Law,  adhering to the regulations under this law.

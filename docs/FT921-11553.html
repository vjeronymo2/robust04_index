			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Warning sign for oversized lorries TO PREVENT double-decker buses or lorries from smashing into low bridges, the UK's Department of Transport is planning to instal electronic devices to warn drivers of an impending accident. The Overheight Vehicle Detector, developed by Coeval, of Prestonpans, East Lothian, uses infra-red technology to detect vehicles over a certain height. Two infra-red beams are installed on poles about 100m before the bridge at the maximum clearance height. If the two beams are interrupted by a vehicle, the detectors send a message to an electronic display a short distance further on. Bright flashing amber lights then warn the driver to turn around or take an alternative route. The equipment will be installed in 30 sites in England by September. Coeval: UK, 0875 814555.</p>

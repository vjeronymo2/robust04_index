			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 27 (YONHAP) -- Retired opposition leader  Kim Tae-chung, now chairman of a high-profile research  Institute, called for an early inter-Korean summit Thursday,  saying such a meeting would be a "success in itself." The  summit may well come this or early next year after a series of  inter-Korean exchanges across all sectors, after which the  United States, Japan and other Western nations could improve  relations with North Korea, he said.    "The summit between the rulers of South and North Korea,  President Kim Yong-sam and leader Kim Il-song, must be realized  as soon as possible," Kim said in his keynote speech  inaugurating his peace foundation for the Asia-Pacific region.    "They must have the sense of spirit that a nation is the  most  important of all and erase misunderstanding and distrust to open  the way for reconciliation and cooperation," he said.    The very fact of the two leaders meeting some 50 years after  national division would be a dramatic event, a monumental  success, said Kim.    People must solve all pending issues between them as fellow  human beings of the same nation once the nuclear problem is  resolved, Kim said, neighboring countries can only cooperate,  not lead the Korean reunification process.    Inter-Korean exchanges should start with possible economic  tieups, then build up to family reunions, cultural and social  exchanges, Kim suggested.    "Peaceful coexistence requires continuous arms reduction and  scrutinous inspection," said Kim. "It's important to create the  conditions for peaceful coexistence and national reconciliation  through these measures instead of military confrontation."</p>

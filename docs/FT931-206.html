			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hurd rejects suggestions that EC delays added to tragedy in Bosnia MR Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, last night rejected suggestions by Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, that delay by the European Community in agreeing a common policy in response to the break-up of Yugoslavia added to the tragedy in Bosnia, Ivor Owen writes. Time taken to resolve the dispute within the EC over according diplomatic recognition to Croatia and Slovenia - finally granted in January of this year - had not been decisive in what followed, he said. Mr Hurd emphasised that while Lady Thatcher believed that recognition was given too late, Lord Carrington, the former foreign secretary, who led the EC's initial pacification attempts, thought it was granted too soon. 'I do not think it would have made sense to have withheld recognition for much longer, or that the timing of recognition had much impact on the tragedy in Bosnia which followed,' Mr Hurd said.</p>

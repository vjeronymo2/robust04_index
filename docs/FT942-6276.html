			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (5): Highly innovative issue - Dresdner Bank has transformed its image Dresdner Bank, Germany's second-largest German bank, is known at home for being big, profitable and profoundly conservative. In north America, the bank is not well known at all, concedes Mr Hansgeorg Hofmann, one of the two board members at the bank in charge of investment banking. At least, Mr Hofmann contends, the bank was not well known in the north American financial community until April-May this year when it conducted a capital-raising transaction which stood the bank's reputation for stodgy conservatism on its head. It became the first Germany company or financial institution to launch a global issue of new shares. The highly innovative issue was conducted against a difficult market background. As shares in German banks tumbled amid the fall-out from the collapse of the Jurgen Schneider property group, and north American capital markets reeled from interest rate jitters, Dresdner Bank successfully placed DM1.16bn of fresh equity with international investors. To support the bank's cash-raising exercise, four board members left their comfortable fastness in the centre of Frankfurt's banking district, and took to the road. Together with a team of senior executives, they undertook the undignifying task of going on a roadshow, conducting a total of 60 presentations to institutional investors in Europe, the US and Asia. While this sort of thing is bread and butter work for Anglo-American executives, it is still a new experience for senior German businessmen to undergo the often humiliating experience of being grilled by pimply financial analysts who may not have heard of the Dresdner Bank. 'This was pioneering work,' reflected Mr Hofmann. 'In the US we have never visited institutions or made information available before. We felt that the response was incredibly positive.' The new shares, representing 7 per cent of the bank's equity capital, were placed without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders, although big shareholders in the bank such as the Allianz insurance group (with a 22.31 per cent stake) did subscribe to the issue. According to Mr Hofmann, who joined Dresdner in October 1989 after 20 years in senior positions with US investment banks, the bank has benefited in a number of concrete ways from the issue: It managed to raise its profile with international investors, especially in the US. At 35 per cent, the percentage of shares owned by foreign investors is far lower than at rival German financial institutions. In the US, the bank's shares have traditionally been less popular with investors than those of smaller German banks such as Commerzbank and Bayerische Vereinsbank. It has opened up a source of capital which may reduce the bank's financing costs over the long-term - especially if demand from the international investment community leads to a higher rating for Dresdner Bank shares. The process of putting the issue together within a necessarily short time-frame forced the bank to act in an entrepreneurial way. Mr Hofmann says that traditional chains of management command and lengthy decision-making processes were bypassed in order to get the deal done - a healthy injection of Anglo-Saxon-style frenzy into the bureaucratic culture of a traditional German bank. The successful completion of the issue will have a powerful marketing effect, giving Dresdner the chance to win lucrative global equity placing mandates in the future (particularly in conjunction with the forthcoming privatisations of Deutsche Telekom and Lufthansa). Dresdner was joint global co-ordinator on the issue with Merrill Lynch - but Mr Hofmann believes the financial technology associated with the issue is not proprietory to the US investment banking community. The bank was able take the offensive on the issue of German accounting. Fund managers were especially impressed by the arguments deployed by Mr Andreas Bezold, a former partner in Deloitte &amp; Touche who now heads up Dresdner's finance deparment. He denounced US accounting on issues such as marking securities to market and the disclosure of derivatives risks, providing rare ideological support for German accounting practices often, Bezold complains, condemned unthinkingly by the Anglo-American investment community. The US segment of the issue was placed with institutional investors under Rule 144A of the US Securities Act. This mechanism allowed the bank to avoid making the accounting disclosures required when a company seeks a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Dresdner was able to follow this route within narrow time constraints because shareholders in the bank had some years ago given the bank formal permission to issue up to 10 per cent of new shares without pre-emptive rights. This was in the context of the planned share exchange with Banque Nationale de Paris which has in the meantime become more modest in scope. Mr Hofmann believes that the Rule 144A placing undertaken by the bank may prove to be popular with German institutions in preference to obtaining a full listing. The German government is intending to introduce legislation allowing companies to place up to 10 per cent of their shares without offering pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders. This move could encourage more German companies to tap the US financial markets, the biggest source of capital in the world, following the Dresdner model. To date, Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, is the only German group to have sought and obtained a full listing in the US. It came to the US market last autumn - without an issue of new shares - in a move which provoked outrage among fellow German companies indignant at the idea of complying with US accounting requirements. The total issue of new Dresdner shares was comfortably oversubscribed, although Mr Hofmann admits that hopes of placing 770,000 American Depository Receipts in the US were overly-optimistic. But in a week when 24 out of 39 equity issues planned for the US were postponed or cancelled, Mr Hofmann declares himself delighted with the level of demand for the new Dresdner shares from north American investors. The follow-up demand from US institutions who did not originally take up shares has also been high, he says.</p>

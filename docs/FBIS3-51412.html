"These financiers have substantal investment in Guyana and  are known to be negotiating further investment with the  government," the party said. It accused the government of  "compromising their ability to best serve the interests of the  country."    The opposition Working People's Alliance (WPA) and the  Guyanese Organisation of Indigenous Peoples (GOIP) earlier said  it was inappropriate that South Korean and Malaysian investors  in the Barama Company Limited should underwrite part of the cost  of President Cheddi Jagan's near month-long tour of China,  Malaysia, Singapore and India which ended January 1.    At a press conference last Friday, Jagan admitted the  financing received through Barama to augment limited public  funds, but said he was unable to say at the time the amount of  the funds from the Barama investors.    Barama officials here have referred queries about the extent  of the financing to the government.    Barama, a manufacturer of plywood for export, has been  touched by controversy over the level of concessions it received  from the former Desmond Hoyte administration, and the impact of  its forestry operations on the environment and on hinterland  Amerindian communities here.    The Guyana Human Rights Association (GHRA) also commented,  indirectly, on the matter in a statement Tuesday expressing  concern that linkages with the newly-industrialised Asian  economies opened Guyana to an "aggressive form of exploitation."    "It requires no great leap to imagine several powerful Asian  conglomerates ensuring domestic legislation protects their  interests when one, Barama Company Ltd, is so profoundly  influencing foreign policy," the GHRA statement said.    Former Prime Minister Hamilton Green, at a press conference  Wednesday, described the financing of the presidential tour as  "unorthodox and inappropriate funding by a private group."</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Big two to join power group THE TWO big power generators, National Power and PowerGen, have applied to become members of the trade group which has hitherto represented small, independent power companies. They are expected to be admitted at a meeting today. Mr Michael Spicer, chairman of the Association of Independent Electricity Producers, said yesterday that the admission of the two electricity giants would alter the character of the group substantially but would strengthen its voice. He stressed its one company-one vote rule would be kept. The 100-member association represents industrial companies which produce their own power and the growing number of independent power projects started since the industry was privatised in 1990. Mr David Porter, association chief executive, said he had written to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, offering to contribute to the government review of energy policy sparked by reaction to pit closures. He said the group was concerned that the review should not bring more government interference in energy markets. Among the association's members are several new gas-fired power projects which have been accused of creating the 'dash for gas', said to be taking market share from the coal industry.</p>

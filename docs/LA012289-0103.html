			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AFTER CROSS-BURNING;  </P> <P> CHILDREN'S NAZI SYMBOLS STIR UP NEWHALL RESIDENTS  </P> <P> Next time, they'll play cowboys and Indians.  </P> <P> That was the pledge Saturday from two Santa Clarita boys who briefly set off  neighborhood alarm by leaving a Nazi flag and a painted swastika on a soccer  field after playing a dirt-clod war game.  </P> <P> The soccer field is a block from where a cross was burned Thursday on the front  lawn of a black family's home.  </P> <P> The swastika and the handmade Nazi flag were discovered at dusk Friday by a  12-year-old boy who turned the flag over to leaders of the 271-family Hidden  Valley Homeowners Assn.  </P> <P> Sensitive neighborhood leaders -- who a day earlier offered a $1,000 reward for  information leading to the arrest and conviction of the cross-burner -- quickly  called Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> Investigators learned Saturday morning that the Nazi symbols were left over  from children playing army, not older people's racial intolerance.  </P> <P> "It was a 13-year-old boy playing war games with a 12-year-old friend," said  Deputy Dan Cox, a Sheriff's Department spokesman.  </P> <P> "They had built forts and decided who would be the American and who would be  the German armies. The 13-year-old painted the swastika on the soccer field  grass and made the flag for his fort to mark his territory prior to a dirt-clod  war game at noon on Friday."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Friend Sees Fort  </P> <P> Later, the 13-year-old showed another friend the fort.  </P> <P> But when the third boy became angry over the swastika, the 13-year-old got  scared and didn't tell his friend that he'd made the flag, Cox said.  </P> <P> Detectives are convinced that there were no underlying motives for the flag or  swastika ,and the 13-year-old does not face any charges, Cox said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Harvey Cantor said the swastika was apparently painted on the  grass last Sunday and remained unnoticed for five days.  </P> <P> "The kids are scared stiff," said Cantor, who would not reveal their  identities. "Their parents are very upset."  </P> <P> So were others in the Hidden Valley neighborhood, where the cross-burning at  the home of Derrick Quals, 31, remained unsolved Saturday afternoon.  </P> <P> "Swastikas are sick. This is gross," said Mike Stewart, 12, as he examined the  soccer field where freshly spread bark chips covered the white spray-painted  Nazi symbol.  </P> <P> "Look what the Nazis did to the Jewish people. I don't care if they were  playing. I used to play army, but I'd never do anything like this."  </P> <P> The cross-burning was wrong too, said friend Bryan Smith, 12. "It was dumb.  There's no excuse for burning crosses. It's stupid."  </P></p>

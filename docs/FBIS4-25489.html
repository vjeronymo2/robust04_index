			<p>BFN     [Text] What is Hebei's current endeavor to build the  spiritual civilization, and what are its problems and  priorities? This is a question that Cheng Weigao, secretary of  the provincial party committee, has paid great attention to. On  the morning of 7 June, provincial leaders Cheng Weigao, Chen  Yujie, and Han Licheng heard a report on this issue given by the  propaganda department of the provincial party committee.    After listening to the report, Cheng Weigao spoke on further  intensifying efforts to build the spiritual civilization. He  said: The current situation in building the spiritual  civilization is good on the whole. However, this endeavor has  yet to be developed in range and quality. We should  conscientiously probe this in line with the new conditions. We  should note that it is all the more important to step up efforts  to build the socialist spiritual civilization when the socialist  market economy system is being established gradually and money  worship has become increasingly conspicuous in some localities.  We should not only build an economically strong province, but  we should also make Hebei a province with a strong spiritual  civilization. The emphasis in the endeavors towards a spiritual  civilization lies in the efforts to build it. Aiming at  achieving a fairly comfortable life and promoting social  progress, all localities should do a good job in formulating  plans for building the spiritual civilization. The plans should  at least specify the goals, fronts, activities, systems, and  [words indistinct].    Speaking on the work that should be made successful when  building the spiritual civilization, Chen Weigao pointed out:  Focusing on the education on patriotism, collectivism, and  socialism, we should greatly advocate the spirit of courage in  doing what is right, helping the people in need, helping the  wounded and the dying, unity and friendship, selfless devotion,  and hard work in pioneering new causes. We should extensively  organize and carry out various healthy, cultivated, and  civilized cultural activities that the masses can participate  in. We should appraise and name civilized units and civilized  villages and towns strictly according to established standards.  We should conduct extensive and in-depth education on the legal  system, especially among young people, conduct special study on  the five-and-a-half-day work system and on how to organize and  guide the masses' sparetime activities, do a better job in the  infrastructure for cultural activities, and strictly manage the  cultural market according to law, especially the markets for  video and audio products and publications and recreational  areas. We should earnestly solve the problems in the cultural  market which are reflected in the refusal to abide by laws or  laxity in enforcing laws. In rural areas, emphasis should be  placed on the crackdown on feudal and superstitious activities.  Such activities that endanger the physical and mental health of  the masses and cause serious consequences should be strictly  banned.    Cheng Weigao, secretary of the provincial party committee,  urged party committees and governments at all levels to examine  and arrange all tasks for building the spiritual civilization in  a unified manner, conscientiously strengthen leadership, and  change some localities' unwillingness to spend money on building  the spiritual civilization. Top leaders of party committees and  the comrades and departments in charge of the spiritual  civilization should conscientiously hold their responsibility  and be competent in their work.    Chen Yujie, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee, also spoke on his opinions at the report meeting.</p>

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Treatt shares rise 13p on back of profits jump Shares of Treatt, the USM-traded supplier, blender and distiller of essential oils and aromatic chemicals, jumped 13p to 180p yesterday on news of a 31 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.66m for the year ended September 30 1993. The improvement, from last time's Pounds 1.27m, was scored on a turnover just 2 per cent ahead at Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 15.1m). Net margins, however, jumped from 8.4 per cent to 10.8 per cent. Earnings rose to 12.27p (9.37p) and a proposed final dividend of 2.9p lifts the total dividend to 4p (3.6p). Mr Geoffrey Bovrill, chairman, said the US offshoot, Florida Treatt, made its first operating profit and was proving to be an important outlet for the sale of RC Treatt's products, particularly its specialities and natural chemicals. Florida Treatt was formed in 1990 to manufacture natural orange juice aromas. The main products are used to improve the aroma of concentrated orange juice which loses some flavour components during production. Its turnover rose by about 50 per cent over the 1992-93 year and the customer base substantially expanded. Overall, Suffolk-based Treatt has a basic range of over 100 different essential oils. Its customers include flavour and fragrance creators as well as manufacturers of soft drinks, food, confectionery, pharmaceuticals, soap and detergents. A substantial potion of turnover consists of export sales.</p>

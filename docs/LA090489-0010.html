			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HISTORY OF SECRECY, PROBLEMS CLOUD ROCKWELL'S CLAIMS OF NUCLEAR SAFETY  </P> <P> In its fight to strengthen its credibility and assure the public about the  safety of the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, Rockwell International might  consider the case of William Lane.  </P> <P> The Canoga Park man was 22 in 1959 when he became a radiation safety officer at  Santa Susana, the research site west of Chatsworth where Rockwell does nuclear  work for the federal government. Lane was still a young man 18 years later when  he learned he had leukemia.  </P> <P> After Lane grew deathly ill, his family filed a workers compensation claim,  blaming the illness on radiation exposure. Lane died in May, 1986, at the age  of 49.  </P> <P> Four months after Lane's death, Marlin E. Remley, director of nuclear safety  and licensing for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, told San Fernando Valley  members of the National Council of Jewish Women the company had "never had a  radioactive injury, a permanent radioactive injury."  </P> <P> But Rockwell later paid the Lane family a $90,000 settlement -- a large sum for  a compensation case -- because doctors for the company agreed that radiation  exposure probably caused or contributed to Lane's death, the case file shows.  The company also has paid smaller settlements in four other cases of alleged  radiation-induced cancer, according to figures supplied by Rockwell.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scoffs at Cancer Link  </P> <P> Settlements are not admissions of responsibility. And Remley, who retired in  January, maintained in a recent interview that radiation exposures at  Rocketdyne were so low that "I seriously question whether anyone has really  suffered cancer because of radiation exposure."  </P> <P> Still, some Rockwell critics look back with scorn at Remley's presentation.  "It's very obvious that they lied to us" about the safety of Santa Susana,  Jeanne Londe, an officer of the Jewish women's council who attended Remley's  talk, said recently.  </P> <P> To Londe and other critics, questions about Rockwell's credibility and  contamination at Santa Susana have become almost inseparable.  </P> <P> The big blow came in May with disclosure of a U.S. Department of Energy report  on radioactive and chemical contamination at the test lab. Many residents  refused to believe that conditions there did not pose an immediate health  threat, despite assurances from Energy Department, Rockwell and independent  state and federal agencies. Among other things, the report made clear that more  nuclear work had gone on at the site than the public had been told.  </P> <P> "I think that's why we're all concerned," said Milena Miller of Reseda, who is  fighting renewal of the Santa Susana lab's license to recycle nuclear fuel. "If  we thought they'd been honest . . . we wouldn't be pursuing this."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Various Factors  </P> <P> Interviews and a review of government records and news accounts suggest various  factors helped create the climate of mistrust, including:  </P> <P> * Statements by company officials that came back to bite them, such as Remley's  remark. The company's cause was not helped by allegations of pollution and  deception at two other Rockwell-Energy Department operations -- the Rocky Flats  nuclear weapons plant near Denver and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in  eastern Washington.  </P> <P> * Company reticence about the nuclear side of its business. While basking in  favorable publicity about its work in the nation's space program, Rockwell over  the years divulged much less information about its nuclear activities. Although  press clippings show the company's nuclear mission received occasional  coverage, the company rarely volunteered information and publicity was  intermittent -- partly reflecting secrecy concerns of Rockwell's customer, the  Atomic Energy Commission (later, the Energy Department).  </P> <P> * Statements by health and environmental regulators who accused Rockwell of  failing to tell them about its nuclear work, even though the statements are in  some instances contradicted by documents on file in their agencies. Put on the  spot by newspaper reporters, some officials may have given hasty answers  without knowing or remembering what Rockwell had told them in the past.  </P> <P> Also, Rockwell was partly immune from regulation and arguably not required to  keep the agencies fully informed. Still, the situation was seen by some as  evidence of a cover-up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'We Have Commitment'  </P> <P> Pat Coulter, spokesman for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, said the company  never sought to mislead anyone. "We have a commitment to keep the public  informed, and we're going to do that," he said.  </P> <P> A general distrust of things nuclear is also part of the company's predicament.  For years, government weapons production and nuclear research was shielded from  publicity and largely immune to many environmental rules facing other  industries. As these operations have been dragged into the spotlight, many  environmental groups, citizens and congressmen have not liked what they've  seen.  </P> <P> "Rockwell definitely seems to have had more than its share of problems," said  Jim Werner, a project engineer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an  environmental group. But "the fact that they're working for the Department of  Energy is more than a small contributor" to those problems, he said.  </P> <P> "Because of the Department of Energy's secrecy in weapons production, they and  their contractors have also been less than up front about environmental  problems," Werner said.  </P> <P> Nuclear power was born in secrecy during World War II in the race to build the  first atomic bomb.  </P> <P> As late as 1952, when Rockwell's predecessor firm, North American Aviation Co.,  started up California's first atomic reactor in Downey, the small test plant  initially was classified.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Satellite Program  </P> <P> A few years later at Santa Susana, the company developed the first of several  SNAP (Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power) reactors, which were intended to  provide power for spy satellites, a company official said.  </P> <P> In the early years, "all nuclear reactors were born classified," said Bob  Tuttle, Rocketdyne radiation and nuclear safety manager, who joined the company  in 1957.  </P> <P> "All of us had top-level clearances from the AEC," Tuttle said, refering to the  U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. "We were taught, instructed, not to talk about  our work. . . . The philosophy of not divulging information I'm sure was  thoroughly ingrained in our top people, and the public relations people,"  Tuttle said.  </P> <P> He said the attitude carried over to later years. "Information has always been  available," said Tuttle, but the company "didn't push it on people."  </P> <P> A tradition of secrecy was reinforced by growing public distrust of atomic  power, even before Three Mile Island or Chernobyl.  </P> <P> Court cases and news reports disclosed that American soldiers had been marched  into the desert after nuclear blasts to see how they'd react. And clusters of  cancer and leukemia appeared in downwind communities, where residents weren't  warned to take precautions following atomic tests. Meanwhile, government and  the nuclear industry struggled unsuccessfully to find a safe means to dispose  of high-level radioactive waste.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Negative' Stories  </P> <P> Rocketdyne spokesman Paul Sewell, who managed the National Atomic Museum in  Albuquerque for a time in the 1970s, recalled that whenever a reporter came to  do a story on the museum, there was always a good chance "it was going to be a  negative story."  </P> <P> Industry officials, put on the defensive, usually took a low profile, reasoning  that little good could come of saying more than was necessary. In this  atmosphere, a serious nuclear accident at Santa Susana in 1959 was not widely  publicized for 20 years.  </P> <P> The accident involved the so-called "sodium reactor experiment," the first  nuclear reactor in the country to produce electricity for a commercial power  grid. Dedication ceremonies in November, 1957, "attracted many high-ranking  government and industrial leaders," according to an account in The Times.  </P> <P> But the accident, in which 13 of 43 nuclear fuel rods ruptured or partially  melted, did not make a blip on the public radar until 1979, when an  anti-nuclear group released records obtained under the Freedom of Information  Act.  </P> <P> The Atomic Energy Commission and North American Aviation issued a press release  following the accident in the summer of 1959. But the two-page statement was so  technical that it was widely ignored. Words such as "accident" and "meltdown"  were not used. The release gave no hint that the commission had criticized the  company for continuing to run the reactor despite weeks of abnormal operation,  as records later showed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Mentioned in Report  </P> <P> The accident also was blacked out of a 1983 report by Rockwell to the Energy  Department on decommissioning and cleanup of the sodium reactor. A section on  historical highlights of the project made no mention of the accident. During  the 1950s, at least a dozen newspaper articles discussed Santa Susana's  emergence as a nuclear reactor site. Much later, in 1981, a news story said a  safety analysis commissioned by Ventura County officials found that Santa  Susana workers and the public were adequately protected from radiation hazards.  It would be ludicrous to suggest that the nuclear side of Rocketdyne's work  stayed hidden, company spokesman Paul Sewell said.  </P> <P> In recent years, however, publicity about that work has been minuscule compared  to that focused on Rockwell's involvement in the space program. Almost everyone  knew Rockwell built and tested engines for the space shuttle. But many people  didn't know the firm had run more than a dozen nuclear reactors and produced  and recycled nuclear fuel at the same sites.  </P> <P> Even when Rockwell made news because of pollution, it was linked to non-nuclear  work. News articles in recent years told how the company, under orders from  state health agencies, was attempting to clean up ground water pollution from  chemical solvents that were used to rinse rocket engines. But the issue of  radioactive pollution was rarely raised.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cover-Up Charged  </P> <P> Controversy engulfed Santa Susana in May after the Los Angeles Daily News wrote  the first of many front page articles about the Energy Department report on  contamination at Santa Susana. Subsequent stories suggested a cover-up, stating  that health and environmental agencies were unaware of the extent of nuclear  work at the site.  </P> <P> In fact, their ignorance may not have been as surprising or as complete as the  stories suggested.  </P> <P> For one thing, nuclear safety at the lab was beyond the jurisdiction of most  environmental agencies, so Rockwell wasn't always obliged to keep them fully  informed.  </P> <P> Moreover, correspondence suggests that the agencies knew at least enough to  have asked pointed questions.  </P> <P> Officials with the toxic substances control division of the state Department of  Health Services were among those who said they knew nothing of Rocketdyne's  nuclear work. But their off-the-cuff remarks were at odds with their own files.  </P> <P> "Some of us were a little bit surprised at first, . . . but quite a few of us  are new to the division," said Scott Simpson, enforcement chief for the  division's regional office in Burbank.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inspectors Knew  </P> <P> From a review of inspection reports "it becomes pretty clear" that agency  inspectors knew part of Santa Susana "was a DOE nuclear power-type research  facility" that they assumed they "didn't have authority over," Simpson said.  </P> <P> The California Regional Water Quality Control Board was another agency that  complained it had been kept in the dark. The board was working with Rockwell on  the cleanup of non-nuclear areas of the Santa Susana site, where chemical  solvents had leaked into ground water. At the direction of the regional board,  Rockwell periodically tested off-site wells and springs for solvents and  reported the data to the agency.  </P> <P> Although it was unknown to the regional board, Rockwell also was testing the  well water for radioactivity, finding no evidence that any had migrated from  the site. But the regional board had not asked for radioactivity measurements  and apparently did not know the company was taking them. Instead, Rockwell  shared the data with the Department of Health Services' radiological health  branch.  </P> <P> Regional board officials expressed indignation when they learned of the  radioactivity testing in May. Rockwell and the Energy Department should have  volunteered the data, if only as a professional courtesy, Hank Yacoub, a senior  engineer with the regional board, said later. "You know we don't have the  resources" to police everyone, Yacoub said. "Without the cooperation of  industry," he said, the agency "is going to be totally ineffective."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Records Show Otherwise  </P> <P> But records show the board should not have been completely in the dark.  </P> <P> For example, in a letter to the regional board in October, 1981, a lawyer for  residents of Bell Canyon near Santa Susana expressed concern about possible  radioactive discharges into Bell Creek.  </P> <P> Regional board files show that Raymond Hertel, then executive officer for the  agency, replied that the discharges were being monitored by Rockwell and  contained no radioactive pollution.  </P> <P> Rockwell "conducts some very low-level radioactive operations" at Santa Susana,  according to Hertel's letter in December, 1981.  </P> <P> Then in May, 1986, Rockwell told the board in a letter why it couldn't test  ground water for chemical pollution in a particular area of Santa Susana. As  the letter disclosed, "a small space power reactor" formerly was housed in a  building in that area, and water seeping into the basement had become  contaminated by radioactive cobalt 60.  </P> <P> If the company pumped ground water for chemical tests, this might cause the  "cobalt 60 contaminated water to exit the basement," the letter explained.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't See Letter  </P> <P> The letter was addressed to Yacoub, but he said he never saw it and that it was  dated at a time he was on vacation. In any case, he said, the letter was a  "very vague" and "perhaps even a sneaky way of addressing the issue of  radioactivity."  </P> <P> Rockwell denies there was anything sneaky about the letter. Besides, "the  radioactivity was out of that agency's jurisdiction," Tuttle said. "I think the  appropriate agencies were always fully informed of what we were doing."  </P> <P> The regional water board and health services department may have the last word,  however. Both agencies are investigating whether Rockwell violated state laws  by failing to obtain permits for some waste treatment and disposal operations  at Santa Susana.  </P> <P> Also fueling the credibility issue were sensational allegations about two other  Rockwell-Energy Department sites: Hanford and Rocky Flats.  </P> <P> Until 1987, Rockwell operated the plutonium processing plants at the giant  Hanford atomic weapons complex in eastern Washington. A recent report by the  House subcommittee on oversight and investigations told how Rockwell prepared  for a visit to Hanford by Washington's governor in March, 1985.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warnings Removed  </P> <P> As the governor's party approached a contaminated area, "signs which warned of  the radiation hazard were removed . . . on direct orders from Rockwell Hanford  Operations management . . ." said the June, 1989, report.  </P> <P> "A part of the governor's entourage passed right through the contaminated area,  oblivious of the hazard around them," the report said. "Rockwell covered up  this incident for almost one year until the matter came to the attention of the  media and the subcommittee."  </P> <P> And at Rocky Flats northwest of Denver, operated by Rockwell for the Energy  Department, a special federal grand jury is weighing evidence of possible  criminal violations of environmental laws.  </P> <P> Rocky Flats opened in 1952 to produce plutonium detonators for nuclear bombs.  For more than two decades it was run by Dow Chemical, before Rockwell took over  in 1975.  </P> <P> During Dow's tenure, an atmospheric scientist discovered higher levels of  plutonium in soil downwind from the plant than in upwind areas. Dow had  secretly buried hundreds of barrels of radioactively contaminated lathe oil,  which was leaking into soil and being scattered by the wind.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Minutes of Meeting  </P> <P> With the source of the contamination sure to be discovered, Dow officials met  to discuss a program of damage control. According to minutes of a April 3,  1970, meeting, filed as an exhibit in subsequent court cases, one Dow official  asked:  </P> <P> "Do you suppose we ought to sneak an article in the paper saying recovery  operations have started if that is what we decide to do? Or should we wait  until they find out and then admit we're up to something?"  </P> <P> "We probably don't even know who it was who made the decision to bury the  God-damned stuff," said a second official.  </P> <P> "We can always blame it on Venable," said a third, mentioning a Dow official  who had been transfered to Chile.  </P> <P> "I'll drink to that," the second man said.  </P> <P> After Dow, Rockwell came on the scene as something of a white knight. But there  were problems on its watch, culminating in an extraordinary raid in June by  dozens of FBI agents and Environmental Protection Agency officials seeking  evidence of possible criminal violations of hazardous waste and clean water  laws.  </P> <P> In a 116-page affidavit supporting the warrant request, the FBI said there was  "probable cause to believe" that Rocky Flats officials had "illegally operated  . . . an outdated and unpermitted" hazardous waste incinerator.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memo Differs  </P> <P> In addition, although Rockwell and Energy Department officials from the early  to mid-1980s "repeatedly stated to the public and certified to government  agencies that Rocky Flats was in compliance with federal and state  environmental laws," an internal Energy Department memo told a different story,  the affidavit said.  </P> <P> According to the July, 1986, memo, Rocky Flats was "in poor condition generally  in terms of environmental compliance." Some of its waste facilities were  "patently 'illegal,' " the FBI quoted the memo as saying.  </P> <P> In a formal statement, Sam F. Iacobellis, president of Rockwell's aerospace  division, which includes Rocky Flats, said Rocky Flats officials "have not and  will not subordinate health and safety . . . to production requirements."  </P> <P> He said "the hard evidence we have seen thus far indicates the incinerators  were not operated on the dates alleged or otherwise illegally."  </P> <P> Rocketdyne spokesman Pat Coulter said it's unfair to link problems at Rocky  Flats with Rocketdyne's operations here. Rocky Flats "is a different facility  run by different people with a different mission," according to Coulter. He  said that at Rocketdyne, there is a "commitment on behalf of the most senior  management to run their business safely and ethically."  </P></p>

However, downtown Mafikeng looked more like a business area than  it has done since Wednesday with people, taxis and cars  thronging in the streets.    Station Street, the scene of most of the clashes between  security forces and rioting civilians, resembled more than ever  a country town on market day with the taxi rank full and people  shopping. Most of the stores were open, including those cleaned  out by looters, as mopping up operations after four days of  violence seemed to have ended.    The road between Mafikeng and the capital Mmabatho had heavy  traffic flow in both directions and parking lots outside  government and parastatal buildings in mmabatho were filled with  cars. Most operations seemed to be returning to normal after the  civil service strike.    Full-scale cleaning up operations started in earnest at the  extensively looted Mega City shopping complex adjacent to the  government buildings, although none of the businesses there had  any stock to count or sell.    Flash point of the wave of unrest that rocked the fragmented  homeland, the Bophuthatswana Broadcasting Corporation, also  reopened on Monday. Corporation staff were back at work,  clearing up broken glass and garbage spilt during a police  routing of employees who occupied the building and effectively  shut down the radio and television service for more than a week.    Broadcasts will resume operations only on Tuesday. In spite  of no broadcasts, the radio news room was a hive of activity.</p>

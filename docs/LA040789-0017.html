			<p><P> April 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> .. . BUT BUILD THE ACADEMY ELSEWHERE  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Police Department is once again trying to bully its way around  Elysian Park. Proposition 2, the Police Facilities Bond Measure, is so poorly  worded that most voters will probably not realize that it includes funds for a  new police academy. But it does.  </P> <P> Although it is not spelled out, the LAPD has made it known that it has  earmarked $40 million of the $176-million bond issue for a new academy, that  constructing the academy is the LAPD's top priority and that Elysian Park is  the preferred site. The LAPD has claimed that it has not determined whether it  will rebuild on the current police academy site in Elysian Park or elsewhere,  but it has also admitted that the $40-million figure does not include money for  land acquisition, should that be necessary.  </P> <P> As a group that has been fighting the expansion of the police academy in  Elysian Park for 22 years, the Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park is well  aware that the academy is overcrowded and in need of repair. We do not question  that new training facilities are needed. We also know that training facilities  in Elysian Park are disruptive to, and incompatible with, recreational park use  and that alternative and better-suited sites, especially one at Los Angeles  Southwest Community College, are available. The Angeles Chapter of the Sierra  Club supports our position on this matter.  </P> <P> Our position is also supported by a 1972 study by the city's chief  administrative officer. That extensive 59-page report concluded, first, that  the "Elysian Park site is now and will always be inadequate for the high  quality and comprehensive training required for the Los Angeles Police  Department." It further concluded that increased public use of the parkland  surrounding the academy site was inevitable and that police activity there  "will result in constant irritation and is incompatible use of public land."  </P> <P> Those observations remain true in 1989. The plans for the police academy call  for a threefold increase in the occupant capacity, with more than 224,000  square feet of buildings. The plans also call for multi-story parking garages  that would accommodate more than 1,000 cars to replace the surface parking  area. Clearly, this scale of construction and the activity that goes with it do  not belong in a park. This is especially true, given how little parkland Los  Angeles has in relation to its population.  </P> <P> The police assure us that the new expanded police academy would not take more  parkland, but if that is the case why is there no language to that effect in  the proposal? Even if the police stay within the 21 acres that are now  controlled by the Board of Public Works, their presence in such an increased  capacity would have a drastic negative impact on Elysian Park.  </P> <P> The Citizens Committee to Save Elysian Park has raised these and other issues  with both the LAPD and the City Council subcommittees that reviewed the  proposition before the council's vote to put it on Tuesday's ballot. However,  both our arguments and our request to separate the police academy funding from  the rest of Proposition 2 fell on deaf ears.  </P> <P> The construction and expansion of a police academy, whether at its current site  or elsewhere, is too important an issue to be hidden in such an  all-encompassing and vaguely worded bond issue. It is unfair to ask the public  to vote for new facilities for their neighborhoods at the possible expense of  the loss of their park. The voters should let the LAPD and the City Council  know that they consider parkland a valuable asset by voting no on Proposition  2.  </P></p>

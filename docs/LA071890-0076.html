			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE ORDERED TO RELEASE MEDI-CAL FUNDS;  </P> <P> BUDGET: STALEMATE IN LEGISLATURE MAY BE NEARING AN END. DEMOCRATS APPEAR READY  TO MAKE CONCESSIONS.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge Tuesday ordered the state to release $330 million to  hospitals and nursing homes by Monday, a development that came as Assembly  Democrats appeared ready to make concessions they hoped would end the crisis  that has left California floundering without a budget for more than two weeks.  </P> <P> Judge Ronald B. Robie of the Sacramento County Superior Court, acting on a  request by a group of nursing home operators, issued the temporary restraining  order to free $330 million for 1,200 hospitals and 1,468 nursing homes. Many of  the facilities rely heavily on Medi-Cal funds and have not been paid since July  1.  </P> <P> Controller Gray Davis, who is prevented by law from paying state bills until a  budget is approved, applauded the judge's decision. But he warned that if the  courts continue to order the release of funds and the state makes an  $850-million payment to school districts this month, as scheduled, the treasury  will be "bone dry" by July 27. Last week, a federal judge ordered the state to  provide payments of $149 million to nearly 2 million welfare recipients.  </P> <P> Assembly Democrats said in interviews that they are prepared as a last resort  to send Gov. George Deukmejian a plan to close the $3.6-billion budget gap  entirely with cuts in programs. Until Tuesday, the Democrats had been insisting  that any solution include equal doses of budget cuts and tax and fee increases.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) said, "You can hold out, but at some point,  holding out with no end in sight and no hope for compromise ends up hurting the  very people we are trying to help."  </P> <P> Two Assembly-Senate conference committees meeting Tuesday night approved the  Democratic plan, setting the stage for an Assembly floor vote on Thursday.  </P> <P> The package includes more than $1.3 billion in new revenues and $1.6 billion in  budget cuts, but the two sides of the equation are not linked.  </P> <P> One leading Republican, Assemblyman Willam P. Baker of Danville, denounced the  package as a "political charade." He predicted his fellow Republicans would  reject the plan because it would force the governor to cut too deeply into  programs Republicans value, such as prisons and universities, and spare such  Democrat-supported services as health and welfare.  </P> <P> The developments came as the state faced an ever-deepening cash crunch because  of the budget crisis.  </P> <P> Davis said that once the $850-million payment is made to schools July 27,  "there will be absolutely no money left to make any substantial payments at  all."  </P> <P> Davis has been taking the side of welfare recipients, nursing home operators  and others whose state payments have been held up even though he is named as a  defendant in the lawsuits.  </P> <P> The Democratic officeholder appeared at a news conference with several  minimum-wage "in-home support workers" who have not been paid since mid-June  for their services to the sick and elderly who otherwise would have to go into  costly nursing homes.  </P> <P> Despite the court action requiring the state to make payments to welfare  recipients and hospitals, Davis is still holding up about $870 million in other  payments, including $270 million in Medi-Cal money for doctors, dentists and  pharmacies and an additional $21 million to providers of in-home support  services.  </P> <P> Cindy Lara, 33, of Sacramento, who cares for her chronically ill 66-year-old  father under the In-Home Supportive Services program, burst into tears at  Davis' news conference. "I have no money. I have an eviction notice. I have to  be out of my home Aug. 10. My car is ready to be repossessed," she said,  sobbing.  </P> <P> Elsewhere around the state similar stories were being told.  </P> <P> "I ran out of food around the 10th (of July) and the bills have kept coming  in," said Rita Blue, a Riverside County resident who depends on a  $1,000-per-month check from the state to support herself and her mother, who  has Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> "You want to know how bad things are? Today I sold blood so I could buy  something to eat," she said, adding that she received $15 from a blood bank.  </P> <P> For James Weatherby and his wife, Lynne, of Riverside, the payment holdup has  meant going without meals so two other family members have enough nourishment  to offset the effects of medication they take for epilepsy.  </P> <P> Lynne Weatherby provides in-home care for her 13-year-old son, Ted, who is also  blind and epileptic, and his brother, Rick. Her monthly checks of $648, coupled  with a small disability check James Weatherby receives because he is blind, are  what the family live on.  </P> <P> "We're going through a lot of hurt," said James Weatherby, 35, estimating the  family income since July 10 at $5.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles County, many home-care workers from among about 40,000 have not  been paid since June 10, according to Ophelia McFadden, general manager of the  Los Angeles Homecare Workers Union Local 434B of Service Employees  International Union.  </P> <P> She said that the union "delivered food to some who didn't even have gas or bus  fare. . . . One woman called and broke down and cried and said I have nothing  in my house for my children (to eat). We are trying to provide food baskets."  </P> <P> Lolly Birlin, a Ventura County woman who cares for her severely disabled  daughter, said that after buying groceries and gasoline Tuesday morning she was  down to her last $1.78. "I'm just waiting. I don't know what else to do," she  said.  </P> <P> Also hard hit is Bette Bendorf, a single mother who provides home care to a  number of clients in Orange County. She said that she has been unable to pay  her rent because she has missed two paychecks.  </P> <P> "I am going to have to take care of those clients who absolutely need the care  and others are going to have to do without for a while."  </P> <P> In San Diego, Ernestine Aviles, who cares for a 90-year-old woman, said that  she will be able to survive the budget crunch because of her husband's  earnings. But many of other people who live in her apartment complex won't be  so lucky, she said. "There are homemakers in this building who are having to  force themselves to leave their patients because there is no paycheck coming  in."  </P> <P> Ronald M. Kurtz, executive director of the California Assn. of Health  Facilities, the group that filed the suit to free up the Medi-Cal funds, said  Judge Robie's decision "means the money will be released in time for nursing  homes to meet their next payroll." Kurtz said that most nursing homes have  already missed two payrolls.  </P> <P> "Nursing home employees have been getting paid by borrowing to the hilt. We're  against the wall. A significant number of our facilities are on the brink of  bankruptcy."  </P> <P> Contributing to this story were Times staff writers Daniel M.

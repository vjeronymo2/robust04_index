			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Windfall prospects boost Gas Anticipation of a big boost to revenues at British Gas saw heavy turnover and a rally in the shares, which closed 6 up at 304p yesterday. Investors were buying ahead of the expected windfall to the company from customers paying early and beating the imposition of value added tax on gas bills. Turnover rose to 18m, making it the most heavily traded Footsie stock in the market. Volume was boosted by a block of 5m shares taken at 295p and placed at 298p. Dealers said the company had already received more than Pounds 100m in advance payments and was expected to net around Pounds 500m ahead of the VAT deadline at the end of the month. The effect will be to boost earnings by about Pounds 30m, according to some analysts.</p>

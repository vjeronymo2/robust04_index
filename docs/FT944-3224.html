			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough doubles with Pounds 5.3m Goldsborough Healthcare, the nursing homes, hospitals and homecare group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in profits amid growing demand for private medical services. The company, which raised Pounds 29m from its flotation earlier this year, saw pre-tax profits more than double from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 5.3m in the 12 months to October 2, as turnover increased 39 per cent to Pounds 41.7m (Pounds 30m). Mr Graham Smith, chief executive, said the figures justified the group's expansion  - involving Pounds 8.2m of acquisi-tions since it came to the market. He signalled a further step in that strategy yesterday by announcing the Pounds 4.9m acquisition of two nursing homes and a sheltered housing management company from Emerson Group, the privately owned property developer. The cash purchase will push net borrowing up to Pounds 23.1m  - equivalent to gearing of 48 per cent  - and will increase Goldsborough's total number of beds to 1,349. Outlining plans for further acquisitions, Mr Smith said the group would be comfortable with gearing of up to 75 per cent 'although we'd prefer it to remain below 50 per cent'. The group is also increasing its homecare activities by opening five new branches, serving an area of the market which it claimed was proving more popular than residential homes. Of the group's three main divisions, however, profits in homecare were outstripped by both care homes and acute hospitals. Profits from care homes rose from Pounds 4.8m to Pounds 6.1m; while in acute hospitals they increased from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.9m. Homecare, nevertheless, reported increased profits of Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 700,000). Earnings per share rose from 7.1p to 13p, or from 9.1p to 11.6p after adjustment for recovery of advance corporation tax; the group announced a maiden full year dividend of 2.3p, some 5 per cent ahead of expectations. The shares rose 4p to 148p yesterday, still well below the flotation price of 170p.</p>

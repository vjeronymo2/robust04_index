			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were no comments on the proposed rule. Thus, a new &sect;233.20(a)(4)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> r <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) implements the provision as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disregard of Agent Orange Payments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the In Re Agent Orange product liability case, M.D.L. No. 381 (E.D.N.Y.), several corporations which manufactured the chemical Agent Orange agreed to pay $180 million into a settlement fund. Under the settlement, military personnel who were exposed to the chemical Agent Orange while in Vietnam and who now suffer from total disabilities caused by any disease, and survivors of deceased veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange, are eligible for settlement payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1 of Public Law 101&hyph;201, enacted December 6, 1989, specifies that, effective January 1, 1989, the payments made from the Agent Orange Settlement Fund or any other fund pursuant to the settlement in connection with the case In Re Agent Orange product liability litigation, M.D.L. No. 381 (E.D.N.Y.), shall not be considered income or resources in determining eligibility for or the amount of benefits under any Federal or federally assisted programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 10405 of Public Law 101&hyph;239, enacted December 19, 1989, also specifies that, effective January 1, 1989, payments from the Agent Orange settlement fund or any other fund established pursuant to the settlement shall not be considered income or resources in determining eligibility for or the amount of benefits under certain specified Federal or federally assisted programs including, among others, AFDC (title IV&hyph;A of the Social Security Act) and the adult assistance programs (titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Act). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were no comments on the proposed rule. Thus, a new &sect;233.20(a)(4)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> s <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) implements these provisions as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disregard of Payments Made Under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public Law 101&hyph;426, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, enacted October 15, 1990, establishes a program to compensate individuals for injuries or deaths resulting from the exposure to radiation from nuclear testing and uranium mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The law authorizes a $100 million trust fund from which payments will be made. Payments may be made until the earlier of the date on which the $100 million, and any income earned on this amount, is expended or 22 years after the law was enacted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individuals who were injured due to exposure to radiation from nuclear testing will receive $50,000 each. Individuals who were injured due to exposure to radiation while employed as uranium miners will receive $100,000 each. When the affected individual is deceased, payments will be made to the surviving spouse, children, parents, grandchildren or grandparents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 6(h)(2) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act provides that amounts paid to an individual pursuant to this law will not be included as income or resources for purposes of determining eligibility to receive benefits described in section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code, or the amount of such benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3803(c)(2)(C) of title 31, United States Code contains a list of various Federal and federally-assisted programs including, among others, the AFDC program. However, the list does not include the adult assistance programs under titles I, X, XIV, and XVI (AABD) of the Social Security Act. Therefore, the disregards required by section 6(h)(2) of Public Law 101&hyph;426 do not apply to the adult assistance programs administered in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Action Transmittal FSA&hyph;AT&hyph;91&hyph;5, dated February 25, 1991, notified the States of the requirements of Public Law 101&hyph;426 to disregard, for purposes of the AFDC program, compensation received by individuals, or upon death by the spouse, children, parents, grandchildren, or grandparents, for injuries sustained by such individuals due to the exposure to radiation from nuclear testing or uranium mining. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are adding a new &sect;233.20(a)(4)(ii)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> u <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) to implement this provision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the regulatory changes related to section 6(h)(2) of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, Public Law 101&hyph;426, do not involve administrative discretion, but simply implement the statutory requirements, we believe that, under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) good cause exists for waiver of a notice of proposed rulemaking on the grounds that it is not necessary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Disregard of Bona Fide Loans <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 223.20(a)(3)(iv)(B) of the existing regulations states that, in determining the availability of income and resources, loans which are obtained and used under conditions that preclude their use to meet current living costs will not be counted as income. Under this regulation, loans that are available to meet current living expenses are considered countable income. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, because of an adverse court decision in the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mangrum  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Griepentrog  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bowen,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 702 F. Supp. 813 (D. Nev. 1988), the Department of Health and Human Services issued Information Memorandum FSA&hyph;IM&hyph;89&hyph;1, dated January 3, 1989. The Information Memorandum permits States the option to disregard bona fide loans as income and resources. Between January and June 1989, 45 States implemented the option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

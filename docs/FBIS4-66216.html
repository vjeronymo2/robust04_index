			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Special Correspondent: "New Ideas About </F> Educational System Reform -- Investigation and Research Report  on the Socialist Market Economy and Educational System Reform"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] For the past nearly half a  year, the State Education Commission's National Education  Development Research Center has conducted a special study in  conjunction with the education sector in more than 20 provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions, and with central  government ministries and commissions, holding various kinds of  workshops with them. It has reached a consensus with leaders in  units in charge of education and with economic and scientific  and technical units, experts, and people doing actual work about  major problems in correlating the socialist market economy with  reform of the educational system.  <H5>  Change From the Old to the New System: Development Faces </H5> Conspicuous Problems    The development and reform of education faces numerous new  problems in the current process of changing from the old to the  new system. Some of these problems are still very prominent.  They are manifested in the following three regards:    1. The priority development of education has not truly been  accorded a strategic position. The emphasis on inputs of  material resources and the slighting of the development of  manpower resources that has long existed in China's economic  construction has still not been fundamentally reversed. Some  comrades in charge regard development of the economy as a  mandatory task, but development of education as an optional  task. In the process of accelerating economic construction, a  mistaken idea has developed that "the economy must be improved  rapidly but education need not be looked after," and that  "education must yield to the economy." In the zeal to get on  with economic projects, build office buildings, auditoriums,  guest houses, and hostels, and put up development zones,  investment in education is slighted, or money for education is  even diverted to other purposes, and a serious situation exists  everywhere of teachers not receiving the wages they should  receive.    2. Reform of China's present educational system still lags  behind the need for economic system reform. On the one hand,  schools still do not have the mechanisms they should have to  operate as they see fit, to develop themselves, and to restrain  themselves. On the other hand, government functions have not  been genuinely transformed. No effective macroeconomic control  system has begun to be built; new troubles and problems have  risen in education; and overall direction, regulation, and  control are not vigorous. The subject matter, the precepts, and  the teaching methods used in education in China today do not  meet needs for building socialism and developing a socialist  market economy; the number, the make-up and caliber, and the  standards set for human talent being trained do not satisfy  requirements for development of the economy and the society; and  overall returns from education and returns from the operation of  schools are not high.    3. Getting money for education has become harder. The  problem  of a lack of continuity and an outflow of personnel from the  teaching corps is serious. Fiscal outlays for education have  long languished around a low 12 percent. The inauguration of  some measures of a political nature in recent years has actually  put a damper on the raising of funds for education through many  channels. Not only does the level of investment in education not  meet the ever increasing need for education in the development  of a market economy and society, but it can hardly satisfy basic  needs for development of existing educational endeavors. During  1992, public expenditures for middle school and primary school  education in more than half of the country's provinces showed  negative growth. Only 8.4 percent of the experimental equipment  needed in primary schools was made available, and in five  provinces and cities, it was less than 1 percent. Nationwide 15  million square meters of middle and primary schools are in  dangerous buildings, and in some provinces and autonomous  regions, the percentage of dangerous middle and primary school  buildings has taken varying degrees of upturn. Because of the  increase in the population base figure, during the final 7 years  of the twentieth century, the number of pupils in middle and  primary schools will increase by 34 million. Unless effective  measures were taken, the goal of 9 years of compulsory education  nationwide will be difficult to attain. Money for institutions  of higher education is extremely scarce. For quite a few  schools, after deducting for price rises, the actual amount of  money for school operation has decreased year after year. The  problem of the overly low salaries of professors has remained  unsolved for a long time. In 1992, several hundred thousand  middle and primary school teachers nationwide left the teaching  profession, most of them first-rate teachers having advanced  degrees. A survey of 95 institutions of higher education showed  the loss of 27 percent of young teachers between 1981 and 1989.  In addition to those who went abroad, 48 percent went into high  salary corporations and firms.    [passage omitted]</p>

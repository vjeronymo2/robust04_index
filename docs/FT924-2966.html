			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Renewed hope for coal pushes fears offshore: Neil Buckley outlines the perils of reversing the 'dash for gas' GAS-FIRED power stations have been widely blamed for the possible demise of a large part of the UK coal industry. Now the government is being warned that any attempt to reverse the 'dash for gas' could inflict serious damage on a mainstay of the UK economy - the offshore oil and gas industry. The economics of five significant North Sea gas developments depend largely on contracts with gas-fired stations. Gas supplies from three more fields have been bought by British Gas to meet higher demand caused by the 'dash for gas'. Oil industry experts warn that, if any of these projects ceases or is damaged, producers may take future investment elsewhere. Modern combined-cycle gas turbine stations are efficient and emit only half the carbon dioxide of coal-fired plant, less than a quarter of the nitrogen oxides and virtually no sulphur dioxide. They are cheap and quick to build - which is why they were so attractive to regional electricity companies in England and Wales seeking to diversify their sources of power after the electricity industry was privatised in 1990. The power industry's enthusiasm for gas coincided with the emergence of independent gas marketers competing with the privatised British Gas. Criticism of the combined-cycle stations has centred on three allegations. The first is that gas-fired power costs more than coal-fired, though this is likely to be blunted by today's report from Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, that gas supply contracts are not uneconomic. Most comparisons suggest that gas-fired power, including capital costs, is more expensive than existing coal-fired plant. But gas-fired power is generally less expensive when the costs of fitting desulphurisation equipment to coal-fired plants are taken into account. Such measures would be unavoidable to meet European Community emissions standards if coal maintained its share of generation. There are two categories of combined-cycle station. Five of the 16 stations given the green light will have to be economic to survive. They are owned by the big two generators and will sell their electricity into the 'pool', the competitive section of the market. 'If we have got it wrong it will be PowerGen and our shareholders who take the hit,' PowerGen said. 'But we are pretty confident we have got it right.' The other 11 gas-fired plants are independent projects that have signed long-term contracts with regional electricity companies involving an agreed price. If that is higher than the pool price, the companies are allowed to pass on the cost to their customers, although Prof Littlechild has said he may review this. Suspicion centres on later projects that signed contracts after gas prices began rising because of heavy demand - especially four receiving gas under the costlier of British Gas's two price schedules. A second criticism is that the new plants will lead to much over-capacity. To avoid over-capacity, some plants will have to be retired - but this was envisaged at the time of privatisation. The government's white paper estimated that 13,000MW of new capacity would be required by the year 2000 to replace ageing plants - 70 per cent are more than 15 years old. The total capacity of likely gas-fired projects is only 10,000MW, with a further 4,000MW awaiting government consents that may not be granted - while the Sizewell B nuclear station will provide 1,200MW from 1994. Finally, critics say UK gas reserves are smaller than claimed, and prices could rise. Estimates from British Gas and other sources say there are only 21 years of proven, probable and possible reserves at the higher levels of demand caused by the rise in gas-fired generation. But experience in the North Sea and elsewhere shows such estimates are constantly increasing. Even if the criticisms are true, the government has four options: To try to stop the combined-cycle stations. Oil companies and independent consultants warn that this could jeopardise Pounds 6bn of investment in the North Sea along with investor confidence and thousands of jobs. Allow the stations to go ahead. Without compensatory action 31 pits would close, as originally envisaged. Allow the stations to go ahead, but limit their market. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, has suggested that the stations should be forced to sell their electricity only into the non-franchise market that supplies large customers and in which British Coal cannot compete. That would leave more room for coal in the franchise market that supplies households and smaller businesses. British Coal could increase sales to the generators by up to 20m tonnes a year. Customers of regional companies would bear the additional costs. The problem is that many combined-cycle stations are being built specifically to serve the franchise market on long-term contracts, and secured financing only on that basis. One project involves 23 banks. The legal difficulties of re-writing the contracts would be immense - one gas marketer described the idea as 'crazy'. Subsidise coal to enable it to compete with gas. That would hit some of the gas-fired stations, with some of the knock-on effects detailed above. Many gas and coal experts say the government should look not at gas plants, but at the heavily subsidised nuclear industry, especially ageing Magnox reactors. They are also urging the government to keep closed pits under care and maintenance, so they can be reopened. Combined-cycle stations could yet provide a new lease of life for British coal - they can burn a variety of fuels, including gas made from coal. Coal gasification technology may not be economic now, but could be within a decade. 'The choice for the government,' said one gas consultant, 'is do we accept that we are here now, and we have to go on from here, causing the least possible damage to the energy market as a whole, or do we try to turn back the clock and make an even bigger mess than we already have?'

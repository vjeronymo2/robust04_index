			<p>BFN     [Text] Political parties have already made preliminary  remarks on the UN secretary general's report. DISI [Democratic  Rally] Chairman Ioannis Matsis said the report ascertains for  the first time that there is no political will for a solution to  the Cyprus issue based on the procedures that have been followed  for a number of years. He said: The Turkish Cypriot side is  blamed for the failure of all talks on Cyprus. Turkey is blamed  indirectly.    Referring to the alternative proposals, Matsis said that  based on the ascertainment that the Turkish side has no  political will, only two of the proposals are significant: The  adoption of measures by the Security Council for the other side  and the radical revision of the approach for a Cyprus solution.  He added that President Glavkos Kliridhis' proper policy led to  the revelation of the Turkish intransigence and to the  attribution of responsibility.</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Credit card bills blunder ANYONE with a National Westminster Bank Worldwide Fund for Nature Visa affinity credit card should handle their statements from the start of the year with extreme caution - and they would do well to check the figures carefully. NatWest admitted last week that thousands of these cardholders had been overcharged because their payments had been sent to other people's accounts by mistake. The funds were misdirected for the first payment period after the 15,000 WWF accounts were converted into ordinary Visa accounts - in the period January 1-26 this year. The bank had identified the error by the end of the month and changed its systems so payments after that time were correctly credited. But it chose only to make reimbursements to customers who contacted it to complain that their payments were not shown - which it said amounted to 'a significant number' of complaints. A senior manager in its credit card services unit decided that it was not necessary to contact anybody else who was affected, although it would have been possible to identify these cardholders. Only a few days ago, when a customer complained to a more senior bank official, did NatWest decide to contact every customer with a WWF account and adjust their statements. The bank says it has now brought in a team to identify all those cardholders who may have been affected and to arrange reimbursements and some possible additional compensation. They can all expect to receive letters of apology in the next few days. Any WWF customers who made payments which were not credited to their accounts will see that money restored and will have the additional interest charges made against them removed. The bank said it was also considering offering some extra reward. Any other Visa customers with statements showing payments from others misdirected to their accounts will see the money removed, but will not be expected to pay the additional interest they owe. NatWest has apologised for the errors and said that no customers would be left out of pocket as a result of the mistake. The bank has launched an internal inquiry to see whether disciplinary action is called for, and to prevent such incidents happening again. NatWest said the error occurred after it decided to withdraw the WWF affinity card in late December last year. A 'human error' when converting them into ordinary Visa accounts meant that some went to other people's accounts with the same identification numbers. However, the issue demonstrates how important it is for all bank customers to check their statements meticulously. Only last August, NatWest decided to write to 1m credit card holders after discovering statement errors following a change in computer software. The Consumers' Association said last week that the incident was just the latest instance of the lack of adequate checking carried out by banks on their customers' transactions. A survey it carried out last year showed that one in seven current account holders with UK banks had found inaccuracies in their statements.</p>

This is truly a breakthrough development in Marxist economics.  What new situations has the "Decision on Matters Relating to  the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure,"  which was adopted on this basis by the newly held Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, provided us and what  breakthroughs and advances has the Decision made? We asked Liu  Guoguang, an noted economist who participated in the drafting of  the Decision to talk about his views on the question.    He said: The Decision is the concrete, programmatic, and  systematic embodiment of the goal of market economy set by the  14th CPC National Congress. This basic framework or general  plan, which the Decision sketched, is in itself a breakthrough  and progress.    The basic framework or general plan has rich contents, of  which some are innovative advances. Let us just cite the major  ones. They are as follows:  <H3>  Establishing a Modern Enterprise System and Genuinely  Energizing the Main Subjects of the Market </H3>   Reform of large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises has  always been the focus of economic structural reform.  Enterprises are the main subject of the market, and large and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises are the lead of the main  subjects. If state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, it  will be difficult to stimulate the market as a whole.    Reviewing past events, Liu Guoguang said: In the past few  decades we have introduced various reforms for enterprises, such  as delegating power to enterprises, changing from profit  delivery to tax payment, and practicing a contract system.  Overall, state-owned enterprises have become more energetic  than in the initial stage of reform. Nevertheless, the previous  reforms have not touched the enterprise system under the planned  economic structure. Thus, the problems, such as that no  distinction was made between the functions of the government and  those of the enterprises, property rights were confused, and  everybody ate from the same big pot, have not yet been genuinely  resolved. Moreover, the burdens shouldered by enterprises are  very heavy and they could not free themselves from running  society. Therefore, compared with nonstate-owned enterprises,  most state-owned enterprises apparently lack vitality.  According to reports from departments concerned, one-third of  large and medium- sized state-owned enterprises incurred losses  in operation overtly, another one-third of the enterprises  suffered losses in operation covertly, and only the remaining  one-third of enterprises were money-making. This shows that  two-thirds of state-owned enterprises had problems with  efficiency. Moreover, among enterprises operating with  relatively good efficiency, there were problems, such as that  the running ox was whipped, cries of help came from all corners  of the country, and expenses were wantonly apportioned for them.  As a result, enterprises were exhausted due to heavy burdens.    All indications show that to effectively raise economic  efficiency and invigorate large and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises, we must switch enterprise reform from the policy  readjustment with delegation of power and concession in revenue  by the central authorities as the main content to the  establishment of an enterprise system with the harmonious  relations of property rights as the main content and proceed to  seek a way of institutionalizing the integration of state-owned  enterprises and the market economy. Through years of  explorations, a consensus of understanding has been reached,  that is, establishing a modern enterprise system. This is the  direction of China's reform of large and medium-sized  enterprises. Liu Guoguang maintained: Through the reform we  must be clear about the relations of property rights. To put it  another way, the ownership of enterprises' state-owned assets  goes to the state and the enterprise has all the property  rights, which is formed by the investment made the investors  including the state, as a legal person and becomes an entity of  legal person which has civil rights and interests and assumes  civil responsibility. On this basis enterprises operate  according to law, pay taxes in accordance with state  regulations, organize production in line with the laws governing  the market, assume full responsibility for profit and loss, and  develop in line with the principle of selecting the superior and  eliminating the inferior. This will help fully separate the  functions of the government and those of the enterprises and  help enterprises really become dynamic economic entities able to  operate independently, be accountable for themselves, and  improve and develop themselves. The formulation of this reform  proposition is a very important breakthrough.    The problems with enterprises are very complicated.  Enterprise reform, in which any single move taken may affect the  situation as a whole, should be carried out in a coordinated  way. Illustrating with examples, Liu Guoguang said: It is  impossible to solve such problems as redundant enterprise  personnel, the burden of enterprises running society, and  enterprises' past debts by making a single reform. To solve  them, supporting reforms in other fields of endeavor are needed.  This will help create conditions for the reform of establishing  a modern enterprise system. He said: The Decision has taken  these factor into account. This shows that in the coming  reform, we must be determined to solve enterprises' outstanding  past and present problems and effectively create conditions to  operate state-owned enterprises as companies. However, to  operate them as companies, we must establish a standard company  system and a standard modern enterprise system rather than just  put up a new nameplate. We must push enterprise reform to this  new height.  <H3>  In Fostering a Market System, Placing Stress on Developing  the Production Elements Market </H3>   The prices of most commodities in China have now been  liberalized and great advances have been made in the market  system. Nevertheless, the Chinese market has been primarily a  market for articles of daily use up to date. Most means of  productions also have now become commodities, but the dual-track  system remains operative in the prices of production means.  Particularly, the market for such means of production as funds,  capital, labor power, real estate, technology, and information  is still in the embryonic stage. The current central decision  suggested creating an environment of competition on an equal  footing and forming a unified, open, competitive, and orderly  big market and placed particular stress on developing the  production elements market.    Liu Guoguang pointed out: In the days to come, the commodity  circulation system calls for further reform. The commodity  market should be further developed and improved. This is not a  problem. However, what is important is to fully subject  production elements to the regulation and disposition by the  market laws and put stress on developing the production elements  market. The specific development plan has yet to be studied.  However, we must notice that there have been important  breakthroughs in this regard. For example, the labor market is  an important factor of the production elements market. In the  past we called it the labor service market or the labor  employment market. This is a breakthrough in theory as compared  with our understanding of the issue before reform was  introduced. However, the terms were not as accurate and  scientific as the labor market. Perhaps people may ask: Since  laborers are masters of the country, why have they become  commodities? As I see it, laborers and labor should be  separated. As citizens, laborers are masters of the country,  while labor can be fully traded in the market as a means of  production.    China's labor market is quite underdeveloped. In state-owned  enterprises, personnel still cannot move fairly freely and a  two-way choice mechanism has not taken shape. Enterprises are  supporting large numbers of redundant personnel. Therefore,  apparently it does not work to throw them to society lock,  stock, and barrel. Generally speaking, it is still very  difficult for an employee to seek another employment avenue or a  new occupation for further development even if he wishes to. In  the vast rural areas, labor mobility has long been developing.  It is said that 50 million people have left their native  villages and settled down in cities and towns. How should we  manage this portion of people? How should we establish a market  mechanism based on state centralized distribution, under which  labor can move between urban and rural areas in an organized and  secured way, so that workers and employing units can choose each  other? These remain problems.    Liu Guoguang held: Although rural labor is now moving, it is  moving blindly. Many problems have not yet been solved  satisfactorily, such as that employment is not secured and there  is political inequality between the employer and the employed.  They must be solved gradually. The Decision set the  development, utilization, and rational disposition of labor  resources as the starting point of the development of the labor  market. It urged the creation of new employment opportunities,  providing more jobs to workers in cities and towns, and  encouraging and guiding superfluous rural labor to move in an  orderly way. This is a new line of thinking effective in  solving problems.  <H3>  The Decision Has a New Exposition on Macroregulation and  Control and Offers Concrete Propositions to the Various Aspects  of Macroregulation and Control </H3>   The establishment of the socialist market economic structure  is inseparable from a sound macroregulation and control system.  It is necessary to change the functions of the government under  the planned economy. In the market economy, the government  manages the economy mainly with economic and legal means and  necessary administrative fiats and no longer directly interferes  in enterprises' production and operations. While clearly  defining these contents, the Decision has offered relatively  concrete propositions to the varies aspects of macroregulation  and control. This is another important advance .    For example, in banking reform the Decision clearly defined  that the People's Bank of China should be run as a genuine  central bank, whose function is to issue currency, and "take it  as the prime goal to stabilize currency, regulate total money  supply, and achieve a balance between revenue and expenditure in  terms of total quantity." Moreover, it urged to set up  policy-oriented banks and turn specialized banks into commercial  ones. All these are very important improvements. In the past,  these matters were discussed in the theoretical circles but they  have now been included in the proposal. Moreover, interest and  exchange rates should gradually become market-oriented. It is  very important to abolish state prices for exchange rates and  let exchange rates float under control.    Again for example, in financial and taxation structural  reform, the Decision clearly defined that the all-round  financial contract system should be replaced by a tax sharing  system. This is also an important advance and change. Turning  the current local financial contract system into a tax sharing  system based on a rational division of administrative power  between central and local authorities will help readjust not  only the relationship between central and local authorities, but  also that between the state and enterprises. The all-round  financial contract system has played a positive role in the  past. However, as it developed it revealed its limitations.  The main manifestation was that there was flexibility on the  part of local authorities and enterprises while there was  rigidity on the part of the state and central authorities. As a  result, the central financial authorities were riddled with  difficulties. Under these circumstances, the state was unable  to make readjustments in important industries and regulate the  gap between different regions. Now the Decision categorized the  items of taxation necessary for safeguarding the state's rights  and interests and practicing macroregulation and control as  central taxes and the items of taxation which have a direct  bearing on economic development as taxes shared by central and  local authorities while suggesting substantiating local items of  taxation so as to increase local tax revenues. This has helped  rationally harmonize the relations between central and local  authorities. Moreover, unification of tax laws and fairness in  tax burdens are all important improvements. As far as the modes  of distribution of after-tax profits between the state and the  enterprise are concerned, there can be distribution of dividends  according to the number of shares held, retention of profits  according to the quantity of capital contributed, or occasional  retention by enterprises of the profits to be handed over to the  state for continued development. This way of doing things has  thus more rationally harmonized the relations of interest  between enterprises and the state.    Moreover, in investment system reform, the Decision urged to  gradually establish risk liabilities for corporate investment  and bank credits. Different projects may adopt different modes  of investment. This is a reform proposition formed on the basis  of the ideas which have been deliberated for many years.    Liu Guoguang said: The question of the relationship between  planning, finance, and banking has in fact not been clearly  stated in the past. The current central decision has defined  the question. Under the traditional structure, planning has  always been primary. There was a figurative formulation on the  relationship of the three, stating: Planning orders dishes,  finance foots the bill, and banking works out accounts. As  structural reform progresses, the relationship has to change.  To establish the socialist market economic structure, it is  even more necessary to harmonize the relationship of the three  in accordance with the laws governing the market economy. With  an observation of the market economic developments of various  countries, we can be clear that in the macroregulation and  control of the market economy, there are two relatively  important elements: Financial policy and banking policy.  Although some countries also have long-term planning, it does  not occupy an important position. From the formulation of the  relationship between planning and finance as set by the  Decision, we can see that although planning takes total supply  and demand into consideration, it gives greater consideration to  total supply and stresses making long-term structural  readjustments. Although finance and banking also take total  supply into consideration, they start mainly with the management  of total demand and stress regulating and controlling short-term  balances in terms of total quantity. There is a division of  labor between financial authorities and banks. Financial  authorities are generally in charge of the redistribution of  national income, which is done without compensation. Repayments  of capital with interest should be made for the use of credits.  In the past, when financial authorities incurred deficits, they  would make overdrafts from banks, turning financial deficits  into credit deficits. In the market economy, this practice does  not work any longer. Financial authorities and banks should be  clearly separated. The former can borrow money from the latter  but should not make overdrafts without compensation. In short,  the Decision has a clear formulation of the relationship between  planning, finance, and banking, which is a great step forward  from the previous practice.    When asked about his views on this year's reform situation  at the conclusion of the interview, with full confidence Liu  Guoguang said: The year 1994 will see the greatest number of  reforms introduced and the biggest reform action taken. The  Decision has provided a grand blueprint for reforms in the next  step in the new year. As I see it, through the hard work of the  entire party and the people throughout the country, this grand  goal can be completely attained.</p>

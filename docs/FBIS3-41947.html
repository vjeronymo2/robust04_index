The only thing Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine can do is  to confirm unambiguously to Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton his  republic's international commitments on nuclear disarmament and  promise to submit again the START-I treaty for ratification by  the new parliament.    This statement was made to INTERFAX Wednesday by a senior  Russian diplomat responsible for Russian-Ukrainian relations.    He believes that the likely three-sided summit may present a  good opportunity for Kravchuk to distance himself in public from  the partial ratification of the treaty.    The diplomat has said the United States promised to Ukraine  financial aid worth $170 Mn as soon as the disarmament process  begins.    The Americans are practically-minded people. They will not  give money to Ukraine for mere promises, he said.</p>

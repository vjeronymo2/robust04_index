The PDS has  convened jurists and magistrates precisely on the day when the  issue of "opportune justice" is disrupting the electoral  campaign. Last Saturday [12 February] [League Secretary] Bossi  stated very clearly that "it looks as if the magistrature is  following politics like a shadow. Action is immediately  followed by reaction." For his part [Center Union leader]  Alfredo Biondi said: "This is clockwork justice: As soon as  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio [Berlusconi] stands as a candidate,  Paolo [Berlusconi] is arrested." [Italian Socialist Party, PSI,  rebel member] Ugo Intini's remark: "This will be the first  election to be decided by handcuffs," while on a Fininvest TV  program, Enrico Mentana said: "The judges should keep silent  during the 15 days leading to the elections."    Berlusconi's arrest, the attack on D'Alema -- is there  really  someone issuing notices and warrants of arrest with stopwatch  precision? Milan chief public prosecutor Borrelli denies this  categorically: "We are only responding to events, we cannot  change our pace at will."    Justice Minister Giovanni Conso, however, putting in an  appearance at the PDS convention, uttered carefully worded  sentences, thus giving rise to doubt: "We must assume, unless  otherwise demonstrated, that the timing depends on the  development of the investigations." Unless otherwise  demonstrated? Why, is Conso in any doubt? No, he said he was  in no doubt, but he emphasized that it would make no sense for  the magistrature to keep quiet for a few days, "it would be a  serious mistake to regard the electoral campaign as a time when  the state's fundamental activities are interrupted."  Nevertheless, the minister added, "at sensitive moments the  risk of interference between political and judicial activities  increases, and we must therefore appeal for compliance with the  rules, and appeal to the honesty of the people."

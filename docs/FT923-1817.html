			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexican and Hungarian issues break new ground MEXICO and Hungary broke new ground in the US bond market last week, launching the first Yankee bond issues by sub-investment grade sovereign borrowers. Mexico brought a Dollars 250m offering of 10-year bonds priced to yield 215 basis points above the 10-year treasury yield. Goldman Sachs, which arranged the transaction, said the deal was being placed with mainstream Yankee bond investors. Meanwhile, Hungary became the first eastern European country to raise funds in the US bond market, with a Dollars 200m 10-year deal via Salomon Brothers priced to yield 275 basis points over the 10-year treasury yield - wider than the original indication of 250 basis points. Hungary has now completed around Dollars 900m of its Dollars 1bn funding programme for this year, and expects to raise the same amount in the capital markets next year. Mexico is rated BB-plus by S&amp;P and Ba2 by Moody's while Hungary has BB-plus from S&amp;P and Ba1 from Moody's.</p>

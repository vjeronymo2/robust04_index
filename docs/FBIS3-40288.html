			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andras Agoston, chairman of the Democratic </F> Union of Vojvodina Hungarians, by Ferenc Kepecs in Budapest on  29 January: "The Dialogue Has Become Public"]    [Text] [Kepecs] How do you evaluate Foreign Minister Geza  Jeszenszky's recent visit in Belgrade?    [Agoston] This visit took place at a time when we succeeded  in taking a big step forward in starting a dialogue between the  Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the Serbian  Government. This visit confirmed the achievement and made it  public in an interstate sense as well. This visit is also  important because it is becoming increasingly clear that the  international community is actually helpless regarding the  Yugoslav crisis. Under these circumstances, we must create the  conditions for Hungary to have advantageous contacts with Serbia  after the lifting of the embargo, particularly in the economic  sphere. After all, we are talking about neighboring countries  and the relations between neighbors are sensitive irrespective  of the international situation.    [Kepecs] Has this visit made the Serb policy legitimate, a  policy condemned by the entire world?    [Agoston] Under circumstances when the international  community is completely helpless, the visit of the foreign  minister of a neighboring country, a visit dealing mainly with  practical issues, does not affect the legitimacy issue. Only  the international community can efficiently declare everything  that happened in the past years as legitimate or illegitimate.    [Kepecs] But there are also Hungarian grievances involved  here! At the talks, Milosevic said that his government would  not tolerate a situation in which anyone has to leave his  birthplace. In the meantime, many Hungarians in Croatia who were  driven out by Serbs are still not able to return to their homes!    [Agoston] All I can say to this is that this issue must be  solved at interstate talks. We accept the fact that the  Democratic Union of Croatian Hungarians is the authority to  decide on this matter. As far as I know, they work efficiently  on making it possible for the refugees to return to their homes.    [Kepecs] Has Jeszenszky's visit changed anything on the  situation of Hungarians who fled to Hungary from military  conscription, people who still should not return home?    [Agoston] According to the VMDK, no one should be put into a  disadvantageous position or on trial for refusing to participate  in the civil war as a citizen of small Yugoslavia. If the  recent domestic policy changes continue, changes that are  positive for us, we can hope that it will be declared in the  form of a state act that everyone can return without fear of  reprisals.    [Kepecs] Mr. Agoston! Do you agree with the opinion  according to which Serbia has come out as a victor in this civil  war?    [Agoston] From the very beginning, we have been saying that  we do not want to interfere in the historic debate of these  people. This is only natural in our situation and the events  proved that our position was correct. Of course, we can have  individual opinions but, as the chairman of the VMDK, I would  not like to speak about this.</p>

Korean  authorities" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon)  recently published a "Detailed Report on the War Crisis on the  Korean Peninsula" concerning the ever more open war provocation  moves of the U.S. imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam group  against the North, according to the Seoul-based Radio Voice of  National Salvation.    Recalling that the U.S. imperialists have already worked out  a war scenario to cope with a "case of emergency" on the Korean  peninsula under the pretext of the fictitious "nuclear issue"  and abruptly turned toward the provocation of an adventurous war  against the North, the detailed report says:    WASHINGTON POST December 2, 1993 reported that in case a  military conflict broke out on the Korean peninsula, the U.S.  Forces would dispatch 500,000-strong reinforcements including  six aircraft carriers, eleven army brigades equipped with heavy  arms, thirty-four combat flying corps and four flying corps of  bombers, which are nearly equivalent to a half of the U.S.  combat units. This is the kernel of the war scenario written by  the U.S. Defence Department to cope with a "case of emergency".  The U.S. imperialists have designed even a U.S.-South  Korea-Japan military command system, not to speak of a  U.S.-South Korea operational command system to perform the above  war scenario.    On September 27, 1993, former U.S. Defence Secretary Aspin,  at his talks with the director-general of the Japan Defence  Agency, decided on the involvement of the Japanese "Self-Defense  Forces" in a war against the north of Korea and its share in it.  On the basis of the "new military strategy", the United States  is reorganising and reinforcing its huge aggression forces in  and around the Korean peninsula.    The 95,000-strong U.S. Army, Naval fleets and Marine Corps  stationed in South Korea and Japan are waiting for an order of  action, while twelve of the thirteen U.S. aircraft carriers in  the pacific are alerted as an "emergency relief force". The  bellicose Kim Yong-sam group has completed the wartime system,  while brutally cracking down on the struggle of the people for  independence and democracy, peace and reunification with  "civilian" fascist tyrany.    It formed a mobile army corps of the "ROK Army" allegedly  for  a "case of emergency" and revised the "system of examination for  conscription" so it could draft any civilian into the army any  time. And it has supplied to 3,800 officers of the "reserve  forces" the same combat uniforms as those for the officers in  active service, doubled the combat police force and modernised  the combat equipment to be hurled into a war any time.    The U.S. imperialists plan of war against the North is near  the danger line for going over to a real war.    If the reckless war provocation moves of the U.S.  imperialists and the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique against the  North are not frustrated quickly, our fellow countrymen will  suffer a disaster, the detailed report says, and stresses:    Anyone who opposes war and wishes to live in peace must rise  up to shatter the war provocation moves against the North and  expel the U.S. imperialist aggressors and overthrow the  traitorous Kim Yong-sam group.</p>

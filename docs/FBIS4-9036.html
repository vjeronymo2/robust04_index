			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 19/4/1994 -- A government  delegation from the Netherlands headed by Prime Minister Ruud  Lubbers arrived in Bucharest on Tuesday, April 19, for a two-day  official visit. The Dutch guests were greeted at the Otopeni  Airport by Romanian Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, Foreign  Minister Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu,  the Dutch ambassador in Bucharest, Monique Frank, and other  officials.    Shortly after his arrival, Premier Ruud Lubbers said that  his  visit in Romania would further substantiate the cooperation  between the two countries. The Netherlands is located on the  other side of Europe and considers that transports and trade are  especially important, said the Dutch prime minister and added  that the Rhine- Main-Danube watercourse would ease the bilateral  ties, as Romania is located on the other end of the road and  therefore the bilateral cooperation was extremely necessary, not  only in the economic field but also in the political one and  perhaps also in tourism. The Dutch premier mentioned the  Latin-rooted language spoken by Romanians as a very special  trait of Romania in central Europe.    On Wednesday [20 April], Premier Ruud Lubbers is scheduled  to  meet Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Chamber of  Deputies' Speaker Adrian Nastase, the presidential adviser Misu  Negritoiu, and the governor of the National Bank of Romania,  Mugur Isarescu.    Today Ruud Lubbers was received by Romanian President Ion  Iliescu, at Cotroceni Palace. The Dutch guest was accompanied  by Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Kooijmans. The visit of  the high Dutch officials is the first of its kind since  Romania's December 1989 revolution.    The interview was attended by Romanian Minister of Foreign  Affairs Teodor Melescanu, Minister of State Dan Mircea Popescu,  presidential advisers Misu Negritoiu and Traian Chebeleu, the  Romanian ambassador to the Netherlands, Marin Buhoara.    After the official talks, the Romanian president gave his  guests lunch.</p>

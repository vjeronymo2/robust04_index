			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LUCAS HELPS RUN CORONA DEL MAR OFFENSE OUT OF ITS SLUMP  </P> <P> Boosted by a record-setting performance by running back Brian Lucas, Corona del  Mar High School pulled itself out of its mini-slump and back into position for  a Southern Section playoff berth Thursday night with a 25-8 Sea View League  victory over University at Newport Harbor High School.  </P> <P> Lucas rushed for 234 yards in 26 carries to surpass the school record of 227  set in 1966 by Tom Westgate against Costa Mesa.  </P> <P> "The linemen blocked real well; I'll be taking them all to breakfast Saturday  morning," said Lucas, who also scored two touchdowns.  </P> <P> The victory gave two-time defending league champion Corona del Mar (6-3  overall, 2-2 in league play) renewed hope. Especially after last week's 24-7  loss to Tustin.  </P> <P> Although Lucas gained 96 yards in the first half, his most dazzling runs came  in the second half.  </P> <P> On Corona del Mar's first possession of the third quarter, Lucas had  consecutive gains of 17 and 34 yards, then scored on a 16-yard sweep, giving  the Sea Kings a 18-8 lead. Corona del Mar extended that lead late in the fourth  quarter as sophomore quarterback Todd Kehrli hit Weston Johnson with a 16-yard  scoring pass.  </P> <P> Until that play, though, Corona del Mar's passing offense was barely  noticeable. Kehrli completed four of 12 passes for 55 yards with a touchdown  and an interception.  </P> <P> "We didn't play good last week. We weren't as intense as we should have been,"  Corona del Mar Coach Dave Holland said. "We got to beat (Newport) Harbor to get  to the playoffs. We got to win next week to make sure we get in."  </P> <P> Although University (2-7, 0-4) already had been eliminated from playoff  contention last week, the Trojans didn't give Corona del Mar much slack. That  was especially evident in the first half.  </P> <P> On Corona del Mar's first possession, Lucas set up his team's first touchdown  with a 27-yard run, before scoring on a one-yard dive. Weston Johnson faked a  punt snap and ran in for the two-point conversion, giving Corona del Mar a 8-0  lead.  </P> <P> But University (2-7, 0-4) matched that performance in the second quarter as  Jerry Apana, who led the running game with 89 yards in 16 carries, dove in for  a three-yard scoring run, and Victor Davis ran in for the conversion, tying the  score, 8-8.  </P> <P> Although Corona del Mar drove as far as the University four-yard line in the  closing seconds of the first half, penalties and a sack forced the Sea Kings to  the 29. With time running out, Jerrott Willard kicked a 45-yard field goal to  give Corona del Mar a 11-8 lead going into halftime.  </P></p>

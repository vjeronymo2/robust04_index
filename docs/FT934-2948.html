			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Survey of World Commercial Vehicles (6): Winter is not yet over - The Japanese Market The past few years have been a long winter for Japan's commercial vehicle industry. The country's truck and bus makers have been forced to take unprecedented measures to survive the business downturn. Nissan Diesel, the maker of heavy duty trucks and buses, last month agreed with its labour union to cut back its winter bonus payment by an average 7.2 per cent. It is the first time the company has had to renegotiate the bonus payment after agreeing the level in the spring. Meanwhile, Hino Motors, Japan's largest maker of medium and heavy duty trucks, has embarked on an unusual diversification path which it hopes will enable it to derive about 10 per cent of its sales from new businesses by 2001. Hino has set up three separate companies to sell vertical parking lots and to provide consulting services in such areas as distribution and corporate identity. The moves reflect the severity of the decline in demand facing Japanese commercial truck and bus manufacturers. Last year, sales of trucks in Japan fell for the fourth consecutive year, while those of buses declined for the second year in succession. As the economic slowdown continued unabated, new registrations of trucks were down 10 per cent while those of buses declined by nearly 6 per cent. What is more, the expected recovery in business investment and consumer demand has not materialised in 1993, leading the country's large commercial vehicle makers to brace themselves for another year of disappointing results. Strong demand for trucks that was expected from public works projects under the government's economic stimulus programme has failed to emerge so far, in the face of a series of bribery scandals that has rocked the construction industry and its local government customers. Furthermore, Japan's economic recovery, when it comes, 'will be an exceedingly gentle one,' notes Hino Motors. As a result, commercial vehicle makers will have to wait some time before demand picks up, the company says. As they face up to the undeniable changes in their business environment, commercial vehicle makers have adopted a number of emergency measures aimed at containing the damage. To begin with, companies have been slashing costs across the board by hiring fewer seasonal workers, reducing overtime work and reining in general expenses. The large truck makers are aiming for double-digit reductions in their seasonal workforce over the next few years not only to reduce their costs but also to increase efficiency at facilities which have been running at below capacity. The cost-cutting exercise has extended to capital investment, which is being focused on a more narrow range of products. For example, Hino Motors cut capital expenditure by 19 per cent last year. In common with Japan's car makers, commercial vehicle makers are also attempting to reduce the number of models they offer and to standardise parts. The move is a reaction to the years of expansion in the late 1980s when many Japanese manufacturers increased their product range and line-up of options with little regard to cost efficiency. But with the contraction of the Japanese market and rapid appreciation of the yen, which has made commercial vehicles less competitive abroad, manufacturers have been forced to concentrate their energies on fewer models and trim product options to cut costs. Going a step further, some automobile makers have taken the plunge in tying up with rival companies to provide each other with product and thereby curb development and production costs. Nissan, Mazda and Fuji Heavy, for example, agreed earlier this year to supply each other with commercial vehicles on an original equipment manufacture basis. Nissan will thus sell Mazda trucks under its own badge and vice versa. The arrangement allows the companies to cut development and production costs on models which are not profitable enough to justify the expensive investments required but which are needed to complement their product range. Meanwhile, Isuzu has pulled out of passenger car manufacture altogether. Instead of splitting its energies between commercial and passenger vehicle production, Isuzu will concentrate on the commercial side where it has proven strength. To continue providing its customers with its range of cars, Isuzu is buying them from Honda and supplying its partner in turn with recreational vehicles  -the Jeep-like cars that are closer to trucks in construction. Another trend in the recessionary trading en- vironment is the growing interest in Asian markets, particularly China. While Japan's domestic market remains in the doldrums and markets in the west remain under pressure, buoyant dem- and from Asian countries has given firm support to the oper- ations of Japanese commer- cial vehicle makers, although earnings from these markets have also been adversely affected by the high yen. Expectations of a slow Japanese market and growing demand in Asia have led many Japanese automobile makers to place their hopes on plans for the regional market. Hino Motors, for example, has set up a joint venture company with one of China's big five bus makers to manufacture and market buses. Nissan is also setting up a joint venture in China to produce pick-up trucks. While the cautious moves into China by Japanese vehicle makers are modest steps, compared with their investments in the US or Europe, they reflect the growing need of Japanese companies to develop new markets overseas and reduce their dependence on the home market. In the short term, as the companies themselves would be the first to concede, Japan's market is unlikely to provide the commercial vehicle industry with the strong recovery it would need for a marked rebound in their business performance. Nevertheless, as more public works projects start to come through, demand for trucks is bound to pick up while in the more medium term, the corporate restructuring and moderate consolidation taking place in the industry should start to bring benefits as well.</p>

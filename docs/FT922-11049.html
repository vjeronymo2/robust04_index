			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (16): Paradise for consultants - The initial ardour of many would-be investors has cooled POLAND has become a consultant's paradise as legions of accountants, merchant bankers, lawyers, company doctors, would-be fund managers and the like have swarmed all over the country's 8,000 state-owned enterprises and fledgling financial institutions offering advice - but little money. Meanwhile, the disruption caused by three governments in quick succession, bureaucratic delays caused by lack of expertise in a former communist bureaucracy made worse by low salaries and poaching of talent by foreign companies and the private sector, have cooled the initial ardour of many would-be investors. The government's own figures show that 5,000 joint ventures and foreign-owned projects with a declared investment value of Dollars 690m were in place by the end of the year. This is only a third of the Hungarian level - and Hungary has only a quarter of Poland's nearly 40m population. Most investments have been small or medium, with none of the megadeals such as Volkswagen's takeover of the Skoda car company in Czechoslovakia. Much painstaking groundwork has been done, however, and this year the pace should speed up. Much will depend on the outcome of the mass privatisation scheme due to be launched mid-year. The rag-bag portfolio of state or municipally-owned enterprises have been sorted into 36 separate industrial sectors. They are being carefully analysed by western accountants and merchant bankers before their sale, privatisation, re-organisation or closure. More than 30 foreign investment projects are at an advanced stage of negotiation. In the automotive industry alone, for example, GM Europe is finalising details of its planned Dollars 75m investment at Warsaw's FSO car plant as is Fiat with its Dollars 200m auto project at FSM in southern Poland. Volvo is also negotiating to assemble trucks at the Jelcz plant also in southern Poland and Peugeot is also negotiating to assemble 405 models in Lublin. Poland is also attracting the multinational food and consumer goods corporations busy carving out market share in everything from packaged foods to detergents and baby goods. Strategic investors such as the Swiss-Swedish ABB are also busy building up capacity and skills for the heavy energy and other infrastructure investments which will have to take place in the latter part of the decade and well into the next century. For all the delays and frustrations, a rapid, if apparently chaotic transformation of the economy is taking place. The old communist economy with its heavy emphasis on heavily polluting, inefficient, coal-fired power plants, iron and steel, heavy engineering, basic chemicals and trade with eastern Europe and the Soviet Union is in profound crisis. But some sectors are doing better than others. It still makes sense, for example, when skilled labour is paid only Dollars 200 a month, to build ships for export and invest in modernising and raising productivity of the Baltic shipyards. A big problem here, in spite of fast-rising official unemployment, is shortage of labour willing to work under harsh conditions for such wages deliberately kept low by government policy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PRINCIPAL FOREIGN INVESTMENTS 1990-1991 (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Name             Capital      Investment commitment     Total                                     or project cost  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ABB                                                       200 Marriott (US)                           120 (Hotel)       120 Radison (US)                     120 (Hotel/office)       120 PepsiCo (US)          25                  56 (Food)        81 Coca Cola (US)                            60 (Food)        60 Philips (Dutch)       16              30 (Lighting)        46 Unilever (Dutch/UK)   20            24 (Detergents)        44 Thomson (Fr)                             (TV tubes)        35 Trust H Forte                            35 (Hotel)        35 Ilbau (Austrian)                        30 (Office)        30 Vienna Int                               30 (Hotel)        30 Henkel (Germany)      10            18 (Detergents)        28 Gerber (US)           11                  14 (Food)        25 Beloit (US)            7             15 (Machinery)        22 Rogener (Fr)                             20 (Hotel)        20 Proctor &amp; G                       15 (Distribution)        15 Siemens (Germany)                      12 (Telecom)        12 Benckiser (Germany)    5             4 (detergents)         9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Midland Montagu Financial Services, Warsaw  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

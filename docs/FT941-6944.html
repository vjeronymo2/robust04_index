			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Books: Liberal view of community politics - Malcolm Rutherford reviews Paddy Ashdown's trawl through the Celtic fringe and inner cities BEYOND WESTMINSTER: FINDING HOPE IN BRITAIN by Paddy Ashdown Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 9.99, 206 pages I first met Paddy Ashdown when he appeared as a spokesman for the British Foreign Office at the Geneva talks following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974. There was no compelling reason why he should be there. James Callaghan, the foreign secretary, had brought along his own very able spokesman, Tom McCaffrey, from London. Lord Callaghan said long afterwards that he had no recollection of meeting Ashdown at the time but, in the light of subsequent events, in British politics, wished it had been possible for the future leader of the Labour Party and the future leader of the Liberals to have had at least an exchange of views. Even then Ashdown was a restless figure, looking for something exciting to do. He had left the Special Boat Section, the Royal Marines' equivalent of the SAS, having learned Mandarin Chinese along the way, for the relative calm of the diplomatic service. The Foreign Office appointed him first secretary at the British mission to the UN in Geneva. Torn between a respect for discipline and a desire for individualism, he remained a diplomat for only five years. It was not entirely surprising that he resurfaced as the Liberal MP for Yeovil in 1983. He had checked the ground carefully and the old Tory seat was plainly vulnerable. Besides, the Liberal party (now the Liberal Democrats) was the only party that he could conceivably represent. Sometimes dynamic, always romantic, usually on the fringe, Ashdown is firmly in the postwar Liberal tradition. The restlessness continued. Bored with Westminster politics after the 1992 general election, Ashdown decided to leave the House of Commons for two and a half days a week 'in order to live and work with some of the different communities in our country'. The result is this book. Some of Beyond Westminster is very good. Ashdown writes well about local communities; the more remote they are, the better the writing becomes. He is at his best working on a Cornish fishing trawler in the Irish Sea, visiting the Orkney and Shetland islands or staying on a farm in the Wye valley. These are, incidentally, the areas from which Liberal votes have tended to come. Yet not all is Celtic fringe. Ashdown also went to the most depressed areas of inner London, Liverpool and Manchester. The most heart-felt sentence in his book is simply this: 'I had no idea what things are really like in Peckham and Toxteth and Moss Side until I went to stay there.' One of his findings was that 'no problem more affects the everyday life and freedoms of people in this country than the rise and rise of criminality and the breakdown of law and order'. He is particularly strong on the relentless spread of drugs. The book is sub-titled Finding Hope in Britain, but for all his professed optimism the evidence is that Ashdown found very little of it. He came across an effective crime reduction programme in Solihull in the West Midlands; a viable First Stop Crime Shop, jointly funded by central and local government and the police, in Peckham; and an old textiles firm that had gone successfully upmarket in Suffolk. There are tales, too, of housing cooperatives that work and local communities taking the initiative on recycling waste. For the most part, however, Beyond Westminster is the story of people battling against almost overwhelming odds. Government, local and central, is the villain. The geographical mix may have affected the judgment. Apart from the outlying islands, Ashdown's only trip to Scotland was to visit the Monktonhall colliery near Edinburgh - 'Britain's deepest pit and only operating mining co-operative'. The north east of England was avoided altogether; so were some of the more prosperous parts of the country. And a visit to Oxford is surely worth more than specialising in the city's Gay and Lesbian Centre. Thus it is almost as if Ashdown set out deliberately to look for minorities. He is also full of nostalgia. 'Toxteth,' he writes, 'contains the oldest black immigrant community in Europe.' A farmhouse in the Wye valley gives a 'powerful sense of being lived in century after century by people who drew their strength from the ground'. Where he wants to innovate - through the use of telecommunications - it is to help keep communities in remote areas. All of which is admirable. Those from other political parties will note, however, that Ashdown is sticking to community politics where the pressure comes from the grass roots up. For the Liberals this has worked well locally, but not yet nationally. In a few concluding pages, Ashdown offers little more than the hope that people will work together; the old Liberal stalwart of proportional representation is not even mentioned, let alone a Lib-Lab pact. A breakthrough still looks distant.</p>

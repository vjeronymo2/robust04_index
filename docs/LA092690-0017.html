			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CAMBODIA;  </P> <P> RESISTANCE READY TO RESTART TALKS  </P> <P> Cambodian resistance leaders said they are ready to reconvene a meeting to move  their country closer to peace but are still awaiting agreement from the  Vietnamese-backed government. Ek Sereywuth, a spokesman for resistance forces  loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk, said the resistance hopes that the Supreme  National Council, which brings together all four warring Cambodian factions,  will be able to reconvene in Bangkok, Thailand, this week to push forward a  U.N. peace plan. The spokesman said that although Sihanouk agreed to Phnom  Penh's demands for an extra seat on the council in return for naming him  chairman, the resistance coalition is determined not to give in to Phnom Penh's  demands that Premier Hun Sen be named council vice chairman.  </P></p>

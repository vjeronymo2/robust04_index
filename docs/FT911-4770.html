			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Brazil seeks to boost standing abroad: Country tries to shed its image as the black sheep of Latin America THE Brazilian government is to launch a campaign to improve its international standing, after last week's agreement with foreign bank creditors on the payment of arrears. 'We feel we've turned a corner with this accord and can now hope for a new climate in our international dealings,' said Mr Marcos Azambuja, director-general of the Brazilian foreign office. 'The impasse with the banks was like an albatross round our necks. Now it's time we got Brazil back into fashion'. As part of this move, Ms Zelia Cardoso, Brazil's finance minister, is planning trips to Japan, Europe and the US to try to recapture the support initially given to the government's adjustment plan. President Fernando Collor plays host to Britain's Prince Charles next week and, in June, will visit President George Bush. Before the US visit, Brazil intends to remove the major thorns in trade relations between the two countries by introducing patent protection and ending a law which prevents importing of information technology similar to products manufactured in Brazil. Brazil is blacklisted by the US commerce department for failing to deal with these matters and for pirating of US films. The US, Brazil's biggest creditor, was most instrumental in the recent delay by Group of Seven countries of a Dollars 350m loan from the Inter-American Development Bank. This loan is expected to be released soon, following the accord on arrears, but Brazil is still far from shedding its image in the international financial community as the black sheep of Latin America. While many Brazilian officials regard their country as a golden egg which outsiders are eager to get their hands on, potential investors are increasingly moving into Mexico, Chile and Venezuela. Brazil's image has not been helped by what seem ad hoc decisions, such as the suspension last month of coffee exports, which caused chaos on world markets, or drastic moves such as the government's seizure of 80 per cent of domestic assets and savings last year. Mr Toshiro Kobayashi, director of the Bank of Tokyo, said: 'Brazil is seen outside as a country one cannot trust. It needs to forget the illusion that it is a great and rich country, where everything one plants turns to milk and honey, and torealise that there are other countries where one can make money without fearing that debts won't be honoured and contracts will be breached.' Brazil's next step towards normalising its international relations starts next Monday, with the arrival of an IMF mission, but continuing economic instability means an early agreement is unlikely.</p>

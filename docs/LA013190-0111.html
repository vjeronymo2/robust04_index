			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA;  </P> <P> SOS AGREES TO BUY SITE FOR $1.4 MILLION  </P> <P> Share Our Selves, the embattled charity being evicted from its city-leased home  in a residential community center, signed an agreement Tuesday to purchase a  building in a south Costa Mesa industrial area, where many neighboring business  owners have already raised objections to the group's presence.  </P> <P> The building is at 1550 Superior Ave. in a southwest part of the city dotted  with commercial and light industrial businesses.  </P> <P> SOS board chairman Scott Mather said the group has agreed to pay $1.4 million  for 5,700 square feet in a 12,000-square-foot building. The sale is contingent  on the city's permitting the charity to operate at the site.  </P> <P> Despite some opposition, Mather called the purchase a "major milestone" for  20-year-old SOS.  </P> <P> "It's a big step in the right direction," he said. "We're going to take control  of our own destiny for the people we serve."  </P> <P> SOS directors have promised to mount a public relations campaign to stave off  opposition from residents who complain about the type of people the agency  attracts.  </P> <P> "It seems that anywhere we go there will be problems," said SOS founder and  chairwoman Jean Forbath. "But we've learned our lesson. We need to explain who  we are and what we are doing before they hear bad things about our people. We  would like to work in the community before anything goes forward."  </P> <P> Earlier this month, the city officials had considered leasing the Superior  Avenue building for the charity until the City Council rejected the plan as too  costly.  </P> <P> During the council meeting, owners of several businesses and an adjacent mobile  home park objected to the charity moving to the neighborhood. Among their  objections was the concern that crime might increase.  </P> <P> Several council members said at the time that, despite some objections, they  would support the move.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said Tuesday that "there are some concerns that  have to be addressed, but I think it is do-able. I believe the true impact on  the area will be minimal. I think that if the business people would go and see  the people that they (SOS) serve, many of their fears would be allayed."  </P> <P> SOS is one of the largest private nonprofit groups in the county and provides  food, clothing, medical and financial assistance to more than 20,000 needy  people a month.

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Brittan aims to have Rover 'sweeteners' case reopened SIR Leon Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, plans to reopen the case against the UK government over 'sweeteners' paid to British Aerospace when it bought Rover, the UK car manufacturer, in 1988. On Tuesday, the European Commission suffered a legal setback when the European Court of Justice threw out on procedural grounds Brussels' order forcing repayment of Pounds 44.4m of sweeteners. BAe and Rover had appealed against the Commission's decision. But Sir Leon said yesterday he had considered the ruling and had decided not to let the UK government off the hook. He said: 'It is clear that the judgment relates wholly to procedural matters and does not touch the merits of the actual decision. I shall therefore be recommending the Commission to reopen the case by commencing formal proceedings.' Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'After years of deception and evasion, it is now time for a speedy resolution to this long-running and regrettable saga.' Sir Leon could start a full state aid investigation, if his fellow commissioners agree. Should the Commission then conclude that the subsidy to BAe was illegal, it could again try to force BAe to repay the Pounds 44.4m. Alternatively, the Commission could complain to the court that Britain did not respect conditions laid down by Brussels for the Rover sale. The government deferred payment of the Pounds 150m initial purchase price beyond the original August 1988 deadline agreed with Brussels. Most of the Pounds 44.4m relates to the interest benefits BAe may have received due to the deferral. Tuesday's ruling said the Commission should have come direct to the court in 1990 or opened a new state aid investigation. Instead, the Commission's sweeteners inquiry was based on the earlier 1988 decision on the BAe-Rover deal, under which the UK government had to cut its subsidy to BAe from Pounds 800m to Pounds 469m. Brussels yesterday extended Sir Leon's mandate to control EC merger policy until the end of the year, ending any possibility of a challenge by other commissioners who wanted more influence over merger decisions. Sir Leon will continue to handle internal decisions on EC merger inquiries jointly with Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president. Sir Leon - whose mandate under the EC merger regulation comes up for review annually - accepted an increased obligation to keep his fellow commissioners informed about the progress of investigations. If he opts to open a new state aid investigation, then the UK government and other interested parties will again be given one to two months to provide evidence to the Commission.</p>

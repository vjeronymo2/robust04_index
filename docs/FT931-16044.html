			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Carmakers confident of Clinton EXECUTIVES of the big three US car makers say President-elect Bill Clinton has undertaken not to do anything to harm the domestic industry, writes our Washington staff. They said that the assurance came during talks with Mr Clinton and his economic advisers in Little Rock this week. The talks seem to have centred on international trade and costs such as health care which affect US competitiveness, with no decision taken on a possible new tax on petrol. Mr Clinton's aides said he had reaffirmed his commitment to higher fuel efficiency standards. Detroit's recent conversion to support of a petrol tax has been predicated on a relaxation by the incoming administration of these standards. Some senior members of the new government, such as Dr Alice Rivlin, deputy budget director, have also recommended higher taxes on petrol, as has the environmental lobby, of which Mr Al Gore, about to become vice president, is a leading member. But the coalition of interests arrayed against - including the oil and trucking lobbies and rural constituencies - threaten a tough legislative battle against any such proposal. Mr Clinton has not yet finalised the programme he will present to Congress when he takes office. The US trade delegation sent its long-awaited proposal for cutting industrial tariffs to Uruguay Round world trade negotiators yesterday, a US official said, Reuter reports from Geneva. Meanwhile, senior trade envoys from the US and the European Community flew to Geneva to discuss advancing the stalled 108-nation talks, an EC source told Reuters. The US offer, which follows a revised EC draft plan presented in December, comes ahead of a meeting of the round's top-level Trade Negotiations Committee on January 15.</p>

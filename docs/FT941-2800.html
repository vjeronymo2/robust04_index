			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine's pits of despair - Coal mining subsidies are helping to drive the economy further into the red Ukraine's mighty and mythicised coal industry has sunk into utter decay and despair, bringing down the two-year-old nation's economy with it. The country has been pouring money into the Donbass coal mining region to save it - but that has only made matters worse. Ukraine's hyperinflation, 90 per cent in December, is largely caused by the massive subsidies needed to keep 262 coal mines operating and 1.2m coal workers employed (5 per cent of the labour force). Employment in Ukraine's coal industry is no bed of roses, however. Four or five miners die for every 1m tonnes of coal produced, making it the most deadly in the world. And it pays the lowest mining wages in Europe  - so low that many cross the border illegally to work in Russian mines at cut-price rates. But cheap labour does not mean that the industry offers good value for money to the nation as a whole - the Ukrainian miner produces only 5 per cent of the coal his European or North American counterpart does. There is also an environmental cost, which extends beyond Ukraine's borders. The country's coal industry contributes 3 per cent (2.2bn cubic meters) of the worldwide emission of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with global warming. At the time of independence in 1991 Ukrainians had banked on the rich coal reserves of the Don River basin to offset lost Russian energy imports and earn precious dollars abroad. Coal was to be a key asset of the Ukrainian state, rather than the drain on resources it is today. The Kiev government spends trillions of its currency, the karbovanets, (hundreds of millions of US dollars) propping up loss-making coal mines. Last year the coal industry could only cover 20 per cent of its costs and the government had to make up the rest. This year subsidies have been reduced to 40 per cent, but still amount to Dollars 50m a month. Some coal pits are extremely profitable and could could be viable without state subsidies. But the government channels the proceeds from the profitable mines to the unprofitable. At present the state takes 95 per cent of production at fixed prices, through the Soviet-style state order system, to satisfy about a quarter of Ukraine's energy needs. Only 5 per cent of production is left with the mines to sell at unregulated prices. This arrangement leaves the successful mines with no money for technological improvements and investment. Everyone, from the Soviet factory boss, Deputy Prime Minister Valentin Landyk, to the coal strike committee chairman, agrees that the inefficient mines need to be closed down. Even Zhenya, a 27-year-old miner at the Gorky pit in Donetsk, is under no illusions. 'This pit should have been shut down years ago,' he says. 'They only keep it running so that we're employed. They're afraid of us.' The Gorky mine, nearly exhausted, is almost 1km below the ground. Extracting the coal from its thin layers is such a laborious process that its 660 miners only get 1,600 tonnes a day. (In Europe, where mining is fully mechanised, 660 workers take out over 66,000 tonnes of coal a day on average.) Many of the mines are negative value adders - the below-ground resources are worth more untouched than the value of the coal mined. 'It would be cheaper to close down the mines, just pay workers their salaries and import coal from abroad,' suggests one western official. As in Europe and North America, closing down loss-making mines without mass unemployment is a daunting challenge for Ukraine's leaders. There is no political will to take action as no one want to take responsibility for unemployment and the potential social unrest. About 90 per cent of the coal industry is based in the densely populated Donbass region of eastern Ukraine, where there is virtually no labour mobility. Kiev fears that sudden unemployment could cause a 'social explosion', especially among a highly Russified population that is disenchanted with Ukrainian independence. The government is also reluctant to challenge the powerful eastern coal mining lobby, which exploits the east-west tensions in the country. Ending coal subsidies could be portrayed as an anti-eastern move, fueling the popular perception in the east that Kiev is controlled by western-nationalist interests. To close the pits without social unrest would require a long term retraining programme and development of new industries to hire workers. But Ukraine has no money for an ambitious, co-ordinated restructuring programme. Meanwhile, the pits are in ruins. Wooden supports from Russia are rotting out - one of the chief causes of frequent pit collapses - as Ukraine cannot afford to import new ones. There has been no significant investment in the coal industry for over 10 years. Much mining is still done by hand. One innovative, but long-term, solution for Donbass is to harness its methane, the natural gas that is now causing underground explosions and environmental destruction. There are 25.4 trillion cubic metres of methane in the Don Basin, enough to satisfy even Ukraine's inefficient energy consumption for over 250 years. Though uneconomic at the moment, technological investment could make coal-bed methane extraction an energy production alternative in the future, while reducing Ukraine's 80 per cent reliance on natural gas imports from Russia and Turkmenistan.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> DEAN WITTER BUYS PASADENA CENTER  </P> <P> Dean Witter Realty today announced it has acquired Pasadena Financial Center, a  major downtown office building, for $30 million.  </P> <P> The nine-story 147,000-square-foot building, located at 35 North Lake Ave., and  six-level parking facility for 470 vehicles are situated on about 1.4 acres.  </P> <P> The six-year-old Pasadena Financial Center is 92% leased. It was purchased for  Dean Witter Realty's portfolio, possibly as an asset for a future investment  fund, according to E. Davisson Hardman Jr., a Dean Witter Realty managing  director. "We expect the slow-growth initiative enacted in March of this year,  limiting future office development in Pasadena, to increase the value of the  building," Hardman said.  </P></p>

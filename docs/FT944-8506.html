			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Ibstock makes Pounds 15m Scottish purchases Ibstock's move to concentrate on its core business of manufacturing building materials was reinforced yesterday with the purchase, for up to Pounds 14.8m, of two Scottish brick companies, Centurion Brick and Scottish Brick Corporation. Ibstock, the UK's third largest brick maker, paid Pounds 9.05m cash and has assumed about Pounds 5.5m in debt, which it plans to pay off immediately. It may pay a further Pounds 200,000 on completion depending on the value of the combined net assets. The previous owner was Law Holdings, a private company with coal mining interests. Centurion operates a factory at Tannochside, near Glasgow, producing 50m facing and engineering bricks a year. Scottish Brick owns a mothballed factory at Bishopbriggs, also near Glasgow. Ibstock plans to install a new tunnel kiln at a cost of about Pounds 6m. Mr Ian Maclellan, group managing director, said Ibstock's 10 per cent share of the UK cement market would rise to 13 per cent and that Ibstock would become the largest producer and seller of bricks in Scotland.</p>

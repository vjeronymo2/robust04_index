			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOW SOARS 63.36 AS GOOD NEWS TRIGGERS RALLY;  </P> <P> WALL STREET: A DIVE IN OIL PRICES AND A TENTATIVE AGREEMENT TO CUT THE FEDERAL  DEFICIT OPENED THE GATES FOR THE BULLS TO CHARGE BACK INTO THE MARKET.  </P> <P> Wall Street kicked off the fourth quarter with a strong stock and bond rally,  as news of a federal budget pact and a plunge in oil prices helped halt the  deepening gloom of recent weeks.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index leaped 63.36 points, or 2.6%, to close at  2,515.84 in the best gain since Aug. 27. Many buyers were betting that the  budget pact will clear the way for lower interest rates ahead, thereby lowering  the likelihood of a severe recession. The chance of a negotiated settlement in  the Iraq-Kuwait crisis also spurred optimism.  </P> <P> Numerous key stocks jumped more than 5% for the day, as volume on the New York  Stock Exchange totaled a heavy 202.21 million shares. The rally was helped by  strong market gains overseas. In Frankfurt, West Germany, the DAX index  rocketed 85.84 points, or 6.4%, to 1,420.73 as oil prices fell.  </P> <P> The rally continued in Tokyo today. The Nikkei index closed up 2,676.55, or  13.24%, to 22,898.41, after losing 761 points Monday. It was a record  single-day surge.  </P> <P> But many experts cautioned against betting that the bear market has suddenly  ended. They noted that knee-jerk rallies are typical after prolonged periods of  selling in bear markets, as investors and traders reach for any straw of good  news.  </P> <P> What's more, a significant portion of Monday's buying appeared to come from  so-called short sellers, who had bet in recent weeks and months that stocks  were going lower. Having guessed correctly, the shorts -- who sell borrowed  stock -- were buying shares on the open market to close out their positions as  the market turned.  </P> <P> "I think the shorts caused more of a (buying) flurry than Wall Street had  expected," said Dan Leonard, who runs the $20-million Financial Programs  Technology mutual fund in Denver.  </P> <P> Still, analysts were encouraged by the breadth of Monday's rally, after  Friday's 25-point Dow gain. Winning stocks outpaced losers Monday by 1,192 to  436 on the New York Stock Exchange, and the rally expanded as the day  progressed. The Dow was up 17 points at 10 a.m. EDT, 39 points at noon and 56  at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 8.89 points, or 2.9%, to 314.94, and  the NASDAQ over-the-counter composite index rose 10.14 points, or 2.9%, to  354.65.  </P> <P> "A lot of people were picking at stocks that have been beaten down  dramatically," said Len Hefter, manager of over-the-counter trading for  brokerage Jefferies &amp; Co. in Dallas. "There were legitimate institutional  buy orders coming in."  </P> <P> The burst of optimism was in part a classic Wall Street reaction after months  of depressing news, traders noted. By last Thursday, the Dow had lost 572  points, or 19%, from its July peak of 2,999.75.  </P> <P> Now, many buyers badly want to believe that the worst is over and that Monday's  action shows it is time to look ahead to a recovery. Here's what spurred  buyers:  </P> <P> * After months of wrangling, congressional and White House negotiators reached  an agreement to cut $500 billion from the projected federal deficit over five  years. Though Wall Street is only beginning to sort out what effects the  spending cuts and tax increases will have on the economy, investors were simply  relieved to have a pact, analysts said.  </P> <P> "I think it's constructive," said DeWitt Bowman, chief investment officer for  the $56-billion California Public Employees Retirement System. Even so, he  said, his fund wasn't a buyer of stocks on Monday. The pact "still has to be  enacted by Congress," he noted, and many questions remain.  </P> <P> * There was widespread agreement Monday that interest rates will come down  soon. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has hinted that he would  ease credit if a budget accord was reached.  </P> <P> Market strategist Elaine Garzarelli at Shearson Lehman in New York cited the  interest rate outlook as a key factor in her decision Monday to turn bullish.  She sees the Dow rebounding at least 10% to 12% soon, driven by lower rates.  </P> <P> * Iraq's renewed interest in diplomatic negotiations helped send oil prices  down more than $2 a barrel, and gave stock traders hope. Yet Iraqi President  Saddam Hussein's back-and-forth rhetoric offers little hope of a solution soon,  most experts agree.  </P> <P> Investors' desire to see an end to the bear market in Monday's events isn't  unusual, analysts say. But many believe that stocks still have further to fall  later this year or early next year, after a short-term rally. The bears say the  No. 1 problem for the market and the economy is the extraordinary debt built up  by companies, individuals and government in the 1980s.  </P> <P> "It's not just the end of a three- or four-year business cycle this time," said  Peter Eliades, at Stockmarket Cycles newsletter in Los Angeles. "The debt has  to be liquidated," he said, and that will take years and much pain.  </P> <P> Among the market highlights:  </P> <P> * Drug and food stocks were among the biggest gainers, showing investors were  mostly seeking out the safer stocks. Coca-Cola jumped 2 1/8 to 41 5/8, Merck  gained 4 1/8 to 80 1/4, Philip Morris rose 2 1/2 to 47 3/4 and Conagra added 1  3/4 to 35.  </P> <P> * Other big winners included many of the consumer stocks hardest hit in recent  months. Disney rebounded 5 5/8 to 96 1/4, retailer Carter Hawley Hale gained  1/2 to 3, Time Warner rose 2 1/4 to 72 1/2 and Circus Circus rose 2 1/8 to 45  1/8.  </P> <P> * Energy stocks were mostly lower with oil prices. Arco dropped 2 3/8 to 132,  Amoco lost 1 to 55 3/4, Halliburton gave up 1 7/8 to 49 1/2 and Unocal fell 1/2  to 30 1/2.  </P> <P> * Some battered technology stocks were snapped up by bargain hunters. Among  Southland companies, Computer Sciences rose 3 to 41 1/4, AST Research added 1  to 17 3/4 and Micropolis rose 3/8 to 5 1/8.  </P> <P> In London, the Financial Times-100 index gained 40.6 points to 2,030.80.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT: Oil, Budget News Ignites Bonds Surge  </P> <P> Treasury bond prices surged Monday as the market cheered a sharp drop in oil  prices and the federal budget accord reached by congressional negotiators and  President Bush over the weekend.  </P> <P> The widely watched 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 1/32 point, or $10.32 for every  $1,000 in face amount. Its yield dropped to 8.84% from 8.94% late Friday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one another for overnight  loans, was quoted at 8.25%, up from 8% Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CURRENCY: Chance of Interest Rate Cut Saps Dollar  </P> <P> The agreement on the deficit-reduction package sent the dollar lower against  major foreign currencies Monday on expectations of lower U.S. interest rates  ahead.  </P> <P> In New York trading, the dollar closed at 136.75 Japanese yen, down from 138.50  late Friday. Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.557 from 1.567.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COMMODITIES: Gold, Grain, Energy Futures Fall Sharply  </P> <P> Gold, grains and energy futures prices declined sharply as conciliatory  gestures from the United States and Iraq's Saddam Hussein eased war jitters.  </P> <P> Gold futures for October tumbled $15.90 to $386.60 an ounce on New York's  Commodity Exchange. October silver fell 12.1 cents to $4.64.  </P> <P> Platinum settled on the New York Mercantile Exchange $7.30 to $6.30 lower, with  October at $426.80 an ounce. Silver settled 15.5 to 12.1 cents lower on the  Commodity Exchange.  </P></p>

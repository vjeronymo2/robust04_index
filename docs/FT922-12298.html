			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Construction Contracts: Fitting out London base BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 50m construction management contract to fit out the new London headquarters of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, situated at One Exchange Square, 175 Bishopsgate, London EC2. Fitting out the 367,000 sq ft of floor space involves internal partitioning, ceilings, carpeting, decoration, data and communications installations, lighting and air conditioning, all to high standards. Other works include directors' offices, various facilities, a dealing room, board room and auditorium. Structural alterations are required to meet the design brief of the bank. Bovis Construction, a P&amp;O company, has made a particular study of how to improve both the quality and speed of the fitting out process. Analysis of all factors involved has resulted in the development of new techniques and methods of working which will enable a phased occupation of the building.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / UK Company News: Scottish Heritable makes sharp inroads into losses SCOTTISH HERITABLE Trust, the mini-conglomerate, showed a substantial recovery in 1991 cutting pre-tax losses from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 792,000. All but one division recorded sizeable improvements to produce an overall trading profit of Pounds 6.59m, against a loss of Pounds 7m. This, however, was swallowed up by interest charges, which fell from Pounds 8.48m to Pounds 6.79m. Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 41m. Gearing at the end of 1991 was 270 per cent and Mr Stuart Macdonald, finance director, said the aim was to cut it during 1992 to 100 per cent or below through the current disposal programme. A decline in oriental carpet sales and the disposal of Hearthstead Homes (housebuilder), John Letters (golf club maker) and Nippasox (children's clothing manufacturer) led to a drop in turnover to Pounds 95.5m (Pounds 116m). Losses per share came to 1.5p (36.3p) before, and to 6.6p (59.7p) after extraordinary charges of Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 8.4m). The charges covered redundancy and closure overheads and the cost of the refinancing programme. In the individual trading divisions the improvement was most significant in property and investment, where there was a profit of Pounds 1.67m before interest and tax, compared to a loss of Pounds 5.56m). SHT's property division has a mixed portfolio of land around Britain and owns tenement flats in the Glasgow area.</p>

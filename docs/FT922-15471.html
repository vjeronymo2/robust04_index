			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME aluminium stocks show first fall since August ALUMINIUM STOCKS in London Metal Exchange warehouses have fallen for the first time since early August but analysts suggested yesterday this did not mark the start of a downward trend. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group, said the 425-tonne fall was 'a milestone' but cautioned that there was still a great deal of Russian aluminium to be exported to the west to swell stocks this year. Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, a member of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, said the outlook for aluminium demand in the second quarter was not particularly bright. Even if production stayed flat, demand would have to rise 2.5 per cent this year just to hold stocks at present levels, he pointed out. The market was anticipating a bigger stocks fall and aluminium for delivery in three months closed Dollars 2.25 a tonne down last night at Dollars 1,318. This was nearly Dollars 225 a tonne above the lowest price reached in the present recession in late December. This week's stock fall came about because less metal arrived in European warehouses and there were withdrawals from LME north American warehouses. Demand is certainly picking up in the US. Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Alcoa, the biggest north American aluminium group, said recently that volumes were up across the board in January and February and bookings from makers of cans, cars and consumer durables and from the building and construction sector had all increased. Alcoa had contacted some of its clients and they had all said their buying was backed by a genuine improvement in US demand. While Alcoa did not want to give exact details for commercial reasons, Mr O'Neill said that, if the group's orders in August last year were at 50 on an index, from November to February the index would be 120 to 125.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  ---------------------------------------- (As at Monday's close)                  tonnes Aluminium    -425 to 1,175,375 Copper     -2,075 to   298,700 Lead         +400 to   132,575 Nickel       +288 to    26,028 Zinc       +2,100 to   221,575 Tin          +150 to    11,990  ----------------------------------------</p>

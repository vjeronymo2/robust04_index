			<p>931102 FT  02 NOV 93 / Goodison backs financial regulator SIR NICHOLAS GOODISON, president of the British Bankers' Association and TSB group chairman, yesterday supported the establishment of the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed self-regulating body for retail financial services. Sir Nicholas argued that improvements in regulation need not await the possibility of new legislation to revise the Financial Services Act. He also renewed his call for the Bank of England to lose its responsibility for consumer protection and to acquire responsibility for the capital adequacy of non-banking institutions.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by STUe: "An SPD Government's Idea of Research: `A </F> Great Coalition of Reason,' More Money, the Energy Policy"]    [Text] Bonn, 10 Dec--A federal government headed by the  Social Democrats would want to set in motion a broad dialogue  between the economic sector, science, the labor unions, and the  state on the direction technological development should take and  the individual measures to be instituted. Vosen, the research  policy spokesman for the SPD [Social Democratic Party of  Germany] group in the Bundestag, said in Bonn that a social  consensus on this domain does not at present exist in Germany,  as demonstrated by the examples of genetic engineering, nuclear  power, or the transrapid. "We need a great coalition of reason  for research that cuts across all party boundaries," Vosen  insisted. The SPD politician conceded that this consensus did  not exist in his party either on a good many issues. Thus,  unlike Social Democratic traffic politicians, he came out in  favor of a transrapid application line in Germany. The call for  "more boldness in technology!" is also aimed at the SPD.    Vosen presented a 10-page "blueprint for a research and  technology policy for the SDP-government program." Agreement on  the paper has not, to be sure, been reached with Glotz, the  member of the election campaign team responsible for education  and research, but it will have some influence on the program. In  the paper he says that the existing obstacles to innovations in  law and administration must be eliminated. Vosen demanded that  the research budget, which in past years has served as a "piggy  bank," be clearly increased from 1995 on. If the budget had  grown since 1986 as the entire national budget has, DM3 billion  more would be available for research in 1994 instead of just the  actual DM9.47 billion.    The SPD differs from the coalition in its assessment of  nuclear energy. The SPD lays stronger emphasis on the  development of renewable sources of energy and energy  conservation technologies. Moreover, it focuses chiefly on the  "humanization" of working conditions, research on peace and  conflicts, and the humanities. The government has come more into  line with the SPD's criticism of the costly manned space  programs because of the shortage of funds. Additional major  focal points cited in the SPD plan are the development of  research on the environment and health, the strengthening of  stat-of-the-art technologies like information technology and  telecommunications, genetic engineering and biotechnology,  research on materials, and the development of new fuels and  ideas for dealing with traffic. Vosen came out in favor of the  reintroduction of tax support for research and demanded legally  established rights for the Bundestag to take part in government  decisions on research programs. Vosen attested to Minister of  Research Krueger's (CDU [Christian Democratic Union]) good  intentions. But he said that Krueger had been unable to assert  himself up to now, as the budget debates demonstrated. He does  not even have much to say in his own house. He said that the  "secret minister of research" is Krueger's secretary of state,  Ziller.</p>

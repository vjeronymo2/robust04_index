			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Letter: Housing: time to end tax relief and encourage lettings (1) Sir, Oh that the government would act upon your leader, 'A new policy for housing' (November 23), which registers your newspaper as another subscriber to the consensus of informed opinion advocating phasing out mortgage interest tax relief. All the political parties know this is right. Neither the government nor the Labour party has had the political courage to act. Now is far enough from the election and, as you point out, the easiest time to cushion the downside for existing borrowers, with further interest rate falls still in prospect. It is astonishing that a government which believes in a free-market economy should continue to give preferential tax treatment to one tenure sector and thereby inflate prices of what is a necessity, leaving many aspiring owner-occupiers unable to invest and other people enduring dreadful housing conditions. An immediate conversion is required. The government could provide adequate financial support for those who need it - the unemployed in danger of losing their homes and those would-be first-time buyers who are the key to stabilising house prices and getting the housing market moving again. But to spend just Pounds 750m moving dwellings from one sector to another, leaving millions in housing capital receipts languishing in local authorities' coffers, will not be effective either in meeting housing needs or stimulating the economy. Michael Pattison, chief executive and secretary-general, The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 12 Great George Street, Parliament Square, London SW1P 3AD</p>

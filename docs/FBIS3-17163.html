He said that experts on both sides would meet in Vilnius and  Moscow next month to draw up agreements on travelling and  customs procedures and on the transit of Russian vehicles and  trains via Lithuania to Kaliningrad.    However, no agreement on military transit is envisaged  following Lithuania's plans to adopt a special government  resolution or law on the transit of military or dangerous  cargoes through the country's territory. It was agreed that  Russian and Lithuanian experts would meet in May to discuss the  issue.    Agreement was also reached that the question of payment of  foreign cash to Lithuanians holding accounts with the former  USSR Vneshekonombank would be discussed at the level of experts.    The Russian diplomat said that last November's trade and  economic agreement easing trade barriers against Lithuania would  be effective only after the package on Kaliningrad was signed.    The next round of talks will be held in Vilnius late in  April  or early in May.</p>

But Tab Ramos'  shot on the restart was knocked down by the Ajax wall.  </P> <P> The United States got the tying goal four minutes later when Bruce Murray  headed a pass to Harkes 25 yards from the Ajax goal.  </P> <P> Harkes dribbled to the left of the penalty area and chipped a shot past Storm  for his third goal of the exhibition season.  </P> <P> The United States closes its exhibition season May 20 at New Haven, Conn.,  against Partisan Belgrade, a Yugoslav club team. The Americans begin  first-round play in the World Cup tournament on June 10 at Florence, Italy,  against Czechoslovakia.  </P></p>

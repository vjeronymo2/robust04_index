			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Property industry raises Pounds 5.7bn The UK commercial property industry raised Pounds 5.74bn in loans, bonds and rights issues in 1993, Vanessa Houlder writes. It was the largest total since 1989 and an 88 per cent increase on the previous year. The statistics, which were compiled by Savills, chartered surveyors, reflect a change in perception about the prospects for commercial property. Expectations about the performance of property increased sharply as a result of the improved prospects for the economy and the decline in interest rates and bond yields. The total raised included Pounds 2.65bn from loans, Pounds 710m from bonds and Pounds 2.39bn from rights issues compared with Pounds 2.77bn from loans and Pounds 281m from bonds in 1992. The large increase in rights issues, which made a minimal contribution to the total raised in 1992, reflected a re-rating of property company shares. The level of funds raised through loans in 1993, which included a Pounds 1.1bn loan in October to allow Canary Wharf to exit from administration, was similar to the 1992 total. Of the debt of Pounds 3.36bn, Pounds 2.18bn was used for refinancing existing debt, leaving Pounds 1.18bn as new money into property. The statistics do not include the money invested directly into the market by institutional investors, which also increased sharply last year.</p>

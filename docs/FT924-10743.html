			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Time for helicopters and holes in the ground There is something futile about a depression. Real economic problems arise from rival and clamorous claims on scarce resources. Other problems arise from reducing the inflation rate, which can have a heavy transitional cost. But depression - defined as too little spending to secure trend economic growth even when inflation is low - seems a paradoxical sort of evil. To put down a few numbers. A reasonable growth rate for the UK national income in money terms (nominal gross domestic product), consistent with low inflation and a very gradual emergence from recession, might be 5 per cent per annum or just above. The present underlying growth rate of the money national income is probably about 2 or 3 per cent per annum or less. This means that even with core inflation down to about 3 or 4 per cent, output continues to fall, adding to recessionary pressures in an already depressed economy. Worst of all the depression is contributing to a mood of acute xenophobia combined with hostility to market solutions which I can only call national(istic) socialism and is particularly vociferous among some of the so-called Tory Euro-sceptics. I doubt the widespread view that the depression is due to political fears. The severity of the first dip was often attributed to the Gulf war in 1991. When the end of the war failed to set off a recovery, the second dip was attributed to election fears. Now the third dip is being attributed to the trials of a weak government. These are late rationalisations. Yet for all the gloom there are few people who cannot think of ways of spending more money so long as they have enough of it. Milton Friedman has spoken of a helicopter dropping dollar bills. Keynes wrote about burying pound notes in holes in the ground. What are the objections to some dressed-up version of the helicopter or the hole? A serious objection is that governments could overestimate the amount of unused capacity or unemployed labour that could be brought back into use by injecting more demand. In that case too much of the stimulus would take the form of more inflation rather than genuine growth. In addition the consumer response could be unmanageably jerky: to begin with very little, and then a sudden and unexpected upward jerk in spending which would be difficult to pull back. Above all, there is the danger of generating a fall in sterling which would increase the inflationary component of any given stimulus. Demand management is and will remain an imperfect art, but allowing a cumulative downward cycle to develop is itself dangerous. The domestic risks can be reduced if demand management is moved a step away from the political process, so that - for instance - base rate changes cannot be timed to help the government out of a parliamentary difficulty. Just as important is commitment to a nominal objective which puts a limit to the inflationary potential if things go wrong. The little word 'nominal' is not just a gesture to monetarists, but the heart of the exercise. The inflationary impact of sterling's recent depreciation could be spread over a longer period than that of previous devaluations and therefore have a smaller impact on the per annum inflation rate. Keith Skeoch of James Capel has shown that sterling is historically extremely competitive against the D-Mark and once again quite competitive against the dollar, following the latter's recovery. The CBI October survey also records the sharpest turnround from pessimism to optimism about export prospects since 1987, even though the world slowdown will delay the impact. The shock horror effect from the CBI survey comes from domestic questions, above all from the highly psychological one which does reflect the political factor but which is also extremely volatile. However, as I tried to show in an article in the FT on October 12 (Sense on Sterling) these gains will turn into inflationary dross if the pound continues to sink. We are already in the danger area and should be looking for some recovery. The moral is that any further stimulus should take a fiscal form rather than the cuts in base rates about which John Major talks so much to the lobby. The common-sense reason for not cutting, and even adding to, public capital projects, is that it is best to undertake them when the construction industry is slack and it is easier to get value for money. And when confidence is important, why not put these projects below some line on a piece of paper so that accountants can say that they form a 'capital budget'? But there are no grounds for cutting social security payments, which feed straight through into consumer spending, other than to prevent abuses which should be tackled irrespective of the economic temperature. Nor are there any grounds for laying off public sector workers other than genuine over-manning. And it would be hair shirt stupidity to raise taxes. But a tight public sector pay limit makes a lot of sense. The objection that a looser fiscal policy would drive up interest rates is badly flawed. As the chart shows, a soaring public sector borrowing requirement has in the past couple of years been accompanied by tumbling interest rates at both the short and the long end. Even in earlier years there is little systematic relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. The error that is made is to treat the UK as a closed economy in which the government can borrow more only by 'printing money' or by bidding up interest rates. In a free world capital market there is a going rate for funds; and borrowing governments pay an interest penalty if their currencies are expected to depreciate or if they are judged to be default risks. A little bit of 'printing money' in the shape of underfunding the budget deficit could well be tried - the equivalent to a few rotations of the helicopter's blades. In the end it may be cost-effective to take a more unorthodox approach. If central bankers, led by Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Fed, could 10 years ago assemble first aid packages for developing countries, there seems no reason why governments and central banks should not domestically offer to take over from building societies and banks a slice of the debt of households with negative equity - or alternatively to make some direct contribution to interest costs. These operations would - like the US savings and loan rescues - be put in a category of their own outside the normal budget, which would then really have to balance once economic activity got back to trend. Taking risks with sterling and interest rates, while making gestures to fiscal orthodoxy, seems to be the prevailing policy mix. It is the opposite of what is required; but it is what we shall get.</p>

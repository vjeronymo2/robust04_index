			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / International Press Review FRANCE Anyone who has ever suspected that the Balladur government is making a fuss about nothing in the Gatt negotiations might have changed their mind had they witnessed the tone of last week's French regional press. The week began with the announcement that the EC and the US had finally reached an agreement on agriculture, a breakthrough welcomed by the national newspapers. The response in the provinces was very different. 'The Gatt negotiations are totally reactionary,' thundered Mr Christophe Pron, head of one of the Aube farming unions, in Tuesday's L'Est Eclair. 'This isn't free trade: it's dictatorship.' L'Alsace described the mood of local farmers as 'anxious' and feared that the US concessions were 'totally inadequate'. The following day, La Depeche du Midi assembled a panel of agricultural leaders to air their views. The bluntest was Mr Raymond Lacombe, former head of FNSEA, the national farmers' union. 'The Americans have one aim  - to smash the common agricultural policy,' he fumed. 'The Europeans are making a major political mistake. The world will starve if food becomes a political weapon for the Americans.' Tempers were still heated on Thursday. Presse-Ocean described the farmers as 'between deception and anger'. The small farmers' union condemned the French government's conduct of the negotiations as 'high treason' in DNA, the Alsace paper. Ouest-France said the farmers had been 'boxed into a corner'. Enough was enough for the nationals by the end of the week. 'Gatted Out]' shrieked the headline of Philippe Bouvard's column in Friday's France-Soir. 'I've found it hard to follow the Gatt dossier,' he confessed. 'All I know is that the naughty Americans, not content with having foisted Disneyland on us, have entrusted the future of our exports to someone called Mickey.' UNITED STATES US news organisations maintain an apparently insatiable news interest in outer space, but there comes a time when one spacewalk starts to look rather like another. That time came last week for US newspapers, as the space shuttle mission to repair the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's defective Hubble satellite telescope rolled smoothly towards its conclusion. Watching routine space shuttle launches is almost as fascinating as train spotting, and the lack of drama soon saw Hubble relegated. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post all carried front-page stories with photographs and graphics on Monday. By Tuesday, only the pictures remained, with the words shifted to the inside pages. The dirty secret, of course, is that news organisations devote reporters and camera crews to the space shuttle just in case one blows up again, as Challenger did in 1986. Since reporters must justify their expenses, they write stories, but when nothing goes on, it is hard to keep them on the front page. By Thursday the New York Times was devoting its front-page attention to the lone gunman who on Tuesday evening had killed five people on a Long Island commuter train, and the Washington Post was warning its readers to boil their drinking water. GERMANY Just how sharp is the much-vaunted long-sightedness of Germany's top managers? The question was asked last Monday in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung's comment on the severe liquidity problems at Metallgesellschaft. En passant, it raised the same poser about Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial concern, whose AEG subsidiary was within days to announce plans for a radical structural shakeout and the sale of its flag-bearing domestic appliances business to Electrolux. Both groups, the FAZ suggested, were peacocks that had fanned their tails too wide: in the case of MG, by attempting to change the old mining and metals company into an environmental technology group through high-risk acquisitions and investments. Borsen-Zeitung, the traditionally po-faced stock market daily, also resorted to the peacock analogy in its analysis of the New York oil futures farrago which generated MG's crisis. It proposed that the local subsidiary had been allowed to over-stretch its capabilities. 'There is need for action here,' BZ concluded. Details of action at AEG, the care-worn electrical and electronics business, rescued from the brink in the 1980s and then tucked under the Daimler-Benz wing, had been well-leaked in advance. The German media, sceptical at the best of times about Daimler's ambitions to become an 'integrated technology group', accepted that some progress had been made with the planned disposal of businesses unconnected with planes and roads and trains. But Handelsblatt, the financial daily, was in no mood to be generous. 'The AEG story is a story of erosion and failings. . . Damage limitation is dominant. Long-term structural and behavioural concepts have yet to come,' it charged. Another article in the same paper, less judgmental but more glum, concluded: 'The dream of an independent, globally-active electro-group appears to have faded. The contraction will continue.' SOUTH AFRICA South African newspaper readers have had a rough time over the past few months: headline writers have served up a tedious diet of alternating breakthrough and breakdown as constitutional talks lurched toward their conclusion; editors and political columnists suffered rapid mood swings from triumph to gloom and back again while the rest of the population demonstrated little more than exhausted indifference. The process reached its climax last week when blacks took their seats on the Transitional Executive Council, ending 350 years of white domination. Yet this story of black triumph over apartheid was relegated to page two in the Sowetan, the leading black daily. The Citizen, the popular Johannesburg daily that also has a large black readership, followed suit, concerning itself on its front page with whether the Prince of Wales would ever be king. Ironically, the Afrikaans daily Beeld greeted the great day with a page-one burst of lyricism: 'The door of the new South Africa has been opened and hope shines through in brilliant beams', it said. The Sowetan's political correspondent took a rather more cynical line: 'If yesterday (was) the beginning of the end of minority rule, it certainly did not feel like it.' The Johannesburg Saturday Star also noted the 'damp squib' effect of the TEC, and set out to find out why. 'People don't seem to know exactly what's going on,' said Ms Joyce Dube, a journalist quoted by the paper. 'Perhaps we have not made it clear,' she said, indicting the role of her own profession in failing to put the minutiae of negotiations in proper context. But 'Big B', a patron of a Soweto shebeen (bar), had the last word: 'Power? What power?', the Saturday Star quoted him as asking. 'You must be joking. Just because you have your hands on the steering wheel does not mean you're driving to the bank.'</p>

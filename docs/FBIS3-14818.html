Boris Yeltsin's press  secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov and presidential aide Georgiy  Satarov discussed a very topical and timely subject with  journalists today -- the defense of democracy and human rights.    As ITAR-TASS has just reported, Georgiy Satarov, the head of  state's aide, told the briefing that Russian President Boris  Yeltsin has prepared certain actions aimed at defending the  democratic state and society. He refused to specify the form in  which these measures would be carried out. However, Yuriy  Baturin, the president's assistant for national security, added  that these steps might even be taken today. He described press  speculation that this would include a TV address as being close  to the truth.</p>

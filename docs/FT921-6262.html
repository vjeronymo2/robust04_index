			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Repsol improves by 4% in an uncertain market REPSOL, Spain's state-controlled energy group, lifted its post-tax profits last year by 4 per cent to Pta70.1bn (Dollars 680m) after setting aside Pta12.6bn for items such as early retirements and plant closures. The company said that the results were good in the light of its decision to adopt a prudent accounting criteria. This decision was in response to an uncertain international oil market, the difficulties of the chemical industry and the development of a liberalised energy market in Spain. Operating income for 1991 increased by 16 per cent to Pta129bn, despite sharply decreased earnings from the group's chemical interests where income dropped by Pta24bn in 1990 to Pta1.2bn last year. The company's policy is to pay out dividends of not less than 40 per cent of profits and not more than 50 per cent. It paid out 42 per cent of its 1990 profits, returning Pta95 per share. It has already paid an interim dividend on 1991 of Pta44 and the final payout is likely to be decided by Repsol board in April.</p>

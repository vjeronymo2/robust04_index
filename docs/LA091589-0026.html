			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MORE STUDY ON REVITALIZATION PLAN ORDERED  </P> <P> Skeptical of whether a plan to revitalize downtown Granada Hills would work,  the Los Angeles Planning Commission sent the proposal back to city planners  Thursday for more study.  </P> <P> The plan calls for Spanish colonial-style architecture and numerous other  landscaping and building-design standards for new development on portions of  Chatsworth Street, Balboa Boulevard and four other commercial areas in Granada  Hills.  </P> <P> But planning commissioners questioned whether the cost of meeting those  standards will cause developers to shy away from investing in the Granada Hills  business district, which is one of several in the San Fernando Valley that has  lost shoppers to enclosed malls in the past 20 years.  </P> <P> The business district "is in need of economic revitalization," commission Vice  President Theodore Stein Jr. said. "But there are so many hoops to jump through  on this, I just don't think it's realistic."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Not Santa Barbara'  </P> <P> Commissioner Fernando Torres-Gil said: "It became clear to me that this is not  going to work. That part of the Valley is not Santa Barbara. It's not Palm  Springs."  </P> <P> The plan design and landscaping standards are part of an attempt to make the  business district a pedestrian-oriented shopping promenade. Similar plans have  been proposed for other aging commercial strips in the Valley, such as  Devonshire Street in Chatsworth, Sherman Way in Reseda and Van Nuys Boulevard  in Van Nuys.  </P> <P> Like the others, the Granada Hills plan would ban establishment of a variety of  new businesses, such as thrift stores, pawnshops and those relating to  automobiles.  </P> <P> The effect of the plan might not be seen for as many as 20 years, city planner  Gordon Hamilton cautioned.  </P> <P> "It's not going to happen overnight," said John Ciccarelli, a past president of  the Granada Hills Chamber of Commerce and chairman of a citizens committee that  helped formulate the plan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Investigation  </P> <P> But the Planning Commission elicited an admission from Hamilton that city  planners had not investigated whether the costs of the plan's building  standards for new commercial and multifamily residential developments might  discourage even long-term investment.  </P> <P> Hamilton conceded that the Planning Department had not estimated the costs of  many of the plan's standards, such as one that requires that the second floors  of new apartment buildings be set back 10 feet from the first floors.  </P> <P> In fact, the plan heard by the commission Thursday was less ambitious than it  was when first proposed earlier this year. The earlier proposal called for  parking lots adjacent to single-family homes on the fringe of the business  district, but planners eliminated that provision after residents protested at a  public hearing in March.  </P> <P> The Planning Commission is scheduled to consider the Granada Hills plan again  in November.  </P></p>

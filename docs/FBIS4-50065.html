			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- Taiwan will lower tariff  rates on 244 agricultural items, including vegetables and  fruits, as part of its bid to join the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade, the Council of Agriculture (COA) said Friday  [13 May].    This is the first time Taiwan has decided to cut tariff  rates  on fresh fruits and vegetables, including those which are  produced in Taiwan, the council said.    After the adjustment, the average nominal tariff rate for  agricultural products will drop to 20.8 percent from the current  21.6 percent. The adjustment will take effect after being  approved by the Legislative Yuan, the council said.    To minimize the impact on local farmers, COA Vice Chairman  Lin Shiang-nung said, the tariff cuts will affect items which  Taiwan does not produce or over which Taiwan boasts a strong  competitive edge.    Lin said tariff rates for veterinary medicines, pesticides,  fertilizers, feed, farm machinery and raw materials will be  lowered by greater ranges with a view to helping local farmers  and food processors cut production costs.    Tariff rates for some vegetables and fruits, including  onion,  potato, celery, cauliflower, strawberry, kiwi, lemon, orange and  grapefruit will be reduced by 2-10 percent. "The adjustment  ranges vary with their `sensitivity' or domestic production  quantities," Lin said.    Customs duty rates for beef, lamb, cod, lobster, small  shrimp, dry shark's fin and salmon will be cut by 5 to 10  percent, and those for various kinds of fruit juice will be  lowered by 5 percent.    The proposed tariff reductions are part of draft amendments  to the country's current tariff regulations passed by the  Executive Yuan Thursday.    The draft amendments propose tariff cuts on a total of 758  industrial and agricultural products. Industrial products  subject to tariff reductions include large refrigerators,  washing machines, typewriters, data processors, fax machines,  cellular phones, walkie-talkies, and videotape recorders.    The draft amendments will soon be sent to the legislature  for  deliberation and approval. If all the proposed tariff  reductions are approved, finance officials said, Taiwan's  average nominal tariff rate will decline to 8.64 percent from  the present 8.89 percent, while the real average tariff rate  will fall to a mere 4.69 percent.    The tariff cuts will cost the national coffers an estimated  NT [New Taiwan] $2.5 billion annually in tariff revenues, the  officials said. The government previoulsy proposed sweeping  tariff cuts in 1990, with the adjustments taking effect in 1992.</p>

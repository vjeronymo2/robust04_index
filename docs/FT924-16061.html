			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Survey of The New Towns of Britain (2): The going gets tough  -The agency which sells new town assets THE COMMISSION for New Towns is moving into perhaps the most challenging period of its finite life. The agency was set up 30 years ago to sell off the assets left behind by England's new town development corporations. While it fulfilled its government remit well during the 1980s - helped for most of the period by a booming property market which devoured land and buildings and boosted values  -the commission faces a much tougher task in the next 10 years. Once regarded as an over-bureaucratic, unprofessional and unresponsive government agency, the commission has taken pride over the last decade in rebuilding itself into a commercially-oriented 'street-wise' organisation. By this year, it had sold assets worth nearly Pounds 2bn, peaking in 1990 at around Pounds 300m. But it still holds assets of an equal value and has to dispose of them in a climate which is likely to be far less accommodating than the 1980s. The commission's commercial credentials are about to be put through their hardest test. The property markets around which the organisation's activities revolve remain flat on their back. Yet the commission is still obliged to meet government-imposed asset realisation targets - now largely involving land rather than bricks and mortar - on a scale which will test its commercial expertise to the full. The targets, after long discussions with the Department of the Environment held in the shadow of the Treasury, have in the last three years been revised downwards to take account of the economic climate. But they remain tough to meet. The commission says that the DoE has been understanding about the impact on its activities of the worst recession since the war but it is less complimentary towards the Treasury, which demands its annual contributions to the exchequer from new town asset disposals. According to Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman since 1981, 'it is questionable whether the Treasury really understands markets at all, especially the property market. It has failed to appreciate our problems and tried to insist on impossible targets.' Sir Neil says that, for three years, the commission has been fighting against targets so unrealistic that staff morale would have been hammered if they had been accepted. 'You would demotivate staff and create despondency and contempt', he adds. The commission has, as a result, been forced to amend its corporate plan and to persuade the DoE to accept lower target figures. Even so, it has been touch and go: 'We have had to work extremely hard in a terrible market, almost getting to the last week of the financial year before we were sure we would reach the target', Sir Neil says. With the current year half completed, the commission expresses confidence about meeting this year's revised figure, though not without another struggle. The expectation is that 1992 will generate sale income of between one half and two-thirds of the 1990 peak. Despite the pressures on it to perform on asset sales, the commission is statutorily obliged to strike deals at the best price reasonably obtainable. According to Mr John Walker, the general manager: 'It is a difficult balance. In the end, we have to make a judgment about selling now or waiting, while trying to disengage from new town assets as quickly as we can.' Beyond meeting asset disposal targets, the commission's task has recently been significantly amplified with the transfer into its control of Telford and Milton Keynes, the last English new town development corporation to be wound up. Their inclusion has added huge tracts of additional land to the organisation's portfolio and handed it a development role which in other towns had been steadily dwindling. In Milton Keynes alone, the commission has assumed responsibility for 2,000 acres of housing and commercial land carrying planning permission. Around one-third of the town remains to be developed, implying the creation of more than 40,000 jobs and around 20,000 houses  - a challenge equal to developing from scratch a new town the size of Harlow. In Telford, a similar acreage of land is also awaiting customers. 'The chances of selling housing land in Telford in the next couple of years seem pretty remote. That's the sort of challenge we now face', says Sir Neil. In response to the challenge, the commission is gearing up the biggest marketing and promotion initiative in its history. Historically, it has been successful in competing against the myriad inward investment organisations for its share of newcomers - more than 1,000 overseas companies are located in the new towns. Armed with a Pounds 2.5m budget, the commission is planning a big promotional push in the Far East and the US, where it has already established agents to help get its message across to local business communities. It believes that it has an edge on some of its British competitors: 'We can offer 21 locations right across the country. We actually own the land and buildings we promote and can offer people the prospect of setting up without any delay,' Sir Neil emphasises. As at home, however, the success of the commission's global efforts will largely depend on a prevailing economic climate beyond its control. While the prospects of a cheaper pound may enhance Britain's status as Europe's most attractive inward investment location, the spectre of higher inflation could act as a counter-balance. If the commission does its job well it could be left with a rump of unwanted assets sometime after the turn of the century. Whatever remains could then be auctioned off by government to the highest bidders. As for the commission, its useful life should then be over. But not necessarily. As the most successful disposal agency in the public sector, it could still be given a new lease of life to oversee the orderly disposal of any other public property assets which a government wanted returned to the private sector. Those held by the present urban development corporations might be a candidate.</p>

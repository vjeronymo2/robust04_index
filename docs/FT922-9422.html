			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Trafalgar House halves dividend TRAFALGAR House, the property, construction and engineering group, halved its dividend as pre-tax profits for the six months to March 31 increased 18 per cent on the back of a strong performance from construction and engineering. Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said the group would focus on construction and engineering which had an order book of almost Pounds 4bn as he unveiled pre-tax profits of Pounds 54m compared with Pounds 45.5m. Turnover increased from Pounds 1.5bn to Pounds 2.1bn. Sir Eric said the cut in the interim dividend, from 8.8p to 4.4p, which was signalled last year, would help mitigate its problems over unrelieved advance corporation tax. He added the group still needed another UK business to get rid of the problem once and for all. Trafalgar had further bad news for former shareholders in Davy Corporation, which the group took over last June. Although the group hopes to lease the Ocean Emerald oil rig to Midland and Scottish Resources for about Pounds 20m it held out little hope of Davy's former shareholders receiving the second payment, totalling Pounds 54m or 45p a share. This is because in Trafalgar's view MSR is still unlikely to be able to draw upon the Pounds 118m letter of credit with the project's bankers. Without the letter of credit Trafalgar House says it cannot make the second payment to the Davy shareholders. Operating profits from property and investment and shipping and hotels continued to fall. The former reported profits of Pounds 6.6m, compared with Pounds 19m, while the latter suffered a smaller profit fall to Pounds 5.9m from Pounds 7.6m. Sir Eric said property continued to experience depressed conditions, although the removal of political uncertainty and lower interest rates gave some prospect of a gradual UK recovery. Occupancy levels still remained disappointing at between 50 per cent and 60 per cent. Construction and engineering increased profits by 39 per cent to Pounds 53.3m. Sir Eric said the group would focus on these core businesses. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 450m to Pounds 328m, although debt increased since the year-end total of Pounds 182m. Fully diluted earnings per share before extraordinary items fell to 4.8p from 5.9p. Lex, Page 24 Observer, Page 23</p>

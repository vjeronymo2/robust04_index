			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Arts: Rousing tales - Radio IN LAST week's Feedback, Chris Dunkley was told that Radio 4's Book at Bedtime could be so stirring that some people could be kept awake. Listeners were so aroused by, say, John Hadfield's Love on a Branch Line that they could not drop off. Now Radio 3 offers daily Sleepless Nights. Someone - this week, pianist David Owen Norris - recalls hard moments from their life  -perhaps tiresome, but hardly liable to induce insomnia. Yet for safety's sake, it is scheduled at 9.55 pm. I have no time for those who hear a programme through and then complain of it. If Lawrence Scott's Witchbroom at bedtime next week is disturbing, choices are to switch off, find another station, or (for me), keep Radio 4 on till eleven for Two Way Cut, a Scots police serial that began on Thursday with a gruesome death. If you expect a disturbed night, have it properly disturbed. Radio 3's Marlowe this week was Edward II, with able straightforward direction by Clive Brill - a few cuts, some scenes moved to underscore the order of events, lines read with intelligence if not much devotion to character. For the National in 1968 Olivier preferred a version by Brecht; few of us went along with that. The plot tells of the peers' revolt against gay King Edward II (Robert Glennister) for frolicking with his boyfriend Gaveston (Robert Patterson) instead of ruling his country. Chief unruly peer is Young Mortimer (Steve Hodson), whom the King suspects of loving his Queen, Isabelle (Adjoa Andon)  -though she, in fact, stays so loyal to her husband that when their son 15-year-old Edward III succeeds (Monty Allen, rather good), he has to send her to the Tower. Gaveston, captured by Mortimer and executed, is replaced in the King's affection by Young Spenser, no luckier. The rebel lords win and Edward is murdered in the horrible way we know about: Clive Brill gave us a long scream, horrible enough. The play is reckoned an influence in Shakespeare's Richard II. Shakespeare never heard Brecht, nor Colin Haydn Evans. Evans's play Gaveston (Radio 4, Monday) has a new idea about Gaveston. Marlowe's lot make him 'a Frenchman'; Brecht, an Irish butcher's son; Evans reverts to France - the son of Arnaud de Gaveston. A secret faith infects 14th-century Britain, holding that top folk are to be sacrificed for the people's good, as in the case of Jesus. Lancaster, Warwick and the Archbishop of Winchester belong to this cult, and Gaveston, exiled by the King, is chosen to enact their 'Calvary'. He is ritually slain on a northern hillside on Midsummer Day, his robed executioner one Robin of Barneside, known as Robin of the Hood. I didn't believe a word of it. No 'mighty lines', either. I caught all I could of Test Match Special on Radio 5 and Radio 3, and fairly exciting it was, thanks to the players more than the commentators. Yet I thought the scenes after the game's end, with sponsors' cheques, champagne moments, and men of the match, were unendurably squalid. This is not cricket, not as I grew up with it.</p>

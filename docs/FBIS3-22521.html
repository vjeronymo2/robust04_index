The coordinator of the United Nations System and  representative of the aforementioned program, Pierre Den Baas,  presented the modern microscopes, which carry a price tag of  $7,600. The Health Ministry's National Tuberculosis Program will  use them in the departments of Cajamarca, Cuzco, Puno, and Lima.  <H5>  Diagnosis and Treatment Guaranteed </H5>   Freundt-Thurne indicated that his ministry intends to  continue reducing the number of tuberculosis patients by 2 to 3  percent a year.    "The Health Ministry is in a position to guarantee both  diagnosis and treatment of all patients," he noted.    He underscored the major gains that have been made in the  battle against this disease in light of economic conditions in  the country.  <H5>  Cholera Prevention Campaign </H5>   As for the measures that the Health Ministry will take to  prevent massive numbers of cholera cases, the minister reported  that a series of publicity spots would soon be broadcast to  remind people about how to prevent the disease.    "The mass media can do a great deal by urging people to wash  their hands, boil drinking water, and cook foods thoroughly," he  said.</p>

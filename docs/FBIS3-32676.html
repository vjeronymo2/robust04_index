Cristiani said:  "We believe the judge should find Major Ismael Lopez, or  whomever he represented, guilty."    Lopez, who was transferred to the headquarters of the U.S.  Southern Command in Panama, is accused of shooting to death his  bodyguard, Jose Crescencio Diaz, when they were returning from a  party in Cabanas Department.    The body of Diaz was found in a U.S. Embassy vehicle on the  outskirts of Soyapango, a densely populated city east of San  Salvador. Lopez is to be tried by a U.S. military court, U.S.  embassy spokesmen said in San Salvador.    Cristiani indicated he asked the United States to let the  Salvadoran Office of the Prosecutor General participate in the  Lopez trial. "We want a representative of the Office of the  Prosecutor General to be present during the trial of Maj. Lopez,  but we have not received an affirmative or negative response,"  he stated.    The Office of the Prosecutor General indicated Maj. Lopez  killed bodyguard Diaz since the shot was fired from the back  seat of the vehicle in which they were riding, according to the  only eyewitness. Special prosecutor Ricardo Larreynaga made that  statement after hearing the eight-hour testimony given by the  only two witnesses at the Sensuntepeque lower court. The  witnesses are Israel Vasquez, Maj. Lopez' driver who was in the  vehicle the day of the murder, and Miguel Tomas Nerio, who  received the embassy vehicle with the body in it. The special  prosecutor explained Vasquez did not see when the shot was fired  but that it must have been fired from the back seat and not from  outside because it was an armored vehicle.    This testimony made it clear how the incident took place and  who did the firing, Larreynaga indicated. Although the  eyewitness did not identify the person who pulled the trigger,  "it is truly valid now to say that the major was the one who did  the shooting." The records show the Criminal Investigation  Division of the National Civilian Police conducted a paraffin  test on Vasquez and Lopez hours after the incident, but the  results of both tests were negative.</p>

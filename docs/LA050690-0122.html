			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. MARINE SLAIN NEAR BASE IN PHILIPPINES  </P> <P> A suspected Communist gunman shot and killed a U.S. Marine sergeant outside the  American-run Subic Bay naval complex, prompting officials Saturday to restrict  travel by all U.S. military personnel in the Philippines as a precaution.  </P> <P> The U.S. Navy identified the slain American as Gunnery Sgt. John S. Fredette,  34, of Buena Park, Calif.  </P> <P> He was attached to the 323rd Marine Fighter Squadron based in El Toro, Calif.,  and was on temporary duty at Subic.  </P> <P> Philippine police said Fredette was killed by a single bullet in the back of  his head while he was walking at 11:30 p.m. Friday in the liberty city of  Olongapo, 50 miles northwest of Manila.  </P> <P> In Manila, U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt "expressed shock and sorrow at the  cowardly murder" of Fredette, an embassy statement said. It said U.S. officials  were in touch with Philippine authorities regarding the investigation of the  case.  </P> <P> No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but police suspected  Communist guerrillas. Fredette would be the ninth U.S. victim of a rebel terror  strike since October, 1987 and the first in Olongapo.  </P> <P> Navy Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukree said off-base travel for the 40,000 military and  Defense Department employees and their dependents was restricted after the  shooting.  </P> <P> Mukree said Fredette was shot by "an unknown assailant" and refused to  elaborate. But Philippine police officials believed the Communist New People's  Army was behind the killing.  </P> <P> The attack came nine days before the start of exploratory talks on the future  of six U.S. facilities in the Philippines, including the giant Clark Air Base  and the Subic Bay Naval Base. The leases expire next year, and there is  considerable sentiment in the Philippines not to renew them.  </P> <P> Eight Americans have been killed in the Philippines since October, 1987, in  attacks blamed on Communist guerrillas.  </P></p>

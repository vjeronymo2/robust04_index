			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINANCIAL MARKETS;  </P> <P> STOCKS;  </P> <P> JOBS REPORT BOOSTS MARKET; DOW UP 10.66  </P> <P> The stock market closed higher Friday as weak employment data fired up hopes  for lower interest rates.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials rose 10.66 to 2,731.44, winding up the  week with a net loss of 16.21 points.  </P> <P> Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of  New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 813 up, 646 down and 525 unchanged.  </P> <P> The Labor Department reported Friday morning that the civilian unemployment  rate increased 0.1 percentage point to 5.4% in November.  </P> <P> The figures showed a gain of 210,000 in non-farm payroll employment, after an  October increase in jobs that was revised sharply downward to 93,000.  </P> <P> Analysts said that painted a picture of continued softness in some major  sectors of the economy, apparently improving the chances for further moves by  the Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy in the weeks ahead.  </P> <P> Gainers among the blue chips included Coca-Cola, up 1 1/8 at 78; Du Pont, up  1/8 at 120 7/8; Exxon, up 3/8 at 49; Sears Roebuck, up 3/8 at 38, and Chrysler,  up 1/2 at 19 3/8.  </P> <P> Pfizer, which projected slightly lower earnings for the fourth quarter, tumbled  4 3/8 to 69 1/8.  </P> <P> Tonka Corp. lost 2 1/2 to 11 1/4. The company lowered its revenue estimate for  the year, citing slower-than-expected sales during the holiday season.  </P> <P> That prompted selling as well in the shares of Toys R Us, which was down 1 3/4  at 35 3/4.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, several stocks that had run up dramatic gains earlier in the year  came under pressure.  </P> <P> Federal National Mortgage led the active list, down 2 at 34 5/8, and Federal  Home Loan Mortgage fell 3 1/2 to 72 5/8. Brokers said the stocks have suffered  lately from concern about the outlook for real estate credit.  </P> <P> L.A. Gear slumped 3 3/8 to 30 3/8. A Wall Street Journal article said the  footwear manufacturer faced the "perils of shifting fads."  </P> <P> Big Board volume totaled 144.91 million shares, down from 161.98 million in the  previous session.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, a technical correction and some early index-linked selling dragged  share prices lower Friday, giving pause to an almost uninterrupted four-week  rally. The Nikkei 225-share index dropped 134.05 points to 37,724.06, reversing  its 203.82-point gain on Thursday.  </P> <P> In London, stocks closed higher on buying for a long three-week account, which  starts Monday. The Financial Times 100-share index ended up 16.8 points at  2,363.5.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CREDIT  </P> <P> Bond Prices Rally in Response to Data  </P> <P> In the credit markets, the unemployment report sparked a rally in government  bond prices, sending interest rates lower.  </P> <P> The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond jumped 7/16 point, or $4.37 for  every $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which falls when its price rises,  tumbled to 7.88% from 7.92% late Thursday.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 8.438%, unchanged from late Thursday.  </P> <P> The downward revision in payroll growth in October cheered bond traders.  </P> <P> Traders have been hoping for evidence of sluggish economic activity.  </P> <P> "The data were viewed as constructive for the bond market," said William  Sullivan, director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.  </P> <P> Each new indication of economic weakness improves the chances that the Federal  Reserve will try to stimulate growth by pushing interest rates lower, analysts  say. Lower rates tend to boost bond prices.  </P> <P> CURRENCY  </P> <P> Dollar Edges Down; Gold Makes Gains  </P> <P> The dollar ended marginally weaker against most key currencies after the  government released the unemployment report.  </P> <P> Gold rose in domestic trading following a big advance overseas.  </P> <P> On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed  at $411.80 an ounce, up $1.80 from late Thursday. Republic National Bank in New  York quoted a late bid for gold at $411.50 an ounce, up $1.90.  </P> <P> Currency dealers said the November unemployment data did little to move the  dollar because it was within market expectations.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  ended at 144.27 Japanese yen, up 0.14 yen from Thursday's close. It traded at  144.20 yen in London, and 144.300 yen in New York, down from 144.305.  </P> <P> The dollar declined against the British pound. Sterling traded at $1.5793 in  London, up from $1.5750 Thursday, and at $1.5825 in New York, up from $1.5780.  </P> <P> COMMODITIES  </P> <P> Pork Futures Plunge as Export Sales Lag  </P> <P> Pork belly futures prices plunged on the Chicago Board of Trade as concern over  lagging export sales prompted traders to bail out of the weak market. Livestock  futures also were lower.  </P> <P> On other commodity markets, cotton continued to lose ground, grain and soybeans  were mixed, precious metals gained and energy futures were mostly higher.  </P> <P> Live cattle settled 0.07 to 0.47 cent lower, with the contract for delivery in  December at 75.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were 0.03 to 0.18 cent lower,  with January at 82.77 cents a pound; hogs were 0.30 cent to 1.18 cents lower,  with December at 50.82 cents a pound, and frozen pork bellies were 1.85 to 2  cents lower, with February at 52.45 cents a pound.  </P> <P> Tables begin on D5  </P></p>

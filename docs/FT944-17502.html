			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kmart warns of fall in quarterly earnings Shares in Kmart, the troubled US discount store group, fell Dollars 3/8 to close at Dollars 16 7/8 in New York yesterday after the company warned that it expected to report a fall in earnings for its third quarter, ending in October. If the prediction were fulfilled, it would be the eighth consecutive quarter in which the company's profits have declined. Kmart said the main reason for the downturn was weakness in clothing sales. This was caused by unseasonably warm weather in the last three weeks of September, which had compared with cooler-than-normal temperatures in the same period a year earlier. The company said the result had been to limit comparable store sales increases in the US to 1.5 per cent in September. A year earlier it reported a 7.2 per cent increase in same-store sales in the US, producing net income of Dollars 94m, or 20 cents a share. Kmart said a weakness in margins on hardline goods would also hit third-quarter profits. This was caused by a shift in the sales mix towards promotional items. The extent of the decline in profits would be influenced significantly by sales trends and the sales mix this month, which should be more favourable than in September, Kmart added. Last month the company announced it was closing 110 of its discount stores, with the loss of 6,000 jobs, in an attempt to arrest its decline.</p>

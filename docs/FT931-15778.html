			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / Japan covets lead role in Asia: 'Miyazawa's doctrine' will set out a change in regional emphasis for his country Our rise can be likened to that of a person who opens a tiny shop, works relentlessly to increase profits and save money and, one day, looks around to find that the shop is one of the biggest in the neighbourhood. We can no longer simply think only of ourselves - Professor Shinkichi Eto, president of Asia University, Tokyo. When Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, touches down in Thailand on Friday as part of a four-nation tour of south-east Asia, he will deliver a speech billed by his government as an important postwar review of the country's role in Asia. It is already being dubbed the 'Miyazawa doctrine'. Mr Miyazawa will show due deference to the US, stressing the strategic importance of its security role. But, between the lines, the speech will suggest that Asians should settle their own disputes and that Japan will gradually move closer to centre stage. His visit to Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Thailand comes as the Japanese recognise that the political and economic sands are shifting. On the eve of a new US presidency, which Tokyo expects will be inward-looking, and with Asian nations debating how they should solve regional security issues, the Japanese government senses an opportunity to reform its small-shopkeeper mentality. Japan's bilateral ties in Asia are as complex as the individual nations are diverse. The relationship with China is haunted by history and a sense of inferiority, while links with south-east Asia are coloured by Japan's wartime brutality. However, Tokyo feels that the time has come to develop an 'Asia policy', with principles as relevant to South Korea as to Burma. Mr Miyazawa's tour will not finalise that policy, but marks an important step along the way. Japan's Asia policy cannot be considered without reference to the US. In the postwar period, the US has been Japan's largest market by far, and maintaining stable relations was the first priority for a country with an export-driven economy. Bowing to the US lead on foreign policy and defence issues allowed the Japanese government to concentrate on civilian development and avoid awkward foreign-policy decisions. Differences have emerged between US and Japanese interests. Japan has seen the period since the June 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square as an opportunity to improve relations with China, while other countries, including the US, were treating it coolly. Japanese business sees Vietnam as an ideal location for low-cost, offshore production facilities, and Tokyo recently resumed aid to Hanoi, while the US maintains its embargo on business with Vietnam. Japan is increasingly reliant on trade in Asian markets. They account for 41 per cent of its total trade, while north America accounts for 30 per cent; five years ago, both regions had 35 per cent. The government is concerned that the North American Free Trade Agreement, encompassing the US, Canada and Mexico, may become a trade bloc, prompting more serious thought in Asia about the need for a regional free-trade area. While Japan is concerned about a North American trade bloc, some US Congress representatives have complained of a 'yen bloc' in Asia. Research by Bank of Tokyo found a 50 per cent rise in the proportion of yen-denominated imports over the past five years, 'attributable not only to a relative decline in trading transactions with the US, but also to a relative increase in trade with east and south-east Asia, where the share of yen-denominated transactions has traditionally been high'. The Japanese government has not wanted to offend the US or China, or other leading trading partners. But the larger Tokyo's political profile, the more it is likely to draw criticism from countries apprehensive about an expanded role. A flurry of recent government reports - though they lack detail on politically sensitive initiatives - suggests there is agreement in Tokyo that Japan should take a political stand. 'As the Asia-Pacific region gains further influence and moves towards becoming an open, pluralistic region with a central role in the global community, the Japanese people must assume a heavy responsibility,' says a prime ministerial advisory panel in Japan and the Asia-Pacific Region in the 21st Century, published last month. The report, which forms the core of the 'Miyazawa doctrine', says that, in economic terms, Asia will be the 'world's brightest spot over the next century'. For Japan, the region is already the bright spot amid the gloom of international recession. A survey by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry shows the average return on sales for Japanese manufacturing projects in Asia is 5 per cent, compared with 3.2 per cent in Europe and - 0.9 per cent in the US. Japanese direct investment overseas fell 27 per cent last fiscal year and a further 12 per cent in the first half this year, but investment in China will double this year, and has risen in Indonesia and Vietnam. Though Japanese electronics makers have had a difficult three years at home and in the US and Europe, annual growth in demand for televisions in Asia was 10.1 per cent over the past five years, for VCRs 21 per cent, and for motor vehicles 26 per cent, according to Mitsubishi Bank. Japan, frustrated at being perceived as just a car salesman, has already been seeking to expand its international role, especially in Asia. Foreign bilateral aid spending was increased 69 per cent over the five years to 1991. East Asia received 47 per cent of the money. Tokyo is likewise keen to play a leading role in the international debate on the environment. It is also accumulating a small list of Asian policy successes. It is the principal contributor to funding for the UN operation in Cambodia, and its dispatch - after agonising debate in Japan - of peace-keeping personnel to Cambodia has generally been perceived, at home and abroad, as a useful contribution. However, the most difficult challenges in developing an all-encompassing Asia policy will be in responding to issues such as the rapidly developing sophistication of Chinese military hardware. It will also mean finding a security role which respects the concerns of countries that suffered under the Japanese military, but which allows Japan to play a part in solving regional disputes such as that over the Spratly Islands - atolls in the South China Sea claimed by China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei and Taiwan. A serious obstacle to developing such a coherent policy is the decayed state of the Japanese political system. A report on Japan's priorities for 1993 by the Keidanren, the Japanese industry federation, said that political reform will be at the centre of any serious changes in social or foreign policy. According to the 21st Century report, Japan must build a 'mature democratic government', meaning that the political system should be more responsive to foreign policy challenges and less obsessed by factional fights within the ruling Liberal Democratic party. That will also mean elaborating a more coherent framework for Japan's foreign relations. Neither the bureaucracy, which is crucial to the policy process, nor the LDP has articulated principles on democracy in Asia, for example. The military regime in Burma is still receiving aid. And when Mr Chris Patten, the Hong Kong governor, explained his democracy proposals to Mr Miyazawa, the prime minister said 'I understand', preferring not to give an opinion. Officially, such statements are justified as respect for 'the diverse routes' to democracy. The need for more durable principles was stressed in another officially sponsored report, intended to be the cornerstone of a redefined US-Japan relationship. Prepared by select executives and academics, the report says Japan must clearly explain its vision 'on which it must take action as a responsible great power, not passively responding to external pressure from the US or any other foreign nation'. If the small shopkeeper does begin to behave as a 'great power', the challenge to redefine perceptions and policies will be as great for Japan's partners as it is now for Japan itself.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mexican rising lifts silver Armed conflict in Mexico, the world's biggest producer of newly-mined silver, helped precious metals start the new year with a price surge, traders said yesterday. Mexico produces about 19 per cent of the world's primary silver. Price rises, which started in New York on Monday with silver leading the way, spilled over to trading in the Far East and London yesterday. The first 'fix' on the first trading day of the new year in London resulted in gold going to Dollars 395 a troy ounce, its highest level for five months. After some profit-taking, gold closed in London up Dollars 3.50 at Dollars 394.25 an ounce, silver was 12 cents an ounce ahead at Dollars 5.235 and platinum ended the day at Dollars 398 an ounce, up Dollars 4.50. Reuter reported from Germany that Commerzbank had suggested gold's price, driven by technical factors, would be volatile this year, but would range between Dollars 360 and Dollars 380. Any higher price would spark bullion sales. However, DG Bank predicted short-term rises up to Dollars 420, which could bring in more buyers and take gold up to Dollars 500.</p>

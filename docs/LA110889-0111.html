			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN APOLOGIZES TO HOLLYWOOD FOR REMARK BUT NOT FOR HIS $2-MILLION FEE  </P> <P> Ronald Reagan apologized to Hollywood on Tuesday for saying recently that the  American entertainment industry should look to Japan to bring back "decency and  good taste" to American films -- but not for accepting a $2-million fee from  Fujisankei Communications Corp. for making a trip to Japan.  </P> <P> At the best-attended luncheon in the 42-year history of the Hollywood Radio and  Television Society, the former President told an audience of Hollywood's most  prominent entertainment executives that "what a person says in one country is  often misinterpreted in another" and spurred applause by saying: "I apologize  to anyone who may have taken offense."  </P> <P> During his visit to Japan late last month, Reagan drew criticism from American  government officials for defending Sony Corp.'s recent purchase of Columbia  Pictures, saying in a taped interview that he was "not too proud of Hollywood  these days" because of immorality and vulgarity in its movies, adding that  Hollywood "needs some outsiders" to correct the problem.  </P> <P> In his opening remarks Tuesday at the Beverly Wilshire, a sheepish Reagan joked  that he was late because he was delayed at the dentist having "the last piece  of shoe leather that I acquired in Japan" removed from his teeth. He added that  the day's lunch menu for him consisted of "crow souffle followed by humble  pie."  </P> <P> Reagan went on to offer lavish praise for Hollywood's new crop of "family"  films, as well as its efforts to avoid glorifying drug use on the screen. He  cited the flow of information into Communist countries as "the best and perhaps  the only hope" for spurring social reform. "You are truly great communicators,"  he said.  </P> <P> In a question-and-answer session, Reagan denied that his praise of Sony's  Columbia takeover was spurred by his ongoing negotiations with the corporation  for a $1-million donation for video equipment for his presidential library.  </P> <P> Reagan also denied that his remarks praising Sony and the Japanese film  industry represented a "paid endorsement" for Japan because of the $2 million  he accepted from Fujisankei and the money his library may receive from Sony.  </P> <P> "Sony had nothing to do with my invitation to Japan," Reagan said, adding that  the Japanese government and "another industry" were responsible for the  invitation. Reagan also denied that the $2 million from Fujisankei influenced  his remarks.  </P> <P> Reagan chose to make light of the Fujisankei situation. "It is true, that  (figure) was offered, and I didn't protest," he said, adding jokingly: "And I  knew there was an actor in Hollywood who got $3 million for doing a Toyota  commercial.  </P> <P> "Theirs (Japan's) is a society I don't think we can understand. It costs $1  million to join a country club, $200 for a cab ride to the airport. They have a  different set of (monetary standards) there than we have here. But I was happy  at the same time that I was able to carry on what I had been doing in office,  which was to bring about the elimination of the last few restrictions on free  trade between our two countries."  </P> <P> Added Reagan, grinning: "I just thought that, for 16 years, I hadn't made any  kind of money. . . ."  </P></p>

Shortly after this bloody tragedy,  U.S. President Clinton invited 'Arafat to Washington to hold  talks with the Zionist regime led by Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin on ways of solving implementation problems of the  Gaza-Jericho accord. 'Arafat hastily accepted this invitation.  However, the united and angry response of the Palestine people  in the face of the Zionist regime's horrific crime and its  repercussions in the entire Arab and Islamic world pushed  'Arafat into a corner and he excused himself. [passage omitted]    It is quite natural that under the existing explosive  situation in Palestinian society no one dares hold talks with  the Zionist regime under the name of the Palestinian people.  'Arafat's decision to call off the talks at this stage is in  fact a message to those responsible for the massacre of the  innocent people that they should not worry as the talks will  resume as soon as the circumstances change and the Palestinians  calm down. Whereas the Palestinians in the occupied territories  and the people of neighboring countries including Egypt, Jordan,  and Lebanon have staged rallies and protest marches to demand  the ultimate cancellation of the talks. No doubt the adoption  of a conciliatory approach on the talks with the Zionist regime  -- at a time when there are clear signs that the Zionist regime  was directly involved in the massacre of the worshippers in the  Ibrahim mosque -- is a step to win the support of the Zionist  regime and the White House statesmen. Such an approach  definitely seeks to serve the interests of the Zionist regime  and the White House. The Palestinians demand something  different and have announced this demand explicitly.</p>

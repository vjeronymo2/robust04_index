			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Travel Focus - Golfing Holidays: The buzz of Madeira IT MUST be off-putting when standing over a nasty 5ft downhill putt for par on a fast-paced green to hear a yelp and look up to see a Yorkshire terrier ascending skywards in the talons of a large bird of prey. But this happened to a lady member of the Madeira Golf and Country Club at Santo da Serra, the first golf course on the Portuguese-owned island, which opened in 1991. Chipping on to the green, she tied her pet to a tree and the bird swooped. Buzzards have been on Madeira for centuries, but golfers are a fairly new species. Madeira is 350 miles south-west of Lisbon and three hours flying time from London. Golf began there in 1947 when expatriates built a nine-hole course to work off the Malmsey and sweet potatoes and work their way up to their post-round poncha (a concoction of grated lemon, honey sugar cane and white spirit) or nikita (beer, wine and ice cream). For an island supposedly discovered by a shipwrecked Englishman, it was inevitable that the British golfing influence would follow. The nine-hole course of 1947 has now become the yellow Serras course and final loop at the 27-hole, 6,100-metre Santo da Serra club, chosen to host the inaugural Madeiran Open and first event of the 1993 Volvo PGA European Tour. 'We offer year-round golf, not just winter sun,' says marketing director Tony Barton. It is a typical resort course: not too easy, not too hard, And it is very pretty. It is like Woburn-by-the-Sea. Although Madeira boasts a continuous English summer, V-necks are required if you are playing early in the morning at Santo da Serra, because it is 2,500m above sea level and can be pretty nippy. Driving skills are another recommendation. Level ground is not easy to find on Madeira, and Santo da Serra, designed by Robert Trent Jones, is a challenge to high and low handicappers alike, especially the 476m par-five 3rd which calls for a drive over part of the Machico Valley. Opening soon, adjoining the course, will be a 145-room five-star hotel and golf village with 30 luxury villas which can be built according to the owner's design. There will also be a bowls green, a driving range, swimming pool, tennis and squash courts, stables and equestrian centre - even a BMX track. The Woburn-by-the-Sea feel will be reinforced when Madeira's second course opens at Palheiro in September, created by Cabell Robinson around the sub-tropical gardens. Palheiro overlooks Funchal Bay. Reid's Hotel and its lift to the beach can be seen from the 18th green.

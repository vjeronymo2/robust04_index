			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Russia hopes for big IMF pay-out soon THE Russian government and the central bank have agreed ambitious targets to cut credit expansion, inflation and the budget deficit, clearing the way to receive the first half of the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) systematic transformation facility from the International Monetary Fund. The government and the bank said they would retain tight control of credit expansion and attempt to reduce monthly inflation to 9 per cent and the budget deficit to 5 per cent of gross national product by the end of the year. Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister for foreign economic affairs, yesterday said he expected the first Dollars 1.5bn tranche of the facility within a month, and the second tranche in the second half of this year. A further Dollars 4bn should also be paid over in the latter half of 1993, he said, as the largest part of the IMF stand-by loan which is conditional upon Russia getting economic reform back on track. Mr Shokhin hoped the July meeting of the heads of state of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Tokyo would agree a further Dollars 4bn fund, proposed by the US, to assist with the privatisation process. Privatisation of small, medium and large enterprises is proceeding rapidly in Russia, although the newly privatised companies desperately lack capital and management expertise. Mr Anatoly Chubais, deputy prime minister in charge of privatisation, admitted at the weekend that he had been 'very concerned' before the referendum that reform and privatisation would both fail. But since the referendum, all those regions that had refused to sell off state companies through auctions had now agreed to do so. 'By June 1 not one region will stand out against the government's programme,' he said. The price of the privatisation vouchers, which had sunk below Rbs4,000, had risen to Rbs5090, and the federal parliament had given up attempts to stop the privatisation process, he said, 'not because they have become supporters of privatisation, but because they know they would lose support if they tried to stop it'. Mr Chubais also thought further reforms of the Russian cabinet were imminent, with radical officials likely to be promoted in order to encourage reform. However, Mr Shokhin sounded a note of caution on reform when he expressed some scepticism over the agreement between the bank and the government because of the difficulties of controlling credit emission from the central bank under the chairmanship of Mr Victor Gerashchenko. Mr Gerashchenko has recently commented that the agreement to limit credit expansion to 30 per cent in the current quarter and a further 30 per cent in the second half of this year could not succeed. The deputy prime minister also said that Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, is to go to Copenhagen from June 19 to 21 for talks with the leaders of the European Community on a possible agreement between Russia and the EC on what Moscow alleges are discriminatory practices against its products. Mr Georgy Gabunia, the deputy trade minister said that the EC had designated Russia as a state-aided economy in which large subsidies were paid on its goods. However, the Russian side will argue that prices have largely been freed and that it is inconsistent to end discrimination against the Baltic states - whose economies are still substantially state-owned - while retaining them against Russia and other former Soviet republics.</p>

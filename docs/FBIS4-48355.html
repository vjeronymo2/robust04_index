			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The High Court of Malawi today declared that the  mounting of roadblocks at [word indistinct] public highways, as  well as stopping and conducting searches on the travelling  public, is unlawful.    The declaration was made in Blantyre by Justice Duncan  Tambala following an application by the National Consultative  Council [NCC] seeking a court order against government to lift  [word indistinct] road blocks mounted by the police in the  country. Making a submission on behalf of the NCC, Mr. Modakari  Mushiswa said the NCC is concerned over the police mounting of  roadblocks in many parts of the country. Mr. Mushiswa said the  barriers are a concern because they cause difficulties to  travellers who are required to offload their luggage for  inspections, adding that the searches are also descriminatory in  that they are only done to nongovernment persons.

North will record a rap album attacking the Soviet  Union and the National Endowment for the Arts. The witches, associated with the  New York Center for the Strange, forecast shortages of volleyballs, garlic and  chopsticks.  </P> <P> Not only that, Donald Trump will franchise a pizza chain called The Don.  </P> <P> Still Hunting: World War II isn't over for Nazi hunter Beate Klarsfeld. "We are  surrounded by the images of all the children, the faces of these tiny beings,  deported to their atrocious fate," Klarsfeld said recently in Detroit. "They  won't disappear as long as their executioners escape justice." Klarsfeld says  her current target is Adolf Eichmann assistant Alois Brunner.  </P> <P> Butt of Jokes: While cartoonist Garry Trudeau is burning cigarette makers in  his "Doonesbury" strip for shipping free smokes to U.S. troops in the Persian  Gulf, Philip Morris and the USO sent 100,000 packages of food and other  products Monday to troops in the region. The packages contained cassette tapes,  candy, and powdered coffee and soft drinks. Philip Morris says its current  shipments contain no cigarettes.  </P> <P> Is That Clear?: It is normal procedure for highway traffic to be cleared for  Vice President Dan Quayle's motorcade.

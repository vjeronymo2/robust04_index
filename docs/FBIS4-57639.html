			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  Bogota Metro Proposal </H5>   Liberal Party presidential candidate Ernesto Samper,  accompanied by a group of reporters, rode a stretch of the  Bogota intercity train on 22 April as a means of promoting his  proposal to build a metro system in Bogota. Under Samper's  proposal, the metro system would use a large number of the  existing railroad corridors. Samper emphasized that a mass  transit system would do much to improve the quality of life for  Bogota residents, noting that his train ride took only 25  minutes, while by bus the same trip would have taken an hour and  a half. According to his calculations, the metro would begin by  providing 240 million rides per year, reaching the target of 600  million rides annually in less than four years. (EL TIEMPO, 23  April) After his train ride, Samper proceeded to a mass  transportation conference organized by his campaign, with mass  transit officials from other Latin American countries and a  representative from the United Nations. Addressing the seminar,  Samper described previous initiatives to build a metro system as  a "long and sad history of wasted time and effort," and laid the  blame for these failures on former city officials, including  rival Conservative Party candidate and former mayor of Bogota,  Andres Pastrana. After the seminar, Samper held a press  conference to discuss further details of his metro proposal. (EL  ESPECTADOR, 23 April)  <H5>  Campaign "In Deficit" </H5>   Speaking to reporters during the train ride across Bogota,  Samper commented on recent testimony by convicted Colombian drug  trafficker Gabriel Taboada before a U.S. Senate subcommittee.  Taboada had alleged that trafficker influence is widespread in  Colombia and that certain presidential candidates, whom he did  not name, had used narcotics trafficking proceeds to help fund  their campaigns. Samper reportedly said that, if need be,  President Gaviria himself should go to the United States to  defend Colombia's reputation. Samper declared that he had been  very careful about receiving contributions from sources whose  origin was not clear, noting that his campaign is "in deficit"  precisely because it has been "scrupulous about monitoring the  transparency" of contributions. (EL ESPECTADOR, 23 April)  <H5>  Economic Program </H5>   In an interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May), Samper said his  proposed economic program of "social capitalism" acknowledges  the "virtues of private initiative and the operation of  markets," while recognizing their "limitations." It gives the  state a "more definitive" role in the "regulation and  orientation" of measures affecting the economy and social  welfare.    According to Samper:    "The state must promote the democratization of credit and  access to property; limit the concentration [of power] within  the economy, and abuse by those with a dominant position in the  market; and make a deliberate effort to promote competition."    Samper's model holds that economic policy should be guided  by  considerations of "efficiency" as much as of "equity," and that  social policy has "as much importance" as economic policy. For  this reason, says Samper, he has focused on job creation, for  only in this way is it possible to "harmonize growth with a  favorable distribution of income," and to improve the situation  of the "46 percent of Colombian families who live in poverty."    Samper said his model does not view privatization as an  "ideology," but seeks to use private capital to provide broader  access to public services and to improve their quality and  efficiency. He further explained that his model would recognize  the need for intervention to influence the exchange rate, and  for policies to protect producers from unfair competition, and  to protect and subsidize agriculture.    As on past occasions, Samper contrasted his model of "social  capitalism" with Pastrana's model of "savage capitalism." Samper  faulted Pastrana's economic program, which he said would limit  state action to providing only the "most basic" services--those  related to defense, security, justice--and added that Pastrana  advocated a "neutral" economic policy guided only by "efficiency  without taking equity into account." According to Samper,  Pastrana's social policy is essentially that of "picking up the  victims" of the "concentration of economic power" and the  "uncontrolled operation of the market." Pastrana, he said,  "believes blindly in savage privatization without conditions"  and is "concerned with economic figures and not with the  individual." In addition, he said that Pastrana's job creation  program is virtually "nonexistent."  <H5>  Counternarcotics Policy </H5>   In the same interview with EL ESPECTADOR (1 May) Samper said  the country "cannot surrender a single millimeter to criminal  organizations." Samper stated:    "In this internal struggle we will continue the policy of  surrendering to justice which has served to dismantle some of  the criminal organizations, but there is no doubt that more  severe sentences must be imposed and the accumulation of  sentence reductions must be prevented."    Samper spoke forcefully on the role of the international  community in the counternarcotics effort:    "We must do much more to demand responsibility on the part  of  the international community in this struggle, especially in the  control of money laundering, the sale of chemical substances,  and the control of consumption in which the developed countries  do not make a greater effort. I will develop an aggressive  international policy in this regard so that the world finally  understands that Colombia is the main victim and not the  executioner."  <H5>  Agriculture Sector Concerns </H5>   During campaign tours of several municipalities in Huila and  Tolima Departments affected by the agricultural crisis, Samper's  promises to reinvigorate that sector met with enthusiastic  applause, according to EL ESPECTADOR (25 April). Acknowledging  that the agricultural sector has been negatively affected by the  "apertura" (market opening) program, Samper said apertura must  not be a one-way street whereby imports are favored at the  expense of domestic producers. Samper proposed transforming the  Agricultural Credit Bank (Caja Agraria) into "the tool of  assistance of many years ago," so that it would be more  responsive to the needs of farmers. (EL ESPECTADOR, 25 April)  Samper added that his government would ensure that farmers and  ranchers who wish to refinance their credit be allowed to do so.    Speaking to ranchers days later during a campaign visit to  the Atlantic Coast region, Samper reiterated his promise to  provide subsidies for agriculture and to address the problem of  insurgent violence in the countryside. (EL TIEMPO 2 May)  <H5>  "New Conservatism" Backs Samper </H5>   A group calling itself "New Conservatism" announced its  formation on 26 April in an event held in Bogota and attended by  Ernesto Samper. (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April) The group includes  former presidential candidate Rodrigo Marin Bernal, Juvenal de  los Rios, Rodolfo Segovia, and other Conservatives who have said  they will support the Liberal Party candidate and his Alliance  for Colombia.    Samper, who attended the event along with Humberto De la  Calle, hailed the support of these "important Conservatives" as  a "step forward in the direction of reforming Colombia  politics," noting that change was needed because Colombians had  "lost confidence in the mechanisms of representation and in  public administration itself." (EL ESPECTADOR, 27 April)    The National Conservative Directorate issued a statement in  which it criticized the group's decision to support Samper, and  said the move demonstrates that Samper continues the practice of  "clientelism which has corrupted the country's political  customs." (EL ESPECTADOR, 26 April)  <H5>  Ministry of Culture Planned </H5>   On 29 April, during a campaign tour of several Atlantic  Coast  cities, Ernesto Samper attended the Cultural Forum in  Barranquilla where he announced plans to establish a Ministry of  Culture if elected. The forum, which took place at the  nationally recognized Fine Arts School of the Universidad del  Atlantico, was organized by a committee headed by Samper's wife,  Jacquin, and attended by 700 Colombian artists. Samper said this  proposed ministry could likewise be called the "Ministry of  Peace since culture is synonymous with peace," and explained  that such a ministry would strengthen the sense of national  identity, fostering "unity within diversity." (EL TIEMPO, 30  April)    EL TIEMPO'S coverage of the event included a half-page  interview with Mrs. Samper in which she explained the rationale  for establishing a separate Ministry of Culture and what its  scope would be. (EL TIEMPO, 30 April)  <H5>  Samper Opposes Reducing Beer Tax </H5>   On 27 April Ernesto Samper asked Liberal Party senators not  to support a bill currently under review by a Senate committee  which would reduce the tax on beer, according to EL TIEMPO (28  April). Samper explained that the beer tax accounts for over 25  percent of the tax income received by the departments. In 13  departments it accounts for more than half of tax income, and in  four departments it accounts for 65 percent of tax income.  Samper said he felt he was in a position to make such a request  because he is leader of the party, and noted that he had reached  a judgment on the bill as a result of his discussions with  Liberal governors. Samper also proposed that trade officials  study ways to alleviate the fiscal burden on the beer industry  to reduce the problem of contraband.</p>

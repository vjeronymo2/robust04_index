			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO ALLOWS NEWSPAPERS TO IMPORT OWN NEWSPRINT  </P> <P> Mexican newspapers can now import their own newsprint, free of government  control, for the first time in 55 years.  </P> <P> In a move he said would reinforce the independence of the press, President  Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Friday opened the border to newsprint.  </P> <P> Imports will be subject to a 15% tariff but no other restrictions.  </P> <P> Previously, newsprint could be imported or manufactured only by a government  monopoly called Pipsa, for the initials of its name in Spanish.  </P> <P> "This is a very significant decision," said Alejandro Junco, publisher of  Monterrey-based El Norte newspaper and for two decades a leader in the fight to  break Pipsa's monopoly. "Mr. Salinas has earned himself the respect of those  who think it important for Mexican journalism not to have the stigma of  government dependence."  </P> <P> In August, 1974, the feisty El Norte's paper supply was cut to 17% of the  previous month's level while competitors were allowed an unlimited paper  supply, he said.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, when Salinas offered last year to sell the company, publishers  objected, saying control by a private monopoly would be worse.  </P> <P> Pipsa will continue to operate as a state-owned company, Salinas said. However,  he added, "Now, journalists and publishers can get their paper supplies from  the source they consider most appropriate, depending on their location,  interests and the (press) size."  </P> <P> Junco predicted that newspapers near the border will begin to import newsprint,  while those near Pipsa mills will continue to buy newsprint from the company.  "If we see fit, we will (import)," he said.  </P></p>

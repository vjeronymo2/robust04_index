			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As of 13 January in the Haitian parliament, it is  Frantz Robert Monde, author of the clean-sweep policy [politique  de la table rase] who now occupies the position of head of the  Chamber of Deputies.    Monde, who has coveted the presidency of the chamber since  the beginning of the legislature, has acquired the post thanks  to a compromise by the socialists, and by members of the  Alliance for Parliamentary Cohesion, ACP, to the detriment of  outgoing President Antoine Joseph of the Movement for the  Establishment of Democracy in Haiti.    The National Front for Change and Democracy [FNCD]  parliamentarians admit that they are dissatisfied with this  choice. In the opinion of some, this election confirms the  strong tendency toward the clean sweep prevailing in the  Chamber. Difficult days are expected. Bob Monde is a resolute,  avowed, fierce opponent of exiled President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide. Several FNCD and centrist parliamentarians say they  fear the future with such a choice. Bob Monde will be assisted  by socialist Mac-Ferl Morquette as vice-president. It is  Emmanuel Reyme, the Haitian Christian Democratic Party man,  another fierce opponent to the exiled president, who has been  elected first secretary. The ACP has thus resumed control of the  chamber.</p>

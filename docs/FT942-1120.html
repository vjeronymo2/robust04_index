			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / The Long View: Look who's talking . . . Once again the international financial markets are being infuriatingly obtuse, or so it appears to the politicians. As another minor dollar crisis erupted on the foreign exchanges this week, the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, chose to boast (in the dangerous style of Britain's former chancellor, Nigel Lawson) that the economic outlook for the US was 'as bright as it has been for decades'. US treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen insisted the economy was fundamentally strong and, by implication, the dollar should be, too. President Bill Clinton also joined in this round of jaw-boning which was, apparently, intended to soften up the markets for the next round of intervention. 'In the end, the markets will have to respond to the economic realities,' he said. Well, yes . . . but have they not already been doing so? Which has the stronger economy: the US, with 3 1/2 per cent growth in GNP, unemployment falling, and corporate profits and investment rising rapidly; or Japan, where total output is barely growing and industrial production is down, year-on-year? But let us look at that again. Japan has a huge surplus of exports over imports and is likely to run a balance of payments surplus of Dollars 125bn this year. It has a negligible budget deficit and boasts the lowest inflation and interest rates of any major country. The US, in contrast, has been running up deficits for many years: it is unwilling to tax its citizens enough to pay the government's bills and the nation is eager to consume more imports than it is willing or able to finance through export deliveries. Currency strength or weakness in the long run tends to reflect ingrained national characteristics. When the politicians of a country such as the US become annoyed by the tendency of their currency to sink, they tend to hit out either at the alleged irrationality of the markets or at the supposed irresponsibility and cussedness of overseas governments - in this case, at the failure of the Japanese government to expand domestic credit fast enough. In fact, the Americans should look at their own characteristics. They save comparatively little and are high consumers. As a result, investment and growth will be comparatively low and the currency will be weak in the long run, with a tendency towards high inflation. If the Americans want to live like this, it is their privilege to do so - but they should understand the consequences. If they really want to stabilise the dollar, they must take steps to raise domestic savings and stop blaming everybody else. Substantial countries rarely change their economic spots. A notable exception has been France, once firmly in the high inflation camp but more recently transferred to the German economic zone, to the incomprehension of Anglo-American critics. The UK, of course, continues on its secular decline, with record levels of consumption and a rate of aggregate national savings at the bottom of the international league table. The exit from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992 was rationalised widely as a triumph; sterling's trade-weighted index drifted below 80 this week, the lowest for more than a year. These long-term trends in currencies have become evident since the ending in the 1930s and 1940s of the links with gold, and especially since the introduction of the floating rate system early in the 1970s. Meanwhile, price movements have become upward-only - not always rapid, but without the interludes of offsetting sharp price falls which meant, in previous centuries, that there was no long-run trend in prices. An over-spending country with a weak currency has to attract the savers of other countries by offering them a higher rate of return. The greater the reluctance of savers in a hard currency country to venture overseas, the greater the premium will have to be. Japanese investors have been hit savagely by currency losses in the past and are proving very reluctant to expose themselves to the very real risk of more of the same. The yen would have appreciated further if the Japanese authorities had not been heavy buyers of US treasury bills and other short-term dollar assets. Now that last year's temporary optimism over the dollar has evaporated, dollar interest rates look anomalously low. Short-term rates have, for a long time, been below those in Germany; now, 10-year bond yields are, too. In part, this might reflect the problems of Germany itself which, because of the persistent consequences of re-unification, is in danger of slipping off its pedestal: state borrowing is very high and the Bundesbank has lost control of the money supply. But dollar rates are, nevertheless, too low and the Americans will have to stop chattering and keep on ratcheting. As the accumulation of debt proceeds, more marginal savings have to be attracted and the real cost of borrowing is likely to rise. Foreign investors have to be compensated for the risk of currency depreciation, domestic ones for the risk of inflation in the long run. There is no point in finance ministers protesting that the present rate of inflation is low. It is less than four years since UK inflation was over 10 per cent, a time period which is just the fleeting interval between one football World Cup and the next. Perhaps the borrowers should focus on the possibility that they could bring down their costs by offering a firmer promise of repayment, backed by links to an inflation or currency index - or even to bullion (as the French once did in their post-war dilettante period) thus, in effect, reinstating the gold standard for long-term government debt. For the time being, though, we shall continue to be witnesses to the frustrating spectacle of perverse financial markets refusing to accept the self-evident truths uttered by the politicians.</p>

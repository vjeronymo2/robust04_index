			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Sweden plans more spending cuts: Minority government in Stockholm seeks to save another Pounds 1.1bn SWEDEN'S minority coalition government yesterday proposed a further SKr12bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in spending cuts for 1993-1994 and outlined an ambitious programme to eliminate the country's structural budget deficit by 1998. The measures, contained in the budget for the year beginning July 1, bring total savings for 1993-1994 to SKr17bn and mean the government has announced cuts of SKr85bn since the start of 1992. Nevertheless, the government still expects a budget deficit of SKr162.3bn next year, which is 11.2 per cent of GDP and only SKr36bn less than this year's SKr198.3bn. It hopes that a combination of more cuts, restricted public consumption, and economic growth will remove the structural part of this by 1998, leaving a remaining deficit of less than SKr40bn. Government critics suggest the calculations may prove too optimistic, with the country still in recession, unemployment rising and a continuing crisis in the banking sector. In addition, a forecast that GNP will grow by 3.2 per cent a year between 1995-1998 may prove hard to meet. But Ms Anne Wibble, finance minister, said Sweden was poised to emerge from recession, with an export-led recovery starting to take effect next year, when GDP is predicted to rise by 1.6 per cent. She said next year's budget did include a provision for supporting the banking system. However, she declined to quantify the amount for fear of jeopardising the government's negotiating position. She also declined to say when Sweden might return to a fixed exchange rate following the krona's enforced decoupling from the Ecu in November. The measures need to be supported by either the Social Democrats or the right-wing New Democracy party to get through parliament, and both parties were critical of the proposals yesterday. Mr Ingvar Carlsson, the Social Democrat leader, called the budget a 'catastrophe'. This helped to unnerve the markets, even though the budget's contents were broadly in line with expectations. The bourse ended down 0.6 per cent. See Lex, page 18</p>

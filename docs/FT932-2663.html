			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard Chartered The recent meeting between Standard Chartered and a number of bank analysts, at which the bank described its current strategy, provided the spark for another burst of sustained buying interest in the shares, which yesterday reached their highest closing level for more than seven years. The stock price settled a net 26 up at 795p, only a whisker from its all-time high of 807p reached in April 1986. The steep rise in the price was not, however, matched by any sharp increase in trading volume. Nevertheless, turnover of 2.7m shares was at the high end of the scale. Some analysts were surprised at the performance of Standard shares after Monday's meeting. 'The meeting was positive but not wildly exciting,' said one who attended. He added that the UK business was still in a loss-making situation in the current year, in spite of cost-cutting, and that there would be a need for yet more provisions against bad debts. International conglomerate BTR was hit sharply by a profits downgrade from BZW, the London investment bank. At the day's worst the shares were down 10 at 354p, but they later picked up in line with a strong market trend to close a net 5 off at 359p after trading volume of 6.5m. BZW trimmed its estimate for the current year's profit figure by Pounds 50m to Pounds 1.25bn, citing tougher than predicted market conditions in Europe and 'a more realistic currency situation'. It kept its 1994 forecast at Pounds 1.45bn. Royal Insurance rose 4 to 287p after a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson Securities. Royal Bank of Scotland dipped 6 to 282p amid hints of a broker downgrade. Interim results up 71 per cent and ahead of City expectations moved the share price of Granada Group up 6 to 415p in trade of 4.2m, while analysts set about upgrading their profits forecasts. Positive views ranged virtually across the market in spite of the absence in the board's report of any hint of an economic recovery. Mr Hamish Dickson at Hoare Govett said: 'It would be the icing on the cake if the recovery picks up.' Mr Roy Owens at Smith New Court said the interim results were a commendation to Granada's new management. The company, a largely cash generative concern, is expected to make further good progress and is viewed as undervalued by many leisure analysts. In a patchy brewing sector, Guinness moved forward 4 to 489p. In Paris, chairman Mr Tony Greener was upbeat about the company's 1993 prospects, while Lehman Brothers, the UK securities house, recommended buying of LVMH, the French luxury goods manufacturer with which Guinness has a 24 per cent cross-holding. Optimism over a turnround in Brazil pushed up Coats Viyella 6 1/2 to 236 1/2 p. Watchers saw the increased hopes as evidence of a recovery, much more than the recent consolidation in the Indian subsidiary, said one analyst. Fears over possible moves by Unilever to make a substantial US acquisition provided part of the reason behind the stock's fall of 12 to 1036p in modest volume. Following recent buoyancy, based on its optimism for growth in East Asia, some watchers are now pointing to its lack of a significant presence in the US. But Ms Nicola Mallard at Charterhouse Tilney believed that the concern was premature. 'It is not going to happen immediately. First there has to be something to buy.' Among other engineering and aerospace stocks, British Aerospace appreciated 8 to 401p on hopes that the long-awaited Pounds 1.3bn Tornado order from Saudi Arabia was about to be signed. Hints of a corporate deal and of a buy recommendation from Credit Lyonnais Laing, the stockbroker, helped TI Group move ahead 8 to 345p. A sigh of relief after the last of the expected major cash calls in property, a significant property portfolio acquisition, and positive noises from NatWest Securities, triggered a bounce in the sector. Hemingway Properties pleased the market with its Pounds 30.2m purchase of a property portfolio and the stock firmed 2 1/2 to 31p. British Land added 6 at 309p, Brixton Estates went ahead 2 to 197p in modest trading, Slough Estates put on 3 at 206p, Great Portland Estates gained 3 at 180p and Clayform benefited from high demand and moved up 8 to 33p.</p>

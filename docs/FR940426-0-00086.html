			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> After receiving funds from the Secretary, a school disburses funds to students by issuing checks or by crediting their accounts at the school. Before a school may disburse funds to a borrower, the school must ensure that it has a completed and signed promissory note. The funds received by a Level 1 originating school that are intended for specific borrowers but not disbursed to those borrowers may be used to fund other borrowers. After the first disbursement is made, the school must record the actual disbursed amount and the date of the disbursement in the loan origination record and transmit all completed loan records and promissory notes (if not previously submitted) to the Servicer. The school transmits subsequent disbursement data to the Servicer as the disbursements occur.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Functions Performed by Level 2 Originating Schools  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Level 2 originating school is assisted in the management of funds by the Servicer. The Servicer reviews the loan origination records and promissory notes transmitted by the school before funds are disbursed. The promissory notes must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The Servicer initiates the transfer of funds to the school three days prior to the anticipated loan disbursement date on the basis of loan origination records and the completed promissory notes. The school receives a roster from the Servicer identifying each borrower, the anticipated disbursement date and amount to be disbursed for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Through the ACH process, the funds are sent to the school's bank within 48 to 72 hours following the initiation of the transfer of funds. The funds received by a Level 2 originating school are intended for specific borrowers and may not be used to fund other borrowers. Level 2 originating schools are responsible for reporting actual disbursement data to the Servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Schools That Use an Alternative Originator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The alternative originator manages both the promissory note and funds management processes for schools that use the alternative originator. These schools transmit the data necessary for the alternative originator to generate the promissory note. The alternative originator sends the promissory note to the borrower. The borrower must complete the promissory note and send it back to the alternative originator. The alternative originator reviews the promissory note before funds are disbursed. The promissory note must be correct and complete before funds can be disbursed. The alternative originator initiates the transfer of funds to the school three days prior to the anticipated loan disbursement date on the basis of the loan origination records and the completed promissory notes. The school receives a roster from the alternative originator identifying each borrower, the anticipated disbursement date and amount to be disbursed for each borrower, and the total amount of funds received by the school. Using the ACH process, the funds are sent to the school's bank within 48 to 72 hours following the initiation of the transfer of funds. The funds received by a school using the alternative originator are intended for specific borrowers and may not be used to fund other borrowers. Schools that use the alternative originator are responsible for reporting actual disbursement data to the Servicer. In addition, the Secretary may provide additional loan counseling to students at a school under alternative origination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Direct Plus Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Direct PLUS loans are made through a process similar to the one used in the Federal PLUS loan program. The parent obtains an Application and Promissory Note (promissory note) from the school and, after completing the promissory note, sends it to the school. The school completes the school section of the promissory note and forwards it to the Servicer, where data from the note is key entered and a credit check is performed. Alternatively, a school enters data from the note using the software provided and electronically forwards this information to the Servicer along with the paper copy of the promissory note. In either case, the Servicer performs a credit check to determine whether the parent has an adverse credit history and notifies the school and the parent of the results. If the loan is approved, the Servicer sends a disclosure statement to the parent. If the credit check indicates an adverse credit history, the Servicer advises the parent of available options; for example, the parent may obtain an endorser without an adverse credit history. If the loan is approved and the school is a Level 1 originating school, the school may draw down money and disburse loan funds in the same manner as it would for other loans made under the Direct Loan Program. If the school is not a Level 1 originating school, the Servicer electronically transmits the funding request for the school based on the loan origination records and promissory notes that the Servicer holds for that school.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

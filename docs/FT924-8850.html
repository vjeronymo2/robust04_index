			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / GPA may show debt plan to banks soon GPA GROUP, the Irish aircraft leasing group which aborted its international public flotation in June, will be approaching its banks 'relatively shortly' with proposals to reschedule its debts, said a director yesterday. GPA, which ranks as the world's largest aircraft lessor, said yesterday negotiations with its banks would continue this week, but denied there had been any 'crisis talks' over the weekend. One of the group's biggest bank creditors said: 'We are not involved in any formal crisis talks.' Mr James King, a GPA executive director, said there had been no emergency discussions with the group's bankers. 'It's all poppycock. I've spent the weekend shooting and gardening.' He added that the group had made two informal presentations to its more than 100 bankers and hoped to put formal proposals shortly, although it was unlikely rescheduling could be completed before Christmas. The group acknowledged last month it had to begin negotiations with banks on its borrowing arrangements after failing to raise new funds from the sale of 18 aircraft leases. Mr Tony Ryan, GPA's chairman and founder, said more than a week ago: 'We are conducting a matrix of wide-ranging negotiations with a significant level of interdependence and this will take time to complete.' GPA is reviewing its financial position and the company and others close to the negotiations reiterated yesterday that any new proposals put to the banks were not expected to be implemented until at least the first quarter of 1993. 'Whatever discussions there are with banks will last well into next year,' the adviser said. GPA's debt is thought to have risen significantly since June when the prospectus for its failed flotation listed borrowings of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.7bn) against shareholders' funds of Dollars 1.2bn. As a result its fund-raising efforts have been hit by investor fears that it might breach its banking covenants. Its financial strategy, put together with shareholders, lenders and aircraft suppliers after its shelved Dollars 800m flotation, has been complicated by its failure to sell the aircraft leases, and subsequent postponement of plans to raise Dollars 752m from its second issue of securitised aircraft leases.</p>

			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Finance and the Family: How does Miras work? MIRAS IS effectively a subsidy to those who take out a mortgage to buy a home. The mortgage holder gets tax relief on the interest he pays for the loan, but there is a ceiling on the size of the loan eligible for tax relief  -currently Pounds 30,000. The amount of relief is also limited to 25 per cent even for top-rate taxpayers. If you were to take out a mortgage for Pounds 30,000 at an interest rate of 8.50 per cent the amount of interest you would have to pay for a year would be Pounds 2,550. Tax relief at 25 per cent on this amount would be Pounds 637.50. So the total interest you would pay would be Pounds 1,912.50. The tax relief for someone taking out a Pounds 100,000 mortgage would still be Pounds 637.50 because of the Pounds 30,000 ceiling on the size of the loan. Higher rate taxpayers cannot claim any extra relief. In 1983, the way in which the tax relief was applied changed to become mortgage interest relief at source (Miras). The borrower pays interest net of the basic rate relief and the lender reclaims the tax relief from the Inland Revenue. Before the change, relief was given by tax offices through tax assessments.</p>

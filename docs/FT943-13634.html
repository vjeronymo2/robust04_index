			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Retailers record strongest sales so far this year British retailers achieved their best sales so far this year in June and are looking for further robust sales growth this month compared with a year ago, the Confeder-ation of British Industry reports. The CBI's latest distributive trades survey, released today, suggested that April's tax increases have yet to make a significant adverse impact on consumer spending. The survey of 502 retailers, wholesalers and motor traders between June 14 and July 6 found that retail sales volumes bounced back from a disappointing performance in May and increased more than expected compared with June last year. Of the 302 retailers polled 48 per cent said sales were up compared with a year ago, 21 per cent said they were down and about 30 per cent said they were unchanged. The resulting balance, which the CBI considers a good guide to the trend of sales, was a positive 27 per cent compared with 12 per cent in May. This balance was the highest since December, when on balance 34 per cent of retailers said sales had risen. In the previous survey a balance of 22 per cent of retailers said they expected sales to rise in June. The survey found that nearly two-thirds of retailers considered their sales were average for the time of year in June, with 15 per cent describing them as good and 21 per cent complaining that they were poor. The balance of replies - at minus 6 per cent - was the least negative since December, when on balance retailers found sales were good for the time of year. Elsewhere, the CBI reported that wholesalers' sales volumes grew in the year to June at their strongest rate since September 1987. A balance of 64 per cent of wholesalers reported sales up on a year, while altogether 87 per cent of the 136 companies polled said that sales were either good or average for the time of year compared with only 13 per cent saying they were poor. Only motor traders appeared to experience less than buoyant trading conditions last month. On balance, 12 per cent of motor traders reported an increase of sales compared with June last year - the slowest rate of growth so far this year. The responses showed that on balance 21 per cent thought sales were below average for the time of year and were expected to stay flat in July. By contrast, retailers and wholesalers are expecting further sales growth this month. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said: 'Retailers' expectations are at their highest since last December.' But he warned: 'We still need to be cautious as consumers have yet to feel the full impact of the tax rises announced last year.' Among retailers the strongest increases in sales were reported by footwear and leather merchants, off-licences and booksellers and stationers. Only hardware, china and do-it-yourself stores reported significant falls in sales. About half the retail sectors reported sales above average for the time of year.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL GROWTH IN SALES VOLUMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                 Jun    Jul    Aug    Sep    Oct    Nov  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total retail                    +30    +32    +31    +25    +26    +23 Grocers                         +43    +38    +37     +5    +25    +62 Specialist food                 +18    +13     +5    -14    -15    +10 Off licences                    -35    -23     -3    +23    -41    -61 Clothing                        +40    +55    +59    +14    +51    +32 Footwear and leather            +43    +55    +37    +84    +59    +12 Durable household goods         +10    +12     +3    -16    +13    -21 Furniture and carpets           +54    +31    +53    +17    +69    -29 Hardware, china &amp; DIY            -5    +10    +14    +23     +5    +10 Confectionery                    +3    +13    +30      0     -8    +36 Booksellers &amp; stationers        +37    +49    +22    +20    +50    +18 Chemists                        +44    +44    +37    +61    +16    +74 Other retail                     +8    +14     -3    +14    +19    +13 Motor trade                      -6     +8    +27    +15    +16    +14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                          Dec    Jan    Feb    Mar    Apr    May    Jun  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Total retail             +34    +15    +10    +12    +22    +12    +27 Grocers                  +60    +39    +40    +37    +33    +26    +38 Specialist food          +25    -26    -36     +4     +9    -44    +15 Off licences             -42    +15    +19     +4    +32    +36    +43 Clothing                 +29    +19    +17    +19    +40    +28    +35 Footwear and leather     +48    +38      0    +11    +42    +75    +43 Durable household goods  +17    +20     +6    +29     +6    +17    +29 Furniture and carpets     +8    +18    +36    -38    +27     -2    +31 Hardware, china &amp; DIY    +29     -5    +12    -13     -1    +29    -15 Confectionery            +22    -10     -1    +36    +39    +18     +4 Booksellers &amp; stationers +48    +48    +17    +47     +2     -5    +42 Chemists                 +83    +18     -8    -31    -53    -39     -5 Other retail             +25    -10    -38     -4     +7    +13    +28 Motor trade               -5    +50    +45    +22    +24    +16    +12  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: CBI Distributive Trades Survey  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Italian president in slush fund denial ITALY'S President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro yesterday denied allegations linking him with illicit payments from a slush fund in the 1980s, saying they were part of an attempt to destabilise the country. In a live television address which interrupted scheduled programmes the president said: 'I have a serene conscience that I have always and only served the state in the absolute respect of law.' His comments follow media reports that a jailed former secret agent had accused him of receiving Dollars 60,000 a month from a slush fund when he was interior minister in the 1980s. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, the Olivetti chairman, could be back at work 'within two or three days,' according to lawyers defending him against charges of alleged corruption, writes Haig Simonian from Milan. Mr De Benedetti was placed under house arrest on Tuesday after giving himself up to police in Milan. The terms of Mr De Benedetti's detention at his home in one of the most prestigious parts of Rome are relatively lax. Unlike some businessmen implicated in the 21-month corruption scandal, Mr De Benedetti has been allowed to receive visitors and to use the telephone to conduct his business affairs.</p>

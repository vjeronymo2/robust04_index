			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 14 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] A top Ministry of Foreign Affairs official said on  13 June: "If North Korea accepts inspections without fail, we  can consider that [economic assistance]." He was commenting on  a reported remark by DPRK (North Korean) President Kim Il-song  that if cooperation was obtained in the DPRK's normalization of  relations with the United States, and assistance was provided  for its efforts to convert [existing nuclear reactors] to light  water reactors, North Korea would cooperate with International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections.    The official said that if North Korea accepted full  inspections, it would be possible for Japan to consider economic  aid.</p>

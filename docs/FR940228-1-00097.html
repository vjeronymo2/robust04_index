			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to require each institution to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for receiving, investigating, and resolving student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complaints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to require that if the stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives of an educational program are to prepare students for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gainful employment, the institution must be able to show that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a reasonable relationship between the length of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and entry level requirements for employment. In addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to supporting the length of a program, the institution should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to substantiate the need for the number of hours of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training. The Secretary proposes to consider the relationship  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between the quantity of training provided in the program and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entry-level requirements to be reasonable if the number of clock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hours in the program does not exceed by more than 50 percent any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State requirement for the minimum number of clock hours necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to train the student in the occupation for which the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepares the student. For example, the Secretary is aware of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that sought approval of a 600-hour program when the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state in which the institution is located requires only 40 hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of training for entry level positions for which the program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided training. The Secretary believes that in situations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as this, the onus is on the institution to demonstrate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the longer program. The Secretary believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> excessive length of programs requires a student to incur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional unnecessary debt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A corollary requirement is that the need for the training  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided is established. Over the past several years, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary has been made aware of many schools that have provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three to six months of training for entry-level jobs, some of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which required no external training before employment, as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers have internal training programs or provide on-the-job  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training. As a basic tenet of student financial assistance is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable students who would not otherwise be able to afford needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training or education to enroll in an appropriate program, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary believes that if an institution is administering the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs adequately, it can demonstrate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training it provides is needed. The Secretary solicits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggestions on the most appropriate documentation to show the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need for the training.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add to the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability standards the requirement that the institution make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on job availability and state licensing requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to students in occupational, professional and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vocational educational programs. The Secretary believes that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order for a prospective occupational, professional or vocational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education student and financial aid applicant to make an informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision about enrollment and use of student financial assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a particular program, the applicant must have access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate, up-to-date information on the job market for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field, and the availability of specific jobs for which he or she  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be adequately prepared after completion of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, the applicant should have access to information on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent to which the educational or training program addresses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> state licensing standards, so the informed student can determine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with reasonable assurance, that necessary topics are covered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program and the extent to which additional information, not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary for state licensure, is covered. The Secretary notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this information may be obtained by the institution from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other Federal and State sources, such as Employment Service or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State occupational coordinating committees. An institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be required to produce this information on its own.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to include within the administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability standards a requirement that the institution have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertising, promotion, and student recruitment practices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurately reflect the content and objectives of the educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs offered by the institution. The Secretary believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to administer the Title IV, HEA programs in a responsible manner,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution must advertise its programs and the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance available in an accurate manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to specify that an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide all required program and fiscal reports and financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statements in a timely manner. The Secretary believes strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that adequate, timely submission of accurate reports is an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> essential element in the proper administration of the Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA programs. The failure to meet requirements for submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports is an indication that an institution's administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability is impaired.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

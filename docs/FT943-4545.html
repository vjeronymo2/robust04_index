			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / IBM's European head resigns: Successor named amid rumours of radical restructuring by troubled computer group The European head of Inter-national Business Machines has resigned after less than a year in the post, prompting speculation of radical restructuring in the European operations of the troubled computer manufacturer. IBM said Mr Hans-Olaf Henkel was resigning as chairman and chief executive of IBM Europe to return to Germany, where 'a significant career opportunity' had opened for him. Mr Henkel was president of IBM Germany until last year. He is being replaced by Mr Lucio Stanca, currently general manager of IBM's operations in southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, based in Rome. Mr Stanca will be IBM Europe's third head in just over three years. IBM stressed that Mr Henkel's decision was 'entirely personal with no strategic implications', but it made no attempt to disguise the suddenness of the move. Mr Henkel will hand over his responsibilities as chief executive with immediate effect, and will remain chairman of the IBM Europe board - a post he assumed only in January - until the next board meeting in early December. Mr Henkel expressed confidence two months ago in the future of IBM Europe and gave no hint that he was contemplating a move. His resignation comes amid indications that IBM is re-evaluating its European operations, aiming to give a greater international focus to its marketing. IBM's Italian operations have received strong ratings from analysts, with Mr Stanca - a respected Italian public figure - seen as anxious to safeguard its autonomy. However, the parent company said yesterday that his appointment would not herald immediate changes, and denied that any wider re-evaluation was in progress. The recession and radical reshaping of the computer market continue to have a traumatic impact on IBM, notably in Europe. The company has shed nearly 30,000 jobs across Europe since its peak in the late 1980s, reducing its workforce from 112,000 to 85,000, with another 10,000 posts are to be lost this year. The worldwide workforce will be cut by a further 20,000 this year to 215,000 and more job cuts appear likely in 1995. The cost cutting appears to have stabilised IBM's position. Its second-quarter earnings, announced in late July, showed higher than expected earnings on the back of sharp reductions in expenses. IBM said demand for mainframe computers was strong but it still faced 'serious problems' in its personal computer operations. IBM's second-quarter earnings of Dollars 689m (Pounds 445m), equal to Dollars 1.14 per share, were well above analysts' estimates of 45-80 cents per share. For the same period in 1993 IBM had reported a loss of Dollars 40m, or 8 cents per share, before heavy restructuring charges bringing net losses to Dollars 8bn. In terms of sales, however, Europe was static for the second quarter at Dollars 5.5bn, with increases for the group reliant on growth in the Asia-Pacific region which picked up 14 per cent to Dollars 2.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 1 December, the government decided to seek a  conclusion of an "environment protection cooperation agreement"  with China in view of the serious environmental destruction due  to the nation's rapid economic growth. In principle, the  agreement will give the two nations equal standpoints to jointly  cope with problems related to the global environment. In this  sense, its approach is quite different from existing environment  aid programs, which are one-sidedly given from Japan to China.    The agreement was proposed by China two to three years ago;  however, some ministries have been opposing the proposal, noting  "such an agreement may be used as an excuse for spending larger  official development assistance (ODA) funds for China." The  Japan-China agreement will become the first case in which Japan  offers an equal position to a developing nation for cooperation  in environmental protection. This is expected to contribute a  lot to settling environmental problems affecting the two  nations, such as acid rain from China.    The agreement's final draft consists of a preamble and nine  articles. The preamble notes: "To protect the global  environment, the two nations will work together on their common  problems and further promote international efforts."    Article 2 lists nine problem fields the two nations should  jointly cope with, and "acid rain and air pollution" is on top  of the list. China has been insisting that acid rain caused by  its air pollution is "nothing more than a domestic problem since  its influence on Japan is not proven." However, the agreement  is going to clearly note for the first time that China's acid  rain is a problem not only for China but also for Japan.    Since Japan already has given environment aid to China under  ODA programs, the treatment of existing aid programs has long  been the biggest obstacle to the new cooperation agreement with  China. The Foreign Ministry has been negative toward the  agreement, saying "the agreement may be used as an excuse to  concentrate allotment of ODA funds to China." The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry also said the agreement may  adversely affect its "Green Aid Plan," an energy aid program  under way in China. Inter-ministry talks were held on this  point, and ministries finally agreed with the government plan on  the condition that "the agreement should not influence existing  aid projects."</p>

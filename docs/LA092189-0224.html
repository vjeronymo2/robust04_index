Richard Romley said today his investigation concluded  there was nothing improper in the pre-dawn extradition to Los Angeles of a  Tucson man accused of murdering actress Rebecca Schaeffer.  </P> <P> Robert John Bardo's court-appointed defense attorney in Tucson had asked Atty.  Gen. Bob Corbin to investigate the Aug. 10 extradition, but Corbin forwarded  the case to Romley.  </P> <P> Bardo was whisked from the Pima County Jail in an Aug. 10 pre-dawn transfer  that an assistant public defender later said violated his rights. She had filed  her initial challenge to the extradition in the wrong court.  </P></p>

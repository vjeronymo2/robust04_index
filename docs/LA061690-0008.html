			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN LAW AGAINST FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> Congratulations to Justice William J. Brennan Jr. for having the intelligence  and courage to lead a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court in its second decision  striking down laws which prohibit an individual from burning the American flag  ("High Court Voids Law Against Burning Flag," Part A, June 12). Our flag is a  wonderful symbol of the principles for which thousands of our citizens have  given their lives. But only by allowing and tolerating the antics of the  various cretins who would ever destroy such a symbol can we truly support and  protect the concepts of liberty and freedom for which the flag has so long  stood.  </P> <P> If flag burning is outlawed, we are destroying a main ideal for which our flag  has become respected throughout the world. It comes down to a rather elementary  balancing test. Do we preserve the flag, the piece of cloth, the symbol, or do  we preserve the true principles of freedom and liberty which the flag  represents? These options are mutually exclusive, and there can be only one  choice.  </P> <P> There must be no amendment of the Bill of Rights to prohibit the flag's  destruction. I find it incredible that Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Rep. Robert  H. Michel (R-Ill.), rather minor characters compared to the brilliant people  who drafted the Bill of Rights, could take it upon themselves to attempt to  sway Congress, state legislators and the American public that such an amendment  is necessary. The public at least, is smarter than that, and will realize that  the Bill of Rights, which was so well written, and which has stood so well for  199 years unamended, should not be modified for political gain under the guise  of patriotism. True patriotism calls for us to protect the ideals of the  Constitution, even if that means tolerating political expression that we find  unacceptable.  </P> <P> THOMAS M. GARCIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

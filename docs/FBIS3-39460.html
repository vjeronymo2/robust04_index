At a CDU election event in Hannover on  Wednesday evening [16 February], Kohl said Rau had "not felt  solidarity with the Germans of the GDR" in the second half of  the 1980's. If the Social Democrats now say that the discussion  of their behavior toward the former GDR leadership is  "mudslinging," they only want to divert the people's attention,  the CDU chairman told 2,500 participants in the event.    He sticks to his accusation that at that time leading Social  Democrats had given in to central demands of ex-GDR head of  state Erich Honecker. They had advocated dissolving the  Salzgitter documentation center for human rights violations in  the GDR and abandoning joint German citizenship. "We never  betrayed the ideal of German unity, despite all the mistakes we  made," Kohl cried to the CDU membership.    In the event of wage conflicts in the metal industry, Kohl  warned against strikes and lockouts. He called on both sides of  industry to solve the wage conflicts at the negotiating table.  "I do not believe that strikes and lockouts would be helpful  for jobs and the unemployed in this situation," Kohl said. On  the contrary, an industrial conflict would "seriously damage"  the competitiveness of the German economy. Therefore, the  employers and the trade unions should get together. Kohl again  presented the latest conclusion of a collective agreement in the  chemical industry as an "act of reason," both regarding the wage  agreement of 2 percent and more flexible working hours.</p>

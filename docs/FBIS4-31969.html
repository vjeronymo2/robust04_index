			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Several recent items in Czech  periodicals have discussed the process of reorganizing,  modernizing, and downsizing the Czech Army.  <H5>  Command Reorganization </H5>   The deactivation of the Western and Central Military  Commands  and their replacement by two corps commands headquartered in  Tabor and Olomouc were reported in the 19 April issue of ARMADNI  REPORT. Lieutenant General Frantisek Podesva, newly named  commander of II Corps, told the military journal that "the  purpose of the Army reorganization is creation of a new concept  of operational command levels." The general stated that the new  corps would assume some of the functions of the old military  commands, such as basic training and responsibility for  "mobilization-asset acquisition," but that some duties, such as  property management, would be assumed by other components.    Below the corps level, the Central Military Command Army  divisions in the the II Corps area will be converted to three  mechanized brigades in mid-July, according to ARMADNI REPORT.  Two Western Military Command armored divisions will be  reorganized as the I Corps brigades by 1 July, while the  transformation of the 20th Mechanized Division into a brigade  within the I Corps will be completed in 1995. Upon assuming  command of the I Corps, Major General Lubomir Jura stated that  the emphasis of reorganization and training efforts will now  shift to the company and platoon levels. Jura noted that Army  downsizing had so far led to the deactivation of 54 regiment-  and division-sized units and the release of 16 bases to civilian  uses.  <H5>  Training Area Reduction </H5>   Army cutbacks have included a consolidation of military  training areas. MLADA FRONTA DNES of 19 May indicates that the  number of Army training areas has been reduced from eight in  1990 to five currently. The facilities that were terminated were  those located at Dobra Voda in Klatovy district, at Ralsko in  Ceska Lipa, and at Mlada in the districts of Nymburk and Mlada  Boleslav. The largest remaining training areas are now those in  Libava and Hradiste.    Libava, in the vicinity of Olomouc, is used for practice  firing from hand-held weapons, self-propelled artillery,  infantry-combat-vehicle guns, tanks, and field artillery. As of  1994, it also includes an aerial target range for fighter and  bomber aircraft. The Army also has 12 firing ranges in the  Hradiste military training area near Karlovy Vary, better known  as Doupov, of which the largest are tank, infantry, and  helicopter firing ranges. The 25,000-hectare Boletice training  area in southern Bohemia has seven firing ranges, including one  for helicopters. Training takes place mainly in artillery and  armored-personnel-carrier, tank, and hand-held weapons fire. A  similar area at Brdy, near Pribram, serves for artillery and  tank training as well as air bombing and strafing. The oldest  training area in Brezina in the Vyskov district, established in  1935, is used for practice firing by tanks, infantry combat  vehicles, and artillery. It is the smallest of the training  areas, comprising 15,000 hectares. MLADA FRONTA DNES notes that  civilian populations in the regions surrounding the training  areas tend to complain about the disruptive effects of military  operations on their daily lives.  <H5>  Rapid Deployment Force </H5>   The establishment of an elite rapid deployment brigade was  described as one of the "key elements" in Army reorganization by  a 14 May LIDOVE NOVINY article, which also noted that the  brigade "is one of the few development programs the military is  able to afford, in view of its tight budget (27 billion korunas  [Kc])." According to LIDOVE NOVINY, the rapid deployment brigade  should become operational by 1 July of this year, and its  formation will cost approximately Kc800 million. The paper  quoted the colonel in charge of organizing the new unit as  rejecting any "theories" that the professionalization of the  Army might fail. He did, however, concede that the substandard  physical condition of many recruits and the poor condition of  military housing facilities are obstacles to the establishment  of an effective professional fighting force.    An article in the 19 April military journal A REPORT  described a press conference by Defense Minister Antonin Baudys  that was almost entirely devoted to the rapid deployment  brigade. Baudys said that, like the rest of the military, the  new unit faced a shortage of qualified junior officers. "Finding  young people for the brigade should be the start of a  fundamental change in this respect, but it is a process that  will require a number of years," stated the minister. As a  result, said Baudys, the rapid deployment brigade will start as  a semiprofessional unit to be converted gradually into a fully  professional one. He added that new methods of attracting  qualified recruits were being tried, such as use of the concept  of "extended service time," under which the soldiers would  receive a one-time cash payment or "temporary retirement pay  upon completion of [their] term of service."  <H5>  PM Wants Further Cuts </H5>   During a recent visit to II Corps headquarters in Olomouc,  where he was briefed on the status of Army modernization and  restructuring, Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said that progress in  transforming the military was proceeding at about the same speed  as that of the rest of Czech society. The 7 May issue of the  Moravian daily ROVNOST quoted him as saying: "After completing  most of its reorganization, the Army is now entering the stage  of routine buildup and improvement." Klaus added, however, that  the Army still needs to "reduce rather than add weight."</p>

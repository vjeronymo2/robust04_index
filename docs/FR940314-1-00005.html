This proposal would require inspection to detect chafing of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), modification of the wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This proposal is prompted by a report that the wiring harness on certain airplanes were produced in a configuration that is subject to chafing and electrical shorting. The actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent loss of ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed during an emergency situation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received by May, 9, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;NM&hyph;222&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.

That AD requires inspection to detect chafing and modification of the wiring harness of the air driven generator (ADG), and repair of any chafed harness. That action was prompted by reports of chafing of the ADG electrical output harness against the backshell of the connector on the turbine generator assembly. Although the chafing occurred while the ADG was in the stowed position, when the ADG was deployed, the chafed wires shorted to the airplane structure and prevented the ADG from powering the essential bus. This essential bus provides electrical power to the hydraulic flight control system and to the essential flight control equipment. In these instances, the shorting also damaged the ADG output harness and its support structure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This condition, if not corrected, could result in loss of emergency power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since issuance of AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01, Transport Canada Aviation, which is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airworthiness authority for Canada, notified the FAA that the same unsafe condition addressed in AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 may exist on certain additional Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes. Transport Canada Aviation advises that, during production of Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive, the wiring harnesses of the ADG's were not modified to preclude chafing against the backshell of the connector on the turbine generator assembly. (AD 91&hyph;19&hyph;01 is applicable only to airplanes having serial numbers 5001 through 5098, inclusive.) Therefore, these airplanes are also subject to losing ADG power to the essential bus when the ADG is deployed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during an emergency situation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Canadair has issued Alert Service Bulletin A601&hyph;0370, Revision 1, dated April 15, 1993, that describes procedures for a one-time inspection to detect chafing and modification of the ADG wiring harness, and repair of any chafed harness. This modification entails replacing two existing harness support brackets with redesigned brackets that would preclude chafing of the harness. The effectivity of this service bulletin includes Model CL&hyph;600&hyph;2B16 series airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131 only. Transport Canada Aviation classified this alert service bulletin as mandatory and issued Canadian Airworthiness Directive CF&hyph;91&hyph;21R1, dated May 6, 1993, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This airplane model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operation in the United States under the provisions of &sect;21.29 of the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada Aviation has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada Aviation, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require inspection to detect chafing and modification of the wiring harness of the ADG, and repair of any chafed harness. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously. This proposed AD would apply only to airplanes having serial numbers 5099 through 5131, inclusive.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

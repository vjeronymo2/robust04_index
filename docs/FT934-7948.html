			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Talks on Irish wage pact falter IRELAND faces the prospect of a wages free-for-all following the breakdown of talks yesterday between the government and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) over a new centralised pay bargaining agreement. ICTU yesterday notified its affiliated unions to prepare for a return to free collective bargaining, having failed in its attempts to persuade the government to remove an unpopular 1 per cent income levy over the next two budgets. For the past six years, public and private sector pay rises have been regulated through tripartite agreements between the government, employers' organisations and ICTU, the latter representing the bulk of organised labour in the country. The first agreement, known as the Programme for National Recovery, ran from 1987-1990 and the second, known as the Programme for Economic and Social Progress (PESP), ran from 1991 and expires at the end of this year. The two agreements have been largely responsible for the economic stability in Ireland over the past six years, peace on the industrial relations front, and the achievement of one of the best economic growth rates and one of the lowest inflation rates throughout the European Union. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, introduced the 1 per cent income levy in last January's budget to help meet pay deals in the public sector and raise funds for a job creation programme. Its critics have argued that the levy amounts to a 2 per cent increase in the basic income tax rate, in that it is calculated as a 1 per cent of the whole income, without any allowances. Mr Peter Cassells, the general secretary of ICTU said the levy 'struck at the heart of the PESP, acting as a clawback of pay deals that had already been settled and so our members have lost confidence in the process'. The levy is worth some IPounds 145m (Pounds 138m) per year to the Exchequer, and Mr Ahern has said that even if the levy were to be removed, in time, it would have to be balanced by tax increases elsewhere. Mr Ahern said earlier this week that 'the government is anxious to enter into a new agreement, but not at any price'. Public sector pay has risen by 46 per cent since 1987, while inflation has risen by only around 15 per cent.</p>

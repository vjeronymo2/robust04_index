Clarifying a speech  delivered by Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi yesterday, in which he  said the IFP and the KwaZulu government should reconsider  further talks with the ANC, the IFP's Dr. Ziba Jiyane said this  wasn't a call to pull out of talks with the ANC. He also said a  decision on whether the IFP should participate in the elections  or not would be made when the party met at the end of the month.</p>

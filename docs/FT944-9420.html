			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / EMI council's first meeting Mr Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, last night warned strongly against the setting in advance of tight exchange rate stability criteria for countries seeking to enter European Monetary Union. After the first council meeting of the EMI - forerunner of the planned European central bank - at its new Frankfurt headquarters, he said it would be 'counter-productive and very dangerous' to set explicit exchange rate bands ahead of monetary union which he expects after 1999. The decision should be taken at the end of the two-year period in which 'normal fluctuation margins' have to be adhered to. 'I just don't see how we can put any precise figure on that today.' He said the 'very hard lesson' of crises in the European exchange rate mechanism showed that very specific currency fluctuation margins 'give a bonus to speculative pressure'.</p>

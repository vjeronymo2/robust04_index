			<p>BFN     [Text] The incident involving an American Lockheed C-130  that violated the Russian air space on Tuesday and was forced to  land by Russian Air Defence in Adler near Sochi is being studied  in Washington where all the necessary information was sent.  This was reported to Interfax on Wednesday by a spokesman for  the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin.    In his opinion, Americans should be given time to study the  circumstances. After that it would be logical to hold a meeting  of high-ranking experts from Russia and the U.S. to prevent such  incidents in the future, Karasin said.    As Interfax reported, the American plane was flying from  Frankfurt-am-Main to Tbilisi. No requests were made for its  flight across Russian territory.    On Tuesday evening the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Adamishin sent a note to the American ambassador in  Moscow Thomas Pickering. He hoped that the American side would  apply disciplinary measures to those responsible.    Meanwhile, the main air traffic control center of Georgia  has  told Interfax that it is in no way responsible for the incident  involving the American plane as it is does not belong to Georgia.</p>

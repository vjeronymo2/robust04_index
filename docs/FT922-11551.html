			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / Watchdog faults Customs over sales of seized goods CUSTOMS AND EXCISE lacks an incentive to sell the goods that it seizes to boost revenues to the exchequer, according to a report released yesterday by the National Audit Office. Local offices on tight budgets had no motivation to incur the costs of arranging sales, and would rather destroy the goods they held. Government accounting rules - which prevent proceeds of sales being retained  -deter staff from selling items such as the vehicles used in connection with smuggling, the government expenditure watchdog found. The volume of goods seized by Customs grew during the 1980s, but revenue from sales of the goods was Pounds 4m in 1990-91, compared with Pounds 4.7m in 1988-89 and Pounds 3.8m in 1986-87. Customs expects smuggling to increase with the creation of the single European market at the end of 1992. There was no attempt at any office inspected by the audit office to establish the cost of sales and only two of the eight visited kept detailed records. Little attempt was made to establish likely staffing, storage and indirect costs in handling the goods, and procedures introduced this year will not be sufficient to determine whether it is cheaper to destroy rather than sell goods. Drugs are generally burnt, but few of the 12 incinerators operated by Customs meet the requirements of the 1990 Environmental Protection Act. Because capacity is limited, some drugs have been burnt off site. Since very high temperatures are required, the drugs are not always completely destroyed and have sometimes caused health hazards when burnt. Transporting drugs around the country and giving publicity to hauls was criticised by some Customs staff concerned about security. The Scottish courts' requirement for all drugs seized to be stored until proceedings were complete posed 'severe security problems', although the audit office found no evidence of any significant breaches. Vehicles raised most money in sales but were often stored in the open, where their resale value fell rapidly. National Audit Office.

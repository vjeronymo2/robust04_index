It provided congregate housing and coordinated supportive services for elderly handicapped or non-elderly handicapped individuals to allow them to maintain their independence and avoid costly and unnecessary institutionalization. Congress appropriated funds for Fiscal Years 1979 through 1982, to remain available until expended. Since then, Congress has provided funds on an annual basis to continue funding grantees that previously received assistance. The demonstration became a permanent program in 1987.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the experience of the grantees funded under the demonstration, Congress created a new CHSP as one of the components of NAHA, which was enacted on November 28, 1990 and amended in 1992. HUD, in coordination with the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) of the Department of Agriculture, administers the CHSP under a Common Rule in accordance with the statute. This Notice announces the availability of both HUD and FmHA funds for the CHSP and invites applications from both HUD and FmHA applicants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

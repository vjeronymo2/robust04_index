			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Baris Parfenavich Savitski, head of the </F> Supreme Soviet commission for ecology and rational use of  natural resources, by Natalya Babina; place and date not given:  ``Paradise Is German Economy Accompanied by Our Ecological  Legislation'' -- first four paragraphs is ZVYAZDA introduction]    [Text] It is a paradox: The more unsafe is our ecological  situation, the greater number of people become ill from various  diseases, and the less people think about protecting nature. Is  this a reaction of an ostrich who -- at the sight of danger --  hides his head in the sand? It is very difficult to meet a  person who understands that protection of the environment is a  much more important task than economic reforms and political  scandals. However, fortunately, there are such people among us.  They are ecologists. They are professional amateurs,  enthusiasts and skeptics, gloomy pessimists and decisive  romantics.... If mankind survives, this will only occur through  their efforts.    Our guest today is an ecologist, if it is possible to say  so,  he is No. 1 in Belarus. He is reserved, he hates loud phrases  and effective gestures. Nevertheless, when my  colleagues-deputies voted down one of the ecological issues, he  said ``Shame on you!'' and left the session hall.    I recalled this event. He impatiently waved his hand. ``At  my age, it was just okay.''    However, I have my own opinion on this issue. Professor,  author of more than 300 research publications, Baris Parfenavich  Savitski heads a Supreme Soviet commission for ecology and the  rational use of natural resources, and demonstrates the  professionalism and wisdom of a competent politician.    Babina: Baris Parfenavich, you have been working  in the legislature for more than three years. What are the  results of your work? With what feelings do you view those  three years?    Savitski: First of all, I have to say that the  work in the commission takes all my time, and I am completely  devoid of time for the fulfillment of my deputy duties.  Therefore, my technical secretary fulfills that part of my  work. I am concerned with this. However, I am satisfied with  the results of the work of my commission.    We faced the task of creating a group of ecological laws  that  would consider the new status of the Republic, its sovereignty,  and emerging market relations in Belarus. Our first draft law  had to reorganize the entire structure of the system of  environmental protection in the Republic, to establish a  powerful centralized system of control, and to do away with  numerous organizations that duplicate each other's activities.  Many deputies thought that this draft law was too advanced and  voted it down. However, some elements of this law are being  implemented in other laws and legal norms.    We have begun to develop the so-called code of ecological  laws. These laws include a number of ecological issues -- the  protection of the environment in general, the protection of  water, land, animals, and plants, etc., and the mechanism for  their implementation. However, it is simply impossible to adopt  all these laws at one Supreme Soviet session. Therefore, we  proposed discussing the most important ``Law on Environmental  Protection.''    The Law ``On State Ecological Examination'' is currently  included in the state planning system and implemented in the  decisions on the socioeconomic development of Belarus. The  implementation of various draft projects that did not receive a  positive assessment of ecological experts will not be financed  by the state. This is the most effective economic lever.    I feel proud that no other state has the same precise  concept  of ecological examination. In my opinion, experts from the  World Bank for Reconstruction and Development and my  colleagues-deputies from other states -- with whom we usually  cooperate on these issues -- agree that this law is a great  achievement for our legislature.    The Law ``On Industrial and Consumer Waste'' has been  recently published in the press. Implementation of this law  will considerably decrease the negative impact of waste on the  environment and make entrepreneurs use this waste in industrial  production. Economic measures will also help to implement this  task.    Our Republic is literally flooded with proposals to build  enterprises for storage and processing of radioactive or  chemical waste. Considering that Western businessmen are ready  to propose enormous bribes, some of our officials are ready to  permit the construction of such production sites on our  territories that are already contaminated with radionuclides.  Well, the new law categorically bans transporting all kinds of  waste to Belarus, excluding the waste which can be processed at  the already existing Belarusian production sites, however, after  a strict ecological examination. This law also limits  transporting waste through our territory because it can cause  terrible consequences. Do you remember how the waste with  radionuclides poured out of containers at Brest railway station?    These three laws have been recently adopted by our  legislature. I can say that if my name is put under only these  three laws, I will claim that my life was worth living.    Hence, our commission is doing well. However, if all 14  members of our commission were professional lawmakers, our  results could have been more fruitful. The issue of a  professional legislature arises, however, this is an issue for  another interview.    Babina: You often go abroad. Can you compare our  ecological legislation with that of foreign states?    Savitski: The financial situation of our state is  in a miserable state, that is why I cannot go to the states I  would like to visit, but to the states where I am invited....  Therefore, it is difficult to speak about all the states. I am  sure that if not for Chernobyl, the ecological situation in  Belarus would not have been worse, but even better than in some  European states. Currently, we have a lot of difficult  problems. In the first place, the change in the chemical  composition of Belarusian soil as an aftermath of acid rains and  air pollution due to the means of transportation. These are  global issues. The local issue of key importance is the waste  from Soligorsk and Gomel chemical factories; the negative  results of foolish land improvement; and the ecological  situation in Novopolotsk.    As for the legislation, it is not worse than in West  European  states and in some respects it is better. In the West, the  implementation of ecological projects is often hampered by  parliamentary agricultural and industrial lobbies. I am  convinced that paradise is the German economy accompanied by our  ecological legislation. To my regret, we are too far away from  this paradise. However, in my opinion, under market conditions,  the mechanism of control over the implementation of ecological  laws is becoming more and more operative. Many of our  industrial and agricultural sites are owned by persons who are  responsible before the law.    Babina: You are heading the Belarusian Ecological  Union. This is one of our numerous new public organizations.  How do you assess the activity of ``the greens'' in the  Republic?    Savitski: I have no single opinion on the issue.  I do not like the appearance of the so-called ``banning'' trend  in this organization. Often, despite real conditions, they  demand that some sites not be constructed. However, life is  life. Therefore, in my opinion, the key task of ecologists is  not to ban but to choose the right option. To my regret, we are  meeting more often with these ``banning'' demands. Sometimes,  they are offended that we did not support their proposals. I  can give you some examples: There is a project for the  construction of an industrial site for production of sodium  carbonate from the waste of the Soligorsk chemical factory. It  may seem that everything is okay, because the Republic badly  requires this substance. Moreover, it will be produced from  this waste.... However, the Soligorsk Union of Ecologists has  been writing letters of protest to all organizations and  departments of the Republic, as well as to the UN ecological  departments. In fact, Soligorsk ecologists are not against the  construction of this kind of a factory, however, they oppose its  construction on their territory. That is, waste from the  Soligorsk chemical factory will have to be transported somewhere  else.... If this union of ecologists made attempts to make this  production safer -- there are no safe technologies overall --  their actions could have been more fruitful.    Babina: You receive many letters from ordinary  people. What are they about?    Savitski: Each day, we receive about 30 letters.  They are varied. Ecologists and workers of various branches of  our economy send their proposals on various issues. We also  receive many letters from working collectives. We try to answer  all these letters.    Babina: ZVYAZDA wrote about the debates between  Belarusian and Ukrainian ecologists on the issue of constructing  a building materials factory close to Malorita. Has this issue  been resolved?    Savitski: This issue has been discussed on all  levels. A very representative commission of Belarusian  ecologists has come to the conclusion that nothing threatens the  Shatskiye Lakes. Nevertheless, we can listen to all the counter  arguments of our Ukrainian colleagues.    I hope that they will also take into consideration our  protests about the decision of the Ukrainian legislature to  continue the operation of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.    Babina: The last question. What is awaiting  Belarus in 10-15 years?    Savitski: I would hope for Belarus, especially its  northern part, to become a kind of Switzerland within the CIS, a  zone for tourism, recreation, and farming. Our industry should  be equipped with modern technology.    In general, it seems to me that Belarus has all the chances  for becoming a state respected by the international community.  The Belarusian agricultural sector can provide us with our own  food, our industry -- with raw materials. We should discard the  practice of using pesticides and herbicides, and begin working  for export. As for our industry, I can hear that many people  say that we experience a lack of raw materials, and can become  ``an assembly shop'' for the CIS. In my opinion, in due time,  this peculiarity of Belarus will make our Republic one of the  most developed in the CIS. Please, pay attention, Japan is also  ``an assembly shop'' for the planet and neither Japan, nor Great  Britain, nor Switzerland, nor Germany can boast of rich natural  resources. This fact does not impede them from being rich.</p>

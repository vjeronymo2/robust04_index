			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / DTI will delay research grants NEW RESEARCH grants or contracts from the Department of Trade and Industry may be unavailable until April 1994 because the Pounds 110m-a-year DTI innovation budget is overspent, the department has told researchers unofficially. Mr John Bennett, secretary general of the Association of Independent Research and Technology Organisations, said some of his 36 member companies had 'expressed very serious concern' about the moratorium. Several organisations expected to receive new DTI funds next year to replace expiring contracts. If funds do not arrive, they will have to shed scientists and engineers. About 10 research and technology organisations will suffer badly, said Mr Ian Cooper, chairman of the association's policy committee and chief executive of BHR Group, an engineering research body. The loss to his own company would be about Pounds 1m next year. There would be the direct loss of Pounds 700,000 in DTI funds, and that might lead to industry withdrawing a further Pounds 300,000. 'That's a big chunk of our Pounds 7m turnover and it will inevitably mean getting rid of some research teams,' he said. Mr Douglas Munro, managing director of the British Textile Technology Group, said: 'This is very bad news for R&amp;D work across the board. And it means that some specific bright ideas from which industry would benefit are never going to happen.' One casualty of the DTI freeze on new R&amp;D spending is a Pounds 1.5m environmental project involving five research organisations to develop systems for removing pollutants from industrial effluents with immobilised enzymes. Mr Brian McCarthy, BTTG biotechnology manager, said: 'It is a field in which the UK could quickly dominate world markets and the initial reaction from DTI was very favourable; they said it was just the sort of work that should be supported. So there is general dismay that it is not going to survive the moratorium.' Officially the DTI says there is no moratorium on new research programmes. Until Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has decided the department's 1993-94 innovation budget, 'officials are taking a cautious line', the department said. The heads of several research organisations insist that they have been told privately by DTI officials that 'there will be no money for anything new until the end of 1993-94', as one executive said.</p>

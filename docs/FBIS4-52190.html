			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan Demanded"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- South Korean rulers must  stop trying to use for insidious political purpose the issue of  old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, who were taken prisoners  during the war and had been kept in prison for many years,  unconverted, and unconditionally send them back to the northern  half of the country, says NODONG SINMUN in a signed article  today.    Recalling that the South side refused to send back Kim and  Ham under an unreasonable pretext once again when the North side  demanded their repatriation, the paper says:    This is a gross violation of the international humanitarian  law and an unpardonable crime contrary to morality.    According to the provisions of the international  humanitarian  law, all of POWs are to be repatriated to their homeland  immediately after the end of hostile acts. The South Korean  authorities are only bound to send POWs Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan back to the North.    However, the successive rulers of South Korea had kept Kim  and Ham in prison respectively for 33 years and seven months and  34 years, cruelly torturing and persecuting for the mere reason  that they refused to be converted ideologically. They are  denied to have communication with their families and relatives.    They, old valetudinarian men released from the prison, are  maintaining the barest existence with toilsome physical labour  in South Korea. Their hope is only to go back to the northern  half of the country at an early date and live a quiet life for  the rest of their days under the warm care of the thankful  system and their families and relatives.    Their repatriation to the North is a matter out of politics,  a matter of human conscience and morality. "Human rights" and  "unification" much touted by the South Korean rulers while  persistently detaining and persecuting Kim and Ham, refusing to  send them back, are nothing but a deceptive argument.    If the South Korean authorities persistently block their  repatriation, they will face a bitter condemnation at home and  abroad, as a violator of the international humanitarian law and  morality.</p>

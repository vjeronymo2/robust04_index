			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape cools on Gestetner link Gestetner shares fell 19p to 144p yesterday after Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, said it would not exercise an option to increase its stake in the distributor of office equipment and photographic supplies. At the same time Gestetner reported a sharp turnround to profits of Pounds 6.6m in the six months ended April 30 compared with a loss of Pounds 45.4m which reflected extensive restructuring costs. Last year Inchcape spent Pounds 38m on a 15 per cent holding and acquired the right to raise this to 25 per cent by today for a further Pounds 41m. Ricoh, the Japanese manufacturer of office equipment, bought a large stake in Gestetner in 1991 and now controls 29.9 per cent. Mr Charles Mackay, Inchcape chief executive, said that it had become 'increasingly apparent the best strategy available to Gestetner, ourselves and Ricoh, may be for the three companies to work together in developing business opportunities, while generally maintaining separate distribution channels for the Ricoh and Gestetner brands. 'However, it has already become clear that, with this strategy, it is not necessary to increase our investment in Gestetner.' Inchcape shares yesterday rose by 5p to 448p. The shares have been underperforming the market recently, partly because of concern that the group might launch a full bid for Gestetner, which would probably have involved a rights issue. Mr Mackay said he was confident of continuing progress at Gestetner. Mr David Thompson, Gestetner's chairman, said: 'We are comfortable that Inchcape remains a major investor in Gestetner and will continue to explore with them opportunities of mutual advantage . . . We continue to enjoy a good relationship with Ricoh as a major shareholder and as an important supplier of office automation equipment.' Gestetner's principal supplier is Ricoh, but the group said it was shifting emphasis towards flexible sourcing from a variety of suppliers. The distributor also expressed determination to exploit its muscle to gain best buying terms and terms from suppliers, including Ricoh. Gestetner distributes 24 per cent of the Ricoh products sold outside Japan. Gestetner trading profit rose to Pounds 14.1m compared with Pounds 10.7m before exceptionals. Mr Thompson said the group was beginning to reap the benefits of the restructuring actions taken last year. Earnings per share rose to 2.7p, compared with losses of 22.2p or earnings of 0.3p, excluding exceptionals. The interim dividend is 1.2p (1.8p). See Lex</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / The Markets: Employment challenge - Economics Notebook Globalisation is one of those ugly words impossible to avoid when discussing the world economy. It is defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a widening and deepening of companies' operations across borders to produce and sell goods and services in more markets. It involves international investment, trade and collaboration for the purpose of product development, production and sourcing, and marketing. Last week, in its Jobs Study, the Paris-based OECD cleared globalisation of contributing significantly to the sharp rise of unemployment in the industrialised countries to about 35m today. Although the OECD said international economic integration had produced more intense competition and a greater need for economic adjustment among its member countries, it claimed that it had also yielded increased efficiency and welfare. Globalisation has, however, produced sweeping changes in recent years. The chart shows how strongly world wide outflows of foreign direct investment grew in the 1980s. The average annual increase was 29 per cent between 1983 and 1989, nearly three times faster than trade and almost four times faster than world economic growth. The annual number of international collaboration agreements among companies doubled during the 1980s. In manufacturing, international sourcing of components and intermediate goods used to make finished products grew faster than domestic sourcing and now accounts for at least half of imports by the big industrial countries. Behind these broad figures, there was, the OECD says, 'a turbulent process of birth and death of firms, the rise and fall of whole sectors of activity and the reallocation of production within, as well as between, regions and countries'. This resulted in the wholesale destruction of many jobs, perhaps one in 10 a year, but the creation of a similar number of new ones. However, these manifestations of globalisation were largely concentrated in the industrialised countries. In their recent study, Europe in 1998*, economists from the Ereco consortium of European economic institutes described the 1980s 'as a lost decade for developing nations'. The OECD calculates that exports from low-wage countries account for only 1.5 per cent of overall spending on goods and services in its member countries. On present evidence, it concluded, the impact of imports from low wage countries was 'too small to account for a significant part of either current unemployment or falling relative wages of the low skilled' in the industrialised world. This analysis, however, was based on conditions in a world that no longer exists. It is debatable whether globalisation will remain such an intra-OECD phenomenon following the collapse of communism. At a seminar organised by the Guardian newspaper last week, Prof Fritz Scharpf of Germany's Max Planck Institute pointed out that the end of the Soviet Empire had made it safe for companies to invest in low cost countries without fear of expropriation. In a paper prepared for ministers at its annual meeting last week, the OECD acknowledged that globalisation was rapidly involving China and the fast growing Asian economies as well as parts of Latin America and eastern Europe. Ereco expects that the recession-induced slowdown in foreign direct investment in the early 1990s, shown in the chart, will be followed by an increase of about 50 per cent in the world stock of such investment by 1998. The consortium has forecast a doubling to Dollars 80bn in the annual flow of foreign direct investment to the developing world between 1992 and 1998. That would lift the developing countries' share of the world stock of foreign direct investment from the present 20 per cent to 25 per cent. Globalisation could therefore have a far more pronounced impact on employment in the industrialised nations in the years ahead. The good news is that markets in developing countries will be growing fast. But so will be their skills. As Ms DeAnne Julius, the chief economist of British Airways, and Mr Richard Brown, a UK economic consultant, point out in the London Business School's latest International Economic Outlook**, South Korea had more 20 to 24 year olds in education as a proportion of the population than either France or Germany in the late 1980s. The lesson drawn by both Ereco and Brown and Julius is that the OECD countries must focus more on the provision and international trade of services. Brown and Julius warn that manufacturing jobs will become increasingly low paid in the mature economies. According to Ereco, the future will see an increasing hybridisation of manufacturing and service activities at intra and inter-company levels. The consortium cites a Swedish study, showing that already as little as a fifth of labour costs in manufacturing companies goes towards the actual process of manufacturing and assembly. New technologies and materials require more complex distribution networks so that marketing, distribution and after sales service will be of more importance in employment terms. The OECD is commonly described as the club of the world's leading industrialised countries. If these predictions prove true, a new definition will be needed very soon. *Details from Cambridge Econometrics, tel UK 0223 460 760 **Details from Centre for Economic Forecasting, LBS, tel UK 071 262 5050</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Company News: Lufthansa strengthens its old Chinese ties LUFTHANSA, the German flag-carrier, is attempting to cash in on China's developing aviation boom by strengthening its presence as the largest European airline serving the Chinese market. Even though Lufthansa is in the throes of sweeping restructuring in Germany to reduce its losses, it is continuing to grow in China with a series of investments. These range from new direct non-stop flights from Frankfurt, a joint hotel and property venture in Beijing, and the expansion of a big aircraft maintenance and engineering venture with Air China. 'Our investment strategy could have seemed somewhat risky and exaggerated two or three years ago,' said Mr Werner Hupe, general manager of Beijing's Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corporation (Ameco), the biggest western aircraft overhaul and maintenance centre in China, 40 per cent owned by Lufthansa and 60 per cent controlled by Air China. 'But it now looks it was the right thing to do,' he added. Unlike other western airlines, Lufthansa decided not to reduce its air services to China after the Tiananmen Square riots in June 1989. It also went ahead with ambitious investment plans to build, with Chinese, German and South Korean partners, a DM495m (Dollars 351m) hotel and property complex in the Chinese capital, and form the Ameco aircraft maintenance venture. 'We always felt the market potential was huge when you consider that China has a population of 1.1bn people,' Mr Hupe explained. 'Right now, China is the only market where you can sell aircraft.' Domestic air traffic in China has been growing by about 28 to 30 per cent this year over last year. China also recently indicated that it planned to restructure its airline industry and partially open state-owned carriers and airports to foreign investment. The proposal would see the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) spin off the country's six largest airlines into shareholding enterprises with the possibility of foreign carriers acquiring minority stakes. Lufthansa, together with Singapore Airlines, British Airways and Hong-Kong-based Cathay Pacific have already expressed interest in either taking a stake in a Chinese carrier or offering these carriers their consultancy services. The Chinese are placing a big emphasis on developing aviation services. 'Aviation is an important business card for China: if their aircraft operate on time, look good and are technically sound, they will become an important shop window for the country,' Mr Hupe said. The Lufthansa executive also stressed the importance of building up long-term relations with the Chinese. One reason for Lufthansa's strong position in China was the German airline's historical links with the country, he explained. These links go back to the 1930s when the German carrier set up an airline called Euroasia in partnership with the Chinese government. It started by providing mail services from Shanghai to inner Mongolia and Europe, but subsequently developed into an airline operating an internal Chinese network which also served Hanoi and Hong Kong. Although the venture ended in 1940, Lufthansa believes the experience helped Lufthansa rebuild a strong presence in China. The airline is to increase at the end of this month its non-stop weekly flights from Frankfurt to Beijing to four in the face of increasing competition from other European airlines. Tomorrow, it will also be opening the new Beijing Lufthansa Centre, the DM 495m project which includes a luxury hotel run by its Kapinski hotel subsidiary, Beijing's biggest department store, as well as a business centre and residential flats. Lufthansa originally planned to develop eight similar property developments around the world. The Chinese venture, however, was the only one to survive the airline's recent strategic retrenchment in the face of growing losses caused by the decline in the world airline business. The German airline is also expanding its joint venture Ameco maintenance facility, which employs about 4,000 people, with the construction of a new hangar for the maintenance of Boeing 747 jumbo jets. The joint venture is the largest commercial aircraft overhaul and maintenance base in China for western jets. Mr Hupe expects Ameco's workload to continue to grow by about 10 to 12 per cent a year as China increasingly turns to western aircraft powered by western engines. Although doing business in China will remain difficult and risky, the Lufthansa executive with seven years experience of the Chinese aviation industry said patience was likely to pay off in the long term.</p>

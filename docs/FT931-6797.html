			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Expensive reality of road tolls Sir, Your editorial, 'Paying for roads' (February 23), prompts me to inform you of the real cost of road privatisation. My company's vehicles use the Severn River toll crossing every day. It now costs Pounds 9.30 for each heavy goods vehicle to cross into Wales. In the nine months since privatisation these tolls have been raised twice and are now 55 per cent higher than at this time last year.

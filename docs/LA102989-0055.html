			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> INDONESIANS CLEAVE TO CLOVE CIGARETTES  </P> <P> A young woman uses scissors to snip the tobacco strands at either end of the  cigarette while her partner rolls another with frenetic speed.  </P> <P> The partner puts clove-spiked tobacco on a small sheet of cloth and deftly  wraps it in a pre-glued piece of paper.  </P> <P> It's midday. Hot. The air thick with the smell of cloves.  </P> <P> Working since five in the morning, the pair should be on about their 6,000th  cigarette of the day for Indonesia's PT Djarum company.  </P> <P> "Hand rollers are paid by the number they produce," said staff manager  Sugiyanto Utomo, explaining the speed at which the women work.  </P> <P> Sweat dripping from his forehead, he gestured around the cavernous shed where  500 women, mostly young farmers' wives, sit at long benches rolling the pungent  clove cigarettes, a favorite Indonesian indulgence, at one of the largest such  manufacturers.  </P> <P> The clove cigarette industry is so labor intensive, and much of heavily  populated central Java so poor, that the government will not let makers abandon  hand-rolled cigarettes completely.  </P> <P> A large proportion of Djarum's 27,000 workers still roll and pack the clove  cigarettes, or kretek, by hand.  </P> <P> "The average worker gets at least 3,500 rupiah (about $2) a day producing about  4,000 cigarettes," Sugiyanto said, stressing that most produce and earn much  more.  </P> <P> That, coupled with an annual bonus, gives the women far more than the average  Indonesian income of $500 a year.  </P> <P> Cloves were one of the spices that enticed European merchants and colonizers to  the tropical islands of Indonesia in search of fabulous wealth and ways to  enliven European dinner tables.  </P> <P> Several hundred years later, the little clove flower finds its most ardent fan  in Indonesian smokers, who puff well over 100 billion kretek cigarettes a year.  </P> <P> The country grows and exports some of the world's finest tobacco. But most  Indonesian smokers, whether cabinet members or peasants, prefer cigarettes  heavily laced with the dark brown, woody spice.  </P> <P> Kretek, a Javanese onomatopoeia, describes the crackle and spitting of burning  cloves, and it was at Kudus, a smallish town in central Java, that the kretek  was invented.  </P> <P> A little over 100 years ago, Kudus asthma sufferer Haji Jamahri tried cloves as  a cure.  </P> <P> From rubbing clove oil on his chest he progressed to chewing cloves, and  finally the most effective method, mixing ground cloves with pipe tobacco.  </P> <P> The kretek was born.  </P> <P> Although no manufacturer now actively promotes this aspect of their product,  kretek packets do not carry any health warning. Indonesia does not have an  anti-smoking lobby.  </P> <P> PT Djarum, spawned by Haji Jamahri's discovery, is the biggest -- or second  biggest, depending on who's talking -- producer of kretek in the country. It  tussles for the top spot with PT Gudang Garam, located farther east in Java.  </P> <P> Kretek sales raised nearly $600 million in duty for the government last year  from the 10 major manufacturers.  </P> <P> The firms prefer not to open their books to public scrutiny, but their owners,  mostly ethnic Chinese families, are reputed to be among Indonesia's wealthiest.  </P> <P> The kretek, and increasingly the machine-rolled version considered more  sophisticated, is fast taking over from ordinary tobacco. In eight years,  market share for ordinary tobacco has plunged from 40% to just over 10%.  </P> <P> "It's hard to say what the difference is," one addict said. "Once I tried  foreign cigarettes, but kretek is still the best."  </P> <P> Most Indonesians seem to feel much the same. As the Djarum company handbook  says, "Cigarettes must be able to deliver maximum ecstasy and peace of mind."  </P></p>

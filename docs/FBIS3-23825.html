			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Petrakov, director of the Institute </F> of Market Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, by T.  Pomelova; place and date not given: "Reform of Reform: Economic  Change or Economic Revolution?"]    [Text] Opinions regarding the recently declared new state  policy priorities (easing the excessively tough monetarist  methods, support of production, etc.) have divided basically  into two irreconcilable directions. One unconditionally supports  the strategy and tactics of the radicals who have just left the  government, and the other just as energetically rejects them.  The discussion is stimulating the emergence in the world of the  most diverse projects, programs, and studies, of which the  greatest prominence was received by the joint report of the  economics department of the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences]  and the Reform International Fund under the title "Socioeconomic  Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches."  At the end of last week its authors--Academicians S. Shatalin,  L. Abalkin, and N. Petrakov--presented their work for the  consideration of their economist colleagues and also of deputies  of the State Duma.    Tatyana Zaslavskaya and Artem Tarasov and Sergey Baburin and  Vadim Medvedev, a former member of the CPSU Central Committee,  were among those who came to the presentation. Not all the  guests decided to speak at this discussion, to which many  probably came out of curiosity. But the positions of those who  nonetheless expressed opinions with regard to the program were  very contradictory. Just as, however, the program of the "three  academicians" itself was contradictory. After the meeting we  were able to interview one of the developers, Nikolay Petrakov,  director of the RAN Institute of Market Problems. But first,  here are several quotations from the draft "Socioeconomic  Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and New Approaches."    "While favorably assessing the movement to a market economy  that is under way, it is necessary to note the continuously  increasing, and in many ways excessive, `price' that society has  already paid and will be compelled to pay for the adopted  strategy and tactics of the transition to the market. Just in  the last two years the drop in production, according to the most  important macro-indices, totaled about 30 percent. In addition,  it is important to emphasize that the drop in production, first,  has not a structural but a general character and, second, it hit  the most progressive and highly technological branches and types  of production in the greatest degree."    "Under current conditions, the loss of volume of production  is a market loss; moreover, not only of the world market (for  example, in the aerospace industry, in the production of  armaments, etc.), but of the domestic market as well. However,  once having yielded a place on the market, it is extremely  difficult to regain this niche."    "The drop in investment activity is most profound and  dangerous in its socioeconomic consequences."    "It was still not possible after two years to normalize the  budget system, despite enlisting huge credits of the Central  Bank and the artificial withdrawal of resources from the Pension  Fund. The result of unreasoned actions, the payments crisis, and  the inability to guarantee normal tax receipts only undermined  the income base of the budget and caused its chronic deficit."    "The choice of strategy of socioeconomic reorganization is a  very complicated process that demands not only detailed  scientific study but also due regard for the popular will and  the consent of the leading sociopolitical forces and movements."    It is necessary:    "to define and formulate the social indicators of reform:  its  aims and also boundaries and limits, whose traversal is  impermissible under any circumstances or for any reason  (guaranteed subsistence minimum, employment threshold, share of  expenditures for education and health services in the GNP  structure, and others)";    "to reject the naive belief in the automatism of improving  the economy with the help of depersonalized monetarism and to  restore state regulation in its natural and generally accepted  functions";    "to switch to new principles of financial stabilization on  the basis of combining a tough financial-credit policy with  selective support of priority spheres and production, use of  various forms of regulation of prices and incomes (including the  help of establishing price parities, cartel agreements, etc.),  and perfection of tax and budget policy."    [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, ex-minister Boris Fedorov in  his last statement appealed to the president with the statement  that an economic overturn is occurring in the country. Do you  agree with such a categorical assertion?    [Petrakov] In my opinion, the government is now in a certain  rigidity: It either faces a change, or it faces a "revolution."  But this is not the point. I do not entirely understand  Fedorov's position, also Gaydar's and Chubays'--in a word,  people of a reformist inclination who steered the economic ship  of our country. What do the macroeconomic methods they employed  represent? Two levers were engaged in the fight against  inflation. First, a sharp reduction in the expenditure part of  the budget. Second, the same kind of sharp increase in taxes.  Everything is "transparent," as in school: In order to finance  the budget, it is necessary to reduce expenditures and increase  taxes. This is the essence of "shock therapy" in the Russian  rendition. Moreover, it is proposed that we go further on this  same simple path.    Now, let us take a look at what happens with expenditures.  Really, expenditures are compressed to all reasonable and  unreasonable limits. Moreover, reasonableness in the reduction  of expenditures already exhausted itself in the first half of  1992. Further, the reduction was already some kind of irrational  number. As a result, all budgetary spheres fell into poverty.  Education, culture, science, and health services--wages for  workers there were lower by a factor of three to eight than in  industry, not to mention commerce.    Or let us take another method, which was used by Minister of  Finance Fedorov in fighting inflation. This is nonpayment for  purchased products. It became a tradition to rebuke agriculture  for the fact that it made requests. But let us analyze this:  People were told that products were being bought from them at a  certain price. This was the state order and mandatory deliveries  that the peasant could not avoid, and he sent all his grain to  the market. So they set the price, and they received the grain.  But they did not want to settle accounts. That is, they simply  took it. Is it possible to consider such methods state economic  policy? This is no better than the surplus appropriation system  of the Bolsheviks. These are absolutely not economic methods,  which for some reason are presented as a monetarist approach.    [Pomelova] Can you mention some decisions of the ministers  who have left that would meet with your approval?    [Petrakov] Hardly. When they announced that it was necessary  to continue, it was not clear just what to continue. We were  already up against the wall. For example, we could raise tax  rates more and more. But what will this lead to? After all,  business activity is already almost stifled by taxes. Instead of  broadening the tax base and stimulating production with normal  taxes, they simply took a colossal part of the profits. Although  this had its own defects, and taxes were simply appropriated.    [Pomelova] But after all, there were periods of a real drop  in inflation during 1993.    [Petrakov] But at whose expense did this occur? From the  standpoint of economists, the temporary successes were achieved  in a very strange way. In autumn I was invited to an expanded  meeting of the Council of Ministers, where I heard a report by  Chernomyrdin. He talked about the fact that the country had  harvested 100 million tonnes at a time when it was expected that  115 million tonnes would be harvested. The "full amount was not  gathered," because agricultural enterprises lacked the financial  resources, and this means because of an inability to pay for  fuel and materials. Because the minister of finance delayed the  allocation of credits for the harvest campaign. In the end he  issued them nonetheless, but many rayons received the money with  significant delays.    Of course, this had a beneficial effect on the inflation  indices. But multiply $120 per tonne of grain (this is  approximately the world price) by 15 million, and you will see  what the cost of the game came to in the economy.    In October, when we also observed a reduction in inflation,  the situation was somewhat different. At the end of 1993, as at  the end of 1992, the payments that the government were supposed  to conduct in November-December were carried over to  January-February 1994. The total indebtedness was on the order  of 7.6 trillion rubles [R].    Generally speaking, when a professional comes to the  leadership of the economy of the country, having a specific  program, he is obligated to take into account the degree of  resistance of the "object" to which his program is addressed.  And if anyone supposed that "shock therapy," which caused a  lowering of the standard of living for an overwhelming number of  people, would be favorably received by them, then they are naive  or infantile. It is necessary to remember the reaction of a  patient when he is operated on without an anesthetic.    [Pomelova] Nikolay Yakovlevich, how can the policy you  propose with your program be characterized? Is this a complete  turnaround from the former direction of reform? "Healing the  wound" after an unsuccessful economic operation?    [Petrakov] I think that even if "wounded," we should crawl  to  the market. Obviously the 70-year experiment to create an  alternative socialist economy failed. But today the movement  toward a market is occurring under conditions that are  absolutely different from those of two years ago. The present  stage is distinguished by mass disappointment in market ideas. I  am not talking, of course, about employers and the employees of  their firms, but about a majority of the citizens. It is very  difficult now to change their minds and get them to believe in  the advantages of a market economy. In essence, good ideas are  being discredited by unskilfull realization. Nothing has such an  influence on the mass consciousness as very specific examples  from everyday life. The examples speak of price increases, pay  delays...    Thus, on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome the  skepticism of the people, and on the other, the criminalization  of the Russian economy. After all, prices were demonopolized  without destroying state monopolies. The latter were under the  complete command of specific groups of persons who were closer  to these monopolies. Moreover, they got the right to free price  formation. These are "capitalists" who do not need a civilized  market: They do not want competition, clear tax legislation, or  a well-organized customs service. A semicriminal market suits  them. But such a market does not give a boost to the economy.    This means that it is necessary to create competition and  develop clear-cut legislation so that our capital remains in  Russia and foreign capital comes to Russia.    [Pomelova] The main argument of your opponents is that every  kind of assistance to production or the village and any credits  and privileges in the final analysis hit the pocket of the same  impoverished population: After all, where else can income for  the budget be obtained, if not from the purses of citizens, by  imposing ever higher taxes on them?    [Petrakov] I am convinced that taxes should be lowered right  now. Moreover, possibly, double taxation of enterprises should  be abandoned, inasmuch as the value added tax already includes  in itself a tax on profit.    On the other hand, why are we raising taxes? In order to pay  an acceptable wage to officers, teachers, and doctors. And they  have to be paid more and more, because prices are increasing.  But why are prices increasing? Because any new tax or an  increase in the rate of an already existing tax is already  included in the price. We have a monopolized market, a  producer's market; consequently, all costs are immediately  included in the price. A person sees another increase in prices,  he goes on strike, and his wage is increased. And so on,  endlessly. That which we gain on taxes, we right away lose on  wages. The tax becomes one of the main inflationary factors.    [Pomelova] Is it possible unequivocally to divide methods of  managing the economy into market and antimarket methods?    [Petrakov] Imagine street traffic. It is subject to specific  rules, you cannot drive through a red light or make a turn in an  unauthorized place. But you are free to drive to wherever you  want. But you can also be issued a travel authorization sheet  that strictly directs movement from point A to point B, and even  to load up with sand. The first example is a market measure, the  second a nonmarket measure.    Taxes, privileges, and various interest rates for  credits--these are market measures. In other words, market  measures are an expression of the state's priorities.    [Pomelova] Are there any guarantees that support of  production and the agrarian sector and the accelerated increase  in the standard of living of citizens will not lead to a  "Ukrainization" of the Russian economy?    [Petrakov] The difficult economic situation in Ukraine is  caused by quite specific errors on the part of the Ukrainian  leadership. But other factors should also not be forgotten. This  country does not possess the necessary economic  self-sufficiency. It has practically no energy sources. It  imports oil, gas, and timber from Russia at world prices. But  the export capabilities of Ukraine are extremely limited:  Consumer goods produced there are of a low quality, and the West  does not need agricultural products at all. Farmers are being  paid there not to expand production. Thus, the sources of hard  currency revenues are extremely limited, and this is the main  reason for the decline in the Ukrainian economy.    The situation in Russia is entirely different. Energy  resources keep us and will continue to keep us afloat. But our  inflation rates give no justification to boast before Ukraine.  When they say that the ruble has started working, they do not  mention that they want to spend it immediately. And until it  becomes a means of accumulation, it will remain a falling  currency, and until that time we will be unable to ensure normal  business activity. [end Petrakov]    From the editorial office. The draft  "Socioeconomic Reorganization in Russia: Current Situation and  New Approaches" has evoked a lot of criticism. In our opinion,  it suffers from excessive emotionalism in its assessment of the  policy being conducted and of the politicians who are conducting  it. On the other hand, the specific approaches proposed by the  authors to put their program into practice are not entirely  clear. For example, lowering taxes and in this way expanding the  tax base (that is, the number of enterprise commodity producers  and the volume of products that they produce) can improve the  budget only in the future, and not in the very near future. At  whose expense should production, which is dying today, be  supported?    Nevertheless, the program has sharply stated a problem to  which we can no longer remain thoughtlessly indifferent. The  drop in production has reached a critical line. But production  in our country is not only an economic factor, it is also a  social and political factor. Its crash is capable of provoking a  crash of stability in Russia. It is also impossible not to  mention Artem Tarasov's praise regarding the study: "Perhaps  this is the first time we are being familiarized with a draft of  an economic concept that can be discussed, and not with a ready  guide for action published in a newspaper."</p>

Speaking in Dar es Salaam, accompanied by OAU Secretary  General Brother Salim Ahmed Salim, Honorable John Malecela,  prime minister and first vice president, said the situation in  Burundi is still deplorable. He said the increased influx of  Burundi refugees into Tanzania is an indication that killings  are continuing in the country.    Brother Salim, who is in the country on a one-week tour,  visited the prime minister at his home in (Osterbay) in Dar es  Salaam to brief him on the prevailing situation in Burundi.  During the talks, the OAU secretary general briefed Hon.  Malecela on the OAU's efforts to send a peacekeeping force to  Burundi.    The OAU secretary general leaves for Zanzibar tomorrow to  attend celebrations to mark the 30th anniversary of the Zanzibar  revolution.</p>

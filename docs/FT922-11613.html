			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German data frighten senior bourses GERMANY'S M3 data frightened senior bourses but tyre stocks bucked the trend, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell just before the close on the release of worse-than-expected money supply growth figures for March. They caused the DAX index to shed a 2.42-point gain and close down 0.86 at 1,752.44. The FAZ index, calculated at midsession, added 0.69 to 714.57. Turnover rose to DM6.1bn from DM5.5bn. Auto stocks continued to improve, following Volkswagen's strong performance on Wednesday, and prospects of good results at the car companies' press conferences next month. Daimler, which recently reported strong sales of its new S model in the first two months of this year, closed up DM2.50 at DM790.50, but off the day's high of DM795.50. Volkswagen rose DM1.70 to DM383.50. Continental hit a 1992 high of DM279.50 before closing up DM8.80 or 3.2 per cent at DM277.50. The stock is benefitting from the rise in Michelin shares in Paris and from reports that Pirelli of Italy has resumed cooperation talks with Continental. Linotype-Hell fell to DM372 after omitting its dividend on 1991 results. But news that first quarter orders had risen by 15 per cent helped it recover to close just DM2 down at DM383. PARIS was pulled from the day's high by a drop in the bond market, after the German figures dashed hopes of an interest rate cut. The CAC-40 index rose to 1,995.21 before ending down 5.54 at 1,978.14. Volume was a heavy FFr3.4bn, bloated by activity linked to the close of the April account yesterday. Michelin remained strong after its results last week, adding FFr11.10 or 5.7 per cent to FFr204.80 in heavy volume of 1.8m shares. There were reports that analysts were upgrading their forecasts following a meeting with the company on Wednesday. However, some dealers said the stock was looking expensive now that it had risen above FFr200. MILAN continued to focus on Fiat and Pirelli. The Comit index rose 3.00 to 510.14 in turnover estimated at L60-80bn after L58.3bn. Fiat closed L145 higher at L4,945, as dealers were encouraged by Wednesday's comments on its car operations. Pirelli added L44 to L1,340 on continued foreign buying. The stock is widely seen as a turnround situation, with break even expected this year and a return to profit in 1993. Sasib, part of the De Benedetti group, was unchanged at L5,975. After the close, the diversified mechanical engineering company announced a 4 per cent rise in net profit to L73.2bn, slightly ahead of expectations, though some London analysts were disappointed that the dividend had not been raised. STOCKHOLM rebounded from a weak opening to close broadly higher, thanks to demand for Asea and Volvo ahead of their annual meetings. The Affarsvarlden general index rose 4.2 to 984.2 in turnover of SKr837m after SKr491m. Astra fell further after the company said it would go ahead with a plan to drop restrictions on foreign share ownership. Its B free shares lost SKr13 to SKr514 while its A frees fell SKr22 to SKr530, reducing the 'free' premium to just 3 per cent. Its A shares eased SKr5 to SKr514. Some analysts recommended picking up the shares, now that the foreign ownership uncertainty was out of the way. AMSTERDAM resisted the fall in neighbouring Germany and the CBS Tendency index rose 0.9 to 127.8 in turnover of Fl 692m. The chemicals sector was strong with DSM and Akzo both rising Fl 1.80 to Fl 111.10 and Fl 152.30 respectively. Polygram closed up 50 cents at Fl 48.80, just off an intraday year's high of Fl 48.90, on UK buying. Nedlloyd was Fl 2.10 stronger at Fl 56.70 following Wednesday's results. BRUSSELS rose at the start of the new forward account. The Bel-20 index gained 6.24 to 1,205.43. Solvay, which said that it was buying Tenneco's US minerals operation, rose BFr225 or 1.8 per cent to BFr12,650. ZURICH was lifted by foreign interest in cyclical stocks. The SMI index rose 5.4 to 1,880.1. Brown Boveri bearers rose SFr120 to SFr4,200 while Georg Fischer bearers advanced SFr20 to SFr1,140. MADRID's general index shed 1.82 to 249.59. Telefonica lost nearly 4 per cent to close down Pta40 at Pta1,015 in high volume.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1173.80  1173.22  1172.86  1173.60  1171.48  1169.28  1169.25  1169.11  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High  1174.19    Day's Low  1168.78  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Apr 22     Apr 21     Apr 16    Apr 15    Apr 14     1171.34    1166.73    1169.83   1167.06   1157.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

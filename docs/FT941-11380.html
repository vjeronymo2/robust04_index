			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Observer: Baker's interval First David Mellor, ex-heritage minister, takes up an arts column for The Guardian newspaper. Now Kenneth Baker, former education and home secretary and ex-chairman of the Conservative party, is doing a stint as theatre critic for the Sunday Express. Baker fancies himself as a literary chap; he has edited anthologies of English literature and has been a frequent theatre-goer for years. His new job won't interfere with his parliamentary duties; being a critic means that after first nights - which start early - he can be back in the House by 10pm.</p>

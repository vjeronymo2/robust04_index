			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 OFFICERS CHARGED WITH ROBBING 3 ALIENS  </P> <P> Two San Diego police officers were arrested Thursday and charged with kidnaping  and robbing three Latino illegal aliens while patrolling the downtown area in  two separate incidents last year.  </P> <P> Officers Lloyd J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf later appeared in San Diego  Municipal Court where, dressed in dark blue jail garb, they entered not-guilty  pleas to five felony counts each of kidnaping, kidnaping for robbery, and  robbery.  </P> <P> If convicted, each could face a maximum sentence of life in prison.  </P> <P> Although the officers were not charged with assaulting the three undocumented  workers, a court affidavit filed in the case alleges that Hoff swung his  flashlight and struck one of the migrant workers in the testicles, then pushed  him into a puddle of water.  </P> <P> Municipal Judge Timothy W. Tower ordered the officers held without bail, at  least until a bail review hearing can be held this morning.  </P> <P> The officers, whom police officials said were fired Thursday, did not speak  during the brief court appearance. But their defense attorneys blasted the  district attorney's office for carrying out a "vendetta" against the officers  and for not having the courage to recognize that the charges were unfounded.  </P> <P> The defense attorneys contended that the victims cannot be trusted, noting that  one of them is currently in jail in El Cajon on theft charges.  </P> <P> "These officers are totally devastated. They couldn't understand why these  charges were brought," said Everett Bobbitt, Schaaf's attorney. "They're both  married, with kids. They both have roots in this community."  </P> <P> Michael R. Pent, a deputy prosecutor in the district attorney's special  operations unit, said his office had no hidden agenda in bringing the case  against the policemen.  </P> <P> Both officers, assigned to the Central Area station which covers the downtown  district, are white, a fact that some San Diego civil rights activists pointed  to in alleging that racial discrimination against Latino migrants is rising.  </P> <P> "These are Latinos being attacked by white people," said activist Roberto  Martinez, who described the incidents as "hate crimes" perpetrated by law  officers. "There's just too much of this going on, people taking advantage of  illegals because of their status and the color of their skin."  </P> <P> But police spokesman Capt. Dick Toneck said the case is evidence that the  police are tough on officers who allegedly abuse minorities.  </P> <P> "We're not going to tolerate this kind of conduct from our officers," he said.  "And no officers on our department will condone this kind of activity."  </P> <P> In one incident, according to an affidavit filed in court by police  investigators, Hoff and Schaaf stopped Rolando Carrera-Reyes, 23, in the early  morning of Aug. 4. They searched him and took his wallet, according to the  affidavit, removing $25 and a medical identification card.  </P> <P> "Hoff struck Carrera-Reyes twice in the testicles with the flashlight," the  affidavit said. "Both officers swore at Carrera-Reyes."  </P> <P> The second incident allegedly occurred a week later, when the two officers  stopped Javier Perez-Gonzalez and Ramiro Rodriguez, both 21.  </P> <P> The migrants said the officers ordered them into their patrol car and drove  them to another downtown location, where Hoff took $41, some loose change and a  cigarette lighter from Perez-Gonzalez. Later, Rodriguez said, he was robbed by  Schaaf of about $100 and a black comb.  </P></p>

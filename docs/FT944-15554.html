			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / Business and the Law: Tetra Pak appeal - European Law Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, recently lost its appeal to the Court of First Instance against a record Ecu75m (Pounds 58.8m) fine levied by the European Commission for breach of the Rome Treaty competition rules. The case, which involved a six-year investigation by the Commission followed by a two-year administrative procedure, concerned the commercial policy adopted by Tetra Pak in the European Community since 1976 in respect of its packaging machines and cartons. The Commission found Tetra Pak had a dominant position in the markets for machines and cartons intended for the aseptic packaging of liquid foods in the EC, and that it had abused that position both in those markets and in the neighbouring markets for non-aseptic machines and cartons. Non-aseptic food packaging does not require the same degree of sterility as aseptic packaging and so calls for less sophisticated equipment. Tetra Pak denied it was in a dominant position in the EC and that it had infringed the competition rules. First, it disputed the Commission's definitions of the product market and geographical market. Second, it disputed that it was in a dominant position in the markets for aseptic products. Finally, it disputed whether the relevant EC competition rules applied to Tetra Pak's conduct in the neighbouring markets for non-aseptic products, in which it was not dominant. In defining the product market, the Court held that it was necessary to take account of all the competitive conditions in the general market for the packaging of liquid food products when determining whether the Commission was correct in finding that there were distinct markets for aseptic and non-aseptic machines and cartons. The Commission was right to determine this issue on the basis of whether other products were sufficiently interchangeable with the particular markets, and to apply this test to the packaging systems themselves and not to the finished products (for example, milk cartons). Given this, the Court found, on the facts the Commission had established to the requisite legal standards, that the markets for aseptic and non-aseptic machines and cartons were distinct from the general market in systems for packaging liquid food products. With regard to the geographical market, the Court held that this consisted of a territory in which all traders operated under the same conditions of competition as far as the relevant products were concerned. The Commission's definition of the market as covering the whole EC market was thus correct, as demand was stable throughout the EC, customers could obtain supplies in other member states and the products themselves could be easily transported between member states. With regard to dominance of the aseptic markets, the Court had little difficulty supporting the Commission's findings, as these showed the applicant had 90 per cent of the market in aseptic machines and cartons throughout the EC. With regard to the Commission's finding that Tetra Pak had abused its dominant position in the neighbouring market of non-aseptic products, in which it was not dominant, the Court said a company in a dominant position had a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair genuine, undistorted competition on the common market. The actual scope of this special responsibility depended on the specific circumstances of each case. In the present case, both aseptic and non-aseptic products were used for packaging the same liquid food products, and a substantial proportion of Tetra Pak's customers operated in both areas. Given these facts, the Court held that the Commission was entitled to find that the links between the aseptic and non-aseptic markets reinforced the applicant's economic power over those markets, without there being a need to establish the existence of a dominant position on the non-aseptic markets. Tetra Pak also claimed that its conduct was not abusive. The Court found, among other things, that customer contracts which tied machine users to using Tetra Pak's cartons were not objectively justified and were intended to strengthen the company's dominant position by reinforcing its customers' economic dependence on it. The Court also found that the company's prices at certain times were below variable costs and that this was evidence of predatory pricing, as no dominant company had any interest in applying such prices except to eliminate competitors. A number of other procedural pleas raised by Tetra Pak, including submissions on the level of the record fine, were dismissed. Tetra Pak International SA v Commission, CFI 2CH, 6 October 1994.</p>

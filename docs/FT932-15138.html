			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke to hear City on insider trading MR KENNETH Clarke, the home secretary, last night promised further consultations with the Stock Exchange and other City authorities to ensure that more stringent curbs on insider dealing do not inhibit legitimate trading processes. He told the Commons that Treasury ministers handling the Criminal Justice Bill believed they could allay fears that normal practices based on expertise might be affected. Mr Robert Maclennan for the Liberal Democrats led protests that City interests and the CBI had not been adequately consulted before the bill was given a second reading by the Lords last November. Mr Clarke acknowledged the difficulties experienced in mounting successful prosecutions under the existing law and stressed the importance of ensuring that the new provisions were correctly drafted so that the law could be effectively enforced. Insisting that legitimate business practices would not be jeopardised, he said: 'Nothing in the bill will prevent the sort of contact between companies and investors which properly take place today.' Nor would it require changes to the legitimate practices of investment analysts, or involve any modification of underwriting arrangements. Mr Clarke confirmed that it would continue to be an offence for an insider who possessed inside information or someone who had obtained information from an insider to take advantage of it by dealing in securities to make a profit or avoid a loss. Mr Clarke said the new legislation would apply to all listed securities, and to all securities which were traded on exchanges throughout the EC, rather than just those which operated in the UK. Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said nothing in the bill would prevent meetings between companies and institutional investors, or occasional meetings with analysts. The bill was given an unopposed second reading.</p>

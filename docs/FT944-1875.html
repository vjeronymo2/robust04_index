			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): Directors' dealings Traditionally Christmas is a period of good cheer in the City when the market rallies, writes Vivien MacDonald of The Inside Track. The absence of such a rally this year may make some people despondent, but the number of directors beginning to buy shares again should offer a glimmer of good spirits. In the past, increasing numbers of directors buying has presaged a rise in the market. Better news is filtering in from the US where the bears are slightly in retreat and the bulls are coming back. This would be genuinely good news for the market though its impact may not come through till the new year. Filofax, the company that supplies specialised stationery, has featured several times in this column over the past year as directors have bought large quantities of stock. The sale by Robert Collischon, the chairman, of 20,008 shares at 223p still leave him with over 1.76m shares. The shares have performed well over the past year, recording an out-performance of some 43 per cent relative to the market. Williams Holdings is a group with diverse interests - ranging from homes and garden through to specialist engineering. The shares have been performing steadily. Earlier this year the company had a rights issue and the recent sale made by AN Rudd was in order to fund the rights he took up at that point.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Directors' share transactions in their own companies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                            Value        No of Company                 Sector     Shares  Pounds '000  directors  --------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Cater Allen             OthF        4,108       20         1 Filofax                 OS&amp;B       20,008       45         1 Logica                  SSer      100,000      317         1 Plasmec                 Elec       28,000       34         1 Ramco Energy            Oil        24,800       62         1 Warner Howard           SSer        4,000       12         1 Williams Holdings       DvI       126,866      441         1 Marks &amp; Spencer         RetG       31,000      123         1* Reuters                 Mdia       28,128      134         1*  --------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES AAH                     Hlth        4,100       14         1 Arlen                   Elec      263,758       78         2 Blenheim Group          Mdia       50,000      122         1 Capital Gearing Tst     InvT        5,000       24         1 Eclipse Blinds          BM&amp;M      100,000       10         1 Evans of Leeds          Prop      100,000       97         1 Filofax                 OS&amp;B       29,850       66         1 Greycoat                Prop      100,000      124         1 Latham (J)              BM&amp;M        6,000       12         1 Merivale Moore          Prop       75,000       41         1 Oriflame Intl           HGod      100,000      267         1 Prospect Ind            Eng       200,000       28         1 Quadramatic             Eng        40,000       72         1 SEET                    Text      170,000       90         1 Takare                  Hlth       10,000       20         1 Waste Recycling         OS&amp;B       15,000       10         1 Witan Inv               InvT        5,164       12         1  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Companies must notify the Stock Exchange within five working days of a share transaction by a director.

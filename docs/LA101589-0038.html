			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITALS ADD BEAUTY AS TREATMENT OPTION;  </P> <P> HEALTH: HAIRCUTS, MANICURES AND COLOR EVALUATIONS ARE BEING TRIED OUT TO GIVE  PATIENTS A BOOST.  </P> <P> One man enjoyed a massage while two women had their hair and nails done. Mellow  jazz played on a tape deck while a small group gathered around the hors  d'oeuvres table for conversation.  </P> <P> The gathering that had all the trappings of an exclusive beauty salon was  actually part of the therapy program offered to patients at the mental health  ward at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla.  </P> <P> "How one feels about oneself has a definite effect on how you function in  society," said Dr. Leighton Huey, medical director of the hospital's mental  health unit. "We're using this experience to try to elevate their  self-awareness."  </P> <P> During the carefully orchestrated sessions, patients are offered haircuts,  massages and tips on improving their dress. Some patients even have their  "colors" selected by trained fashion experts.  </P> <P> Those services might seem mundane but they do help many depressed patients  "feel better about themselves," according to Melodie Lohr, director of the  hospital's expressive arts program.  </P> <P> Scripps has for several months offered the "beauty wellness" program to  patients elsewhere in the hospital for a fee. Typically, the service is paid  for by individual patients who face more time in a hospital bed -- or who want  to spruce up before being discharged.  </P> <P> But the mental health ward has gone a step further and incorporated the beauty  program into its drug and therapy programs, Lohr said.  </P> <P> Health professionals at other hospitals acknowledged that the common-sense  approach probably pays dividends.  </P> <P> "It makes sense that with depression self-image is part of the problem,"  according to Leslie Satz, a nurse practitioner with the Veterans Administration  outpatient program here. Satz plans to initiate a similar -- but decidedly  lower-key -- program later this year at the VA's Mission Valley clinic.  </P> <P> "We're trying to teach depressed patients to dress better and to take better  care of their personal appearance," Satz said. "Because, if self-image is a  problem, one way to help . . . is to give (that person) a boost."  </P> <P> The VA program will be run by beauty counselors from local J. C. Penney Co.  stores. The chain will make the beauty experts available to VA patients to  provide make-overs and fashion tips at no cost. They also will provide fabric  swatches that patients can use to determine the most appropriate colors to  wear.  </P> <P> The VA program, which is aimed at female veterans who are being treated on an  outpatient basis for mild psychiatric problems, will not be as in-depth as the  program offered by Scripps, according to Satz.  </P> <P> Scripps' "beauty wellness" program has elicited dramatic responses from some  patients who did not respond to traditional treatments, Lohr said. For example,  two depressed male patients, both of whom had exhibited "robot-like" behavior,  surprised Scripps' staff by lining up for massages.  </P> <P> "They had been non-responsive to traditional therapies," Lohr said. But, after  the massages, both men "even had their colors done," Lohr said. The men  subsequently seemed better able -- and more willing -- to socialize with other  patients and staff members.  </P> <P> Socialization is an important part of the program, Lohr said. Doctors and  nurses typically are first in line to get facials, manicures or massages  because depressed patients often are hesitant to join in the action, Lohr said.  </P> <P> But patients soon realize that the beauticians are not a threat, and "all of a  sudden there's this interaction going on with the other patients," Lohr said.  Patients "learn skills that will help them when it comes time" to return to  general society, Lohr said.  </P> <P> Scripps' "beauty wellness" program is operated by Fashion on Location, a San  Diego-based company that provides on-site beauty care for corporations, film  companies and hospitals.  </P> <P> Only a fraction of the firm's in-hospital work, however, is done in mental  health wards. For the most part, it provides beauty care to patients who are  recuperating after surgery or who are about to be released.  </P> <P> Douglas Gordon, the firm's founder and president, believes "beauty wellness"  programs can speed the recovery of patients who have undergone surgery -- as  well as those who are hospitalized for mental health treatment.  </P> <P> Scripps "has told us that the sessions really break down barriers, and the  patients and staff begin bonding together," Gordon said.  </P> <P> Patients being treated for depression at Scripps are not billed separately for  services provided by Fashion on Location. Patients elsewhere in the hospital --  and other hospitals serviced by the company -- are, however, billed by Fashion  on Location for haircuts, beauty treatments and the like. A simple haircut and  a blow-dry styling would cost about $25.  </P> <P> Susan Blumenthal, a psychiatrist and chief of the behavioral medicine program  at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., gives a qualified  endorsement to the appearance factor in mental health treatment.  </P> <P> "What is important is that this be an adjunct to therapy, that it not replace  psychotherapy or medication," Blumenthal said in a telephone interview.  "Learning that you look better and draw a more positive response by dressing in  certain colors won't cure depression. But it might help them to take control or  charge of their life a little more."  </P> <P> Blumenthal said she has not heard of other programs similar to those at the VA  and Scripps. "Things always seem to start in California," she quipped.  </P> <P> Fashion on Location's employees receive special training before working in  hospitals because "most beauticians are not set up" to work with patients,  according to Bruce Bainbridge, a part-time critical care nurse at Chula Vista  Community Hospital who runs the firm's hospital division.  </P> <P> "There are protocols for working in that kind of an environment . . . and there  are things you can and can't do," Bainbridge said. "Most people aren't used to  (patients with) a tube coming out of their nose and a few tubes going into  their arms. Many people get queasy with that sort of thing."  </P> <P> "People who are getting ready to go back into society don't want to go back  looking like hell," Bainbridge said. "You want the reaction as you go out the  front door that you're looking good."  </P></p>

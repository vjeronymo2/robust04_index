			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Gatt regime may outlive French revolution FRANCE'S explosion of fury on Wednesday, inside and outside the parliamentary walls of the Palais-Bourbon, was a moment of maximum heat and minimum light in the country's reaction to the EC's draft farm deal with the US. Maximum heat, because MPs were giving their first reaction to the Gatt deal in a televised debate under extra-mural pressure from several thousand protesting farmers. Minimum light, because MPs were at that point still in the dark about the details of the Washington accord and of the European Commission's judgment on it. An outpouring of emotion about the need to preserve the French rural way of life from attack by US agri-business - uncluttered by technicalities about the precise extent of that attack - was just what the government wanted, and why it rushed the debate onto parliament's agenda. Equally important was to trumpet the threat of a French veto early and loudly. As Liberation commented yesterday, resort to the Luxembourg compromise is like nuclear deterrence. 'As with the atomic bomb, one has to talk about it as much as possible so as never to have to resort to it,' the newspaper said. Mr Bruno Durieux, the French trade minister, claimed yesterday that having brandished the veto threat, 'we have already benefited from half its effect' in frightening partners in the EC and adversaries in Gatt. So, the government got a 301 to 251 majority for its motion complaining that Brussels had 'gone beyond' its Council of Ministers mandate in striking the farm deal, and calling for an EC ministerial meeting at which Paris 'will confirm it will veto any draft agreement contrary to France's fundamental interests'. Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy had hoped for unanimous backing. But, because the declaration was cast in the nature of a motion of confidence in the government, the opposition, strong-armed by the RPR Gaullists, voted pretty solidly against. Yet, Mr Beregovoy's anti-Gatt tactics were scarcely undermined by this. For the opposition said they wanted even tougher action, demanding immediate use of France's veto and a re-opening of EC negotiations with the US. The prime minister refused to narrow his room for manoeuvre to this extent. Better still from his viewpoint, the CNJA young farmers' union bridled at the opposition's divisive tactics and threatened to take it out on them at next March's parliamentary elections. Mr Jacques Chirac, RPR president, sought to limit any electoral damage. A post-March conservative government, he said, 'will take on, if need be, a European crisis by vetoing a policy or concessions to the Americans which do not take France's interests into account'. Is France, therefore, set on a collision course with its EC partners over Gatt? Certainly, that was on Wednesday what the government seemed to want the world to think. But yesterday Mr Beregovoy appeared to be softening his stance. He went as far as to say that France's veto threat on the agricultural agreement with Washington was 'not intended to paralyse negotiations' in the world trade talks. Any crisis scenario has to take account of three variables: The timetable. The French prime minister was very careful to say that France would use its veto 'at all stages of the procedure, from the moment a legal text (on the Gatt farm deal) is presented to it'. That could be a long way off. France yesterday asked the British presidency for a jumbo meeting of EC foreign and farm ministers as soon as possible. But even if the UK agrees to such a meeting, there would not be on the table any legal text enshrining the Washington deal, with its 21 per cent cuts in subsidised EC farm exports and restraint on oilseeds output, into EC law. The decision to table EC texts lies with the presidency - Britain for the next six weeks and Denmark for the six months thereafter. 'Now that all the world now knows that France will veto the Washington deal, it will be up to the British and then the Danish to decide when that veto comes,' said a close aide to Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, agriculture minister. Allies. France is now busy calling in its cards with potential allies; it has even reminded Spain of its role in rounding up Basque terrorists on the French side of the border. Paris hopes it can count on Latin support from the south, and on specific farm sector anxieties in northern states like Denmark and the Netherlands. This lies behind France's request for farm ministers to join their foreign affairs counterparts in a jumbo Gatt session. But key to these countries' attitudes will be that of Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Germany's backing was invoked by Mr Beregovoy on Wednesday and by Mrs Elisabeth Guigou, France's EC minister, yesterday. The German chancellor is clearly wavering on the fence. This week he told the Bundestag he hoped for French approval of the Gatt deal, but called for understanding of 'our French friends' situation'. President Francois Mitterrand is reserving his persuasion for the Franco-German summit on December 3-4. Compensation. For the moment, the talk in Paris is all of principle in refusing the Gatt deal, not of pay-offs for accepting it. But the French Agriculture Ministry will in the next few weeks be trawling again through the Gatt deal and the CAP reform for discrepancies between the two. It may, in the process, be able to foster enough discontent with the existing CAP reform to get a revision of last May's EC accords. The chances of 'a reform of the reform' is not very promising, Mr Soisson concedes. But there is a formula which would suit France - extra EC income support for its small southern farmers, offset financially by an even bigger cut in EC cereal intervention prices which few farmers in the Community outside the Paris basin could tolerate.</p>

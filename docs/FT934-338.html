			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Cold comfort park: Euro Disney is hoping for a happier new year Most visitors to EuroDisneyland over the holiday period are there to see Mickey and Minnie Mouse capering around the gigantic Christmas tree. Not Alice Ross. Mrs Ross is a woman with a mission. She is an accountant from Delaware, in the US, and an investor in Walt Disney, the US entertainment group. Disney has seen its shares fall sharply this year, owing to the losses it has incurred on its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure company that operates the EuroDisneyland theme park. Mrs Ross was spending two days at EuroDisneyland to see what the problem might be. 'My Disney stock has been sinking like a stone because of this place and, as I'm over in France, I thought: 'Why not rub a little salt in the wound?' ' she said. 'I'm looking into everything. Disney holds its annual shareholders' meeting in Delaware. I'm going to tell Mike Eisner (the Disney chairman) what I think.' A belligerent shareholder such as Mrs Ross is only one of the problems plaguing Mr Eisner and his colleagues. They will spend the festive season putting the finishing touches to the proposals they will present next month to Euro Disney's creditor banks. They hope to persuade the banks to save the company from collapse by agreeing to restructure its FFr20.3bn (Pounds 2.3bn) net debt. The US group has warned the banks that, unless the restructuring is completed by March 31, Euro Disney, which reported a net loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, will be forced to close. In the meantime, Euro Disney is hoping for a repetition of last Christmas, when EuroDisneyland was buoyed by a surge of visitors. More than 30,000 people visited the theme park on New Year's eve: well below the record of 90,000 in September last year, but much better than its low of 5,000 one icy day last January. A successful Christmas and new year would not only help to ease the strain on Euro Disney's cashflow, but would also act as a timely demonstration to the banks that it might be worth saving. EuroDisneyland's employees have done their best to deck it out in festive finery. Ivy bells dangle from the lamp posts. Mickey and Minnie Mouse skate across the Hotel New York ice rink. The strains of Christmas muzak are piped all over the park. Even the barber shop quartet in the Main Street shopping arcade has ditched its usual repertoire in favour of carols. At 5pm each day one child is chosen to light the 20-metre Christmas tree. The decorations alone had been enough to tempt Corinne Jillit, a public relations executive from Angouleme in western France, to bring her four-year-old son. 'The park looks so pretty at this time of year,' she said. 'We'd rather come in the winter, when we don't have to queue to get on the rides.' Werner Muller, an engineer from Hamburg visiting with his six-year-old twins, agreed. 'Friends who came here in August had to queue for two hours just to get on the rides,' he said. 'At this time of year the kids don't have to wait too long, just as well given the weather.' The cold was already proving too much for other visitors. 'It's freezing,' said Willi Ramstein, an Italian architect, who had come to the park during a business trip to Paris. 'The park's great, but the weather's terrible.' Jane Pritchard from south Wales said: 'You'd think they'd sell warm hats in this weather.' Her companion added: 'Never mind, we'll go to the Florida park next time.' 'It's sunny there.' The souvenir shops were packed with festive memorabilia - a Winnie the Pooh Christmas stocking for FFr125, a Mickey Mouse Santa hat for FFr30 and a Goofy bauble for FFr29 - but no woolly hats. As for Mrs Ross, her mission had only just started. But on her first impressions, she seemed to agree with the other shivering visitors. 'They should have built this place somewhere warmer.'</p>

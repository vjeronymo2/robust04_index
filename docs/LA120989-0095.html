			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 'HOT LAB' OPPONENTS ADMITTED TO NRC CASE  </P> <P> An administrative law judge for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has  admitted two more anti-nuclear groups and a homeowners association as parties  to the dispute over the proposed relicensing of the nuclear "hot lab" at  Rockwell International's Santa Susana Field Laboratory southeast of Simi  Valley.  </P> <P> The Southern California Federation of Scientists, the Committee to Bridge the  Gap, and the Susana Knolls Homeowners Assn. were granted intervenor status by  Judge Peter B. Bloch in an order dated Thursday. The groups join two other  organizations and four local residents previously admitted as intervenors.  </P> <P> The intervenors, all of whom oppose Rockwell's request, may file written  evidence and take part in any negotiations aimed at settling the license case.  </P> <P> Rockwell has requested a one-year extension of the NRC license to operate the  hot lab, a heavily shielded workshop where radioactive materials are handled by  remote control. The company originally sought a 10-year renewal but scaled back  the request because of local opposition and flagging business for the hot lab.  </P></p>

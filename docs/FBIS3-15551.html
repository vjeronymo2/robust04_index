Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy  told reporters that during talks with the head of the Joint  Chiefs of Staff, General John Shalikashvili, it was decided to  hold joint military exercises and establish a direct  communications line between the Ukrainian Defense Ministry and  the U.S. defense Department. It was also agreed that U.S.  defense Secretary William Perry would visit Ukraine on March  21-23.    According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko, the  two countries' relations have risen to a "new level." "The  American administration has completely revised its policy  towards Ukraine," Zlenko said. The United States saw it as  essential that "Ukraine should remain an independent and  sovereign state," because Ukraine's loss of independence "may  upset the balance of power in Europe," he said.    Zlenko said the two nations had considerably stepped up  their  economic relations. Thus, America had allocated $700 mn as aid  to Ukraine, and the latter would also receive assistance from  the World Bank and other international financial bodies, he  said. A team of U.S. experts is shortly due to arrive in  Ukraine to determine priorities in the two countries' economic  relations, Zlenko said.</p>

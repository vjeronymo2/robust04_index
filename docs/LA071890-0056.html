			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBUS SUSPENDED FOR LIFE BY TAC;  </P> <P> TRACK AND FIELD: PANEL SAYS COACH WAS GUILTY OF PROVIDING HIS ATHLETES WITH  PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING DRUGS.  </P> <P> Chuck DeBus, a Los Angeles track and field coach, has been suspended for life  by The Athletics Congress for his alleged role in promoting the use of  performance-enhancing drugs by athletes he coached.  </P> <P> A three-person panel of TAC, the sport's governing body in the United States,  found in an opinion released Tuesday that DeBus was guilty of "inciting  athletes to use banned substances, guilty of providing banned substances to an  athlete, and guilty of conduct detrimental to the purposes of The Athletics  Congress and amateur sports."  </P> <P> The lifetime ban on three counts is the strongest action the panel could take  under the rules. DeBus was given a 15-year suspension on another count. It is  the first time an American coach has been sanctioned under rules regarding drug  use or distribution.  </P> <P> A TAC news release stated that DeBus was suspended from track and field for  life, but it is unclear if that is wholly accurate. According to the release,  the panel's decision expelled DeBus from TAC. That means that DeBus may not  coach any national teams such as the Olympic team and may not enter athletes  into TAC-sanctioned events.  </P> <P> That might be the limit of the sanction. It does not appear to prohibit DeBus  from coaching any athlete he chooses.  </P> <P> A panel member conceded that the decision does not prevent DeBus from coaching,  saying, "I don't see how it could, other than what it does for his reputation."  </P> <P> A TAC spokesman said he did not know what the appeals process is in this case  but that the question is "under review."  </P> <P> TAC said miler Steve Scott and hurdler Tonie Campbell testified before the  panel last April that DeBus urged them to take banned substances. Darryl  Robinson, a 400-meter specialist, testified that DeBus had given him banned  substances.  </P> <P> The TAC release quotes the 52-page opinion as saying Scott told the panel that  in 1987 DeBus offered to assist him in setting up a program of blood doping  and/or steroid use. Campbell said that during the 1985 season DeBus told him  that steroids would improve his ability, and Robinson testified that DeBus had  assisted him in obtaining and using steroids from 1985 through '87.  </P> <P> At the hearing, DeBus said he "did not encourage drug use; absolutely did not  incite drug use, had never used drugs, had never purchased drugs, had never  been arrested for drugs and had never possessed drugs."  </P> <P> DeBus, 45, has coached at UCLA and Cal State Northridge, where his women's  teams won four national titles. He also coached the now-defunct Los Angeles  Track Club from 1971 through '88; the club won nine TAC team titles. DeBus had  been under investigation since May of 1989, when some of his former athletes  made public allegations that he had offered or provided banned substances.  </P> <P> DeBus' attorney, Craig Dummit, said Tuesday that the decision was more a public  relations announcement than anything else. He said that he intended to exhaust  all appeals within TAC and then, if necessary, take DeBus' case to civil court.  </P> <P> "TAC won the first round using themselves as judges," Dummit said. "Once we get  a neutral judge in court, we will score a quick knockout."  </P> <P> The panel consisted of William Hickman, a Seattle attorney; Julie McKinney, a  San Pedro attorney, and Rich Nichols, a San Francisco sports consultant.  </P> <P> McKinney said the panel members were not trying to send a message with the  lifetime suspension, merely adhering to the rules.  </P> <P> "I don't now what the legislative intent (of the rules) was, but my own opinion  is that a person who is in a position of dominance over athletes (and advises  them to use drugs) should be dealt with strongly," McKinney said.  </P> <P> She said that although the panel was offered no physical evidence or any  evidence to corroborate the testimony of the three athletes, the panel members  believed the athletes were credible.  </P> <P> The hearing process for DeBus has a fitful history, having been rescheduled six  times. At one point, an attorney for TAC and DeBus struck a deal by which the  coach would voluntarily step down from the sport for two years in exchange for  the names of athletes DeBus said were drug users. However, the deal fell  through when the panel members protested. TAC attorney, Alvin Chriss, has since  resigned.  </P> <P> In April, the TAC panel held a hearing at a hotel near Los Angeles  International Airport. After two days of testimony by Scott, Robinson, Campbell  and DeBus, the panel adjourned without rendering a decision.  </P> <P> The opinion was formulated over three months and a handful of conference calls  among the three members.  </P></p>

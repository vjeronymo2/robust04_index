			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / SIB delays rules for disclosing commission The Securities and Invest-ments Board, the City's chief watchdog, has put on hold plans to require sales agents to disclose commission on term-assurance policies. The SIB board has decided to leave the question for the new Personal Investment Authority, the proposed super-regulator for personal financial services which is due to start operating around the middle of next year. But SIB did agree draft proposals to be submitted to the Treasury on how all sales agents - independent advisers, authorised representatives and those based at banks and building societies - should disclose to prospective customers the commission on sales of life products. Its decision on term assurance represents a slight setback in the overall moves towards disclosure of commission in the selling of financial services, and followed opposition from the industry. As commissions for selling term-assurance policies are lower than those for life insurance, disclosure was thought to be less controversial. But because term assurance is taken out for protection rather than for investment, and because policyholders surviving beyond the period of their policies receive no payment, it falls outside the terms of SIB's remit from the Treasury. To draw up rules on commission disclosure in this area, SIB would require the co-operation of the industry. The rules are expected to seek to ensure that those selling and providing life products along with other financial services, such as selling an endowment policy with a mortgage, are not able to evade the rules by switching commission to the 'non-life' product. SIB confirmed that the proposals were 'on ice', but made clear they were expected to be adopted by the PIA. The move will, however, delay their implementation. By the time the rules have been completed, the requirement to disclose commission on life insurance is not expected to be in effect much before the end of the year.</p>

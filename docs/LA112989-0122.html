			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> MAGAZINE SUES DON JOHNSON  </P> <P> Star magazine has sued Don Johnson, claiming that the former "Miami Vice" star  encouraged a bodyguard to fire shotgun blasts at a helicopter trying to cover  his June remarriage to actress Melanie Griffith.  </P> <P> Johnson's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said Tuesday that the supermarket tabloid's  allegations are "a complete fabrication, just a pathetic attempt to sell some  magazines."  </P> <P> The Star claimed that a photographer and reporter aboard the helicopter were  injured. The lawsuit, filed in Pitkin County Court, also named Greg Isaacs,  described as a Johnson bodyguard who "lay in wait for the helicopter and . . .  ambushed the aircraft."  </P> <P> An investigation by the Pitkin County Sheriff's Department and the Colorado  Bureau of Investigation concluded that shots probably were fired from Isaacs'  gun and hit the helicopter. Isaacs told investigators he was skeet shooting. No  charges were filed.  </P> <P> The tabloid, reporter Barry Levine, Thunderbird Helicopters of Montrose and  pilot Burt Metcalf are seeking unspecified damages from Johnson and Isaacs.  </P> <P> Mintz said Johnson and his attorney haven't seen the lawsuit and could not  comment.  </P></p>

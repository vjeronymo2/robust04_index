			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / International Company News: Ahold improves 7% to Fl 153.3m AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer active in the US and the Netherlands, reported a 9 per cent increase in first-half net earnings to Fl 153.3m (Dollars 93m). However, growth was checked by economic slowdown and the lower dollar rate in which nearly 50 per cent of sales were denominated. Turnover advanced 10 per cent to Fl 11.8bn, of which Fl 5.8bn was generated by the Dutch Albert Heijn supermarket chain where sales advanced 7.1 per cent. The US operations powered ahead 17.3 per cent, due mainly to last year's acquisition of the New York-based Tops chain. Autonomous sales growth in America was put at 3.4 per cent. Six-month operating profit, excluding income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and financial costs, was up 10 per cent to Fl 261m. In the second quarter, operating results fell 5 per cent to Fl 114.8m against last year but this was counter-balanced by other unconsolidated income and lower costs and taxes. Ahold has reiterated its expectation that 1992 net profit will would exceed the Fl 275.8m of last year, in spite of start-up losses at its new Czechoslovak operation and slower growth.</p>

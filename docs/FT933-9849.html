			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Civilian groups plan 3-day protest in Lagos PRO-DEMOCRACY groups in Lagos yesterday pressed ahead with plans for three days of civilian protest in Nigeria's commercial capital next week calling for an end to military rule. The protests, set for August 12 to 14, were 'to demonstrate the implacable commitment of the Nigerian people to the unconditional termination of military rule on August 27,' the Campaign for Democracy (CD) pressure group said. Okesuna market in central Lagos was packed with people who said they were buying essential items to stock up in case the protests choked Lagos as similar ones did in July. The government of President Ibrahim Babangida and civilian politicians face a difficult task to overcome public hostility in Lagos and in the south-west of Nigeria, stronghold of Chief Moshood Abiola, winner of June's annulled presidential election to a proposed interim government. Delegates from the military government and the two civilian political parties have recommended to General Babangida that the next head of state and his deputy should be civilians, with cabinet posts going to the service chiefs of the armed forces. The interim government would hold presidential elections in October 1994 and hand over at the end of next year. The members of the new government would be chosen from the Social Democratic Party and the National Republican Convention and from non-party civilians. It is not clear who would choose the new government nor whether it would have a free rein. The SDP is split over the recommendations, with supporters of the presidential candidate, Mr Abiola, denouncing it as a sell-out and community leaders in Lagos calling for Mr Abiola to be installed as president. Mr Abiola is pressing his case in the US, having met British government ministers on Thursday. The SDP chairman, Mr Tony Anenih, justified the interim government as the only way to get the military out of power. 'If we reject it, we are indirectly telling Babangida to stay on and Nigerians do not want that,' he said after the recommendations were submitted to the president in Abuja.</p>

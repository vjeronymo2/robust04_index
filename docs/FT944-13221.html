			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Observer: Cut] No man is a hero to his barber. Terry Byland, the FT's UK Stock Market Editor, called in at Khops, the Bow Lane barber who crops many well-known City heads, including Sir Samuel Brittan's. 'Glad to see you, sir,' was the opening shot. 'Saw you on TV the other day talking about the dollar. Very interesting, sir, but if I may say so, you looked as if you needed a good haircut.' Byland gave him a larger than usual tip.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Wales wins Pounds 42m circuits plant A THOUSAND jobs are expected to be created in south Wales by a new Pounds 42m electronics plant being set up by Asat (UK), a subsidiary of QPL International Holdings of Hong Kong, an electronic components maker. The 110,000 sq ft factory, to be built on a greenfield site near Crumlin in Gwent, will be on the same Pen-y-Fan industrial estate as Aiwa (UK), the Japanese electronics company which this week announced a Pounds 27m expansion of its plant, with a planned increase of nearly 500 in its workforce. Asat will base its European headquarters at the new plant, which will assemble and test integrated circuits. Construction of the factory, on a site owned by the Welsh Development Agency, is expected to start in late summer with the first production about 12 months later. Mr Steve Byars, chief executive of QPL in the UK, said yesterday Asat hoped that within two years it would be half way to its target of 1,000 jobs. The project is being backed by regional selective assistance from the Welsh Office. The amount of aid has not been disclosed but Mr Byars described it as significant. The parent company QPL was founded in Hong Kong 11 years ago and the group has grown rapidly to a worldwide workforce of about 3,700. Another QPL subsidiary, Newport Wafer-Fab, was set up at Newport, Gwent, last December with SGS-Thomson, the French-Italian semiconductor group. The company saved the wafer fabrication plant of Inmos, the subsidiary of SGS-Thomson, and the workforce there is expanding. Asat said the two Gwent companies would be able to provide their customers - based in the UK, continental Europe and the US - with a 'one-stop shop' for wafer fabrication, assembly and integrated circuit testing. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday described this week's announcements as 'a sign that recovery is coming to Wales, and that Wales remains an attractive place for investors.'

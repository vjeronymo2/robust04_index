			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (4): Too much of a good thing - Europe gets to grip with price variations THE investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to intensify over the next two years. In mid-1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire. The motor industry has been given due warning by the EC competition directorate that a renewal of the block exemption will depend heavily on car manufacturers' performance in conforming with EC limits on car price differentials across Europe. The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year. During 1992 both the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European Commission have published reports on car prices in Europe. Neither report has succeeded in removing the widespread confusion over price differences, but the EC report in particular has drawn attention to many specific cases where price differentials have exceeded the block exemption guidelines. This month a new report is being published by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts, which widens the pricing debate beyond Europe and claims that, whatever the price differences within Europe, European car buyers are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in the US and in Japan. Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in relation to household income. The report is the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between Europe and the other major world markets, the US and Japan. According to the study the largest differences are with car prices in Japan. It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent higher than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45 per cent higher than in the US. On average it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan. The UK is at the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians need four weeks less. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, warned car makers during the summer that 'action is needed at once' both to monitor car prices more closely and to reduce differentials. The study prepared for the European Commission and published earlier this year showed that there have been substantial price differences for some car models across the Community of more than 40 per cent in the most extreme cases. According to the EC report five car makers, Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and Audi, had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988 and January 1991. The study's findings have come under heavy attack from the motor industry, but in a letter to car makers Sir Leon has made clear that the industry must take steps to make their European pricing policies more transparent if they wish to retain the selective distribution system, which in effect restricts sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the manufacturers. Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market free-for-all, with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually any outlet which wishes to sell them. At issue is the question of power and control within the motor industry, and whether some of that power should be allowed to slip from the manufacturers to the retailers. Is selective distribution in fact a significant factor behind the substantial price differentials the EC claims to have found? Sir Leon is presently on delicate legal ground with the motor industry. In his letter to car makers last month he accepts that the EC car price study has not established 'beyond doubt' the linkage between large car price differences across the Community and the selective distribution system. Ominously for the car makers he pointed out, however, that the study had made adjustments for the other most significant potential causes of the price differentials perceived by consumers, such as varying equipment specification levels, currency fluctuations, tax rates and discounting. The decision about what to do when the block exemption expires in mid-1995 would be based 'on a full evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the selective distribution system as it currently operates, and not just the price issue,' admitted Sir Leon. He left little doubt in his letter, however, that the pricing issue will play a vital role in the decision-making process, at least for the competition officials. According to Sir Leon 'the current pricing situation is a cause for concern,' and the evolution of prices over the next three years would be 'an important factor' in the decision on whether or not the block exemption should survive. Action was needed 'at once'. Given the confusion that still reigns over the results of the car makers' pan-European pricing policies, Sir Leon is seeking three far-reaching steps by the industry to increase price transparency. He is calling on car makers: to publish every three months one price list on an EC-wide basis for their entire product range. Prices should be quoted in Ecus and in local currency, and should be set out in a way that 'will enable consumers to make clear comparisons.' to make freely available every three months the prices recommended to authorised dealers for the manufacturer's five top-selling models in each market along with comparable prices for every other EC market, (again in Ecus and local currency). to complete every six months an analysis of the prices recommended to dealers in each EC member state of 'one standard, low equipment model' in each market segment. The manufacturers are to ensure in this way that they are operating within the price bands allowed by the block exemption regulation. In addition Sir Leon has asked the car makers to write to their dealers in each market to assure them that they will supply cars ordered with specifications for another market (for example a right-hand drive car with UK specifications ordered in Belgium) 'within a reasonable time period' and 'at the same basic price' as for normal supplies of the comparable local model. The industry is still to respond to these requests, but it has some way to go if it is to repair the credibility gap with Sir Leon and ensure the survival beyond 1995 of selective distribution, which car makers insist is essential to provide adequate levels of service and safety to car owners.</p>

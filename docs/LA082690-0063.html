			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PROBLEMS THREATEN TO DISRUPT EAST EUROPE'S NASCENT DEMOCRACIES;  </P> <P> PETROLEUM: SOVIET UNION CUTBACKS AND HARD-CURRENCY DEMANDS, COUPLED WITH  PERSIAN GULF TURMOIL, PUT THE SQUEEZE ON FRAGILE ECONOMIES.  </P> <P> The fragile democracies of Eastern Europe are being dealt twin blows by the  petroleum crises in the Soviet Union and the Persian Gulf. The sudden reality  is that these countries cannot afford to import vitally needed oil at today's  soaring prices.  </P> <P> Until last year, Eastern Europe -- Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania,  Bulgaria and East Germany -- depended to an overwhelming degree on Soviet  petroleum and natural-gas deliveries, financed by subsidies and barter through  Comecon, the East-Bloc common market. Eastern Europe was thus sheltered from  the great oil shocks of the '70s that hit Western economies so painfully .  </P> <P> When the fledgling democracies in Eastern Europe began preparing early this  year for fundamental shifts from central planning to free-market economies --  shifts calling for unprecedented austerity and social and personal sacrifices  -- they continued to enjoy cheap oil and easy eastward exports. They assumed  that the transition from the old trade patterns with the Soviets to new ones  would be long enough to cushion their economies. There seemed to be no reason  for Moscow to upset existing practices.  </P> <P> The crucial assumption was that oil would remain available in needed volume and  at an affordable rate. But the effects of vast economic changes in the Soviet  Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's perestroika caught East Europeans  unprepared.  </P> <P> Last spring the Soviets announced that starting Jan. 1, 1991, all exports to  Eastern Europe, including oil, would have to be paid at world prices and in  hard currency, such as U.S. dollars or German marks. While the Soviets promised  to pay in hard currency for East Europe imports, their purchases dropped  precipitously. Overnight, Polish potato farmers lost their Soviet markets, as  did the Hungarian manufacturers of Ikarus buses.  </P> <P> The hard fact was that Moscow could no longer afford to subsidize the former  satellites, desperately needing hard currency to finance its own vital imports  from the West, such as grain and high technology.  </P> <P> Just as East Europe countries adjusted to the hard-currency realities of their  new relations with the Soviet Union, things got worse. Domestic upheavals in  the Soviet Union cut 1989-90 petroleum production, and Moscow decided last May  to reduce its oil deliveries to Eastern Europe by about a third.  </P> <P> Even before the cut in shipments, the East Europeans were already calculating  that their annual hard-currency expenditures would double this year to meet the  Soviet fuel bill. Before the Persian Gulf conflict, these governments  calculated that for 1990-91 they would need at least $6 billion in additional  dollar earnings to pay for imported energy. East Germany, of course, will be  removed from immediate peril by its absorption by West Germany, now set for  Oct. 3. But elsewhere economic and social tensions have risen as retail  gasoline prices shoot up; lengthy queues at stations brought back memories of  the communist days.  </P> <P> There is concern that fuel shortages may diminish Western tourism, a basic  source of hard-currency for Eastern Europe. Even at July oil prices, economists  were projecting a surge in inflation and a reduction in industrial output.  </P> <P> In the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, world oil prices jumped from $16  to more than $30 per barrel of benchmark crude oil, rendering it virtually  impossible for East Europeans to buy the petroleum they need. Governments began  to realize that even if prices did not keep climbing, they had to rethink all  their fundamental economic planning. The only beneficiary of the new situation  was the Soviet Union, whose hard-currency income from oil exports virtually  doubled.  </P> <P> The worst hit were Bulgaria and Poland. Iraq was indebted to Bulgaria for $1  billion and to Poland for $500-million, in payment for large-scale engineering  works and arms, in Poland's case. Iraq was paying off the debt in crude oil;  the U.N.-imposed embargo -- fully supported by the two governments -- has  effectively shut off this source of fuel.  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, it should be a top priority for the United States and  its Western partners to develop measures and policies to protect Eastern Europe  from the new oil shocks. It would be morally and politically intolerable if the  Eastern European nations, newly freed from nearly 50 years of communist  dictatorship, were allowed to founder in economic chaos and social unrest as a  result of oil shortages.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration, aware of Poland's latest economic troubles and of the  need to prevent social unrest certain to play in the hands of rightist  political radicals, has taken preliminary measures to alleviate the oil  problem. Among them, it has sought to establish a relationship between Warsaw  and Saudi Arabia, in the hope that might help the Poles work out a favorable  import arrangement.  </P> <P> The Administration has also looked into the possibility that oil belonging to  Kuwait, now on ships at sea, might some way be diverted to Poland. But the  government turned down Poland's request to forgive part of its debt, fearing it  would have set an unfavorable precedent for other debtor nations. Latin  America, for example, has also been hit by rising oil prices, and carries  enormous debts.  </P> <P> In a worst-case scenario, the emergence of right-wing, dictatorial regimes  throughout Eastern Europe is possible if tension and frustration sweep the  region. Profound splits within democratic forces are already occuring in  several of these countries; economic catastrophes could push them over the  edge.  </P> <P> A concerted plan by the United States, Western Europe and Japan is urgently  needed to prop up the imperiled Eastern European democracies. Innovative  policies must be launched, or else the West risks losing Eastern Europe for a  second time in this century.  </P></p>

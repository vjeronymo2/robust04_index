			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / World Trade News: US anti-dumping law attacked US anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws came under attack at the opening of a two-day hearing by the US International Trade Committee into the broad effects of the legislation. The hearing is part of a two-year ITC investigation ordered by Mrs Carla Hills, the former US trade representative, before she left office last year. The lead witness, Congressman Jim Kolbe, an Arizona Republican, said US trade policies were failing to recognise 'the challenges of global and economic integration and capitalise on economic opportunities'. Mr Peter Watson, chairman of the ITC, welcomed the study which he said would include an economy-wide empirical analysis of the economic impact of unfairly traded imports on selected domestic industries and consumers, as well as the specific industries, which seek relief from imports under the trade laws. The study will also estimate the effects 'on both upstream and downstream industries of unfair trade imports as well as the reverse effects associated with the remedy', he said.</p>

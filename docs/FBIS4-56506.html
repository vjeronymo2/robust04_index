			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Urgent" press release issued by FMLN General Coordinator </F> Shafik Handal in San Salvador on 3 May; from the "KL Radio News"  newscast -- read by announcer]    [Text] Regarding the events that have taken place at the  first plenary session of the new Legislative Assembly, the  general coordinator of the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front] informs the Salvadoran people and the general  public worldwide that:    1. At several meetings, during which the Political  Commission of the FMLN examined in detail the operational and  organizational conditions of the new Legislative Assembly, the  Political Commission unanimously agreed that the assembly's  current internal organization imposes a presidentialist system  [regimen presidencialista] that fails to proportionately reflect  representation that characterizes this branch of state and that  it obstructs the democratic fulfillment of parliamentary and  legislative endeavors. For this reason, the commission agreed  to seek a consensus with all political parties and their  deputies to reform the internal organization and thereby  democratize the Legislative Assembly, demanding, among other  things, the formation of a board of directors that more  accurately reflects the ratios achieve in the 20 March elections.    2. While we held these discussions, ARENA [Nationalist  Republican Alliance] unexpectedly had the previous Legislative  Assembly approve, at its final session on the evening on 29  April, a reform of the regulation that set the number of board  members at 10 and granted a double vote to the assembly  president -- now a female president. ARENA has thereby seized a  majority that the people did not grant the party by way of their  votes. The reform states that under no circumstances can the  opposition make decisions within the board of directors without  the board's approval. This reform has worsened the assembly's  presidentialist and antidemocratic nature.    3. This situation was exacerbated by the decision of ARENA  and some of its allies to break away from the consensus achieved  at Copaz [National Commission for the Consolidation of Peace] to  reform the Constitution on those points recommended by the Truth  Commission. The message was clear: ARENA has decided to exert  its influence and turn its back on the commitments that emerged  from the Chapultepec Agreement.    4. In response to this new situation, the Political  Commission, expanded by the participation of elected FMLN  deputies, decided by a majority vote not to participate in the  Legislative Assembly's board of directors until its internal  organization is reformed, and to announce that the FMLN will  soon present a bill explaining this. In turn, the FMLN's  Political Commission has abstained from approving any individual  candidates or lists of candidates for positions within the  Legislative Assembly Directorate.    5. Despite this situation, seven deputies from our  legislative faction voted during the board elections at the 1  May plenary and two of them, Ana Guadalupe Martinez and Eduardo  Sancho, accepted the posts of vice president and secretary,  respectively.    6. Consequently, we must make it clear to all that these  deputies do not represent the FMLN as a faction or the FMLN  itself in the Legislative Assembly's board of directors, and  that none of their actions, opinions, or commitments are binding  with the FMLN. In this way, the FMLN's representation has been  usurped with the support of the ARENA deputies' votes.    7. The general coordinator of the FMLN is discussing this  problem to the party's rank-and-file and factions to enable the  FMLN to make relevant decisions.    8. The FMLN will remain faithful to democratic revolutionary  ideology, popular interests, programs of democratization, and  social justice, as outlined in the Chapultepec agreement and the  FMLN's Charter, goals, and programmatic platform, and it will  redouble its efforts to achieve their fulfillment.    [Dated] San Salvador, 3 May 94    [Signed] Shafik Jorge Handal, general coordinator of the  FMLN</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Inchcape ahead in 'tough year' - Motor retailing improves on the back of a recovery in the UK Mr Charles Mackay, chief executive of Inchcape, the diversified group, described 1993 as an 'exceptionally tough year' although normalised profits were still ahead on 1992. While group turnover rose by 16.7 per cent to Pounds 5.88bn, a fall in margins left operating profits only 7.1 per cent higher at Pounds 279.6m, including associates. The pre-tax profit figure, on Inchcape's normalised basis, excluding exceptional gains of Pounds 8.1m (loss Pounds 2.1m), but including property profits of Pounds 10.9m (Pounds 3.2m), rose 4.4 per cent from Pounds 252.2m to Pounds 263.3m. However, the small change in the group figure hid large swings between divisions. For the first time, the group split out the operating profits from motor retailing, which showed a jump from Pounds 43.6m to Pounds 71.4m, on sales 10.2 per cent higher at Pounds 2.11bn. This largely reflected the recovery in the UK retail market, although car sales are still well below their late 1980s peak. Importing and distribution, the other part of the motors business, suffered from the strong yen, which squeezed margins and caused volumes to fall, and declining markets in continental Europe. Operating profits fell 12.7 per cent to Pounds 106.1m, including associates, in spite of a 31 per cent rise in sales to Pounds 2.59bn. Inchcape largely distributes cars from east Asia, notably from Toyota. Although market shares were increased this was at the expense of margins, as additional advertising and promotion costs were borne. Results from the marketing division, which manages brands such as Colgate in the Middle East and Heineken in Hong Kong, were disappointing, Mr Mackay said. Profits, including associates, fell by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 58.2m although sales were 20.5 per cent up at Pounds 1.29bn. Inchcape was hit by the recession in Japan, which limited consumer spending, and austerity measures in China. The services division, which includes insurance, testing, shipping and buying, increased profits by 27.4 per cent to Pounds 53.9m, with three of the four sharply higher. Buying made a Pounds 1.2m loss (Pounds 3.4m profit) as retail demand remained weak. Interest charges rose Pounds 15.1m to Pounds 27.2m. Mr Rod O'Donoghue, finance director, said the underlying increase was about Pounds 4m, although gearing fell from 31 to 23 per cent. Net debt fell Pounds 24m to Pounds 205m, with the cash inflow before financing at Pounds 21.1m. This was after capital expenditure of Pounds 33.9m and acquisitions of Pounds 103.4m.</p>

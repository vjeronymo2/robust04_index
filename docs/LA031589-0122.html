			<p><P> March 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRAZY HORSE WINS THIRD TIP OF CAP  </P> <P> Completing a hat trick of the 10-gallon variety, the Crazy Horse Steak House in  Santa Ana has won its third consecutive Country Night Club of the Year award  from the Academy of Country Music.  </P> <P> Fred Reiser, co-owner and concert director of the nightclub, said Tuesday that  the Crazy Horse's growing accumulation of silver, hat-shaped trophies -- known  as Hat Awards -- is still far from being old hat.  </P> <P> "I was really surprised," said Reiser, who is president of the Los  Angeles-based ACM. "We thought maybe people would be voting against us because  we'd won it the past 2 years. It's quite an honor for a little, 250-seat  house."  </P> <P> The nightclub award for 1988 was decided by the wing of the 2,800-member  academy, which includes record company personnel, music journalists, publicists  and the managers and booking agents who represent country performers.  </P> <P> Hat awards for performers will be presented April 10 in a televised ceremony on  NBC.

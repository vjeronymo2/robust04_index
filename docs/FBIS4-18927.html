			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Winfried Muenster commentary: "GATT Sets Noble Goals for </F> Itself"]    [Text] When the government representatives of the 120  partner states of GATT meet, discussions are often heated. On  15 December they celebrated the success of their seven years of  negotiations about new free trade rules, which was hardly  considered still possible. Exactly four months later, next  Friday [15 April], they want to sign the new 550-page treaty in  Marrakesh, Morocco. However, it was just last Friday that the  danger was averted that they would quarrel for days before the  final celebration, as if the agreement of mid-December had not  been achieved at all.    In the hectic negotiations of the past days in Geneva,  nothing less was the issue than a decision on political  direction. At the beginning of next year, GATT, which is only  an agreement, as its name implies, will turn into the World  Trade Organization (WTO), which will have far more powers. The  WTO will not only have more power, granted to it by the treaty,  to implement the new free trade regulations. As Brussels  Foreign Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan says, it will  "probably also develop into the decisive forum of international  discussion about all economic problems," some sort of  international security council for international economic  policy. The supporting pillars of international economic and  trade relations include -- and this is something that the  industrial West agrees on in principle -- human rights,  environmental protection, and a minimum of decent work  conditions. GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland is  currently having the text of the apolitical statement polished,  which is solemnly to order the WTO to work out comprehensive  economic policy rules of behavior.    In the meantime, the United States and France are racing  ahead in an unusual alliance. In Marrakesh they want to set  down that the validity of the newly adopted free trade  regulations depends on the preservation of future social and  environmental standards. This enrages the GATT majority of the  Third World, because they fear protectionism by the West against  them, which might enter through the back door. The United  States and the French want to be able to close off access to the  markets for products that, for instance, have been produced by  children or prisoners or are kept cheap through extremely low  wages. They argue that there cannot be any free markets for  dangerous waste or for products that have the ozone-killing  chlorofluorocarbons as an ingredient, or for deals that  eradicate species of fauna. The Third World does not  fundamentally oppose such principles, but it wants to talk about  it and not have it hang like the sword of Damocles over its  exports from the outset.    In the European Union the majority are willing to give the  developing countries and, above all, the emerging industrialized  countries in Asia every guarantee that the minimum regulation of  environmental protection and decent working conditions, which  are included in GATT, will not provide an excuse for  protectionism. However, France and the United States are drawing  a line of tolerance. The French have always believed that their  ideas about fair foreign trade can be better implemented through  a network of bilateral agreements than through the classical  multilateral free trade rules of GATT, and the current Clinton  Administration in Washington is most profoundly convinced of  that. After all, the United States has its experiences with  Japan, and the French can point to the single market.  Basically, what is important for them is the command of  reciprocity.    Countries open their markets only for those that also do so,  and they let competition between them have free reign only if  they compete with relatively similar costs. On the single  market reciprocity has been implemented virtually 100 percent.  Thus, the member states of the European Union are in free  competition with one another and, therefore, there is no  resistance to the single market. GATT, however, is far from that.    However, this will not last long. The WTO is to build a  bridge between the followers of bilateral "managed trade" and  those of worldwide free markets. It is to link the classical  "free trade" with "fair trade." Therefore, it must be equipped  with instruments, at least rudimentarily, which the United  States and the European Union have; otherwise the two economic  powers would not renounce the use of their own instruments.  This is the philosophy behind the WTO's mechanisms for settling  quarrels, to which every member state has to subordinate itself  in the future, just as, in addition, to the Ministers'  Conference, which meets every two years and can adopt decisions  with a three-quarter majority. Thus, the WTO is modeled a  little along the lines of the Council of Ministers in Brussels,  and this is what France likes. The United States, on the other  hand, would not have given up its "Super 301," if all the  partner states in GATT were not committed to adjusting their  laws to the Geneva regulations. The "Section 301" in U.S. trade  law serves the purpose of threatening other countries with  import quotas if they do not open their markets. As of 1995 the  WTO will take over its task of enforcing reciprocity. At the  moment the European Union can still ignore the Geneva free trade  rules and enforce its banana market order, which is against the  rules. As of next year, it will not be able to.    When the Uruguay Round began in 1986, no one was thinking of  the WTO. When has it ever been the case that international  politics achieved more than it intended?</p>

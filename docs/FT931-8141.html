			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Rise in interest payments hits Asahi Breweries ASAHI Breweries, Japan's second largest brewer with a 24 per cent market share, yesterday posted a sharp fall in unconsolidated profits for 1992 partly due to a rise in interest payments on its bonds. Asahi, which holds a 17 per cent stake in Foster's Brewing of Australia, reported that pre-tax profits plunged 19.6 per cent to Y14bn (Dollars 115.7m) despite a 4.3 per cent rise in sales to Y770.6bn. After-tax profits fell 34.2 per cent to Y4bn. Operating profits surged 90.7 per cent to Y35.9bn thanks to cost cutting and a sharp increase in bulk sales of non-alcoholic beverages, with a large profit margin. For the full year to December, Asahi expects pre-tax profits to rise 3.3 per cent to Y14.5bn on a 5.1 per cent increase in sales to Y810bn.</p>

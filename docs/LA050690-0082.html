			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TIME TO SEE WHAT BOBBY HAS BUILT;  </P> <P> CHARGERS: MINI-CAMP BEGINS TODAY, GIVING COACH DAN HENNING AND HIS STAFF A  CHANCE TO EVALUATE A TEAM THAT HAS BEEN CHANGED A BIT SINCE LAST SEASON.  </P> <P> About 90 faces will greet Charger Coach Dan Henning and his staff today when  the team opens its six-day mini-camp. Some of them, he will even recognize.  </P> <P> Twenty players have been traded, been released, retired or left the team  through free agency since the end of last season. Only 39 players eligible to  attend the camp were on the team's active or reserve lists at the end of last  season.  </P> <P> Player turnover is a natural part of NFL life. But it is a particularly active  element when a team finishes 6-10, fires its general manager and replaces him  with one generally acknowledged as among the most innovative in the NFL. Bobby  Beathard has brought much of the change.  </P> <P> Most of those who have left were far from household names. But some should  sound familiar: running back Gary Anderson and wide receiver Jamie Holland  (traded), offensive tackle Jim FitzPatrick (Plan B free agent), center Don  Macek (retired) and quarterback Jim McMahon (released).  </P> <P> They and the others have been replaced from a variety of sources by Beathard.  These include 17 via the team's largest draft class since 1986, nine through  Plan B free agency and at least 22 through other free agency.  </P> <P> Almost all are expected to participate when the team holds its first of 11  mini-camp workouts at 4 p.m. today at its practice facility at San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium. The workouts will continue with double sessions Monday through  Friday beginning at 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. each day.  </P> <P> "This is our chance to get a better look at the rookies and some of the other  new players," Beathard said Friday. "It's just the next step in the evaluation  process."  </P> <P> Beathard said that only a handful of players have been excused for medical or  personal reasons. These included linebacker Cedric Figaro and wide receiver  Walter Wilson, both of whom are attending to college commitments, and offensive  linemen Mike Simmonds (knee) and Larry Williams (shoulder), who are recovering  from injuries.  </P> <P> Beathard said he was not aware of any player who would not attend the sessions  because of contract troubles as the agent for McMahon, Steve Zucker, said his  client would have done before he was released last week.  </P> <P> With McMahon gone, the quarterback role rests solidly with Billy Joe Tolliver,  who started the final four games of his rookie season last year. But other  offensive questions remain to be answered, starting with the offensive line and  running backs.  </P> <P> The Chargers have added three Plan B free agents -- Ronnie Harmon from Buffalo,  Joe Mickles from Washington and Thomas Sanders from Chicago -- to go along with  three holdover running backs. Chief among the returners is Marion Butts, who  led the Chargers as a rookie last season with 683 yards on 170 carries.  </P> <P> The offensive line situation could be just as unsettled. Almost no one outside  of center Courtney Hall and likely left tackle Joel Patton appears assured of  starting or playing the same position as last year. Guards David Richards and  Broderick Thomas both might be tried at tackle. Dennis McKnight, after  experimenting at center before a preseason knee injury ended his season before  the first game last year, will be tried at left guard.  </P> <P> "This is just a checkpoint for us," Beathard said. "The work we do now will  make it easier for us to get started when training camp opens in July."  </P></p>

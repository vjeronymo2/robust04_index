			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 24 (XINHUA) -- The State Council has  formed two inspection teams, which are expected to be sent soon  to conduct investigations around China into prices and  investments in fixed assets.    Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua reminded the teams today that  although China's economy has been growing at a rapid speed,  price rises and high-pressure inflation have arisen as two big  problems in the country's current economic outlook.    "The urgent task is to find a quick solution to the problems  of a large expansion of investment in fixed assets and a  relatively backward management system over investments and  prices, which are the key factors leading to inflation and price  rises," he said.    Timely completion of the inspection work will be helpful  toward implementing policies the central government has drawn up  for this year's overall work in 1994 and toward the fulfillment  of tasks set for 1994 in terms of reform, opening and economic  development, he said.    The price inspections will mark random charges on daily  necessities like food and cooking oil and extortionary,  unauthorized price rises which take advantage of market  monopolies on important productive raw materials such as rolled  steel, electricity, coal, petroleum and chemical fertilizer, and  unauthorized extra charges on services.    The inspection of investments in fixed assets will focus on  newly-started projects. The team will make clear the source of  investment and the extent of funding for national key projects,  see to the stoppage of some projects that must be suspended or  stopped, and tend to other matters.    The vice-premier called on the members of the inspection  team  to make thorough-going investigations and study and report on  the situation as it is. Moreover, he added, they must also  abide by laws and regulations and be clean and honest themselves  in performing their duties.    Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning  Commission, has been appointed head of the price inspection  team, which is composed of executives concerned with state  planning, supervision, finance, banking, taxation, auditing,  industry and commerce and technological supervision.    Chen will also head the other team concerning the inspection  of investment in fixed assets. Its members are drawn from  departments of the State Planning Commission, the State Economy  and Trade Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the People's Bank  of China, the Ministry of Supervision, the State Development  Bank and the State Statistics Bureau.</p>

			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Survey of Azerbaijan (4): Stalin's map explodes - The conflict which has created 1m refugees For six years Azerbaijan's politics and economy have been dominated by the fortunes of a war on an obscure battlefield in its western mountains. Five Baku governments have fallen, more than a fifth of the republic's territory has been conquered by ethnic Armenian separatists and 1m Azeris have become refugees. But neither side is yet ready to compromise and peace seems distant. Since coming to power eight months ago, the Azerbaijan president, Mr Heydar Aliev, has prosecuted the war more boldly than his predecessors in the hope of strengthening the republic's bargaining position. He has launched two major offensives, but both failed. The first was undermined by desertions, the latter by unsuccessful 'human wave' tactics reminiscent of Iranian offensives in the 1980s war with Iraq. As a result of these frustrations, the government has shrunk from radical reform, contenting itself with get-rich-quick foreign trade deals. The war, one of the fiercest in the former Soviet Union, stems from the separatist aspirations of Armenian communities in the western region of Nagorno-Karabakh. Its seeds were sown by Josef Stalin in 1923 when, despite its majority Armenian population, Stalin made Nagorno-Karabakh part of Azerbaijan. After simmering for many years, the issue exploded in 1988, when Nagorno-Karabakh's governing council voted to unite with the republic of Armenia. Now the fighting engulfs much of western Azerbaijan. The Armenians control territory all the way to the Iranian border, and threaten to push north into Azerbaijan's third city, Ganja. Mr Aliev, a former member of the ruling Soviet Communist Party politburo, appears to be politically secure but Azerbaijan has been so volatile since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Western analysts say they do not know how long he will last. He himself came to power in a coup by Azerbaijan's disgraced former main battlefield commander in Nagorno-Karabakh. Meanwhile, western-led peace efforts continue. The European Council for Security and Cooperation has resumed its so-called Minsk peace efforts with an official scheduled tour of Azerbaijan and Armenia this month. Last month, Russian defence minister Pavel Grachev persuaded both sides to accept a truce, and there were signs that Moscow could push for further negotiations. But the situation is not hopeful. Unlike in Bosnia, where an international consensus has finally forced serious moves toward reconciliation, there is no solid Western pressure on the Nagorno-Karabakh combatants. The majority Azeris simply want to see the ethnic Armenians withdraw from all captured territory, and make do with cultural autonomy for Nagorno-Karabakh. The Armenian separatists, however, demand the independence of Nagorno-Karabakh as the minimum condition for peace. They do not say what else they want, but their scorched earth tactics in captured Azeri towns suggests that they will also claim at least some of the additional territory now in their hands. Mr Aliev has appealed for help from the US, Turkey and Iran, but so far seems to have gained little more than the dispatch of some military advisers. Late last year, Mr Aliev sought what senior Western diplomats and Azeri analysts believe was a quid pro quo: in exchange for Moscow's military assistance, Mr Aliev agreed to Azerbaijan joining the Russia-dominated Commonwealth of Independent States. He also awarded Russia a share in a Western-led oil deal to develop Azerbaijan's rich offshore fields. But there is little sign of effective Russian help. With his army weakened by desertions, Mr Aliev sent an aide last August to Afghanistan to 'borrow' some of that country's mujahideen rebels. More than 1,000 Afghans came to Azerbaijan and faced their first test in October, when Mr Aliev launched his first offensive. The surprise attack, in the southwestern Zangelan region near Iran, was spearheaded by the Afghans. They advanced a few kilometres, before they and the Azeris fled from an Armenian counterattack. The Armenians then promptly drove some 60,000 local Azeris from their homes. Mr Aliev almost immediately began to prepare another attack. In November, thousands of young men were called up and given a few days of basic training. On December 15, Azerbaijan attacked in several places, mostly in the southwest and in strategic Kelbajar, next to Armenia's border. The the ethnic Armenians were pushed back, but at the beginning of February they again resumed the upper hand. The Azeris have held the town of Horadiz on the Azerbaijan-Iranian border, but they have been ousted from Kelbajar and pushed over the important Morov mountains. A walk through Martyr's Cemetery on a Baku hillside shows the result of Azerbaijan's new offensive. There are rows of shrines decorated with red, pink and white carnations and new concrete tablets attest to the daily funerals of fresh war victims. Conservative Western estimates put Azerbaijan's dead in the latest offensive at 4,000 men, and Armenian losses in the hundreds. These are higher figures than for the previous two years of fighting. The sixth year of the war is estimated to have seen more than 15,000 dead on both sides. With the Armenian forces now controlling the Morov heights, Western analysts worry that Ganja, the site of a former major Soviet Army base, may be subject to rocket attacks. 'You can't put together any real army here to fight the Armenians. There is a lack of determination in the people fighting, a disarray in the ranks,' said a Western diplomat in Baku. 'This country is capable of gaining and holding ground only temporarily. If the Armenians don't retake territory immediately, it is only for political reasons, not because they cannot.'</p>

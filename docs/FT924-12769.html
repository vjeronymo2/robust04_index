			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Subsidy figure disputed THE government's claim that keeping open the 31 pits due for closure would cost taxpayers Pounds 100m a month is coming under increasing fire from economists and, privately, from British Coal officials. The figure, used repeatedly by ministers, is based on the assumption that if British Coal can sell only 40m tonnes to the electricity generators next year that will leave 2m tonnes a month - at a production cost of Pounds 50 a tonne - unsold. British Coal officials say the production cost is in fact considerably lower, even at most of the 31 pits earmarked for closure. They also point out that the Pounds 100m figure assumes that the coal could not be sold at all, whereas it could be sold on the world market, albeit at somewhat below its cost of production. There would still be a monthly cost related to selling the coal but British Coal officials insisted it would be far less than Pounds 100m. They also point out that since the mid-1980s British Coal has received no operating subsidy, although it still gets government money for redundancy packages and related matters.</p>

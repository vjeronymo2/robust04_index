This finding is to be based on all information available to the Service at the time the finding is made. To the maximum extent practicable, the finding shall be made within 90 days following receipt of the petition and promptly published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Service must also commence a timely status review of the petitioned species if its accompanying information results in a positive finding. Following a positive 90-day finding, Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires the Service to make a 12-month finding as to whether the petitioned action is: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Not warranted, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Warranted; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Warranted but precluded by other higher priority listing proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 15, 1994, the Service received a petition from Ms. Nancy Fraser Williams on behalf of the Rock Creek Owners' Association, Gainesville, Florida. The petition requests that Says' spiketail dragonfly, ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Cordulegaster sayi <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), be listed as an endangered species. It states that a portion of a forested ravine and its riparian corridor owned by the Rock Creek residential housing subdivision is essentially the species' only known breeding grounds. The petitioners contend that a proposed municipal storm water retention project within the corridor's floodplain, described as the Possum Branch of Hogtown Creek, would gravely endanger the existing breeding sites of this extremely rare dragonfly and virtually wipe out the species. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Westfall (unpublished) provides collection information for Say's spiketail from seven localities in northern Florida and one specific site from southeastern Georgia. Five of these sites are located on public land, with occurrence based on fewer than two dozen specimens. Rock Creek, named in the petition, is the best studied and most productive of the known collection sites. Alabama may be added to the range if identification of an adult female collected in 1994 from Conecuh National Forest is verified (Mr. Bill Mauffray, International Odonate Research Institute, pers. comm., 1994). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Say's spiketail was included as a candidate for listing in the Service's invertebrate notice of review for animals published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664) and is comprehensive animal notices of review published January 6, 1989 (54 FR 554) and November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804). The dragonfly was included in the first notice as a category 1 candidate for listing, but as a category 2 candidate in subsequent notices. A category 1 taxon is one for which the Service has available enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threat(s) to support a proposal to list it as endangered or threatened. A category 2 taxon is one for which information in possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threat are not currently available to support a proposed rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information presented in the petition supports the Service's previous decision to consider this species as a category 2 listing candidate as defined above. At the time the petition was received, the Service was aware of and investigating the proposed floodwater relief project and its potential impact on Say's spiketail. The hydrologic model for the project (Westfall and Mauffray 1994) predicted the proposed flood control structure would increase depth of inundation for 10-year and 25-year storm events by approximately 2 and 3 feet, respectively. All but one of nine seepage transects included in the project's biological assessment would be completely inundated during any 10-year event. The seep heads and a few feet of their runs in four of the nine sampled seeps would not be totally inundated by a 10-year flood under the existing pre-project conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One such 10-year event did occur in March 1993. The only larvae collected after this flood were found at three completely inundated seeps (Westfall and Mauffray, 1994). Less than 10 percent of the previous seasons' adult total was observed during a 3-week period in 1993. During the 1994 flight season, however, 12 adults were observed in a single day at Rock Creek, indicating recovery from any adverse effects from flooding. It appears that larvae may not be displayed by significant flooding and are able to survive these episodes at their original locations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

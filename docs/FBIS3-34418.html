			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] On 5 February, the foreign ministers of Iran,  Turkey, and Syria met in Istanbul, allegedly to study the  situation in Iraq again. This was the fourth tripartite session  in this connection.    It is surprising that the three countries should decide to  hold such sessions to examine the situation in Iraq and to  express their concern over the [word indistinct] there, when  they are not ready to allow an Iraqi Government representative  or representatives of the Iraqi opposition or Iraqi Kurds to  attend these sessions.    Apparently, the objective behind the tripartite session of  the Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian foreign ministers is to examine  the possibility of reaching a common stance on a possible  dismemberment of Iraq. For some time, these three countries  have been paying lip service to safeguarding Iraq's territorial  integrity and shed crocodile tears for it without having  specific proof that Iraq is being dismembered. This, when both  Iran and Turkey still covet part of Iraqi territory and  sometimes repeat their territorial claims on part of it.    But the three countries have not been plunged into concern  and fear out of the threat of Iraq's dismemberment. The concern  and fear stem from the situation in Iraqi Kurdistan and the  intensification of the justice seeking struggle of the Kurdish  people elsewhere in Kurdistan. The three countries do not  consider the intensification of national and freedom seeking  beliefs and the consolidation of national feeling among the  Iranian, Turkish, and Syrian Kurds to come within the framework  of the growing world trend that seeks democracy, but try to  portray that all this stems from the situation in Iraqi  Kurdistan. Thus, the Kurdish problem in general and the  situation in Iraqi Kurdistan in particular are portrayed as an  important and common problem for these three countries.    Iran, Turkey, and Syria rule over part of Kurdish territory  and the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan are striving to  achieve their national and just rights. The three countries  that control part of the Kurdish territory do not favor the  fulfillment of the Kurdish people's aspirations and objectives  in each part of Kurdistan. You can see clearly how the [words  indistinct] allegedly shedding tears for Iraq's unity and  integrity stem from the growing trend of the Kurdish people's  freedom seeking movement.    The Islamic Republic, which has been [words indistinct] and  suppressing the Kurdish people for over 15 years [words  indistinct] for the Iraqi Kurds. In relation with this, Tehran  scorns the Turkish Government for allowing the United States and  its allies to use Turkish bases to support Iraqi Kurds. The  Turkish Government, which for years has denied the existence of  several million Kurds in eastern Turkey and has had to admit  this existence because of domestic problems on the one hand and  the West's public opinion on the other, has taken no serious  step to ensure the national and political rights of the Kurds in  Turkey. And finally, not only is Syria refraining from granting  the just rights of the Syrian Kurds, but it is also trying to  annihilate their national identity. It has always pursued the  policy of crushing and decimating the Kurds.    Thus, the historic enmity of Iran, Turkey, and Syria toward  the Kurdish people throughout Kurdistan leaves no doubt that the  various sessions among the three countries' foreign ministers  are not meetings to exchange views on the general situation in  Iraqi Kurdistan, but an effort for more cooperation in their  opposition and hostility to the formation of a Kurdish country  within the framework of Iraq and an effort to find ways to  suppress the Kurdish people elsewhere in Kurdistan.    In the current situation--in which the world's support for  the Kurdish people can (?prevent) these three countries from  showing more (?hostility) against the Kurdish movement in the  various parts of Kurdistan--the [word indistinct] of the Kurdish  people throughout Kurdistan to uncover behind the scene  agreements and plots being hatched by these three countries is  very opportune. In addition to these agreements, the regimes of  the Islamic Republic of Iran and Turkey are implementing a  special joint agreement. Also, Iran, Turkey, and Syria have  decided to continue their sessions and their plotting against  the Kurdish people in future.    Undoubtedly, any joint effort by these three to crush the  Kurdish people will meet strong reaction worldwide, including  among the supporters of the Kurdish people. These three  countries should understand that suppressing and plotting  against the Kurdish people cannot solve the Kurdish problem.  Experience has proven this. [Word indistinct], in addition to  dozens of domestic problems, these three governments are united  as far as machinations against the Kurdish people go. There are  many signs, particularly those seen recently, that this unity  and these machinations are intensifying and that these three  countries are moving toward a common attempt against the Kurdish  people's interests.    For this reason and to thwart any plot against the Kurdish  people, the public and humanitarian organizations and forums  should be better informed. The Kurds should [words indistinct],  adding to their self- confidence. Consider the fear and concern  felt by the three countries. This clearly shows that the  Kurdish movement is intensifying [words indistinct].</p>

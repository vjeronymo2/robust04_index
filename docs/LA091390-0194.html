			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PREVIEW OF AREA TEAMS: POLY, PARAMOUNT EXPECTED TO REPEAT AS CHAMPS  </P> <P> Here is a preview of Southeast/Long Beach area high school football teams. The  predicted order of finish, indicated by number, is based on information  supplied by coaches and compiled by Mike Coil of The Times.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MOORE LEAGUE Perennial favorite Poly's biggest challenge could come from  Wilson, but Lakewood, Millikan and Jordan should also contend.  </P> <P> 1. POLY -- The youngest Jackrabbit team in 11 years is inexperienced in the  secondary and offensive line. Only one starter returns on defense, safety  Richard Washington, another in a long line of great defensive backs at the Long  Beach school. Other top players are tight end Chris Love, an excellent  receiver, and guard Edward Hopkins, who started every game in a 9-2 league  championship season a year ago. "We are going to play like a bunch of wild and  crazy guys," said co-head Coach Jerry Jaso. Poly lost its opener, 14-7, to  Eisenhower.  </P> <P> 2. WILSON -- "We are going to be right in the thick of it," said Coach John  Brennan. The Bruins (7-5 overall and 4-1 in league play last season) have good  players at the skill positions, but an inexperienced defensive line. Running  back Mike Steward (160 yards in a 14-12 opening win over Servite) and safety  Dante Lewis are all-league. Wilson will miss center Buster Layton, now at Cal  Poly San Luis Obispo, and tackle Demario Vaughn, now at Arizona State. Both  were all-CIF.  </P> <P> 3. MILLIKAN -- The Rams, fourth in the league last season, are young and  inexperienced, but optimistic Coach Dave Radford, a 27-year veteran, said, "We  have good unity and (the players) are a joy to be around." Jeremy Jones, a  three-year starter, returns to running back after playing quarterback last  season. Larry Satterlee is an all-league defensive end. The Rams beat St.  Anthony, 29-9, last week.  </P> <P> 4. LAKEWOOD -- The Lancers ended a 19-game road losing streak last Friday night  by beating Warren, 21-14. This is a pass-minded team whose top receivers are  all-league Johnny Horner and A. J. Marinelli. Brian Kaveney, a senior with a  strong arm, takes over for the graduated Robert Fonseca at quarterback. Coach  Mark Rose said his linemen are young.  </P> <P> 5. JORDAN -- The Panthers, who lost their opener to Mission Viejo, 42-12, are  led by 6-foot-3 Joel Rosborough, one of the area's best wide receivers. The  quarterback is junior Johnnie Nanson. The Panthers must improve their defense  to avoid another losing season. They were 1-9 in 1989.  </P> <P> 6. COMPTON -- New coach Mike Wells, a former player at San Diego State who was  a teacher last year at Compton, takes over a team that was 1-8 and 0-5. The  Tarbabes are above average at the skill positions but weak in the line, Wells  said. Top players are running back/linebacker Brian Bradford and quarterback  Edward Hervey. Compton is scheduled to play at its home field Oct. 12 for the  first time since fire destroyed the stands three years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY LEAGUE Paramount, Dominguez and Lynwood should fight for the  league title, with the other four teams evenly matched.  </P> <P> 1. PARAMOUNT -- The Pirates will try for their third consecutive Southern  Section title. Returning from a 13-1 team is all-CIF back Leon Neal, who gained  more than 1,700 yards last season. Neal and DeMondre White (9.5 yards a carry)  are part of the best backfield Coach Ken Sutch said he has ever had. Larry  Hooper and Steve Lopez will alternate at quarterback, replacing all-CIF Jack  Manu.  </P> <P> 2. DOMINGUEZ -- Bruce Walker has gone on to UCLA, but Willie Donerson's Dons  have seven starters back from an 8-4 team. The most prominent are track star  James Jackson, who scored 11 of the 37 times he carried the ball last season,  and wide receiver/defensive back Lavell Townsend. "We should be in the top  three in the league," Donerson said. Quarterback Anthony Young passed for 97  yards last Thursday in an opening 43-0 victory over Centennial.  </P> <P> 3. LYNWOOD -- "We are rebuilding attitudes, philosophies and techniques, and we  are starting from ground zero," said Coach Ben Carpenter, a former Lynwood  assistant who was a graduate assistant last season at Cal State Long Beach.  Carpenter, off to a good start with a 28-15 victory over Notre Dame of Sherman  Oaks, succeeds Joe Hembrick. The Knights, coming off a rare mediocre season  (5-5), have a strong offensive line and a talented secondary, but lack  linebackers. Eugene Jackson, an all-CIF cornerback, will try to replace  graduated star Charles Levy at quarterback. Lineman Don Jacobs was all-league  last season.  </P> <P> 4. DOWNEY -- The Vikings, trying to bounce back from a 3-7 and 0-6 season,  opened with a 42-26 victory over Damien as sophomore quarterback Johnnie Macon  ran for three touchdowns and threw for one. The Vikings have two dependable  linemen in Robert Bayles, who also plays linebacker, and all-league tackle  Demetrious Maxie. Coach Phil Dunaway said improving the defense will be the key  to making the playoffs.  </P> <P> 5. GAHR -- Coach Steve Silberman, after turning around a losing program, has  moved on to Macalester College in Minnesota. So the Gladiators, 7-4 last year,  will have to start over under Steve Nishimoto, former coach at Fullerton High.  "We have a lot of catching up to do," he said. Returning starters include  safety Frank Thornton, who will also play quarterback, and cornerback/running  back Darius Cunnigan. Gahr beat California, 15-10, last Friday night.  </P> <P> 6. WARREN -- The Bears, 3-7 last season, will depend on junior quarterback Jon  Miller and senior linebacker Mark Zapata. Miller threw for 179 yards in an  opening 21-14 loss to Lakewood. Coach John Hennigan has a lot of returners at  running back and wide receiver, but the offensive line is new.  </P> <P> 7. CERRITOS -- The Dons were 2-8 a year ago but Coach Harold Eggers said his  young team is much better. Leslie Davis is the best runner on the team and  quarterback Jon Nielsen started last season. Davis made a 75-yard TD run in an  opening 24-16 loss to La Mirada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WHITMONT LEAGUE Bell Gardens, El Rancho, Whittier and Montebello are expected  to fight for the title, as they did last season.  </P> <P> 1. MONTEBELLO -- With the graduation of all-CIF Miguel Cortez, the Oilers are  inexperienced at receiver. But they are strong defensively and in the offensive  line. Top players are defensive end Hector Del Rio and center Jesse Robledo.  The Oilers were 8-3 and 5-2 last season and finished in a second-place tie with  El Rancho and Bell Gardens.  </P> <P> 2. BELL GARDENS -- Tailback Rudy Ramirez (50 TDs in two years) is gone, but  Coach Dave Newell still sees his team, 7-4 last season, as a top contender. "We  have good receivers and a good offensive line," Newell said. Jesse Rafanon, who  caught 29 passes for 489 yards last season, is back. The best returning lineman  is tackle Jose Paulo. The Lancers lost their opener to Paramount, 27-6.  </P> <P> 3. EL RANCHO -- Nine juniors start on defense for Dick Shelko's Dons, who were  7-5 and 5-2 last season. The most prominent players are junior quarterback Jim  Arellanes, who threw for 1,000 yards last season; Noe Lopez, an outstanding  kicker, and 6-5, 285-pound senior offensive lineman Matt Hicks. The Dons lost  their opener to Los Altos, 21-13.  </P> <P> 4. WHITTIER -- The defending league champion Cardinals had one of their  greatest seasons in 1989, but Coach Mike Fitch said, "The only thing that  matters is the present." The team is fast but not as big as it was last season.  Top players are quarterback Eric Somilleva, fullback Albert Sethman and  offensive lineman Fernando Hernandez. The Cardinals, who lost to Covina, 14-7,  last week, have a tough preseason schedule.  </P> <P> 5. SANTA FE -- The Chiefs, 6-4 in 1989, are young and have only two defensive  starters returning, safety Jim Hudnall and linebacker Chris Sandoval. Coach  Mike Thomas thinks his team will be fighting for third or fourth place.  </P> <P> 6. CALIFORNIA -- The Condors, who lost their opener, 15-10, to Gahr, have the  experience to improve on a 2-8 record. Quarterback Larry Haney threw for more  than 1,500 yards last season as a sophomore. Paul Martinez is an all-league  tailback, and linebacker Shawn Olivarez leads the defense. "I think we will  surprise some people this year," said Coach Tom Tereschuk.  </P> <P> 7. PIONEER -- Taking over the Titans is Hugh Mendez, who was head coach at  Whittier College the last 10 years. "We will beat somebody," he predicted. If  that happens, the Titans will improve on last season's 0-10 record. They lost  their opener, however, 15-12, to Bassett. Tight end Danny Guerrero is the top  returning letterman.  </P> <P> 8. LA SERNA -- Wayne Manzo's Lancers, 1-9 last season, won't have quarterback  Brian Dunningan, who has decided to play only baseball. The main Lancer will be  runing back/safety Alfredo Martinez. Linebacking looks strong with Scott Keen  and St. Paul transfer Jim Uhl. La Serna, which lost to La Habra, 26-0, in the  opener, lacks depth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> SUBURBAN LEAGUE La Mirada has the size and the defense, but Glenn, Norwalk and  Mayfair can't be counted out.  </P> <P> 1. LA MIRADA -- The Matadores, who were 9-4 and did well in the playoffs last  season, have seven players back on defense, including all-CIF tackle Mike  Cardona (6-4, 280) and linebacker Kendall Alexander. Alexander rushed for 134  yards in a 24-16 victory over Cerritos last Thursday. The player from last  year's team that Coach John Mele will miss most is fullback Joe Fernandez. "If  we get the offense going we have a shot to win it," Mele said.  </P> <P> 2. GLENN -- The Eagles were 9-2 last season and finished in a first-place tie  in the league with Norwalk. They began this season with a 24-13 victory over La  Puente. Paseko Teo, who gained almost 1,000 yards, is back, as are Jerry  Jornadal, who rushed for 350 yards, and all-league guard Joshua Henderson.  Coach Willie Norman has only 30 players and will miss all-CIF back Travis  Carter, who graduated.  </P> <P> 3. NORWALK -- The Lancers average 230 pounds on their offensive line, but they  lost eight defensive starters from an 8-2 team, including all-CIF back Chuck  Stafford, who moved to Chicago. All-league Eric Peterson is back at tight end.  The Lancers edged Sierra Vista, 23-21, last week.  </P> <P> 4. MAYFAIR -- The Monsoons, the only team to beat Glenn in the regular season,  have seven starters returning in their bid to be a contender. Chris Shubin  (6-3, 260) was impressive last season as a sophomore tackle. Damion Watson is  an effective two-way back who scored twice in an opening 28-14 victory over  Keppel. Larry Hilliard is the new coach.  </P> <P> 5. ARTESIA -- Eight starters are back on defense, only two on offense from a  3-7 team. Tackle Jimmy Buford was all-league last season, as was linebacker  Scott Rafferty. "If we live through the preseason we will do pretty well," said  Coach Norm Flowers. The Pioneers survived the first game, 15-13, against Valley  Christian.  </P> <P> 6. BELLFLOWER -- "We are picked dead last so every game we win is an upset,"  said Coach Doug Bluth, who started his first full season last week with a 21-6  loss to South Torrance. The Bucs, 1-9 last season, are led by  tailback/defensive back Marcus Galbreath and fulback/linebacker Jacob Davis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CAMINO REAL LEAGUE Serra is expected to win, with everyone else contending for  second place.  </P> <P> ST. ANTHONY -- Run-oriented quarterback Garnett Overby, who started last season  as a sophomore, and fullback Lincoln Sii lead the Saints, but Overby injured  his hip in the opening 29-9 loss to Millikan. Coach Ralph Godfrey said his  defensive line is untested. The Saints were 3-7 last season.  </P> <P> PIUS X -- The Warriors' 17-7 opening loss to Santa Fe was their 21st successive  defeat, but that streak may end. "Everyone thinks we are going to be last but  if we're healthy we'll win a couple of games in league," said Coach Mike  Gallegos. Up from a champion sophomore team is running back/defensive end Phil  Ward. The best veteran is Devon English, who impressed as a runner last season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OLYMPIC LEAGUE Once again, Whittier Christian and Valley Christian are the  class of the league.  </P> <P> WHITTIER CHRISTIAN -- The Heralds are quick but inexperienced. Coach Phil Bravo  said 23 players on last season's 11-1 team graduated. Returning are offensive  lineman Ryan McEntire, a three-year starter, and two-way end Carl Martinez, who  was all-league in 1989. The Heralds outscored Dos Pueblos, 41-40, in the  opener.  </P> <P> VALLEY CHRISTIAN -- "We can't afford to get hurt, we're dressing 26 guys," said  Coach Mike Wunderley. The Crusaders have a sound defense and running game, but  will miss quarterback Chris Miller, who graduated. Top returnees from a 10-2  team are all-CIF linebacker Mike Overgaauw and tailback Mitch Bledsoe.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OTHERS SCHURR -- "I should be able to score some points, I hope," said Coach  Ken Davis, who has all-Foothill League quarterback Jay Macias and all-league  tight end Danny Vargas. But the Spartans, 7-4 and 4-1 last season, lack depth  and already have had injuries to some starters. They tied highly regarded  Montebello, 15-15, last week.  </P> <P> ST. JOHN BOSCO -- The Braves, coming off a 4-6 season, appear solid on offense  as they move into the Angelus League. Coach Gabe Soumakian's top players are  center Alex Hannaman and tackle Bobby Mendoza, both three-year starters. Bosco  will miss defensive standout Mike Munoz, who graduated. The Braves lost to  Valencia, 10-7, in their opener.  </P> <P> ST. PAUL -- The Swordsmen, who have moved from the Angelus League to the  Mission League, have Albert Borunda back at quarterback, but he threw four  interceptions in an opening 17-0 loss to Loyola. His top receiver last season,  Steve Corpus, is now at East Los Angeles College, and all the pass catchers are  new. Joe Ledesma, a 6-2, 250-pound tackle, is the team's best lineman. "Our  depth is definitely a problem," said Coach Miguel Olmeda.  </P> <P> CENTENNIAL -- "If there is a strength, it's the running game," Coach James  Emery said. "We moved the ball well against Dominguez (in a 42-0 loss last  week)." Tailback Raydon Hawthorne and fullback Eric Jones lead the Apaches, who  were winless last season and finished last in the Pioneer League. Emery was at  Compton College and was the golf coach at the school last year.  </P> <P> CANTWELL -- The Cardinals of the Santa Fe League, 4-5-1 last season, are led by  tailback Carlos Zarate (923 yards in 1989) and tackle Lou Ayala, a strong  blocker. Coach Mike Noonan said the weakness is tackling kick returners. Last  season, opponents returned five kicks for touchdowns, and the opening kickoff  last week resulted in a TD for Maranatha. But the Cards won, 34-6.  </P> <P> LEFFINGWELL CHRISTIAN -- The Lions, 3-6 last season, will be led by tailback  Allan LeCour, who had 1,500 yards in total offense as a junior.  </P> <P> PIONEER BAPTIST -- This team, in the eight-man division, has only eight  players, the best of whom is guard/defensive end Bobby Barnard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> CITY SECTION SCHOOLS SOUTH GATE -- The Rams, coming off a 10-1-1 season, have  all-league offensive tackle Carlos (The House) Nunez, who Coach Gary Cordray  said is as quick as a mouse. They also have linebacker Steve Martinez, who had  nine sacks last season. But the Rams do not have star runner Ivan Wilson, who  is now at El Camino College. Of 22 starters, 21 are seniors, but they lack  experience. "I would say our chances of winning the league are not very good,"  Cordray said. "It will be between us and Fremont for second place. Locke will  win the league."  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON PARK -- Quarterback Chris Hernandez, who threw for more than 1,000  yards and 10 touchdowns in 1989, leads the Spartans. On defense, the key player  is all-league linebacker Manuel Carvajal. Coach Dwight Muskrath said his team  will contend for the league title despite an inexperienced offensive line.  </P> <P> BELL -- Of eight starters who were thrown off the team for disciplinary reasons  last season, six are back, which makes Coach Ray Galarze hopeful of improving  on a 3-7 record. Two of those players are Armando Lara and Marshall Valante,  who were all-league running backs as sophomores. Gilbert Garcia is an  experienced quarterback. The Eagles lack kickers.  </P></p>

			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / 'Sensei, are we still in hot water?': William Dawkins overhears a young member of Japan's finance ministry seeking advice from his elderly mentor It is a snowy day in the mountains north of Tokyo. An old man sits up to his neck in a rock pool of steaming water, taking a therapeutic soak in the wooded setting of one of Japan's most famous onsen, or hot water springs. His name is Takeshi, a retired senior finance ministry bureaucrat. When not playing golf or meditating in hot baths, he is employed as an adviser to several of the world's largest banks. A worried-looking young man, wearing a yukata - a cotton bath robe - pads down the snowy path, undresses, shivers and slips into the pool. This is Tokoro, a bureaucrat at the all-powerful finance ministry, who owes his prestigious job to Takeshi's patronage. Takeshi lifts a flannel from his lean, fit-looking face to acknowledge the young visitor's attempt at a semi-submerged bow. 'What brings you here, my boy?' he asks. 'I need your advice, sensei,' Tokoro replies. 'That troublesome prime minister of ours has asked me to write a report about the recession. Is it going to get worse, he wants to know. 'He wants quick solutions, in time to announce them late next week. The economy is the first job on his list after political reform, which he thinks he will get through parliament next Wednesday, despite the efforts of his enemies in the Liberal Democratic party. Most regrettable. I thought my job was to keep politicians in the dark.' Takeshi narrows his eyes, for a moment looking like a dangerous water lizard. Playing safe did not get him to his position as a member of the 'iron triangle' of senior bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians, which covertly runs Japan. 'You must learn to move with the times,' he says. 'Politicians these days want to give the impression that they, not we, are running the country. So give Prime Minister Hosokawa what he wants. After all, your ministry will far outlast his fragile government.' Tokoro looks alarmed. 'You don't mean I should tell the prime minister the truth?' 'By all means,' replies the sage. 'Tell him this: the economy might get a bit worse soon, then improve maybe late this year. But it will be a pretty weak recovery, because years of complacency by your bureaucratic colleagues  -if you will forgive me for being blunt - and by the business establishment have allowed surplus industrial capacity and excess employment to build up. Companies are employing between 1m and 2m people more than they need - perhaps the same number again as the 1 3/4 m officially unemployed. 'On top of this, it will take the banking system such a long time to write off its bad debts, caused by the fall in property and stock prices, that it cannot be expected to finance a strong recovery. Some of the gloomier ones among my banking colleagues privately reckon their total bad debts are at least Y30,000bn (Pounds 179bn), just over 11 times this year's net profits. 'Unless Mr Hosokawa takes courageous action, he risks an uncontrollable deflationary spiral and a banking crisis. Judging by the recent rise in share prices, the stock market thinks that won't happen. Yet in fact, a crisis might be just the thing we need to sharpen the minds of those squabbling coalition partners,' concludes the old man. The effort of listening to this long speech makes Tokoro look even more overheated than the sensei, hard-boiled by many years of hot water bathing. 'But how can it get worse?' asks the pupil. 'Already, this recession is the worst since the war. And I don't believe the scare story about the surplus of labour. I thought we had a long-term shortage of workers. If we don't now, we soon will have, as the proportion of people over 65 increases from 13 per cent now to one in four by 2020,' he says, checking the figures from the damp note-book wrapped in his towel. 'Moreover, our ministry will never allow a banking crisis. What are we paid for?' Takeshi, amused by the young man's innocence, smiles benevolently. A spiral of steam twists round the old man's head, adding to the pupil's troubled impression that not all is what it seems. The sensei explains: 'Your ministry colleagues like to think that so long as demand rebounds, we can go back to normal. But the real economic problem is deeper than that. Why do you imagine the Y30,000bn of pump-priming measures produced over the past 16 months and the record low interest rates our friends at the Bank of Japan have been kind enough to deliver have had such little effect?' 'Obviously, those measures weren't enough,' says Tokoro. 'We at the ministry have withdrawn our opposition to the income tax cut that Mr Hosokawa wants so badly, because he appears to have accepted our argument that it must be financed by a rise in sales tax. So that is a good sign. 'Some politicians say consumer demand would improve even more if we scrapped the planned sales tax rise. But we cannot do that. Somehow we must make up for the decline in income tax revenues that will take place as we all get older, and start drawing our state pensions. There are plenty of wage earners like me to pay for your pension, sensei, but who is going to pay for mine?' Takeshi scoops a handful of snow from the pool edge and throws it at Tokoro  -recalling the Zen masters' technique of using shock to knock wisdom into slow pupils. 'We need tax reform, but don't be fooled into thinking that is the way to economic nirvana,' he exclaims. 'The amount you can afford to give away in income tax cuts, say between Y5,000bn and Y10,000bn, is not enough to stimulate the economy. And as I have tried to explain, demand is not the real problem.' Tokoro gives a despairing look. 'Have you got anything constructive to say?' he asks. 'Yes,' says Takeshi. 'Mr Hosokawa still has time to stop deflation before it runs out of control. He must improve the supply of credit and help companies curb surplus capacity, so as to increase their profitability. First, he must free up the supply of credit by making it practical for banks to turn bad debts into marketable securities. It would also help the banks if he dismantled the heavy property taxes we introduced in 1987 to try to brake the rise in land prices.' Tokoro says: 'Some of us at the ministry have been thinking about securitisation for some months. We have not yet persuaded colleagues in other departments, who think securitisation is a dodgy practice that might lead to another uncontrollable rise in asset prices. I'll try harder, but I can't guarantee anything, sensei. 'But what can we do about the other big problem, industrial overcapacity?' asks the pupil. 'The bureaucracy is not as powerful as it was in your day. We can't just tell Mazda to close down, for instance.' 'Of course not, thank goodness,' Takeshi replies. 'But you can use administrative guidance to encourage companies to reduce their workforces and bring their break-even levels more in line with their leaner US and south-east Asian competitors.' 'Why haven't you mentioned de-regulation?' asks Tokoro. 'I know it's a deplorable policy, but the electorate really seems to share Mr Hosokawa's fondness for it. Too many economists are saying that fewer regulations will improve corporate profitability in the long run.' Takeshi sighs. 'This deregulation crusade only shows how you young bureaucrats are losing your grip on power. But don't despair. Mr Hosokawa is not the first to try deregulation, and you can ensure he joins the queue of failures. Stop trying to resist too hard. When it becomes clear that powerful business interests will get hurt as regulations are removed, the whole thing should die away, as it has in the past.' 'I am always grateful for your wisdom,' says Tokoro. 'I will pass on your ideas to the honourable prime minister. But if I get fired as a result of his campaign to win control over the bureaucracy, can you fix me a job at one of your banks?' Takeshi smiles: 'Certainly, dear fellow. If we Tokyo University graduates didn't look after each other, where would Japan be today?'</p>

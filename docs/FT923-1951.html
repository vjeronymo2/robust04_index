			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Fishing: A bite in the beck THE RESPONSE to my offer to provide trout for supper was, I thought, short on trust and long on scepticism. Their expressions seemed to say: 'We've heard that one before. Get the chops out of the freezer.' But I was quietly confident, eager to assume the role of the hunter. It was an old-fashioned Lake District day. Rain poured from an implacable slate sky. The fell tops were invisible, the lower slopes streaked with silver torrents. Drainpipes gushed; sheep, trees, and holidaymakers dripped mournfully. At such times you can forget the elegances of fly fishing. You need worms, and plenty of them, in a box that will fit into the pocket of a sound, waterproof coat. The other requirements are wellington boots, a packet of hooks, some weights, a 10ft rod with a fixed spool reel, a bag for the fish, and a sturdy indifference to the elements. The trout of these lakeland becks are at the sharp end of life's struggle. Little food comes their way in the turbulent pools; what there is must be grabbed at once or lost for ever. A spate is their time of plenty as worms, beetles, slugs and caterpillars are washed their way. Appetites are keen and reflexes quick. The technique is simplicity itself. The angler crouches beside the pool and lobs the weighted worm into it, seeking out the eddies and holes behind rocks. The line is held between the fingers and the reaction to the jab-jab of the bite must be instant (otherwise, it will be found that the worm has been filched or it and the hook swallowed). Once a trout has been hooked, it must be transferred from its own sphere to the terrestrial one as soon as possible. Forget about playing it and do not encumber yourself with a net. Simply swing it out of the water over the land; then seize it, unhook it, and either knock it on the head or return it. The technique is simple, but that is not to say it is easy. There are times when the fish will not bite at all, and others when they will bite everything except the portion of the worm containing the hook. Most vexing of all is the amazing facility of these trout for wriggling free of the hook mid-way through the swing from water to land. Hurling yourself on your knees and clutching with bare hands at a slimy escapee is undignified and usually fruitless. This beck fishing is also physically taxing for those accustomed to meandering southern chalk-streams. It involves much scrambling over devilishly slippery rocks, and slithering up and down spongy, sodden banks of moss. Sooner or later, you will slide or step into a pool deeper than your boots, and wet feet will be added to other discomforts. In such circumstances, self-control is lost easily. I remember watching a brother fishing the best pool on this particular lakeland stream. He had insisted, against all advice, on using a soft-tipped fly rod and, as a result, lost each of the six trout he hooked. For a moment, I feared he was about to stamp on the offending implement, until - with a visible effort - he got a grip on himself. I have had my share of such nightmares but was favoured on this recent excursion with a tolerable proportion of success amid the usual blunders and failures. The beck - it runs down not far from Ambleside, but I will give no further clue as to its location - was in perfect order. In the first decent pool, I took two nice fish. One was a full 6oz, a good specimen in this Lilliputian world. In the next pool I lost two, thanks to a pestilential overhanging branch which inhibited the landward swing. Thus was the pattern of the morning established until, having forged my way up two miles of valley, I found it wasn't morning any more. I was troubled briefly by the recollection that I had promised to be back for lunch. But I reminded myself that the chief duty of the hunter is to provide for his dependents, rather than to observe bourgeois conventions such as mealtimes. I arrived back late in the afternoon with 10 trout of edible size, having put back as many more. In the event, the children and their mothers turned up their ill-educated noses at the hunter's spoils, which I shared with another brother. Thirty years ago, when I first fished the beck, I was told by an old Ambleside angler that its trout were the sweetest-tasting in the whole of the Lake District. I am happy to report that they have lost nothing of that.</p>

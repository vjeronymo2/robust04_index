			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Stoichkov chases seven-goal mark Prio to yesterday's semi-finals, Bulgarian star Hristo Stoichkov needed two more goals to hit the seven-goal barrier at the World Cup, a mark that has not been reached in 20 years. He was the only player left in the tournament with five goals. In contention with four apiece were Sweden's Kennet Andersson and Martin Dahlin, and Brazil's Romario. Russia's Oleg Salenko is the leading scorer with six goals, a record five coming against Cameroon. Grzegorz Lato of Poland scored seven goals during the 1974 World Cup. Just Fontaine of France holds the record: 13 goals in the 1958 tournament.</p>

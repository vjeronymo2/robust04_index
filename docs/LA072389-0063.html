			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: THE UNOPPOSITE SEX BY ELISABETH BADINTER TRANSLATED BY  BARBARA WRIGHT (HARPER &amp; ROW: $22.50; 304 PP.)  </P> <P> In this book covering the history of all humanity, Elisabeth Badinter draws  upon anthropology, paleontology, primate studies, history, classics and  literature to weave a narrative describing how the sexes are by nature  complementary. For 4,000 years, she argues, this complementarity has been  skewed by masculine domination, but this situation is now shifting and coming  into balance.  </P> <P> Badinter begins by asserting that among hunters and gatherers women were by no  means inferior. Men of the Paleolithic were well aware of the complementarity  of the sexes, she claims -- after all, it was women who invented agriculture --  but the complementarity became obscured by a subsequent ideological revolution.  </P> <P> One of Badinter's underlying theses is that we are all bisexual. She writes  that Adam's rib is the equivalent of the maternal womb. Therefore, if God is  Eve's creator, Adam is her mother, or a kind of mother/father. To support this  view, she draws on a series of Harvard studies of infants, which demonstrate  the similarity of male and female fantasies about giving birth. The author does  not neglect the realm of psychoanalysis, citing those analysts who depart from  Freud in focusing on the problems in the acquisition of masculine (rather than  feminine) identity; they see the male as forever beset by fears of maternal  omnipotence. Badinter is convinced that we are now in the throes of a profound  revolution ushering in what she calls "bisexual humanity." "The equality which  is now coming about," she writes in this book which was long on the French  bestseller list, "engenders a resemblance (between the sexes) which puts an end  to this war. Now that the protagonists like to think of themselves as the  'whole' of humanity, each side is in a better position to understand the Other  . . . . We may perhaps lose something of our passion and desire thereby, but we  shall gain the sort of tenderness and cooperation that can unite the members of  a single family." To marshal such vast quantities of information in a human  panorama of such scope is something of a feat; even when the style goes flat,  the facts keep coming. Not that the facts are uninteresting. But because of the  alacrity with which various topics are treated, one is reminded of the remark  of a medieval monk: With a pen one can write anything one pleases.  </P></p>

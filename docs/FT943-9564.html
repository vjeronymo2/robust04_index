			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / International Company News: Higher costs hit HK Aircraft Engineering Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), the aircraft maintenance subsidiary of the Swire Pacific Group, saw net profits inch up to HKDollars 215.2m (USDollars 27.8m) for the six months to June 30 this year, compared with HKDollars 213.9m for the same period last year. The company blamed the stagnant results on rising operating costs, exacerbated by inflation; reduced margins on airframe maintenance; and losses on managed funds sparked by the worldwide fall in bond prices. Earnings per share were also flat, at HKDollars 1.16 compared with HKDollars 1.15. The interim dividend is to be held at 30 cents. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said: 'It is expected that the company's maintenance and overhaul divisions will enjoy reasonable levels of work in the second half of the year. 'However, as a result of worldwide overcapacity, rates for heavy airframe maintenance work have fallen sharply and are expected to remain depressed. In this generally difficult environment, any improvement in the results for the full year may be difficult to achieve.' Haeco received higher line maintenance revenues on the back of a 7.8 per cent increase in the number of aircraft movements at the colony's Kai Tak airport. Scheduled checks on Cathay Pacific's fleet were supplemented by refurbishing work on three of the airline's Boeing 747s, and maintenance work on aircraft belonging to other companies, including Air India. Union Bank of Hong Kong lifted net income for the first six months of 1994 by 40 per cent to HKDollars 71.7m, AP-DJ reports from Hong Kong. The bank said its deposit base grew 28 per cent in the first half from a year earlier.</p>

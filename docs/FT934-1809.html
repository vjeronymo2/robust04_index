			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Germans defend recycling scheme Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, yesterday defended his country's recycling scheme following a decision by European environment ministers to introduce lower European recycling quotas than those in Germany, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. In a statement, Mr Topfer, the architect of Germany's ambitious environmental legislation, said the agreement would set back recycling programmes in Europe and force Germany to produce more waste. 'It is not supposed to be the EU's job to standardise the environmental tempo in all member states at any price or even to reverse it,' Mr Topfer said.</p>

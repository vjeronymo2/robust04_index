			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter indicated that SDA designation, under &sect;628.405(a)(3) of the interim final rule, should not be required for a previously designated SDA which has complied with all of the JTPA mandates and has successfully operated good training programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is nothing in the Act or interim final regulations that requires existing SDA's to formally apply for designation or redesignation by the Governor when such designations are to be made within the State. Section 628.405(a)(3) only indicates that the Governor should address the treatment of existing SDA's in the procedures developed to govern the SDA designation process within the State. Thus, the Governor may choose to require reapplication for each designation cycle or to permit existing SDA's to continue without the need for a new application. Section 628.405(a)(2) of the interim final regulations is redesignated, in part, as (a)(3), and is amended to clarify this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters took exception to the requirement that the Governor establish standards by which to evaluate discretionary SDA designation requests under section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act which, at a minimum, must include the criteria set forth at &sect;628.405(d). These requirements are viewed as overly prescriptive, limiting the Governor's discretion in making SDA designations and establishing a higher standard than that provided for in the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department believes that neither the provisions of the Act nor the interim final regulations, at &sect;628.405(d), inhibit the Governor from making discretionary SDA designations, pursuant to section 101(a)(4)(B) of the Act. The Department does not believe that the regulatory provisions are overly prescriptive in establishing some uniform minimum standards for the Governor to evaluate such designation requests. With approximately one-third of the over 640 current SDA's being discretionary designations, it is necessary to ensure the viability of such SDA's to adequately administer and promote effective delivery of JTPA services to a substantial portion of the eligible population in the area to be served. The regulations simply formalize the minimum standards that Governors would need to consider and, in most instances, probably already have established, in making discretionary SDA designations consistent with the provisions at section 101 of the Act. The Department believes that the regulations in this area are consistent with the provisions at section 101 of the Act and the Secretary's authority to promulgate regulations to implement the provisions of the Act. No change is made to the final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters took exception to defining ``substantial part'' and ``substantial portion'' of a labor market area (LMA) for the purposes of SDA designations under section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii) and (B) of the Act, respectively. These commenters argue that the requirement that the prospective SDA serve 10 percent of the population of an LMA is arbitrary, artificial and exceeds the language in the Act, unduly limiting the Governor's flexibility to determine SDA's for the State. The commenters recommended that the 10-percent provision be withdrawn from the final rule. A few of the commenters suggested including a ``grandfather'' provision for existing SDA's in the regulations, if the 10-percent provision is not removed in the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Act provides that prospective entities seeking SDA status under the provisions of section 101(a)(4) (A)(ii) and (B) of the Act serve a substantial portion/part of an LMA as a statutory criteria for designation. In the past, the Department has deferred to the Governor's definition of ``substantial'' for the purposes of such designations, which has resulted in a wide range of thresholds being established, from levels significantly below the 10 percent provided for in the regulations, to a majority of an LMA. The Department reached the 10-percent figure taking into consideration the need for a rational figure which would assist the Governors in the SDA designation process and still ensure the statutory mandate for serving a substantial portion or part of an LMA, as appropriate. The regulations still provide that the Governor defines these terms, with the 10 percent floor as a minimum requirement. The Department believes that the 10-percent figure is reasonable and consistent with the provisions of the Act and the Secretary's authority to promulgate regulations implementing the Act, while still maintaining the Governor's flexibility in designating SDA's. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On the suggestion that existing SDA's be ``grandfathered'' notwithstanding the 10-percent requirement, part 627, Subpart I, Transition Provisions, of the interim final rule addresses this issue. The regulation, at &sect;627.904(l), indicates that, at the Governor's discretion, SDA's designated prior to July 1, 1992, need not be subject to the provisions at &sect;628.405. The Department does not believe that further clarification is needed. No change is made to the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Private Industry Council  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 628.410 of the interim final rule set forth requirements relating to the establishment and functioning of the PIC. Comments on the provisions of this section fell mainly into three areas: PIC recertification, joint agreement on the plan for Wagner-Peyser activities of the employment service and PIC representation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters questioned the requirement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;628.410(a)(2) that the Governor recertify the PIC biennially, one year prior to the date of submission of the job training plan. The commenters indicated that this requirement was an undue administrative burden and appeared to go beyond the provisions of section 102(g) of the Act, which states: ``The Governor shall certify a private industry council if the Governor determines that its composition and appointments are consistent with this subsection.'' In response to this concern,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;628.410(a)(2) is amended to require the Governor to review the PIC certification biennially rather than to formally recertify the PIC. The review process is intended to afford the Governor a continuing role in ensuring that the PIC is an effective local policy making body. The requirements specified in &sect;628.410(a)(3) encompass three areas: the PIC membership and the nomination process, the PIC/chief elected official agreement, and the responsibilities of the PIC to carry out its role.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

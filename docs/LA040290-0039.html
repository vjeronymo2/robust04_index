			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADRIFT IN A SEA OF COALITIONS;  </P> <P> ISRAEL'S SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO EVOLVE IF IT IS TO COPE  </P> <P> Israel's late coalition government experienced many failures. Among the  greatest was its inability to deal with the compelling need for electoral  reform. The consequences are again wearisomely apparent as inconclusive  maneuvering continues over who will lead and who will take part in the next  government.  </P> <P> To achieve a parliamentary majority, either Labor or Likud (the two major  political blocs) needs considerable support from among the other 13 marginal  parties represented in the Knesset. That requires delicate negotiations and  balancing of the competing demands of one special interest group against  another. It's a tedious and not always dignified process. For a democracy  facing urgent challenges that call for clear and prompt decisions, it can be  dangerous as well.  </P> <P> Since 1988, Labor and Likud between them have controlled 79 of the Knesset's  120 seats, more than enough to legislate changes to eliminate the  disproportionate influence so long enjoyed by fringe parties. No party in  Israel has ever won an electoral majority at the polls. Coalitions have thus  always been the rule. Until the 1984 shotgun marriage of Labor and Likud, those  coalitions included one or more of the religious parties. In a largely secular  society, that participation has given the religious minority an extraordinary  claim on patronage and special privileges.  </P> <P> But the problem with Israel's politics isn't parochial, it's systemic. The  multiplicity of parties that emerged with the birth of the state reflected  Israel's cultural heterogeneity and the Zionist movement's historic divisions.  Get three Israelis together in a room, the old joke goes, and they will soon  form four political parties. Some say the continuance of the multiparty system  indicates the freewheeling vibrancy of Israeli politics. From a larger  perspective, it's arguably an indication of an outmoded political immaturity,  of a refusal to compromise to obtain more efficient and, yes, more truly  democratic government. That's why public opinion in Israel is increasingly  supporting the call for electoral reform.  </P> <P> Reform, though, is for the future. Labor and Likud each hope to lead the next  government. Each, though, now seems unable to command more than a non-majority  60 votes in the Knesset.  </P> <P> What should come next? The best course -- and not for reasons of electoral  reform alone -- is to forget about coalition-building and move on to new  elections, in hope of breaking a crippling political deadlock. Granted, the  next election could again prove inconclusive. But at least it would give  Israelis a chance to try to end the policy paralysis of recent years. Who  knows: It could even bring closer the time when an anachronistic electoral  system can be abandoned.  </P></p>

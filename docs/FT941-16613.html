			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Practical Traveller: Budapest - spa city The Turks, abandoning Budapest to the Austrian Army in 1686, must have looked with regret at what they were leaving. Buda was not only a long-standing outpost of the Ottoman Empire but a place well-endowed with natural springs - subterranean fountains that fed a network of Turkish baths. Today, 500,000 cubic meters of water percolate daily through the city's limestone-rich soil, filling 31 medicinal baths and open-air pools and making Budapest one of the world's great spa cities. Do not be misled by the word 'spa'. A spa is merely a mineral spring or hotel built around springs; luxury is not a requisite. This is certainly true with Budapest. On the other hand, its springs certainly have what it takes: calcium, magnesium, fluoride, sulfates, alkalies, even radium. This combination, known to treat inflammation as well as respiratory problems, is what makes Budapest's water so prized. Well-being is not the only reason for a spa visit. The architecture, from 16th-century Turkish baths to turn-of-the- century resorts, is as fascinating as the water is therapeutic. Although there are more than 30 spas, the number includes summer swimming pools and modern clinics. For the real thing, you need only to focus on a handful of locations. My favourite is the Gellert Hotel and medicinal baths, a belle-epoque monstrosity which seems to float like a wedding cake on the Buda end of Liberty Bridge. The Gellert dates from 1918 and is the city's only remaining 'old world' resort-spa. The hotel partly faces the Danube and, although billed as one of Budapest's finest (Pounds 132 per double room, spa included), is in need of upgrading from its present no-frills, socialist-era decor. Hotel guests reach the spa by private elevator; the paying public enters separately. There are some strange treatments available, but stick to the Gellert's basics: thermal baths (men and women separately); outdoor wave pool and indoor swimming pool. Avoid the manicure and pedicure and take a massage at your own risk (it is a few slaps short of torture). To make your visit easier, take some coins for tipping and learn a few words, like furdo (bath), gozfurdo (thermal bath) and kijarat (exit). Unwind first in the thermal baths. Both men's and women's baths are elaborately decorated. Leaving the baths, grab a new towel and take a cold plunge or change into a swimsuit for the indoor pool. This naturally carbonated, glass-roofed pool was added in 1934 and echoes the Roman baths of Caracalla. I expected a sunny, lively room, but there was too much cloud cover that day. The detailing, however, is stunning: carved marble columns flank the pool and rise to a palm-tree-lined balcony. The Gellert baths close at 8pm on weekdays, 2pm Saturdays and 1pm Sundays. The indoor pool closes at 7pm, except Sundays (4pm). The Szechenyi Baths in City Park is one of the grandest bathing houses in Europe, attracting 2m people a year. The thermal baths are elegant but even better are the three outdoor thermal pools (hottest 38'C). Here you will witness Budapest's famous postcard vignette in living colour: bathers standing in the water, playing chess on cork boards. The domes of Budapest's remaining 16th century Turkish baths are still scattered among the Baroque architecture of Buda's neighbourhoods. At the foot of Elizabeth Bridge you cannot miss the hemi-spherical cupola of the Rudas Bath, known for its green columns and radioactive water which clients drink to boost circulation. Continuing towards Margaret Island you will be transported back to the Ottoman Empire by the four crescent-topped domes of the Kiraly Baths, built in 1566. Here, history seems to hang on the vapors. It is not hard to picture Turkish pashas immersed in reverie as invading troops pummel the city walls, ending forever Budapest's entanglement with the Sultanate.</p>

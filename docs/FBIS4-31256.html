			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Jovanovic, Dusko Vujadinovic, Goran </F> Sinadjinovic, and Pedja Bozovic: "The Comeback of Write-offs"]    [Text] The latest military successes of the Bosnian  troops on many fronts, particularly Mount Majevica, and the  final subordination of the Croatian brigades under the command  of the central authority in Sarajevo, speaks more and more for  the likelihood that the war will be settled by operations in the  field. The agencies are reporting the formation of the joint  General Staff of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina [BH Army],  headed by Generals Fikret Muslimovic and Ante Roso. This is, in  fact, the result of the mission by U.S. General John Galvin, who  organized and directed many meetings between the Bosnian and the  Croatian generals.    It seems that at the strategic level the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO] still has some autonomy: the chief of HVO General  Staff, General Milivoje Petkovic, said recently in Mostar that  the HVO units positioned near Orasje would be receiving his  orders in the case of clashes in Bosanska Posavina [Sava River  basin], but also that the 107th and 108th HVO brigade, which are  located in the area of responsibility of the 2d Corps of the BH  Army are under the direct command of the Bosnian officers. The  tension is easing in Mostar, while the occasional incidents  between the Bosnian and Croatian forces no longer have serious  consequences. It is believed that the Croatian seaports, in  particular Split and Ploce, are gradually opening for arms  imports, which are accumulating on the Tuzla front, near the  northern corridor. What do the troops of the Bosnian new  federal army have at their disposal at the moment?  <H5>  Ethnic Diversity </H5>   The "old" Bosnian army (without the HVO) had some 70,000 to  80,000 effective soldiers (meaning well-armed), and more than  100,000 men in reserve forces. They are organized in six corps  and two independent brigades, which are organized according to  operational zones. The (JANE'S) SENTINEL agency believes that  the Bosnians have 85 tanks and around 100 large caliber cannons,  while there are also, as MONITOR found out, at least 14  helicopters concentrated in the regions of Zenica (because of  clashes on Mount Vlasic) and Tuzla (see box).    The Bosnian Army's forces are ethnically diverse, and  correspond to the national makeup of the territory controlled by  the central government. At least 10 percent of the Bosnian Army  are Serbs. There is only one unit composed exclusively of Muslim  soldiers, namely the 7th brigade, which involves volunteers to a  certain degree as well.    The HVO is organized according to the territorial principle.  The arrangement is according to operational zones, and one such  zone is made up of six to eight brigades. In the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina the HVO has some 45,000 soldiers (making up a  total of 22 brigades), five independent regiments, two armored  motorized platoons, and one special unit with 1,000  diversionists.    One HVO brigade has around 1,800 people (that number used to  vary from 500 to 2,500), while each of the brigades contains the  command post, three infantry battalions, and one military police  platoon.    The regiments number around 1,000 fighters. In western  Herzegovina and the Neretva basin there are 20,000 HVO soldiers,  in northern Bosnia there are around 10,000 to 12,000 soldiers,  6,000 to 8,000 soldiers in central Bosnia, some 2,000 soldiers  in the region of Sarajevo, as much in Bihac, and a quite  insignificant number in the enclaves of eastern Bosnia.    The Croatian forces in central Bosnia are organized within  the 5th operational zone, while in northern Bosnia the 102d,  103d, 105th, 107th, 108th, 115th, and 139th brigades are  deployed within the 4th operational zone. According to Western  assessments, the HVO has at its disposal 105 tanks (mostly T-54  and T-55), while as for rocket launchers, it has RPG-7,  Maljutka, Zolja, Osa, and Ambrust types. Of the multi-stage  rocket launchers, the HVO has Oganj and Plamen (128  millimeters), and the manual BM-21. As for cannons these are  mostly 76 millimeter caliber, and 105 millimeter howitzers.    The controversy over a plane loaded with explosives and  (perhaps) ammunition at Zagreb airport -- it was supposed to  strengthen the war logistics of the Bosnians -- is not of much  significance, and is probably aimed at achieving propaganda  goals. The explosives factory in Vitez -- now controlled by the  HVO -- is merging with the Bratstvo factory in Novi Travnik  (which was attacked by Serbian Galebs [seagulls] on 28  February), which produces rockets, cannons and howitzers, as  well as with the rocket fuel factory in Bugojno and the  lightweight infantry weapons factory in Konjic.    Serbian military sources believe that at the moment the  Bosnians most need tanks and armored vehicles (which is logical,  in view of their offensive character), and claim that there is a  plan for such equipment to be transported by C-5 Galaxy and  C-141 Star-Lifter heavy transport planes either to Sarajevo  Airport or Tuzla Airport.  <H5>  Generals and Politicians </H5>   Who are the commanders of the new Bosnian federal army?  General Colonel Ante Roso started his military career in the  French Foreign Legion, where he worked his way up to the rank of  colonel and commander of the 2d parachute brigade. At the  beginning of the war in Croatia he commanded the ZNG [People's  Guard's Corps] units in Slavonia, and organized the Croatian  guard brigade in Vukovar. He was commander of the Croatian  special units (Zrinjski and Frankopan units), after which he  went to Bosnia, where he became chief of the HVO Staff.    Later he gave up that post to General Milivoj Petkovic (then  commander of the 113th HVO brigade). Thereafter General Roso  was relocated to the command area of Split, where, together with  Generals Janko Bobetko and Zeljko Tomljenovic of the Croatian  Interior Ministry, he organized the raid on the Serbian position  around Maslenica bridge in January last year. After that he  returned to Bosnia, and took over the post of commander in chief  of the HVO Staff from General Slobodan Praljak.    General Fikret Muslimovic is a former officer of the  Yugoslav  People's Army, who -- at his own request -- was demobilized  early in 1992, but the circumstances remain unclear. On the eve  of the war he was selling books in Bas-Carsija [Sarajevo old  town]. Some claim it was a gesture of his determination, while  others say it was just a camouflage covering the fact that he  was a KOS [Counterintelligence Service] officer. As a matter of  fact, General Muslimovic was the head of the security service of  the then Sarajevo Corps, although he actually graduated from the  Military Academy, which is to say, his qualifications are those  of a "combat" officer.    In the BH Army he was chief of the military secret police.  Many people believe he was involved in the affair regarding the  removal of the former commander of the BH Army, namely General  Sefer Halilovic, but this has never been officially confirmed.  He enjoys President Izetbegovic's support, whereas to a lesser  extent that of Haris Silajdzic's. Some people with whom MONITOR  spoke believe that by his appointment as chief of the BH Army  Izetbegovic is trying to strengthen his control over the  military structure, because so far the top officers have always  been more devoted to Silajdzic.  <H5>  Strategic Direction </H5>   General Tudjman [Croatian president] stated on Saturday that  Croatia had no intention of extending the mandate to the blue  helmets in the UN protection areas, which expires in September.  The matter is probably that the revival of military efforts  aimed at placing Krajina under the Croatian control is being  prepared. An introduction into this is probably a possible  escalation of the war in Bosnia, particularly the battle for the  strategic jugular -- the northern Serbian corridor.    From the point of view of the Bosnian military forces,  Izetbegovic's statement about an acceptable truce lasting two,  rather than four months, sounds logical, since the estimates  about the time needed for the consolidation of the Bosnian and  the Croatian forces to be completed largely correspond to his  demand. Still, it is believed that the task of organizing joint  units that is awaiting the two sides, will be very difficult,  since the existing forces do not meet the conditions necessary  for the formation of relatively strong armored battalions --  which are indispensable for offensive operations. In addition,  the lack of larger mechanized infantry units capable of  providing adequate support to tank units while operating in  lowlands and uplands around the northern corridor (from  Semberija to Doboj) is very conspicuous.    The Serbian military circles are convinced that the basic  strategic direction of the latest activities of the Bosnian  forces is -- Brcko. This attitude is disclosed by several  statements made by people in the Serbian military and political  leadership. The Serbs have piled up an enormous force on the  60-kilometer wide front to the south of the Sava, in the wider  area of Brcko, but except for several artillery attacks by the  BH Army, there has not been any real raid on Brcko. Our  estimates say that such a raid will hardly happen, because the  Bosnians are hardly capable of holding Brcko, if the fighting  for the northern corridor happens to be concentrated on Brcko  only.    The Bosnians have tied the Serbian forces to the Brcko  front, and thus forced them to stretch their lines. The Bosnian  forces are keeping up pressure on other fronts, while through  their linear disposition of troops, their activities are still  not disclosing the point of a key attack. As a matter of fact,  this attack will hardly happen, if the Croats fail to guarantee  that they will bring in the mass artillery support from the left  bank of the Sava. However, this would involve the risk of  possible revival of clashes in Krajina, to which a possible  introduction may be the recent interruption of the negotiating  process between Zagreb and Knin and Belgrade.    Nevertheless, it seems that the clashes going on at Mount  Majevica at the moment have perhaps the greatest importance:  U.S. reconnaissance planes have discovered a strengthened  accumulation of Serbian artillery on the mountain. The news  agencies claim that the commander of the European military  sector south, NATO Admiral Layton Smith, has sought UNPROFOR's  permission to attack the Serbian positions.    The entire matter is still so confusing, particularly  because  of the undefined position of the blue helmets in Bosnia, as well  as the announcement of their possible withdrawal. Still, it is  unlikely that the withdrawal will come about. The crisis  regarding the issue has probably been caused by the confusing  attitudes of the U.S. Administration. The announced partition  of Bosnia in the form of a tripartite union does not sound  acceptable either to the Bosnian side, or to the Serbian side,  and that situation could possibly be resolved by an eventual  military defeat of one of the rival armies.</p>

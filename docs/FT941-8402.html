			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: They've moved my file Does a taxpayer have any right to ask that his tax affairs be dealt with at an office close to his residence? Mine have been handled in the local IR office in Devon for the past 13 years, which is handy for local telephone calls and visits. Now it says my affairs are to be handled in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 300 miles away. The only reason it gives me is that Newcastle is the source of the major part of my pension income. Write to the Controller, Inland Revenue South-west Regional Office, Finance House, Barnfield Road, Exeter EX1 1QX (quoting your tax district and reference number) and explain why it makes sense for your tax affairs to continue to be dealt with at your local office. You could also ask for a copy of the free leaflet IR120 (You and the Inland Revenue), either from the regional office or from your local office. At the same time, you might like to write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room, Somerset House, Strand, London WC2R 1LB, for a free copy of Budget press release IR3 (Self-assessment and simplification of personal tax). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Delors makes plea for industrial leadership MR JACQUES DELORS, president of the European Commission, yesterday made an impassioned plea for vigorous leadership to relaunch world economic growth, combined with a warning that if the EC could not co-ordinate policy with the Americans it would have to stand up to them. His remarks follow his call on Monday for a spring summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries to co-ordinate macroeconomic policy, and come amid worsening relations with the US after Washington's imposition of anti-dumping duties on European steel, and threat to block EC bids for US public procurement contracts. 'Over the last couple of years there has been a total lack of world leadership: a drop in co-operation between the G7, a drop in co-operation between the (EC) member states,' Mr Delors told a European Socialist conference on jobs and growth. The result was punishing interest rates, mayhem on the currency markets, and no macroeconomic co-ordination. 'The speculators are virtually running things,' he said indignantly. But he denounced the US's unilateral imposition of trade sanctions on the EC. He referred angrily to what he called President Bill Clinton's 'need to preen in front of the mirror to make sure that his muscles are still firm', and said that if Europe allowed itself to be trampled on by Washington's trade policy, 'I dis-avow that Europe'. Mr Delors told the conference that 'classic models of growth are not sufficient to produce jobs', and that 'the Community cannot survive without an industrial policy'. This was not a case of 'backing so-called Euro-champions', he said. In his wide-ranging, unscripted remarks, Mr Delors said the EC should also reappraise whether it could let itself be undercut by competitors with sweat-shop labour conditions. 'We should distinguish. . . between those (countries) which share the fruits of their trade and those which simply exploit their workers.' Behind this remark, senior EC officials are watching with intense interest to see if the Clinton administration insists that Mexico comes to agreements with the US and Canada on environmental standards and working conditions, as part of the North American Free Trade Area treaty.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: EXIT LINES  </P> <P> Comic actor Gene Wilder, back on the big screen in "See No Evil, Hear No Evil"  after a three-year break to help wife Gilda Radner overcome ovarian cancer,  says the struggle has made him appreciate life much more. "Life is very short.  Everyone says, 'I know, I know,' but . . . if they knew, they'd stop doing  what's unimportant and do what is important. There's no time for anything else.  And it's too sad to learn it when it's too late," Wilder says in an interview  in the May 29 issue of US magazine. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

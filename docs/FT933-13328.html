			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Colourful brush with the gods - Alan Davie at the Barbican 'The Quest for the Miraculous' is the subtitle of Alan Davie's retrospective at the Barbican. One could say that, one way or another, we are all Questing Beasts but that, in the nature of things, the artist is more likely to attain the Holy Grail than the rest of us. Of course it all depends on one's understanding of the word 'miraculous'. For me the best definition of it was the late Harold Hobson's phrase 'the authentic frisson', that spontaneous shiver of recognition when one is present and a thrilling moment in a performance or when one sees a picture which is touched with genius. The Surrealists called it 'the marvellous', something rich and strange. For Alan Davie it is a spiritual quality which includes magic and the occult, a brush with the gods maybe. Davie himself wrote that and 'the mysterious element of colour . . . is something utterly magical to me.' The colours in his paintings certainly sing, reminding us that Davie is also an accomplished musician, and the fact that he considers colour to be a mysterious element implies that the making of art is for him a journey whose end is uncertain. The element of discovery and the quest for the miraculous lies for him in the process, the imagery being dredged up from the unconscious along the way. Despite his globe-trotting and his intense interest in other cultures, Davie's sensibility is essentially Scottish, that is to say Northern European. Born in Grangemouth in 1920, he attended the Edinburgh College of Art from 1937-1940. Perhaps it was the intervention of wartime service which prevented him from being a second generation Scottish Colourist. As it was he became aware of Pollock, Motherwell and Rothko well before his contemporaries, marrying their freely-painted Abstract Expressionism to his own Celtic heritage. The paintings of the 1950s show clearly his indebtedness to Pollock's masks and anthromorphic figures and to the configurations of Motherwell's 'elegies to the Spanish Republic'. Signs and symbols of an esoteric kind increasingly appear in his work from the beginning of the 1960s, as he became more interested in oriental religions and primitive cultures. Imagery borrowed from Zen Buddhism, Jain cosmology, Hopi geometrical patterns and Aboriginal bark paintings are all combined with Celtic crosses and Egyptian ankhs in a gloriously rich stew, so skilfully cooked that the different flavours are impossible to isolate. Davie is popularly regarded as an abstract painter, but he is no more an abstract artist than was Miro. All sorts of flora and fauna pop up in his paintings: dogs, snakes, birds and insects, not to mention monsters and what he specifically called 'earth spirit'. Some of the paintings include texts in a variety of languages, some hieroglyphic and cryptogrammatic, often obscure and incantatory. The recent work has become more linear, the forms expressed with a greater clarity, even if their meaning is as shrouded as ever. Davie thinks of the artist as an 'arch-priest', a shaman, which certainly embraces a degree of magic, but I baulk at the Miraculous, the authentic frisson having escaped me (to September 5). ***** In the Concourse Gallery at the Barbican the Printmakers Council, a self-governing body, is holding an exhibition of members' work, some 250 pieces in all, a colourful assortment of pictures, framed and unframed, in a wide range of technique. All paintings, watercolours and mixed media pieces are included to acknowledge that printmakers are more than just that. All works are for sale with prices ranging from Pounds 50 to Pounds 3,000. For me the star of the show was a small hologram by Joyce Peck of the Medusa, a snip at Pounds 120. As the viewer moves his head from side to side the Medusa's snaky locks weave and duck in concert, a spellbinding experience (to July 28). ***** Michael Rothenstein RA, who died on July 6 aged 85, was one of the most inventive printmakers of the second half of the 20th century. After studying at Chelsea and the Central Schools and Art he became a painter in watercolours, only turning to printmaking in 1946. A visit to Stanley Hayter's atelier in Paris opened up new technical possibilities in graphics. Objects of lowly origin - urban detritus, wood offcuts, metal debris, newspaper photographs - were all grist to his mill, transforming and extending the boundaries of printmaking. At his home in Great Bardfield, Essex he worked in lithographs, monotypes, etchings, linocuts, woodcuts, screenprints, and mixed media. He became an ARA in 1977 and a full Academician in 1984. He exhibited and taught widely as a printmaker. His imagery is wide ranging, often topical, but if there is one particular motif with which he has been identified beyond any other for some 40 years, it is that of the Cockerel, which for him encapsulated energy, violence, aggression, beauty and excitement, a suitable metaphor for his work. But Rothenstein never forsook painting, the medium with which he had begun. The present exhibition at Flowers Graphics, 199-205 Richmond Road, E8, shows graphic work from the late 1960s to the present day and paintings made in 1993, as energetic and lively as ever. Ceramic bowls, jugs and platters, decorated with typical Rothenstein beasts and flowers, are available in a limited edition (to August 1). A catalogue raisonne, The Prints of Michael Rothenstein by Tessa Sidey, containing over 500 illustrations, has just been published by the Scolar Press, Pounds 95.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: RED RIBBONS TALISMANS OF DRUG FIGHT  </P> <P> Schools across the country are winding up the fifth annual Red Ribbon Week, a  national public-awareness campaign to promote drug-free choices and healthy  lifestyles. This year's theme is "My Choice, Drug-Free."  </P> <P> The Red Ribbon campaign was launched in 1985, after the killing of federal  agent Enrique Camarena by drug traffickers.  </P> <P> In the Tustin Unified School District, Foothill High School is handing out drug  awareness folders, holding a Wear Red Day and encouraging students to tie red  ribbons to their cars. Tustin High students are attaching bumper stickers and  red ribbons to their cars. In addition, the district has formed a Drug-Free  Advisory Council, a 10-member committee composed of professionals who have an  interest or expertise in combatting substance abuse within the school district.  </P> <P> Check with your local schools and school districts to find out about their  various planned activities. Red Ribbon Week runs Oct. 21-28.  </P> <P> On the Fullerton High School campus this month, yellow ribbons are tied around  trees, teacher podiums and wrists. "We're just trying to make a statement  during this Middle East crisis," said Aarie Loeb, a 16-year-old junior who  started the project.  </P> <P> "All we're trying to say is that we want the soldiers to come home safely,"  Loeb said. "We aren't advocating the situation or protesting it."  </P> <P> Said Loeb's assistant, 17-year-old senior Theresa Bustamonte: "We've received a  lot of support from the community. We're received donations of ribbon and our  administration is behind us all the way. We are also trying to write letters to  the soldiers and send them books."  </P> <P> Both girls are members of the school's student body council, which sponsors the  project.  </P> <P> "I'd like to see the government get out of war altogether and leave the whole  field to private industry." -- Joseph Heller, American author COLLEEN CRUZ  </P></p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Government policy on mergers reaffirmed COMPETITION IN all sectors of the economy is 'the spur to increased efficiency and innovation', Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said yesterday. His speech to the European Policy Forum, a rightwing think tank, was a reaffirmation of the government's commitment to competition as the best weapon against industrial decline. Mr Hamilton was speaking on the day after Mr Heseltine, trade and industry Secretary, apparently signalled a change of policy by waving through British Airways' takeover of Dan-Air in spite of concerns about a reduction in competition. Mr Hamilton denied that the merger policy prevented UK companies from becoming big enough to compete internationally. In general, the more competitors there were in a market the fewer competition concerns there would be. That was not to say, however, that there could not be adequate competition where one company had a very significant share of the market.</p>

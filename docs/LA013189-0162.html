			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> XEROX LOSES $77 MILLION FOR QUARTER, CITES STREAMLINING  </P> <P> Xerox Corp. today said it lost $77 million in the fourth quarter, the result of  a streamlining program in which it will cut 2,000 jobs, trim its typewriter  business and stop selling medical image-making equipment.  </P> <P> Xerox, the copier giant based in Stamford, Conn., said that without the pretax  charge of $275 million, its profit in the quarter would have risen 8%.  </P> <P> The company lost money last year in electronic typewriters; document work  stations; and medical image-making, which uses an unusual copying process  called xeroradiography, according to David Kearns, Xerox's chairman and chief  executive.  </P> <P> "We are not moving as rapidly toward our objectives as we feel we must," Kearns  said in a news conference, explaining the streamlining program.  </P> <P> The losses were partially offset by a good reception for its new 50 Series of  copiers and healthy profits in the financial services business, which accounts  for 30% of Xerox revenue, the company said.  </P> <P> Xerox said its loss in the fourth quarter contrasted with a profit of $155  million, or $1.43 a share, a year earlier. Without the charge, it said, profit  would have been $167 million. Revenue rose 6% to $4.4 billion from $4.15  billion a year earlier.  </P> <P> For all of 1988, Xerox said its earnings fell 33% to $388 million, or $3.50 a  share, from $578 million, or $5.35 a share, a year earlier. Without the  fourth-quarter charge, profit would have risen 9% to $632 million. Revenue rose  9% to $16.4 billion from $15.1 billion.  </P></p>

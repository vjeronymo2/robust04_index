			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / Heated response on Pepper Hill Residents in Pepper Hill, Kent, were outraged yesterday by the announcement of the route for Union Rail's channel tunnel rail link. Committee members on the A2 Rail Action Group, who have campaigned for more than three years for a rail route that would skirt the Pepper Hill estate of 355 homes near Gravesend, were disappointed that Mr John MacGregor had postponed a decision on the precise route the rail link will take through their community. Daphne Bannister, a Pepper Hill resident for eight years, said: 'It makes me sick - all this worry and upset and still we do not know any more than we did before.' Mr MacGregor's announcement that there will be no tunnel running under the electricity switching station near the estate, however, drew hot protests from committee members. Mr Ted Gaish, a committee member said: 'Our position is that the tunnel goes under the switching station or forget about it. The group is ready to fight the route tooth and nail and the residents of Pepper Hill will not stand for this.' By eliminating the possibility of an underground tunnel beneath the switching station, Mr MacGregor left two proposed route options open These are: building a tunnel underneath estate homes, or building a viaduct over nearby fields. Pepper Hill residents want neither of these options, but as there is no decision on the route, they have no case yet for compensation, and blight in the area is severe. Mr Robert Hibbin bought his house in 1992 for Pounds 74,000 and in November it was valued at Pounds 58,000. The surveyor noted that the effect of the channel link had reduced the house's value. Mr Hibbin said: 'We have been blighted on something that we are still not sure is going to happen. But I think we will stay blighted until the rail link is finished and that could be up to 10 years.' Many residents have seen the value of their homes plunging for more than three years. Pat and David Henderson, say the price of their home has fallen from Pounds 95,000 in 1990 to Pounds 65,000 in October. Mr Henderson said: 'When you have worked for 28 years hoping to retire when you are 55-years-old with the property making a bit of money, and you find you can't get a good price for it you find that your dreams of an early retirement have been taken away.' Mrs Henderson said the action group would now call a public meeting of all residents and begin planning negotiations with Mr Jacques Arnold, their local MP. The group has considered legal action against Union Rail, although the cost could be prohibitive. Resident Deana King said: 'We can all see the benefits of the rail link but we are being punished because we are not being compensated or treated fairly.'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 21 KYODO -- Turbulence swept through the  five-month-old administration of Prime Minister Horihiro  Hosokawa Friday [21 January] after the House of Councillors  voted to kill a political reform package on which he has staked  his administration's fate.    The upper chamber rejected the package by 130 votes to 118,  a  margin of 12, after 17 defectors from the seven-party coalition  undermined the coalition's unity.    The package of four bills was designed to completely  overhaul  the mechanism for electing the powerful House of  Representatives, the lower house of Japan's two-chamber Diet, by  introducing a 500-seat mixture of 274 single-seat districts and  proportional representation.    The package is also designed to unify fundraising channels  to  direct all funds into the coffers of political parties, which  would then distribute corporate donations among individual  politicians.    Hosokawa, who rose to power after voters stripped the  Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP) of its 38-year lock on power last July,  has repeatedly said he would place priority on passage of the  package and vowed to "take responsibility" if it failed -- a  euphemism for resigning or disolving the lower house for a snap  general election.    However, Hosokawa told a news conference after the voting  that he "is not thinking" of stepping down as premier or  dissolving the lower house for the election.    "In the 10 days remaining before the end of the current Diet  session I will do my utmost to push the political reform package  through the Diet," the premier said.    He said he would do his best to hammer out a compromise  package by arranging for the Diet to set up a 20-legislator  consultative body, comprising 10 legislators from each chamber.    Yohei Kono, president of the No. 1 opposition LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party], told a separate new conference, however, "The  vote margin is serious enough to forestall thinking by the  coalition of further moves they might take."    Kono pressed Hosokawa to live up to his repeated pledges to  resign, saying, "It is extremely serious that the coalition  could not secure passage even after it substantially extended  the Diet session. He should consider these things."    Kono also suggested that he would consider a suprapartisan  proposal to legislate an alternative bill to impose tough  penalties on legislators who take bribes.    On August 10, Hosokawa told his first news conference after  taking power that he would assume responsibility for failure of  the package to clear the Diet by the end of the current Diet  session, then tentatively set to end December 15.    After the package failed to clear the Diet by the  provisional  deadline, Hosokawa extended the session by 45 days until January  29 and resumed his bid to push the package through the Diet.    The premier ruled out seeking to separately legislate the  bill that would place stricter curbs on acceptance by  politicians of shady political contributions.    Hosokawa said he wants to reconcile differences with the LDP  through a summit with Kono.    He said his readiness to accept the LDP-proposed revision of  the package grew following the failure to pass it, saying, "As  the result of the developments in the Diet, there is greater  room for a compromise with the LDP."    Koken Nosaka, chairman of the Social Democratic Party [of  Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Diet Affairs Committee, told reporters the  SDP leadership would be pressed by coalition partners to account  for the breakdown of the package.    SDP Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a meeting of SDP  executives Thursday he would "take responsibility" as chairman  of the party if the rebellion by some SDP legislators scuttled  the package in Friday's vote.    A total of 17 legislators of the SDP, the biggest force in  the seven-party coalition, voted against the package while two  SDP legislators refrained from attending the voting session.    The dissenting SDP members have long criticized the package  for carrying the possibility of undermining the parliamentary  strength of the SDP, saying that the proposed 274 single-seat  electoral districts would be disadvantageous to SDP legislators.    They have also chided the coalition for refusing to plug  what  they called "loopholes" in the package's anti-graft provisions  designed to bar legislators from accepting bribes or buying  votes.    Yasuo Nishino, one of the 17 SDP rebels, told reporters,  "The  Diet should place priority on legislating provisions to prevent  bribe-taking."    The SDP dissidents outnumbered five LDP dissidents who  crossed party lines to vote for the bills.    Meanwhile, Keiwa Okuda, chairman of the lower chamber's  Steering Committee, said the lower chamber will convene its  plenary session on January 25 to vote on a motion to ask the  upper chamber to agree to establish the 20-member two-chamber  consultative body.    If the two-chamber consultative body fails to work out a  compromise bill, Hosokawa has the choice of disbanding his  cabinet or dissolving the lower chamber for the election.</p>

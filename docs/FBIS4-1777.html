			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Mar (XINHUA) -- After the State  Statistical Bureau [SSB] recently published the statistics on  economic and social development in 1993, many people have asked:  Why does China use increment value indexes in its statistics  instead of total output indexes? In connection with this  question, this reporter today interviewed Qiu Xiaohua, an  economist and SSB spokesman, and asked him to talk about related  matters.    Qiu Xiaohua said: In general, internationally GNP [gross  national product] or GDP [gross domestic product] is used to  measure the index of a country's economic development. China  began to use GNP and GDP as a transitional measure in 1985,  hoping at the same time to preserve the indexes such as total  industrial and agricultural output value, total social output  value, and national income, which it used in the past.  Beginning in 1992, the state abolished the total output value  index in its statistical communique released for foreign  consumption and retained only the GDP and other related indexes.  GDP is the sum of the added value from various departments.    What are the defects of the total output value index which  China used in the past?    Qiu Xiaohua said: Total output value is merely a statistic  of the total production result of a material production  department. As far as the price structure is concerned, total  output value includes newly created value and material  consumption in various links of production, such as the two main  consumptions, energy and raw and semifinished materials  consumption. Because total output value includes material  consumption from the intermediate link, the double computation  factor exists. For example, in the textile industry if  spinning, weaving, printing, and dyeing are done separately by  various industrial enterprises that conduct business accounting  independently, the value of these raw and semifinished materials  are again added to the total output value. This makes it  difficult to truly reflect the national economy's growth. With  the development of various types of social services, it is also  difficult to comprehensively reflect, using only the total  output value indexes of material departments, the economic and  social development of a country or a region.    What is an increment value index?    Qiu Xiaohua pointed out: The increment value index covers  all national economic departments, including the original  material production departments as well as the nonmaterial  production ones. As far as the price structure is concerned, an  increment value index only includes newly created value and  depreciation but excludes energy and raw and semifinished  material consumption in the various production process links.  Thus, it avoids the factor of overlapping computation and more  truly and accurately reflects changes in the national economy.    Qiu Xiaohua pointed out: The replacement of the total output  value index with the increment value index has the following  benefits: First, it will encourage production enterprises to  reduce consumption and save energy and guide all sectors of  society to develop the economy while keeping efficiency in mind;  it will also help overcome the tendencies of one-sidedly going  after total output value and growth rate. Second, it is  conducive to bringing the indexes of various industries in line  with the GDP or GNP, because the sum of their increment values  is equal to the GDP. Third, it will help enterprises upgrade  their equipment and technology, increase their economic  efficiency, and strengthen their competitiveness. Fourth, it  will make it easier to make international economic comparisons.</p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (13): Just right for British palates - Angela Wigglesworth salutes a growing reputation for fine wines A GRAPHIC indication of the meteoric rise over the last decade of New Zealand's reputation for fine wines is that there was no mention of them in Hugh Johnson's encyclopaedic book published in 1966. Not until the 1980s did New Zealand wine begin to have international status: in 1981 exports to the UK totalled 37,890 litres; 10 years later they had jumped to 2.2m litres. For the 11 months to June this year, the figure is 3.3m litres. While domestic wine sales are expected to fall from over 41m litres in 1990-91 to 39m litres in 1991-92 (last year's budget curtailed retail spending and raised wine prices through increased excise duties), exports have grown by 21 per cent in volume and 32 per cent in value over the same period. White wine accounts for 83 per cent of output, red wine (growing at the fastest pace) for 11 per cent, sparkling wine 4 per cent and fortified wine 2 per cent. The UK, which takes 42 per cent of the country's wine exports, is New Zealand's biggest market. 'More people in Britain are becoming aware that New Zealand makes wine that is of high quality and sells it for just under Pounds 5 a bottle,' says Ms Vicky Bishop, UK manager of the New Zealand Wine Guild, a group of export wineries established last year. The range is large for a relatively small country and, at the guild's annual tasting in London this year, visitors were able to try 200 different and many award-winning wines - Sauvignon Blanc, Chardonnay, Chenin Blanc, Riesling, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir  -from 43 of the country's 100 or so wineries. The main wine-producing areas - the most easterly in the world - are in north-west Auckland, the Bay of Plenty, Gisborne, Hawke's Bay and Martinborough, the Canterbury Plains, Nelson, Central Otago. In Marlborough, the Wairau Plains has become one of the 10 great wine-producing regions in the world and the largest in New Zealand. It is hard to believe the first grapes were planted here only in 1973. But wine-growing in other parts of New Zealand goes back 140 years: Mission Vineyards at Hawke's Bay dates from the settlement of French missionaries in 1851. Corbans in Henderson was established in 1902 and Te Mata in 1909. Many winemakers and growers are third and fourth generation descendants of European immigrants who brought the skills of winemaking with them. Montana, for instance, was founded in 1944 by a Dalmatian immigrant Ivan Yukich and now has 850 hectares of vineyards yielding up to 15,000 tonnes of grapes. With a 1,000-tonne winery crushing an estimated 45 per cent of New Zealand's entire grape crop, it is the largest winemaker in the country. The most successful winery, says Bob Campbell in his New Zealand Wine Annual, is Cloudy Bay whose Sauvignon Blanc 'developed cult status almost immediately after the release of the first vintage in 1985 and has remained highly sought after ever since.' Mr Kevin Judd, a wine-maker who was born in England but left when he was nine to live in Australia, told me, over Vivaldi's music in the winery, how the company began: David Hohnen, the Western Australian winemaker, had 'got successful with his reds, wanted to make whites, but wasn't getting the right quality.' In 1984, four New Zealand winemakers dropped in to see him, produced a bottle of their Sauvignon Blanc which so impressed him that within a year Mr Hohnen was in New Zealand having a look round. 'In 1985 he offered me the job of winemaker,' says Mr Judd, 'and we set up Cloudy Bay.' Today around 90 per cent of its wine is exported round the world where it is pre-sold before delivery. Another success story comes from the three Nobilo brothers, the second generation to run their family winery, Nobilo Vintners, which is nearly 50 years old. Last year they signed a NZDollars 3m contract to supply 1.5m quarter bottles of their Poverty Bay Chardonnay to British Airways. The deal boosted New Zealand wine exports by 6 per cent and made BA the first airline to serve non-European wine on its European flights, according to Mr Peter Russell, BA's public affairs manager. New Zealand's only methode champenoise specialist is Mr Daniel Le Brun, a 12th generation champagne maker from Epernay in France, who came to Marlborough in 1979, bought 35 acres and opened the winery six years later. 'He came looking for a hillside and found this,' his wife, Adele, who comes from Cumbria and is the winery's marketing manager, says. 'This' was, indeed, a hillside and Mr Le Brun dug deep into it to create the only underground cellar in New Zealand to provide him with a naturally cool environment for maturing the wine. 'Everyone thought he was completely round the twist,' Adele says, 'but it's worked.' Many vineyards have introduced Visitors' Tours and Trails (one company runs a 'de luxe scenic wine trail with white water rafting' two-day package) and there are at least 10 local wine and food festivals. The largest is in Marlborough, sponsored by Air New Zealand, which also offers a wide selection of New Zealand wine on its aircraft, changing the wine list quarterly to bring innovative local winemakers to the fore. Their festival, held every February on Montana's Brancott Estate and now in its ninth year, is so popular that a hectare of grapes has just been pulled up to make more room for its 14,000 visitors. 'You can sample a glass of the best Sauvignon Blanc in the world, while relaxing on a hay bale enjoying the musical entertainment in the sunshine,' says Mr Mike Blair, the festival's enthusiastic co-ordinator, adding that a pink and blue toilet built specially for the Queen's recent visit to the area but never used, was now the festival's information centre. Avery, the Bristol shippers, wine merchants and agents for Nobilo, was one of the first to bring New Zealand wine to the UK. 'We are always looking for wine that tastes as if it was Pounds 7 a bottle but costs Pounds 5,' says Mr David Pinchard, marketing manager. 'What makes New Zealand wine so special? It has to do with the climate (warm sunshine, light summer rains and a long autumn ripening period) which seems to produce these very dramatic Sauvignons that don't taste like anything else in the world.' The way they make some of the wine is unusual, too, he says. They pick grapes on South Island, truck them up overnight to Auckland and arrive at the wineries with the fruit pressed down and frost on it. 'It's a vision of wine making that is different from anything that exists in Europe. 'All of us in the business,' he adds, 'are terribly keen for the New Zealand wine industry to work. The wines are so good they're forcing the French to re-evaluate theirs.' The New Zealand Wine Guild will be taking part in a regional wine tasting in Bristol (September), the Sunday Times/Decanter show (October), the BBC Good Food Cooking and Kitchen Show (November) and a consumer tasting in London on December 8 at the Commonwealth Institute.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Chung faces his toughest ordeal: John Burton assesses the election funding indictment of Hyundai's founder MR CHUNG Ju-yung, the founder of South Korea's Hyundai business group, may have to revise the title of his autobiography, Ordeals But No Failures. His recent foray into politics, a source of further ordeals for the 77-year-old industrialist, now threatens failure. It has been a disastrous time for Mr Chung. He performed unexpectedly poorly in the presidential election in December, finishing a distant third after a lavish and expensive campaign. He was then subject to a highly publicised and humiliating investigation for alleged election violations that concluded with an indictment at the weekend. If Mr Chung is convicted of illegally receiving more than Dollars 60m (Pounds 39.7m) in secret election funds from his shipbuilding subsidiary, he could be stripped of his seat in the National Assembly and forced to withdraw from politics. Moreover, the United People's party (UPP), the opposition group he formed a year ago, is already weakened by internal dissension after his failed presidential bid. His departure as party leader could cause the UPP to split or disintegrate. Prosecutors say they have a strong case against Mr Chung, but the indictment is still regarded as a government vendetta. Korean politics is notoriously corrupt, with politicians often receiving secret corporate donations. Mr Chung claims the money came from the sale of shareholdings in Hyundai Heavy Industries, the shipbuilding unit. Mr Chung greatly irritated the government when he launched his political career last year. Officials, accustomed to giving orders to the nation's large conglomerates or chaebol, did not like to see their authority challenged. They also suspected that Mr Chung was trying to win political power to prevent the government from reducing the chaebol's economic clout, although the Hyundai founder argued that he was campaigning for economic deregulation and promised to break up the chaebol as part of this programme. In addition, Mr Chung posed a political threat to the ruling Democratic Liberal party by attracting conservative middle-class voters away from it and possibly denying the presidential election to its candidate, Mr Kim Young-sam. This threat was blunted after the government revealed not long before the election that it was investigating whether Hyundai was illegally diverting funds to Mr Chung. Mr Kim won the election by a comfortable margin. The prosecution of Mr Chung, if successful, would serve as a warning to other chaebol not to get involved in politics. It could also prove politically beneficial to the DLP since it may attract some of the UPP's 34 mainly conservative parliamentary members if Mr Chung's party collapses. The switching of party affiliation is a common practice in Korean politics. Defecting UPP members would increase the ruling party's slim parliamentary majority of 163 seats in the 299-member chamber, while leaving the Democratic party as the only main opposition group. The UPP is already showing signs of splintering. Mr Chung's autocratic style has been blamed by some party executives for the UPP's defeat. Several prominent members, including Mr Kim Dong-gil, a popular academic who helped establish the UPP, have threatened to leave unless Mr Chung steps down as party chairman. If Mr Chung is forced to retire, he may no longer be willing to fund the UPP, depriving the party of its main financial support. He has already failed to fulfil a promise to give another Won200bn (Pounds 170m) to the party this year. It is unlikely that the government will also try to punish Hyundai if it manages to destroy the UPP with the indictment against Mr Chung. Hyundai was the subject of tax penalties and credit squeezes last year in a government attempt to intimidate Mr Chung to withdraw from the presidential election. However, the government is trying to revive the flagging economy and reprisals against Hyundai would harm that effort. Hyundai is Korea's largest business group and its biggest motor vehicle maker, shipbuilder and construction company.</p>

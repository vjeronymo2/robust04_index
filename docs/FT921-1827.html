			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour tax plans 'compete with EC' THE STATISTICAL battle over rival tax regimes rests on complex and highly contentious foundations. Comparisons of international tax systems, and even of the British fiscal regime at different points in history, involve assumptions about individual and family circumstances. The UK tax system looks simple when compared with the complicated structure of tax and social-security contributions in France and Germany. Moreover, internationally comparable and up-to-date figures on incomes earned or taxes paid are hard to find. The chart alongside is based on statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and FT calculations about the effects of Labour's shadow Budget. The figures in the lower chart are based on the marginal tax and social security liabilities of a single person in France, Germany and the UK. Labour's plan to increase marginal tax rates for high income earners would still leave most single British tax-payers facing lower marginal tax rates than in either Germany or France. However, under the Conservatives, the top rate tax-payers will face substantially lower marginal tax rates than in Britain's main European competitors. These comparisons ignore the complications introduced by married couple and child tax allowances. The combination of these allowances would reduce the marginal tax rate faced by families in France and Germany compared to those shown here. Marginal tax rates, the amount of tax paid on each additional slice of income earned, are usually plotted against money income. A better way to make international comparisons of the tax burden is to show the marginal tax rate facing each income decile from the poorest 10 per cent to the highest 10 per cent. The top 50 per cent of single French tax-payers all currently face a higher marginal tax rate than would confront upper income earners under Labour's plans. Only the top 20 per cent of British tax-payers would face a higher marginal rate than the same group in Germany under Labour's plans. Labour's tax plans, the Tories argue, will heap a heavy proportion of the tax burden on middle and upper income tax payers. Nearly all of the top 50 per cent of wage earners will face a higher marginal rate than at present. Yet most single French and German upper income earners, and almost all lower income earners in these countries, face higher marginal tax rates than would be the case under either a Labour or a Conservative government. The remaining charts provide a historical perspective on the current debate. The UK, compared to France and Germany, has been relatively lightly taxed throughout the 1980s. The total UK tax burden as a percentage of GDP was 40 per cent in 1990, marginally higher than in 1980 - the Tories' first full year in office. For much of the 1980s the personal income tax burden was more evenly shared in the UK than elsewhere in Europe. In 1987, the richest 10 per cent of UK households paid 43.4 per cent of total direct taxation comparted to 53 per cent in Germany and 60 per cent in France. It is clear from all these calculations that they do not support simple political claims from either side. That is unlikely to prevent the politicians using them in a debate which will probably remain at the centre of the election campaign</p>

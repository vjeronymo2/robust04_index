			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Adams poised for his first meeting with Irish premier Sinn Fein may be poised to take another big step towards recognition as a fully legitimate democratic party with a meeting between Mr Gerry Adams and Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister, within two weeks, Dublin officials indicated last night. Word of the meeting - which would be the first between a Provisional Sinn Fein leader and an Irish premier - came as Mr Adams extended his list of demands by calling in Dublin for the withdrawal of British troops from nationalist areas. There were also hopes last night that the outlawed Irish National Liberation Army was on the brink of announcing a ceasefire. Meanwhile in Washington, senior members of the US Congress warned that no extra money was likely to be available this year to help smooth the way to peace in Ulster. But Irish foreign minister Dick Spring said after meeting President Bill Clinton in the holiday resort of Martha's Vineyard that he hoped 'substantial' sums would be forthcoming.

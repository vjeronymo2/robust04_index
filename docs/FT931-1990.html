			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sharpe &amp; Fisher ahead to Pounds 1.5m SHARPE &amp; Fisher, the building supplies and property group, returned profits of Pounds 1.45m pre-tax for 1992, a sharp improvement on the previous year's restated Pounds 452,000. The shares responded with a 12p rise to 95p. Tight control on costs together with a reduction in bad debts enabled the building supplies division to swing from losses of Pounds 139,000 to profits of Pounds 1.22m. However, the contribution from property fell from Pounds 2.15m to Pounds 1.49m - comparable figures here were been restated to conform with FRS 3. Overall turnover edged ahead from Pounds 43.8m to Pounds 45.3m. An unchanged final dividend of 2.5p holds the total at 4p from earnings more than doubled at 7.8p (3.5p). Year-end borrowings were reduced from Pounds 7m to Pounds 6.5m.</p>

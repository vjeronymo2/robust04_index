			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / In search of the drinkers' thinker: Christian Tyler follows a trail of bottles from Yorkshire to Languedoc as he tries to unravel the mystery of the extraordinary Doctor Rabelais Alcofribas Nasier: even his anagrammatical nom de plume has the smell of drink about it. But there was a time, and there are still some places, where Francois Rabelais was better known for thinking than for drinking. As the sober-suited director of the Montpellier public library, Gilles Gudin de Vallerin, said: 'The word 'rabelaisian' just does not suit him.' The 500th anniversary of the birth of the author of Gargantua and Pantagruel is being celebrated all over France - mischievously, because it is the second such celebration in a decade. But French wine-growers, tourist officers, politicians, visiting bibbers and buyers care little for the latest scholarly consensus which says Rabelais was born in 1484, not 1494. Their attitude is, as Rabelais might have said: 'You open the books; we'll open the bottles.' The pilgrim's path to the real Doctor Rabelais is littered with bottles. This pilgrim's journey was launched during a convivial winter evening, from a stone farmhouse at the top of a Yorkshire dale. Hanging on the wall was an engraving of an equivalent stone farmhouse, La Deviniere, ('the soothsayer') near Chinon in Touraine, the reputed place of Rabelais' birth. La Deviniere stands on the upper slope of a wide and open valley, overlooking fields of sunflowers and melons. The farmhouse bedroom is reached by an outside stair under its own grey slate roof. In the corner is a four-poster bed, hung in jute and linen drugget. Around the panelled walls are illustrations by artists over the centuries of the five books of Gargantua and Pantagruel; there is a piano score by Erik Satie and an original Matisse sketch. But the putative birthplace of Rabelais is overwhelmed - undermined, one should say - by the magnificent rustic cellars below the house where wine presses and other agricultural impedimenta have been set out in honour of the secular saint of the vine. On their way out visitors are offered the chance to buy a magnum of the local red. The label says 'Gargantua'. A kilometre or so down the road sits the abbey of Seuilly where Rabelais and his brothers may have been sent to school by their father, a Chinon notary (or apothecary, or inn-keeper). It is also the place where, in the first book, Friar John first appears defending the abbey close against the forces of the King of Lerne. The abbey is closed now, and used as a conference centre. But today someone had been busy: in the garden behind lay an immense quill pen, 17 metres long, made of plywood, its white paint drying in the sun. It was plainly the plume of Gargantua. As his birthplace shows, Francois Rabelais was not a gentleman. But he was certainly a scholar. Enrolled as a monk into the Franciscan order he transferred to the more benign, modern regime of the Benedictines of Maillezais where he set himself to learn Greek, then considered a shocking, pagan language. In early middle age, after a tour of the universities and a spell in Paris learning to despise the medieval orthodoxy of the Sorbonne, he threw off his monk's habit and descended on Montpellier in 1530 to enrol in the famous medical school. It was one of the few places in Europe licensed to practise the new art of anatomical dissection, or equipped to deal with the repulsive consequences (as the present anatomical museum reminds us) of the new plague: syphilis. Here in Montpellier the modern pilgrim was able to catch up with him, thanks to a hazy organisation called Les Rencontres de Dionysos, the creation of a whirling dervish of an Irish literary tippler, Dr Redmond O'Hanlon, of University College, Dublin. By means of a cunning combination of brain-work with gullet-work. O'Hanlon had tempted a clutch of Rabelais specialists from France, England and the US to a seminar called Rabelais et Dionysos; vin, carnaval, ivresse at the Paul Valery university. The days were to be devoted to academic debate, the nights to slaking the throat in the company of a succession of grateful but bemused wine-growers in the surrounding hills of the Languedoc. Evidence of Dr Rabelais' own reputation for extraordinary scholarship came quickly to hand. Outside Montpellier, stands the beautiful Chateau de Flaugergues owned by the viticulturist Count Henri de Colbert. Among the 16th and 17th century vellum-bound books in his library is a two-volume history of Montpellier by a family ancestor, Charles Degrefeuille, published in 1739. It contains the story of Rabelais' encounter with a certain chancellor Duprat who was attacking the medical school's privileges. According to legend, Rabelais opened his petition by addressing the chancellor's secretary in Latin. When the secretary called a Latin interpreter, Rabelais spoke to him in Greek. A Greek-speaker was summoned. The doctor switched to Hebrew. A professor of Hebrew was unearthed and Rabelais addressed him in Arabic. Finally, with a speech in Syriac - a form of Aramaic used by some eastern churches - the doctor clinched the contest. On hearing the story the chancellor was charmed and the privileges restored. For this feat, Rabelais' portrait was placed in the hall of the school and his doctor's robes thenceforward placed round the shoulders of each graduate. Rabelais took his medical degree within months of arriving in Montpellier and went to practise at the Hotel Dieu hospital in Lyons, then the intellectual capital of France. There he fathered a son, Theodule, and a book Pantagruel. It was the beginning of his gross, great satire against medieval, monkish scholasticism and hymn to the intellectual and sensual liberation of Renaissance Man. 'Beuvez tousjours, ne mourrez jamais.' Was Rabelais drunk when he wrote? Modern scholars say there is no evidence for it. Was he a boozer? If so, he could hardly have held the post of doctor at Lyons or, later, as secretary on important ambassadorial missions to Rome. But anyway, what constituted a boozer in 16th century France? Rabelais' prose, scholarly and vulgar, defined French as Chaucer's had defined English, and poured out just at the moment when the printing press was spreading. His heirs include Sterne and the modern French writer Georges Perec - but above all James Joyce (though some find Joyce's wordplay anaemic by comparison). 'People who love Rabelais with all their heart read him as if he'd written the day before yesterday,' said Jean-Paul Sartre. The English novelist John Cowper Powys called him the sanest of all great writers - and perhaps the only sane one. Over the years, Rabelais' work has been mined by marxists, deconstructionists and other ideologues and mystics. Today, according to Dr Richard Cooper of Oxford, there is no real controversy left. His fellow participants in the Rabelais revels agreed that beneath the punning, insults and obscenity, the doctor has a humanist message to convey - which is partly why his books were condemned and censored. That does not mean, however, that the academic playground has been entirely stripped of rides. Prof Francois Rigolot of Princeton University kicked off with a happy hour's discourse on rhetoric and ambiguity, taking as his text Friar John's pun in Book I: service divin, service du vin. Marie-Madeleine Fragonard, a professor from Montpellier, talked about obscenity in the Renaissance. She explained how con might be traced back to the Greek kuon (dog) and reappear in the German konig, and how the syllables 'cu' and 'ul' had ancient symbolic meanings, as shown by the names of mythological heroes such as Mercury, Hercules and Bacchus. Dr Carol Clark analysed the infant education of the giant Gargantua. What was meant by the episode in which the ladies of Grand-gousier's court squabble over the baby's enormous, inquisitive member? It was, she suggested, from their eloquent banter that the infant was learning the rhetorical style of a Renaissance prince. Once he was transferred to the instruction of men Gargantua grew into a silent, hesitant adult. For flights of Rabelaisian fancy there was none to match the gaunt and passionate figure of Claude Gaignebet, an anthropologist from Nice. Black-haired, grey-bearded and wild-eyed, with a battered volume of the masterwork under his arm, Gaignebet is the last survivor of that school which regards the five books as arcana, as riddles to be unpicked. His device is to manipulate the calendar to expose the keys and clues to what he says is the doctor's real persona, that of latter-day evangelist who reveals the true history of the Christian religion. Gaignebet, with his immense knowledge and exotic views, sometimes amuses, sometimes charms - and often frightens - more orthodox experts. Whatever Rabelais' true purpose, it is plain that he has been swallowed and regurgitated by the voracious characters he created. It is his own fault. Commercial lobbies shamelessly invoke the name of Rabelais (there are discos and cafes named after him) yet it is the character of Gargantua that they are celebrating. When Jacques Blanc, president of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, stood before the wine-growers of the Mediterranean in Narbonne and declared that wine does not lead to alcoholism, merely to an ivresse of the heart and the passions, he was talking in truly Rabelaisian fashion. But the scene before him was gargantuan: 500 diners, already gorged on oysters and sparkling wine, facing fresh fistfuls of cutlery, with seven glasses apiece waiting to be filled, roaring their approval while teams of vignerons paraded on stage in their medieval gowns to receive trophies in the shape of Silenus, the goatish mythical father of Bacchus. A few miles away stands the most eloquent memorial of all to the spirit of Rabelais the devout, divine libertarian. Valmagne is a well-preserved gothic abbey church of 1257, as high as the cathedral of Notre-Dame from which Gargantua stole the bells. The monastery was confiscated from the Cistercians at the time of the French Revolution and passed into private hands. Apart from a statue of the Madonna holding a headless child and a cross made of twisted vine root, the church has been stripped of devotional trappings. In each bay that formerly housed a side-altar, stands a 40,000-litre wine barrel. There are 18 of these oak tuns in all for storing the output of the vineyard. The empty church is cool but airy, the perfect temperature. Service divin has become service du vin. Rabelais, lawyer, doctor and writer died as a parish priest in Paris in 1553. He prescribed only one rule for his utopian (and co-educational) monastery, the 9,332-room Abbey of Theleme which Gargantua built for the heroic Friar John. It was: Do What Thou Wilt. His instruction has been faithfully followed in this second-time-around anniversary year. But who is to complain? Only, perhaps, those who are tired of hearing the words 'rabelaisian' and 'gargantuan'. For there is another adjective, one by which Rabelais better deserves to be remembered. It denotes wisdom, generosity, curiosity, spontaneity, hospitality and humanity. The word is pantagrueliste.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: US media boss predicts recovery A RECOVERY in earnings in the second half of 1992 was forecast yesterday by Mr Daniel Burke, president and chief executive of Capital Cities/ABC, the US television and newspapers group. Mr Burke, speaking at the annual shareholders's meeting in New York, said the second-half results would benefit from an improvement in local and national advertising demand in the broadcasting division. The company's shares reacted with a rise of dollars 7 3/4 to dollars 448. 'We cannot make predictions beyond that for the balance of the year, although we expect the company's expense growth to be modest,' Mr Burke explained. The media group's 1991 net income declined by 28.1 per cent to dollars 343.5m, on revenues of dollars 5.4bn. In the first quarter of 1992 net profits at Capital Cities/ABC plunged by 45 per cent, to dollars 58.6m, on unchanged revenues of dollars 1.26bn. Mr Burke promised that ABC would remain 'a player of consequence' in the global television market, having established partnerships in seven international media-based ventures to date. In the US, ABC Television ended the 1991-92 prime time season in last place, just behind NBC. 'While I live for the day I can report to you that the network ranked first or second, I would rather that it made a respectable profit,' Mr Burke told shareholders. He noted that the broadcasting division had earned dollars 669.7m of operating profit last year. Mr Burke said while Capital Cities was considering acquisitions, it might be 'entering a period where internally developed businesses make more sense for us'. He cited several internally generated ventures such as new magazine and fashion shows that have cost the company dollars 42m pre-tax in start-up expenses.</p>

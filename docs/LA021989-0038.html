			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON VIEW: BACHELORS HAVE A BALL WITH 'TRANSYLVANIA NIGHTMARE'  </P> <P> The Bachelors Ball in the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton was,  well, sort of unbelievable, and that may have been why, almost without  exception, post-ball chat was rating it a 10 -- one of the best Bachelors balls  in years.  </P> <P> This was the 84th anniversary fancy dress affair. Members of the prominent  organization of young men host the annual party, they say, to pay back social  obligations incurred during the year.  </P> <P> This party sizzled, even with the theme "A Nightmare in Transylvania," which  led arriving guests through an eerie tunnel, through a graveyard where  prominent bachelor John Welborne found his name on at least four tombstones.  "It's some sort of in-joke," Welborne, costumed as the devil, said. "Only I am  not the devil; I am a devil." He had hosted his four tables -- 32 guests, $220  a couple -- at a pre-cocktail party at Trader Vic's. The entourage included  Spike and Debby Booth, wearing authentic Japanese robes.  </P> <P> It was the sort of night that found Elvis with Priscilla (Martin Spencer and  Tracy Sanders), Laurel with Hardy (Randy Carroll and Susan Dick), the Prince of  Wales with Princess Diana (Pat McKoskey and his fiancee, Kathy Lee), King Tut  with Cleopatra (Steve Hobbs and Lori Parrish), a conquistador with a Spanish  dancer (Grafton Tanquary III -- his father was a Bachelor -- with Robin Wood).  </P> <P> Pamela and Robert Kidney came as Mr. and Mrs. Mac the Knife. Lisa Dennis and  Bachelors treasurer William Bessolo were Indians. Stephanie and Mark Reuter  were handsome space police -- or were they cats? Lyn Vandegrift wore a Chinese  costume and a snake mask, escorted by Gordon Pashigan. But when Vern Monroe  walked through the cocktail party carrying a huge python, there was near  pandemonium as guests all but fell over one another to avoid contact.  </P> <P> The "Dangerous Liaisons" costumes were abundant. Laura Perkins was one,  flirting with "Napoleon" David Brittain, a new Bachelors board member. John  Thompson and Tracy Verna were drum majors, Adam Bianchi a gangster and Penny  Bianchi a flapper (Missy Wilkins was a flapper too), joining Nancy Davis,  Donald Spitz, Jerry Zorthian, in elegant regalia, at Peter Adams' table.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, partygoers fussed with their costumes. Bachelors president Walter  Wilson found his Dracula face peeling as he stood at the receiving line,  awaiting his date Dr. Patricia McKeever (on professional duty as an intern at  County-USC Medical Center) to glue him back together. Not only is Wilson a  Bachelor, but his late father, Philip Wilson Jr., was one and so were two of  his brothers, Philip III and Joseph.  </P> <P> Some of those costumes must be uncomfortable. A mock television set on the  shoulders of one guest prevented communication, though the picture was clear.  But even with a horse costume on his head, Dan Palmer "jumped" the entire night  with his date, Ashley Bren, in hunter togs. On the other hand, there was a  comfy table of laid-back Brooklyn Dodgers, handing out baseball cards, another  table of more intense '20s golfers (Mark Hennessey and Julie Dalton and Paul  and Mopy Locker), handing out tees.  </P> <P> Most authentic, perhaps, was the Air Force jacket, hat and wings worn by  Richard Hadfield (escorting Gabrielle Gottlieb), which was worn by his late  uncle who was killed in a training air crash at Bakersfield during World War  II.  </P> <P> Arriving at their tables, guests found rock 'n' rolling bats with red eyes  gyrating on the ceiling above them. Programs at the tables were cutout mummies  lying on cotton balls inside paper coffins. They became collectors' items,  disappearing from tables about 1 a.m.  </P> <P> That was all after dinner was served at a leisurely 10:45 p.m., and after the  men at Bachelors Hugh Evans' (with Jeanne Crowley) and Chris Liebes' tables of  camouflaged jungle fighters slid down the railings to the dance floor in high  spirits as Bob Gail's orchestra struck up "She's a Honky Tonk Woman," a  favorite Bachelors' song.  </P> <P> And, it was after Arthur McClure was complimented that he looked "most  bucolic," sitting at the Bachelors' Patroness table with Bonnie McClure, Penne  and Bill Durst, Margaret and John Given, Judy and Steven Jones, Jo and Bob  Kroger (whose son Jim flew down from San Francisco for the party).  </P> <P> And it was also after Briant Howes' table of sailors, including Henry  Williamson and Robin Ferrante, whirled to "Celebration," after the juggler  juggled grapefruit, after a duck popped out of a silver tray.  </P> <P> By then, Santa Claus was dancing with the Easter bunny, and Bachelors vice  president Chip Stuart, ball chairman, and his co-chair Casey Griffin were  dousing the dripping candles.  </P> <P> It's the sort of party that sends the young crowd to the airport. Carllyn  Haldeman, daughter of Sue and Tom Haldeman, flew in from New York to be Richard  Mogan's date. New Yorker Joan Cavalero flew in to join Neil McCathy. And Leslie  Graham, moving here from New York, came feather-boaed with Madison Offenhauser,  sitting at Scott Albrecht's table.  </P> <P> Funniest line of the night, we hear, came from the men's room: Two gangsters  were reportedly washing their hands. One well-heeled gangster says to the  other, "Nice suit. C&amp;R?"  </P> <P> ROMANCE: Eugenia Erskine of San Francisco (she's the daughter of Paul and  Georgianna Erskine of Pasadena) and her fiance, Don Jesberg of the Bay area,  have been widely feted in the Southland with prenuptial parties.  </P> <P> Sally Lewis and her daughter, Carey MacNiff, gave a luncheon with violet  nosegays at each place. Joan and Jim Caillouette, Roberta and Sandy Huntley and  Elizabeth and Steve Algermissen invited guests to bring a bottle of wine for  the young couple at their dinner. Now, Sandy and Maria Mallace, Patty and Roger  Burschinger, Jane Simpson and Jakie and Ted Engs join to host a Mexican fiesta  before the wedding here April 1.  </P> <P> RECEPTION: Happy that the Grammy Awards will be in Los Angeles on Wednesday,  Mayor Tom Bradley and the Los Angeles Host Committee, headed by Sheldon I.  Ausman, host a welcoming celebration for the National Academy of Recording Arts  and Sciences and the 1989 Grammy nominees on Monday evening at the Gene Autry  Western Heritage Museum. NARAS will honor Gene Autry with the President's Merit  Award.  </P> <P> KUDOS: To Bruce Meyer, honored by the Beverly Hills CPR with its "From the  Heart Award" at a '50s party at Ed Debevic's in Beverly Hills. . . .  </P> <P> To Carl Terzian, a founder nearly 30 years ago of California Lutheran  University, Thousand Oaks, saluted for nine years as a regent. . . .  </P> <P> To Jeanne and Bob Morrissey, who hosted the California Wine Patrons gourmet  dinner at the Four Oaks restaurant.  </P> <P> RED LETTER DATES: British Consul General Donald and Elizabeth Ballantyne will  be at the forefront of the second of three foreign motion picture screenings by  American Film Institute Associates next Sunday. Skouras Pictures hosts a supper  after the L.A. premiere of "High Hopes."  </P> <P> Earlier, in a tie-in with consular groups in Los Angeles and an effort by AFI  to increase membership in its International Film Society, the consul general of  Denmark presided at the supper hosted by Ava and Chuck Fries, Didi and Fernando  Gelbard and Sybil and Jim Goldrich after the showing of "Pelle the Conqueror."  </P> <P> Consul General Ma Yuzhen of the People's Republic of China is in the spotlight  March 19 for the screening of "Woman Demon Human."  </P></p>

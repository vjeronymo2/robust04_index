			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping; place and </F> date not given: "Mr. Scharping, What Would You Change As  Chancellor?"]    [Text] [BILD] Mr. Scharping, has your life changed since  you have become candidate for chancellor of the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]?    [Scharping] I have hardly any leisure time any more. But I  like the new challenge. I think that people notice that.    [BILD] Many people would like you to shave off your  beard....    [Scharping] I know as many who want me to keep it. When I  was in my last year of high school, I once shaved it off, but I  did not like it.    [BILD] Seriously, what would Chancellor Scharping change  immediately?    [Scharping] Germany must concentrate all its efforts on  employment, the fight against joblessness, the future, and a  decent life for everybody -- which requires the creation of new  jobs.    We need a national employment pact. The enterprises must  increase their investments, and the SPD will promote that.    Work must be organized in a more intelligent way.  Corresponding collective agreements have been concluded. I  hope that this will also be possible in the metal working  industry.    We do not want strikes. The employers should offer the  employees a settlement. One thing should not be forgotten:  Paying for work is more useful than financing unemployment.    [BILD] What else?    [Scharping] First, families with children should receive 250  German marks [DM] for every child, and the high allowances for  high-income earners should be abolished.    Second, the reconstruction of eastern Germany should be  financed in a balanced way. The employees are now carrying the  major burden. This must be organized in a different and fairer  way.    In fact, many officials in Bonn no longer know what it means  for an employee to make ends meet at DM2,000 net per month.  However, if somebody can pay DM2,000 in taxes, he can also pay  DM2,200 without a reduction of his living standard.    Third, bureaucracy must be reduced. Thus, building permits  should no longer be required for houses containing up to six  apartments. Compulsory notification should be sufficient.    Fourth, environmental protection offers enormous  opportunities -- for exports as well as new jobs.    [BILD] Would you increase the price of gasoline?    [Scharping] No, I do not see any possibility of further  increasing the gasoline tax. The burden of taxes and fees is  already too high for the broader population.    We will relieve earned incomes. Something is wrong when  gross incomes of DM3,000 are reduced to DM2,000 net or less.    Messrs. Kohl and Waigel have increased the gasoline tax by  over 40 pfennig per liter since 1990. Those who take such  measures must help the commuters. The gentlemen in Bonn have  forgotten that.    [BILD] How will you finance the reforms?    [Scharping] We need a fairer equalization of burdens. Thus,  taxes on income that is not earned through employment should be  clearly higher than on earned income.    In Germany the population possesses financial assets worth  DM3,500 billion. There are people who receive several thousand  DM in interest every month.    I strongly advocate the principle of achievement. Yet  depositing one's money in Luxembourg is no great achievement.  Thus, income that is not earned through employment should be  burdened to a greater extent in the future.    In fact, we will not increase taxes but reorganize them.  Work should be relieved, and the burden on consumption of raw  materials, the environment, and energy should be increased.    [BILD] How do you want to reduce the high state debt?    [Scharping] We have a debt of DM1.9 trillion. In his term  of office, Theo Waigel has incurred higher debts than all the  finance ministers before him put together.    The main task of an SPD-led government in the first year  would be: To Reduce state expenditure to the absolute minimum  and use it in a more purposeful way. I will reject all demands  for additional expenditures or tax increases. I am as hard as a  rock in this respect.    Moreover, the state must prove that it is able to save  before  it can ask the citizens for higher contributions.</p>

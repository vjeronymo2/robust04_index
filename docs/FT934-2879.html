			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Threat to 400 jobs in defence research A further 400 jobs are likely to be cut at the government-owned Defence Research Agency in addition to the loss of 2,000 jobs announced just over a year ago, David White writes. The agency said it was disbanding its engineering services branch as a separate unit because of a rapid drop in demand from business clients. This meant that 470 jobs were 'likely to become surplus'. However, the agency said some of these jobs would have been lost anyway under the 1992 cuts. The agency, formed in 1991 from four defence research establishments, employs about 10,500 people. The engineering cuts affect eight sites, with the biggest reduction involving 114 jobs at Pyestock, Hampshire. Plans for market testing in the engineering unit and possibly moving it to the private sector will be abandoned. Final recommendations on the reductions will be put to ministers in January after consultations with staff and unions.</p>

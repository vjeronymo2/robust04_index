			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / People: New role for Green at Argos Mike Smith, the cerebral chief executive of the Argos catalogue store chain, is relinquishing his role as chief executive of the company's main trading subsidiary to concentrate his efforts on group affairs. Trevor Green, 48, who is currently the main board director responsible for business development, will become managing director of Argos Distributors, as from November 1, with responsibility for day-to-day running of the business. Green (left) has worked at Argos for more than a decade, during which time the company has been demerged from BAT Industries and successfully established itself as one of the UK's best-managed independent retail groups. It is likely that Smith will now spend more time helping to develop Argos's newly launched furniture chain, Chesterman, on which the company is pinning great hopes. ***** When you want to sell British foods to the French - employ a Frenchman. That, at least, is the philosophy of Food from Britain, the organisation set up to help redress the UK's startling trade deficit in foods by aggressively promoting British goods abroad. FFB has just recruited Dominique Mine (above) to head its office in what is the UK's biggest food and drink export market, worth more than Pounds 1bn last year. French consumers are clearly developing a healthy appetite for muffins and whiskys as their imports of such products have risen 13 per cent in the first seven months of this year. Mine, 35, was previously general manager of the European Duty Free division of Remy-Cointreau group. He will now devote himself to helping British exporters find new market opportunities and providing general promotional help to UK-based producers.</p>

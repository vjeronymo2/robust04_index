			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / July truck sales show 6.7% rise TRUCK SALES in July were 6.7 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago, the first monthly year-on-year increase in 34 months. Commercial vehicle sales fell by 21 per cent, however, after only a brief respite in June when the sector succeeded in reversing 32 consecutive months of decline. According to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, new commercial vehicle registrations fell to 7,887 in July from 9,964 a year before, largely because of a 36 per cent fall in medium vans. Registrations of light vans - mainly those derived from cars - fell 9.8 per cent to 2,760. Commercial vehicle sales were 9.6 per cent lower in the first seven months at 122,161. Sales have fallen 47.5 per cent in the past three years. Truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes) were 1,473 in July compared with 1,380 a year before. Truck sales in the first seven months of the year, at 16,536, were still 8.8 per cent lower than a year earlier. Sales have fallen 59.5 per cent in the past three years. Sales of heavy trucks have declined less this year than other market segments with a fall of only 2.8 per cent.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  UK COMMERCIAL VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS                           JANUARY-JULY 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume     Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Jul 92   Jan-Jul 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Total Market*                 110,394     -9.6       100.0        100.0 Imports                        38,023     -9.3        34.4         34.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Small vans (up to 1.8 tonnes) Total                          35,267     -9.6       100.0        100.0 Imports                         6,962     +2.3        19.7         17.4 Ford                           15,190    -15.3        43.1         45.9 Vauxhall (General Motors)      11,820    +13.8        33.5         26.6 Rover (British Aerospace)       2,726    -38.7         7.7         11.4 Peugeot incl.

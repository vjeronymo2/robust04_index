			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Italgas moves ahead to L91bn ITALGAS, the fast-growing Italian gas and water distribution company, raised net group profits by 16.7 per cent to L91bn (Dollars 73.6m) last year thanks partly to a 25 per cent increase in sales to L3,353bn. The improvement has prompted the group, which is controlled by the state-owned ENI energy and chemicals concern, to raise the dividend by L10 a share to L100. Italgas attributed the rise in turnover to an increase in its number of customers, higher average gas usage and the effect of a cold winter. Net group interest charges fell by 24 per cent to L51bn from L67bn in 1990 thanks to improved liquidity management and lower-cost sources of finance. Investment, largely financed by low-cost loans from the European Investment Bank, rose by 8.2 per cent to L683bn. Italgas affirmed its commitment to growth, notably outside Italy. Nordica Sportsystem, the acquisitive sports equipment group controlled by the Benetton family, raised consolidated sales by 67 per cent to L465bn last year.</p>

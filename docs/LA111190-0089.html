			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THREE DAYS WITH JOYCE BY GISELE FREUND (PERSEA BOOKS: $11.95)  </P> <P> These exceptional photographs were taken in Paris in 1938 and 1939, near the  end of Joyce's life.  </P> <P> Two extraordinary series of images, one of the author revisiting Sylvia Beach  and Adrienne Monnier at the celebrated Shakespeare and Company bookstore, the  other with his beloved grandson at the home of his son, Giorgio, on the rue  Scheffer, seem to summarize the writer's life. Despite his popular image as a  distracted, untidy man, Joyce appears elegant, even dandified in silk bow ties,  patterned socks and rings. But he also looks frail, weary and otherworldly: The  later pictures clearly show a man approaching death. Gisele Freund's studies  form a revealing portrait of this elusive genius.

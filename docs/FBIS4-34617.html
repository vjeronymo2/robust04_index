			<p>BFN     [Text] Integration Deputy Minister Ruben Fadlala has said:  "Paraguay is in the most sensitive and difficult situation  within Mercosur [Common Market of the South], because it must  adapt itself to play a significant role in the regional market."  Fadlala attended the most recent Mercosur meeting--held in  Buenos Aires, Argentina--with his colleagues of the other  signatory countries.    Fadlala said this was a very difficult meeting because of  the  various aspects, the short time available, and the deadlines  that are about to expire.    He said: "We have outlined our position and want it  considered in order to achieve what we are looking for, that is,  an expanded market with coordination and harmony in various  subjects."    He added that this will turn Mercosur into an expanded  market--rather than a free-trade zone--in which we can implement  at least an initial common market.    As for the products over which there are tariff  disagreements, Fadlala said not all points have been raised in  connection with the products on which it is not possible to  adopt a single tariff. "This will be done at the last technical  meeting of subgroup 10, scheduled for the end of the month. The  matter will be later addressed at the political level, when  deputy ministers will choose the exceptions," he said. The  deputy ministers' meeting might be held early in July.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hard times for Japan's two biggest watchmakers Japan's watchmaking industry is still in the grip of hard times, according to the latest interim results from Seiko and Citizen Watch, the two leading producers. Both companies suffered from the erosion of the yen value of their export income, because of the strength of the Japanese currency and the price sensitivity of their high-volume products. They provide an example of how exporters of low-margin products have found it hard to adjust to the yen's rise. The two groups have tried to diversify by making small computers, but have met fierce competition in the sector. The result was a loss for Seiko and a sharp decline in profits for Citizen at the parent company level for the six months to September. Seiko yesterday passed its interim dividend after reporting a reduced interim loss of nearly Y1.02bn (USDollars 10.4m), on sales down 10.8 per cent at Y108.7bn. The economic outlook is so uncertain that Seiko was unable to make a forecast for the full year. It warned, however, that it was under pressure in the current half from the yen's volatility and a slow recovery in personal spending. Seiko announced late last year that it would reduce costs substantially by ending production of personal computers for overseas markets, a factor in its reduced interim loss. Citizen fared slightly better, with a 61 per cent decline in recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - to Y2.4bn, on sales down by 22.5 per cent to Y96.2bn. It will pay a maintained interim dividend of Y4.5 per share, but forecasts that full year current profits will fall by 43 per cent to Y6bn. Sales of watches, which account for more than half of Citizens' turnover, fell by 11.2 per cent. Like Seiko, the strength of the Japanese currency eroded the yen value of its export sales, which account for just over 70 per cent of total turnover. However, Citizen's computer products did even worse than its core watchmaking business, with sales down 46 per cent. The company also suffered from the cancellation of an order to make notebook computers for computer producers to sell under their own names.  -------------------------------------------------------------------                INTERIM RESULTS TO SEPTEMBER 1994 (YBN)  -------------------------------------------------------------------                          Sales          Recurring         Net                                            profit*     profit  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Citizen Watch  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994                      96.2             2.455       1.632 1993                     124.2             6.290       4.243 Est for year             205.0             6.000       3.300  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Seiko  ------------------------------------------------------------------- 1994                     108.7            -1.018      -1.010 1993                     121.8            -3.208      -3.200 Est for year             219.0                 -           -  ------------------------------------------------------------------- * before extraordinary items and tax  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: company reports  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

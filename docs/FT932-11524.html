			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Cash shortage proves too tough for Midlands leather company: An end to recession may be a poisoned chalice for small and medium-sized companies. Charles Batchelor assesses their chances WITHIN a few hours of the liquidator arriving at Ms Jennifer Bond's* Leicestershire leather-processing business last Wednesday a Pounds 65,000 order arrived. The order, for the tanning and dyeing of about 50,000 feet of leather, would have kept the factory busy for more than a month. But chronic underfunding had already brought about the demise of the five-year-old business, and on May 11 a meeting of creditors is expected to put it into voluntary liquidation. Ms Bond said: 'The recession has passed but we can't finance the orders we are getting.' Ironically the company's fate was sealed by its efforts to expand the business. It increased turnover from Pounds 300,000 in 1991 to Pounds 500,000 last year by switching from the cheaper leathers and varied colours used in women's shoes to better-quality leather for men's shoes, most of which are dyed black. The improvement in business increased the company's need for working capital and put further pressure on its already overstretched finances. 'We were very successful in opening up new markets but we didn't have the money to go on,' said Ms Bond. 'We couldn't afford to buy in the chemicals or the other raw materials.' The problem of how to finance growth will be one confronting many businesses if the economy continues to strengthen. Managements must become adept at juggling their finances to avoid a cash shortage. They have to get customers to make payments early, suppliers to extend their payment terms and the bank manager to maintain, and where possible, to increase the financial facility. Ms Bond's company had barely established itself when the recession began to bite and it lost money in 1991 and last year. She fell out with the bank which had funded the business in its early stages and switched to one of the big four clearers, which agreed to refinance the business provided it factored its invoices. Ms Bond has nothing but praise for the bank but says that she had problems with its factoring arm. The financial squeeze tightened but after an accountant's review, paid for by the bank, the bank manager agreed to put in more money provided the shareholders also injected more capital. While these agreements were negotiated the company could not order hides from its overseas suppliers. For a while it was dependent on processing other people's leather, a less profitable activity. The company was unable to return to profit and finally Ms Bond decided to call in the liquidator. 'They were underfinanced almost from the beginning,' said Mr John Talbot, insolvency manager at the Leicester office of accountants Ernst &amp; Young, which is handling the liquidation. 'The bank facility they had was used to buy plant and machinery instead of being used for working capital. They have picked up some orders but because they were underfunded they could not buy the materials to work the leather.' There are so few assets in the business that the bank waived its right to appoint a receiver and has agreed to the shareholders' request to put the company straight into liquidation. If the creditors approve on May 11, the liquidator will sell off the plant and equipment, the remains of the lease on the factory and any other assets he can find. Ms Bond, in spite of her disappointment at the loss of the business and concern at the personal liability she may still face when the business is liquidated, is relieved that it is all over. 'I feel better,' she said, after her first meeting with the liquidator. 'It has been two years of 'ifs and buts'.' *The name has been changed.</p>

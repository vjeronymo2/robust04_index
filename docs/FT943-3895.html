			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: East/west factor key to German economy Sir, It is reassuring to read that the FT has become more upbeat on Germany's economic prospects ('German facelift', September 9). Nonetheless, your notion of growth through exports may need a qualification. While it is true that west German exports were indeed up nicely in the first half of 1994, imports had grown even faster. Net exports made no contribution at all to the west German recovery this year. Instead, the only significant forces lifting west German real gross domestic product above its end-1993 level have been housing construction and stock-building. Had housing construction remained flat in the first quarter, GDP in the period would have fallen by 0.2 per cent instead of rising 0.5 per cent; had companies not piled up inventories in the second quarter, real GDP would have gone down 0.1 per cent instead of surging 1 per cent. Housing construction and stock-building are transitory. Apart from unusually good weather, the house-building frenzy is fuelled by the expiry of a tax break at the end of this year; companies will not want to pile up inventories for ever. These two forces of growth should thus moderate a lot in 1995. There is one little understood aspect of west German exports and growth. For the national accounts statistics, west German exports include trade with east Germany. In the early 1990s, west Germany enjoyed a big growth push when, after German monetary union at a ludicrous conversion rate, west German suppliers wiped east German producers off the east German market. In coming years, this process will be reversed. The heavily subsidised investments in east Germany are finally paying off. The new east German producers have started to (re-) gain the home market and establish a foothold in the west. West German net exports to east Germany could start to fall soon. While the surge in such exports provided a strong second wind to the west German upswing in the early 1990s, their imminent fall should ensure that the west German upswing will be more modest than one may have expected by just looking at earlier upswings. Although private consumption should soon recover from its 1 per cent slump in the second quarter and machinery investment should edge up nicely, there is thus no risk that the upswing may get close to overheating territory any time in the foreseeable future. A modest non-inflationary upswing, which helps to do away with the big public sector deficit, should be the best possible news for markets and the Bundesbank.

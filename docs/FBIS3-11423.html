			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elder Gomez on interview with Armando Calderon </F> Sol, presidential candidate for the Nationalist Republican  Alliance, from El Presidente Hotel in San Salvador on 21 March  -- recorded]    [Text] [Gomez] A few minutes ago Armando Calderon Sol,  candidate for the Nationalist Republican Alliance, ARENA, held a  news conference in which he did not rule out the possibility of  participating in a runoff election. Calderon Sol did not  dismiss the possibility either of negotiating with the  opposition regarding the suspension of the runoff elections,  which would be held on 24 April.    [Begin recording] [Calderon] We have seen this done in other  countries. It is no secret. We hope that the opposition will  have second thoughts about this. We think a situation of this  sort would be more beneficial for the country. There would be  less polarization. We could say this would allow us to overcome  electoral problems. As I told you we are proud to have three  hundred and some thousand more -- almost (?350,000) more votes  -- than our closest contender.    [Gomez] What do you think could have influenced the fact  that  your party was not elected in the primary elections.    [Calderon] On the contrary. I think it was a victory for the  party. The election results give us a marvelous victory.  ARENA's triumph is total and absolute. I think we have been  favored by the majority vote and by the vote of the Salvadoran  people. I would say that it has been a premium vote by the  people who trust in their leaders, a premium vote for a good  government which fulfilled a good government program with a good  electoral campaign. Proof of this is that we are transforming El  Salvador and we have begun modernizing El Salvador. Proof of  this is the fact that those who had never participated are  participating. We are building a new El Salvador. [end  recording]    [Gomez] The Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced this  afternoon the possibility of holding runoff elections 24 April,  because none of the nine political parties that participated in  the 20 March elections obtained 50 percent plus one of the votes  cast on Sunday. Calderon Sol said that if a runoff election is  scheduled, ARENA will speak with all the political and social  forces of the country which have always accompanied him. He  complained about the problems in the voting process and  attributed them to the bureaucracy imposed on the voters by the  TSE.</p>

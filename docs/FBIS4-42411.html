			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Recovery Not Enough To Allay </F> Deficit, Employment"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 25 -- Italy's public sector  borrowing requirement could climb to 156 trillion lire (98.11  billion dollars) in 1994, less than some pessimistic forecasts  because of lower interest rates, and on to 160 trillion (more  than 100 billion dollars) next year if no further corrections  are applied to public finances.    The nation's GDP should grow by 1.3 percent in the current  year and by two percent in 1995 but employment will shrink  further in 1994, by one percent, according to ISCO [National  Institute for the Study of the Economic Situation], the short  and medium-term economic studies institute which urged Italy to  better exploit present and coming opportunities associated with  recovery.    An ISCO report on the economic trend issued today said under  consideration were forecasts based on no changes in economic  policy. What surfaces, said the document, "is a picture in which  not all opportunities, which do exist, are fully utilized.  Economic growth would not acquire, therefore, the pace  necessary to activate an additional commitment of productive  factors, despite the presence of the improved financing  capabilities of enterprise."    The institute said the rate of inflation can be expected to  come down further but that Italy's low will still be above the  rates in the other European Union nations and that the public  debt can be reduced only in terms of the percentage of GNP.    The recent past, said ISCO, has shown the recovery signals  are being consolidated as a result of reductions applied to the  Bank of Italy's key discount rate, meaning a lower cost of  money, and the generalized improvement of the world economy.  However, the outlook for all of 1994 and '95 confirms that  growth this year "does not appear to reach the consistency  needed to revive investments and employment in a satisfactory  way," the report added.    Following is a table of ISCO forecasts covering the major  economic indicators with the percentages shown in real terms,  that is, net of price variations:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |1994                     |1995                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |gross domestic product   |+ 1.3                    |+ 2.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |imports                  |+ 3.5                    |+ 5.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |exports                  |+ 7.0                    |+ 7.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |domestic demand          |+ 0.3                    |+ 1.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |household consumption    |0.0                      |+ 1.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |total consumption        |+ 0.2                    |+ 0.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |gross fixed investments  |- 0.7                    |+ 2.5                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      Inflation is expected to continue downwards, slowly, to 3.9  percent by the end of the year and to 3.5 percent in 1995.    Despite the "very modest dynamics" on the cost-of-labor  front, the employment picture will not brighten, said ISCO which  reported that the cost of labor per unit of production should  increase by about one percent this year and by 2.5 percent in  1995.</p>

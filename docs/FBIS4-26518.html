			<p>BFN     [Text] The State Ministry of Communications and the  provincial government held an on-the-spot meeting on the  Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone, which was developed by the  Chinese Merchants Steamship and Navigation Company and the Bank  of China, in Zhangzhou on 14 June to study the issue of  accelerating the construction of the zone. The meeting  stressed: Governments at all levels and various departments  must further understand the great significance of accelerating  the construction of the zone from the height of realizing the  reunification of the motherland, must make concerted efforts to  do a good job of port construction, and must actively create the  optimal conditions for the opening of the three exchanges.    Communications Minister Huang Zhendong and Provincial Party  Secretary Jia Qinglin listened to the reports submitted by the  leaders of Zhangzhou City and the Zhangzhou Economic Development  Zone and made important speeches.    Since the Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone, which  earmarks  an area of 18 square km for development, has been under  construction since the beginning of last year, great progress  has been made in the various fields of work, thus attracting the  attention of people at home and abroad.    When discussing the need to fully understand the  significance  of accelerating the zone's construction, Huang Zendong stressed:  Fujian will be the first to bear the brunt of opening direct air  and shipping services between the two sides of the strait.  Efforts should be made to speed up port construction to  facilitate the commencement of shipping services. It is  imperative to accelerate the construction of the Zhangzhou  Economic Development Zone.    Jia Qinglin fully affirmed the achievements already made by  Zhangzhou Economic Development Zone. He pointed out: The zone  has been set up in Fujian, Zhangzhou, Longhai, and Gangwei, and  these areas will be the first to benefit. We should support the  zone's construction with concrete action. He stressed: Not  only will the construction of the zone spur Zhangzhou's economic  development but it will also play a mutually complementary role  in the development of the Xiamen Special Economic Zone. More  importantly, we should focus on the development of exchanges  between the two sides of the strait and serve and submit to the  overall situation of peaceful reunification and the concept of  one country, two systems. We should approach the great  significance of the construction of the development zone in this  sense.    The meeting studied the issues of port construction, land  acquisition, deep-water facilities and the corresponding support  roads on land, funds, a 35,000-tonne-class multipurpose wharf,  the zone's preferential policy after the introduction of  taxation system reform, and the zone's gateway to the outside  world. The participants achieved unity in understanding and  adopted a resolution.</p>

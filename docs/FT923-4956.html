			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (2): On track to speed up network - Action to save EC's combined transport plans from stagnating EUROPEAN transport ministers will next month be urged to agree urgent financial backing for a proposed new Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.7bn) strategy to save the Community's combined transport plans from stagnating. The proposals will for the first time also seek to include intra-Community maritime container movements for special treatment under combined transport regulations. The 10-year support plan for dedicated track, terminals, rolling stock and unit load devices is being put forward at a time when combined transport activity is slowing down and road congestion escalating. But in spite of the urgency of the situation, some countries, notably the UK, are doing little to encourage the development of combined transport systems. Combined transport traffic growth in Europe in 1991 has slipped from 20 per cent annually to 5 per cent. A T Kearney, the management consultants whose report for the European Commission in 1987 predicted combined transport traffic would triple by 2005, has now extended the time scale by five years. Rudy Colle, director-general of the International Union of Combined Road-Rail Transport Companies (UIRR), explained that the decline in 1991 volumes resulted from a drop in national traffic caused by increased competition from road hauliers. The UIRR's 12 member companies were set up by the railways with hauliers as shareholders so as to dispel hauliers' fears over the railways' conflicts of interest. But many other hauliers and distribution contractors are not committing themselves fully to the system. They fear the railway companies cannot provide a reliable service. Transport Commissioner Karel van Miert will tell the Transport Council ministers that the economic and social gains of the Commission's plan far outweigh the costs. Commission officials calculate that a Community-wide combined transport rail network will cost Ecu1.4bn over 10 years. Terminals and equipment will cost Ecu600m. It is hoped that up to two-thirds of the cost will be funded by the operators and the remainder by national governments and the Commission. Ministers will be told combined transport operators cannot themselves finance the investment required for the rail and terminal network. The margins that they are forced to operate on to remain competitive with hauliers are too slender to afford the heavy investment. This is due to deep price-cutting in the liberalised road transport market and the difference in hidden costs between road and rail, where road hauliers get their infrastructure free and escape the costs of the environmental damage they cause. Mr Van Miert will argue that for combined transport to be effective, it is essential to develop a community-wide network and not rely, as at present, on isolated lines. The plan will concentrate on the most productive lines first. These are in Germany, Italy and France. Eventually the network will stretch from Scotland and Ireland, to the Iberian Peninsula and across to Greece and the borders of eastern Europe. To encourage new private operators, the ministers will be asked to agree to pilot projects aimed at establishing ground rules on how small road hauliers get access to terminals and the conditions for market entry. The projects will involve inland waterway and short-sea container operations. The Competition Directorate, DG IV, will also be involved because of a possible need to draft a derogation from competition rules. The special nature of combined transport entails operators of different modes to enter agreements with each other that could be interpreted as being against the Treaty of Rome's competition rules. But there is still widespread scepticism over the railway's commercial role in combined transport. A new intermodal company, Allied-Continental Intermodal (ACI) is being launched in the UK today by Intercontainer, the European Railways' intermodal company, SNCF and Railfreight Distribution (RfD) to compete directly with the newly-formed UIRR associate, Combined Transport Ltd (CTL). This is causing concern in the UK industry. ACI is owned by the railways whereas CTL is 36 per cent owned by private hauliers and forwarders. But a spokesman at RfD insisted that CTL has nothing to fear and will receive service quality equal to that given to the new company. To encourage combined transport the Commission has agreed derogations which allow governments to give discounts on vehicle excise duties and permit gross lorry weights of 44 tonnes for vehicles in combined transport. The Belgian, German, French and Italian governments allow one or both of the derogations. The UK government allows neither, preferring to stick with its 38-tonne gross lorry weight limit until 1999. The 32.52 tonnes restriction on drawbar sets will be raised to 35 tonnes next year. Because this makes British operations less competitive than those on the European mainland, UK firms are reluctant to invest in combined transport equipment. The UK has fewer than 2,000 swap bodies, the most popular intermodal system, compared to more than 100,000 on the mainland. The Rail Users Group, the Freight Transport Association and the Road Haulage Association continue to urge the government to adopt a more helpful attitude. UK-based Grand Transport Systems, a leading European supplier of intermodal equipment for combined transport, makes little effort to market its products in the UK because of delays and uncertainty over the provision of combined transport infrastructures on the British side of the Tunnel. RfD managing director Ian Brown says he now has government approval to spend Pounds 50m to increase the clearance height to European loading gauge standards of tunnels and bridges on the Channel Tunnel routes. It will allow his new fleet of medium deck height wagons to carry 9ft high containers.</p>

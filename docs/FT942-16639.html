			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Survey of Switzerland (9): Ban it and bore on - John Braun reports on plans for new Alpine tunnels The inscrutable Swiss startled their neighbours again last month by voting for a total ban on transit lorry traffic through the Alps to take effect in 2004. Initial reactions abroad varied from disbelief to anger that the Swiss were apparently putting up more fences to keep out the neighbours. Since then, Swiss leaders have been at pains to emphasise that isolation is not their goal. They want very much to be good neighbours, but they also want their neighbours to be considerate of Swiss concerns. One of the main concerns these days is trying to curb the pollution caused in the narrow Alpine valleys by transiting German, Italian and other European lorries. Switzerland's proposed solution to this problem is not just to ban these lorries. Rather it is proposing a bold expansion of the national rail system and a rejigging of transit charges to encourage all shippers to choose the rails rather than the road for moving their goods through the Alps. At the heart of this plan is the AlpTransit Project or NEAT (Neue Alpen-Transversale) approved by Swiss voters in a referendum in September, 1992. It calls for the construction of two new high speed north-south rail lines through the country connecting Basle and Milan. Officially, the cost of the project is set at SFr14bn, but few deny that it will be much greater, perhaps double that amount, which would make it about three times as expensive as the Channel Tunnel project. The main elements of AlpTransit would be two new so-called base rail tunnels through the Alps, with base reflecting the idea of keeping the tunnels at low altitude so that trains can pass through them at speeds up to 200km per hour. One line would be drilled under the Gotthard pass, the most highly travelled transit route today. The other would go through the Lotschberg south of Bern and continue on the existing rail tunnel under the Simplon pass. Planners say it should be possible to knock two hours off the journey time between Basle and Milan, making the railway a much more competitive form of transit even without the lorry ban. AlpTransit will be a huge civil engineering operation. The project will, among other things, involve drilling one of the world's longest twin-tunnel, single-track developments - the 57km Gotthard base tunnel - comparable in length with Eurotunnel. Tunnelling will take place at depths of more than 2km under the higher mountains, incurring such difficult technical problems as extremely high rock pressures and stresses - with attendant high working temperatures. Test borings began last year, but serious exploration work is only due to start this year following selection of contractors from an international tender process that began last autumn. In addition to the Gotthard and Lotschberg tunnels, the project includes substantial upgrading to the Simplon tunnel rail line and improvements to the Rhone valley rail line to connect with the French high speed rail network at Geneva. Connections from eastern Switzerland will also be upgraded. A new line is planned for the Lake of Zurich area (Waedenswil/Au and Thalwil). This will run in a tunnel under the Hirzel and Zimmerberg to Zug. The management of the projects is in the hands of the two leading Swiss railway companies, Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) on the Gotthard line, and the Berne-Lotschberg-Simplon Railway (BLS) on the Lotschberg-Simplon line. Early this month they formally requested federal government approval of their route proposals, together with some variants that would add cost but reduce disturbance in sensitive areas. In the time honoured Swiss way, a long process of consultation will now commence, so that the final decisions on routes are only likely to be taken around the end of 1995. Then tenders will be issued for the main design and construction contracts. The actual work is expected to begin in 1996 with completion scheduled for 2007. Although the Swiss have undertaken to open bidding to foreign companies, there is little doubt that Swiss companies will dominate both the project management and the work itself. In part, this is protectionism but it also reflects the immense Swiss experience in drilling tunnels through the hard rock of the Alps, dating back to the 1870s when the first rail tunnel was pierced through the Gotthard. However, the sheer scale of the project means that the Swiss engineering and construction industry alone will have nothing like enough equipment or manpower to carry out the work. They will need to take on a lot of foreign sub-contractors. It is generally agreed that Italian and French companies are best placed to win contracts as they have long experience of working in Switzerland and with Swiss companies. British and other foreign companies that have less experience of working in the country are being advised that the most promising way of approaching the project is to join consortia led by Swiss companies. Unfortunately, even if the AlpTransit project is completed on time, it will not come on stream until after the lorry ban is in force. Swiss officials say there is plenty of capacity at the moment, and minor improvements being made in the existing Lotschberg and Gotthard tunnels should ensure that no bottlenecks develop. But that may underestimate how quickly and extensively Switzerland and Europe as a whole embrace the concept of environmentally friendly rail transport in the next decade. On the same day that the Swiss voted for a transit lorry ban, they also voted to impose taxes on all lorries based on the distance they travel. If the government exploits the opportunity provided by this measure, the railway could soon become the more economical means of transport as well as the more environmentally friendly one.</p>

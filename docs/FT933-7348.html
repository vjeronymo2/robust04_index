			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Books: Enemy of the Yahoos - Gary Mead likens CH Sisson to Jonathan Swift IS THERE A CHURCH OF ENGLAND? by C H Sisson Carcanet Press Pounds 25, 308 pages 'What comes back is that every choice is wrong, No action finished as it was conceived, The body withered while the hope was strong; No itch it suffered ever was relieved.' (from C H Sisson's The Pattern, 1993, published by Enitharmon Press, Pounds 3.50). SOME writers gain their glory from a single work, bursting into the firmament like new suns. Others are like distant constellations; it takes time to discern their complexities. We are often blinded by the glare of the immediate. Out of the glare, Charles Hubert Sisson has for five decades crafted a body of writing which, without public commotion, is impressive in both range and quality. The objects of his attention, the rational voice which underpins his satirical, ironic style, establish him as a true and faithful heir to the 18th century of Jonathan Swift and Samuel Johnson. Now, in his 80th year, Carcanet has published Sisson's latest collection of 41 essays, spanning the last 40 years, under the rhetorical title Is There A Church Of England? What Sisson really means is, is there a Church of England worthy of the name? Not really, it seems: 'Not the truth of what is said, as it seems to the speaker, but its acceptability to the largest possible audience, has been the concern of many of those most prominent in the Church . . . There used to be eternal truth; now, in the mouths of these mis-leaders, there is only the contemporary.' The syntax, the firmness of view and the certainty of belief are pure 18th century - as is the essay's firm conviction that reason is the only guide. When viewed as a whole, Sisson's work takes on the form of a cathedral which has, over time, accumulated a chapel here, a gargoyle there, all of which bring out the architectural immanence of the whole structure. His two novels are acclaimed minor masterpieces. An Asiatic Romance, published in 1953 but now out of print, is a wonderfully comic tale whose ancestor is Samuel Johnson's Rasselas. Christopher Homm (1965), is a relentlessly bleak dissection of a man, with a chronology that skilfully moves backwards, long before Martin Amis tried the trick in his considerably more well-known Time's Arrow. But whether as translator, novelist, poet, literary critic or political essayist, Sisson's central preoccupations - with religious belief and the Yahoo-like nature of humanity - are ubiquitous. The temptation to draw parallels with Swift are irresistible. Just as Swift uneasily combined his relatively eminent role in the Establishment of his day with a frequently expressed resentment at the whimsical nature of political power, so too has Sisson experienced the vicissitudes of fortune at the heart of British political life. He ultimately took early retirement (in 1972) from the civil service, where he had achieved the senior rank of under-secretary in the department of employment. His successful career came to a fairly abrupt halt, following disagreements with more senior functionaries. But Sisson pooh-poohs the idea that somehow he missed out by not being a full-time 'professional' poet or writer, that his having to commute every day to his London office to support himself and his family may have interfered with his creative writing. 'The idea that a poet is given an Arts Council grant to spend a year or so just writing is rather odd. I am sure that that is the worst thing that can happen. For me, poetry doesn't 'take time' in that sense. It just happens.' Sisson's work is steeped in a cocktail of a form of Tory political thinking which is now all but extinguished by Thatcherism; a high Church of England theology; and a jaundiced view of humanity. His poem 'The London Zoo', first published in 1961, is redolent of TS Eliot's The Wasteland. It's a bitter commentary on the suburban commuters whose lot he shared each day on his way to his bureaucrat's niche in Whitehall: 'Mr Axeter's office is designed theologically;/ Upstairs there is one greater than he;/ Downstairs there are several he must keep in submission/ Who profess they are doing what should be done.' Yet Sisson does not exempt himself from castigation: 'And who am I, you may ask, thus to belly-ache/ At my betters? I tell you, I am one of the same lot,/ - Without lobster and limousine, but, like the rest,/ Expending my best energies on the second-best.' No doubt the latest collection of essays will be dismissed as antediluvian, anachronistic, out-of-touch with the current world. The paradox is that Sisson would not disagree with such judgments, since to fall into line with unreflecting fashion is precisely what his work portrays as a grave human error. He is a man who, now tucked away with his wife in a remote Somerset village, has never possessed that great dispenser of fashion, a television set. 'This business over the transporting of Bosnian children to this country is ludicrous. A person with a television camera can sway the whole world, which is absurd. Mr (John) Major, who is not known for his humaneness, then falls into line. If all your attention is forced into following events elsewhere, then you can easily forget that you have neighbours closer at home. You end up ignoring things at hand. The notion that a committee of international diplomats can decide what some poor chap with a gun will do is nonsense.' That is a voice remarkably out of kilter with received wisdom. What gives that voice authority is the intellectual strength that runs throughout his writing. Marked out by the Whitehall establishment as being sufficiently disaffected not to have deserved the customary honour due his rank, his literary achievements were recognised in unusual fashion in June this year. He was made a Companion of Honour, a gesture which would have tickled Swift's sense of the absurd quirkiness of fortune. Age has not withered Sisson; his impulsion to write seems as strong as ever. It matters deeply to him that humanity not be swept into the maelstrom of transient tragedies, here today but superseded tomorrow. His core preoccupation in political, theological or poetic contexts, is the destruction wrought on humanity by the massification of culture, spurring on the splintering of society into disconnected shards. The constellations most worth exploring, suggests his writing, are those within ourselves and our consciences.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Lloyd's to chase frozen deposit Lloyd's of London last night threatened legal proceedings against the Alliance &amp; Leicester building society if it did not agree to release funds held on behalf of a member of the insurance market. The Alliance &amp; Leicester confirmed that its Isle of Man office had frozen an account belonging to a Lloyd's Name. It said it had received 'notice' from a firm of solicitors that the funds, which acted as a deposit at Lloyd's, 'are subject of a fraud'. Lossmaking Names hailed the case as a victory in their battle to prevent Lloyd's seizing money held on their behalf to settle debts at the insurance market. It is believed to be the first time a UK financial institution has agreed to freeze a Name's funds in this way. But Lloyd's insisted that the allegations on which the Alliance &amp; Leicester appeared to have acted 'are similar to those raised in a previous court action against Lloyd's which, on Lloyd's application, were struck out'. A group formed to protect the interests of the wealthiest Lloyd's Names met for the first time yesterday. The High Premium Group, which has 285 members, is a response to reforms introducing new forms of corporate capital.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Labour leadership contest fails to fill the house BILL CLINTON and Al Gore may be playing to a full house of Democrats in New York this week but in the UK the party faithful are unlikely to be standing in the aisles when Mr John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett are elected as leader and deputy leader of the Labour party. Guest celebrities are also likely to be thin on the ground this Saturday. Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU engineering and electrical union - the third biggest union affiliated to the Labour party - will be attending a family wedding. His union's cheerleading contingent will be reduced from the customary 70-plus to a mere six delegates for the meeting of the electoral college in the giant Royal Horticultural Hall in London. The GMB general union is sending 22 delegates instead of its usual 80 and the National Union of Mineworkers is sending one delegate. He is not even an executive member. The unions, which account for 40 per cent of the electoral college, will be heavily outnumbered by the 650 delegates from the constituency parties which have 30 per cent of the vote, and the 270 Labour MPs, who also have 30 per cent. The latter have to attend in person for their votes to count. For a party that has been accused of relying too much on glitz and trade unions, a sharp reduction in both might be counted a blessing. But most union leaders will still be there and the Labour press office has been wondering how it can avoid those television shots of trade union barons dropping their votes into the ballot box. There will be no windy speeches from trade union bosses. Indeed there will be scarcely any speeches at all. Mr John Evans, the Labour chairman, will make some introductory remarks. After the votes are counted the victors will say a few words. For the leftwing NUM executive this lack of opportunity for traditional labour movement rhetoric was described as an 'insult' and accounts for the lack of a delegation. Rightwing unions are also irritated by the unnecessary cost of the day. Mr Jordan said there was overwhelming support for Mr Smith and no need for a contest at all. Mr Paul Gallagher, leader of the electricians sections of the AEEU, said the voting could have been done by post. 'It will prove an extremely expensive ballot box and the money could have been better used for other things,' he said. On one thing almost everyone seems to be agreed - it will never happen again like this. Profile of John Smith, Page 24</p>

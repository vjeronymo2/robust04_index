			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ulundi Jan 26 SAPA -- Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP]  President Mangosuthu Buthelezi says he is not optimistic  Thursday's talks between the government, the African National  Congress [ANC] and the Freedom Alliance will lead to an  inclusive constitutional settlement. In a statement issued on  Wednesday Mr Buthelezi said: "I am not overly optimistic after  the experience of the kind of games that the ANC, in tandem with  the government and the National Party, has been playing with us  in these so-called negotiations."    However, "We must of course leave no stone unturned in our  search for a consitutional settlement and we will have to make  this last attempt on Thursday".    Regarding the IFP's participation in the general election,  Mr  Buthelezi asked: "Why should the ANC want us in the election if  we really are their true opposition and if we are the only party  which could stop them taking control of the legislature in this  region?"    "We will have to face the facts now that we have to go to  the  conference to tell delegates about the failure of negotiations  and face the conference with the need to finally put to bed the  issue of whether or not we enter elections," he said.    "I say this constitution is fatally flawed and that there is  no future for kwazulu and for self-determination for the people  of this region or any other region in it".    Mr Buthelezi warned of civil war and said: "We will never  have peace, stability and prosperity if we repeat the failure of  Russia and East Europe to recognise that centrist constitutions  imposed over a plural society, in which there are competing  demands for self-determination, can only give rise to  disruption, violence and finally civil war".    The IFP is seeking a federal constitution with a division of  power between the central and state governments. The IFP has  also opposed the proposed deadlock-breaking mechanism which  "inter alia enable a constitutional assembly to completely  rewrite the constitution with only a 50 percent plus on  majority".    The IFP is also demanding two votes per person in the  election.</p>

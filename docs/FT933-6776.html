			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Inflation figures boost German rate cut hopes: Shares surge in Frankfurt FRESH SIGNS that inflation in western Germany could be turning down emerged yesterday, further fuelling speculation that German interest rates will be cut today. Share prices surged in Frankfurt after news that annual inflation in three of western Germany's largest states had edged lower. The mood in stock markets was also helped by suggestions that the German automotive industry is showing signs of recovery, and a new overnight record on Wall Street, which made further gains late yesterday. Frankfurt's blue chip DAX index closed more than 20 points higher at 1,917.78. The state figures indicate that inflation could finally be coming down after being stuck at around 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent for most of this year. A provisional annualised inflation rate for the whole of western Germany, based on the state-by-state figures, is expected before the end of the week. Market analysts suggest that a flattening of price rises could bring the rate down to 4.1 per cent in August from 4.3 per cent in July. Inflation has been widely forecast to slide after the summer break, possibly dipping as low as 3.5 per cent by the end of the year, before rising again early next year. Some market analysts said the signs pointed to a cut in the key discount rate at the Bundesbank's policymaking meeting today. Earlier this week, economists at Germany's leading 12 banks said they, too, expected a rate reduction. However, the central bank will also consider the latent inflationary pressure in the recent excessive growth of money supply. Money supply figures published last week showed broad money, or M3, climbing at 7.5 per cent in July on a seasonally adjusted, annualised basis - far above the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy president and president-elect of the Bundesbank, has made clear that both money supply and inflation are central to interest rate decisions. According to yesterday's provisional figures, the annual rate of inflation was down from 4.1 per cent to 4 per cent in North Rhine-Westphalia; from 4.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent in Hesse, and from 4.2 per cent to 4 per cent in Bavaria. Prices in the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, however, rose from 4.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent. Shares rose in Frankfurt after news of the drop in inflation in Bavaria, but markets were closed by the time the other states had reported less optimistic figures. Economists said the degree to which the Bundesbank council members believed a turning point for inflation had been reached would be one key to its decision on interest rates.

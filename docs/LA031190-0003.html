			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOISTING ANOTHER BY HER OWN PETARD;  </P> <P> THE JOURNALIST AND THE MURDERER BY JANET MALCOLM (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $18.95; 162  PP.)  </P> <P> Some years ago, Joan Didion ended ne of her most famous essays -- a piece that  all her admirers remember, and, fortunately, that few of her subjects  subsequently took to heart -- with this gaunt, defiant coda: "Writers," she  warned, "are always selling somebody out."  </P> <P> At times, Janet Malcolm's brilliant and discomfiting new book, "The Journalist  and the Murderer," is an attempt to graft flesh onto the bones of that remark.  Her formulation is, if anything, even more stark than Didion's. "Every  journalist," she writes, "who is not too stupid or too full of himself to  notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is  a kind of confidence man, preying on people's vanity, ignorance or loneliness,  gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse. . . . Journalists  justify their treachery in various ways according to their temperaments. The  more pompous talk about freedom of speech and 'the public's right to know'; the  least talented talk about Art; the seemliest murmur about earning a living."  </P> <P> Hard pounding, this, as the Duke of Wellington remarked at Waterloo. There is  harder to come. In Malcolm's account, the relationship between journalist and  subject is inevitably one of seduction and betrayal. All the rest is wishful  thinking on the subject's part, duplicity on the journalist's.  </P> <P> The best thing for a wronged subject to do, Malcolm suggests, after what she  calls his inevitable "dehoaxing," is to consign the experience "to the rubbish  heap of love affairs that ended badly." The worst thing is to sue. But, of  course, it is precisely the subject who can't let go and the writer who denies  his perfidy that engages Malcolm.  </P> <P> In 1984, Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald, a former Green Beret captain then serving three  consecutive life sentences for the murders of his wife and two young children,  sued Joe McGinniss, the author of a best-selling account of the case called  "Fatal Vision." MacDonald claimed that he had only cooperated with McGinniss --  cooperation so unstinting that at times during his several trials he had  treated McGinniss more like a member of his defense team than like a journalist  -- because the writer had asserted an unshakeable faith in his innocence.  </P> <P> The suit, MacDonald's lawyer, Gary Bostwick, maintained, was "a case about a  false friend." For in between 1979, when he first approached MacDonald, and  1984, when the book appeared, McGinniss had become convinced that his subject  was indeed a murderer. What made this change of heart bad faith was that after  McGinniss had changed his mind, and was telling his publishers that "Fatal  Vision" would portray the doctor as a killer, he continued to insist to  MacDonald, even after the guilty verdict had come in, that he still thought the  charges were false.  </P> <P> For Malcolm, the case of MacDonald v. McGinniss "was unprecedented in being  concerned with a writer's personal conduct toward his subject," an opportunity  to explore not only the moral ambiguity of journalism but what she regards as  its essentially authoritarian nature. Approached by one of his lawyers, who  wrote of the "grave threat to journalistic freedoms" that the case posed,  Malcolm went to see McGinniss hoping, as she puts it rather too grandly, that  their conversations would be like that of two experimenters "strolling home  from the lab together after a day's work, companionably thrashing out the  problems of the profession." Instead of finding a co-experimenter, however,  Malcolm encountered another masochistic subject. McGinniss, she writes, with  the brooding contempt that marked her portrait of him throughout the book,  insisted that "we play the old game of Confession."  </P> <P> Of course, the subject of "The Journalist and the Murderer" is writing, not  crime. Nevertheless, Malcolm's portrait of McGinniss is so damning and her  portrait of MacDonald so noncommittal that one sometimes has to wonder about an  approach in which a writer's dishonesty is treated with more heat than the  murder of three human beings.  </P> <P> Malcolm has always had a taste for demolition. As McGinniss' defenders pointed  out when the book first appeared as a series of articles in The New Yorker,  when she talked about journalism as an ethically ambiguous activity she might  have been thinking less of MacDonald v. McGinniss than of Masson v. Malcolm. A  few years earlier, Malcolm herself had been sued by Jeffrey Masson, the former  curator of the Freud archives whose character and competence she had  effectively demolished in another series of brilliant New Yorker pieces. The  piece on McGinniss, her critics insisted, was more an elaborate rationalization  of what she had done to poor Masson than a truthful account either of McGinniss  or of journalism.  </P> <P> Malcolm relies so heavily on psychotherapeutic, and usually rather rigidly  Freudian, explanations for people's behavior that she should not have been  surprised when this rather dubious weapon was turned against her. In her  afterword (there was no mention of Masson in the body of the text), Malcolm  denies the connection. Readers will judge for themselves.  </P> <P> In the end, however, the question may be irrelevant to the book's quality, if  not to its author's motivations. Like all of Malcolm's best work, "The  Journalist and the Murderer" is an attack, and what McGinniss and Masson really  have in common is that they have been well and truly skewered by a writer as  pitiless as she is talented.  </P> <P> Her masterpieces of severity will, as her subjects must know, endure long after  their own work is forgotten. Indeed, the only recent piece of Malcolm's that  was a disappointment was her admiring portrait of Ingrid Sischy, the former  editor of Art Forum magazine. She is not at her best when she is being kind, a  fact she seems to acknowledge when she writes that "I, too, have committed the  journalistic solecism of putting a person's feelings above a text's  necessities."  </P> <P> The limitation of the book is not that it is wrong but that, whatever she may  claim, Malcolm's subject is really not journalism at all. Malcolm affects to  misunderstand the hostility with which her articles were received by working  journalists, but the explanation is obvious. A reporter covering the START  talks or Mandela's release may have an ego as big as all outdoors, but his  principal relation to his subject is neither of seducer nor of exploiter.  </P> <P> Moreover, Malcolm's casting of the journalist in the position of authority and  the subject in that of the victim ignores all those examples of the journalist  as the tame and obedient creature of the powers that be. Think of the free ride  the press gave John F. Kennedy, or Ronald Reagan during his first six years in  office.  </P> <P> In fact, although Malcolm condescends to the notion of the journalist as  artist, preposterously arguing that writing is best thought of as a way to make  a living (why not go to law school then? The money's better and the work  exercises some of the same abilities), her jeremiad, at once so self-lacerating  and so curiously complacent, applies not to working journalists, filing every  day to deadline, but to writers like herself who produce long articles or books  on subjects of their own choosing according to schedules, the money permitting,  of their own devising, writers whose points of view are as important as their  subject matter: in short, artists.  </P> <P> For it is not with regard to journalism but with regard to the making of works  of art that Malcolm's important book gathers its inspiration, its breathtaking  rhetorical velocity, and its great truth.  </P></p>

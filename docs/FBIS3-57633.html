			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vadim Markushin and Sergey Pashayev report: "Western Group </F> of Forces' History Will Continue With Its Withdrawal"]    [Text] A good hundred journalists assembled at the Russian  Embassy in Berlin for a press conference given by Colonel  General Matvey Burlakov, commander in chief of the Western Group  of Forces [WGF], and their expectations were justified. During  his half-hour speech the commander in chief briefed the  journalists in great detail on the progress of the Russian troop  withdrawal from FRG territory and the problems associated with  it.    Housing construction in Russia for the families of the WGF  servicemen being withdrawn is the most painful problem, M.  Burlakov stressed. As you know, this has been exacerbated  because the units' withdrawal to new basing locations has been  speeded up. The withdrawal has been speeded up, but the pace of  apartment construction not been stepped up, indeed it has even  slowed down. At present there are still 13,000 servicemen's  families without housing. This year's plans make provision for  the commissioning of around 45,000 apartments; however, given  the current lag, I have my doubts, the commander in chief said,  that these plans will be fulfilled.    The press conference also touched on the subject of the  planned celebrations to mark the Russian troop withdrawal from  Germany. They have been given the "go-ahead" in principle,  notably during a recent telephone conversation between H. Kohl  and B. Yeltsin. And the Russian side has put forward a concrete  plan for these celebrations. What adjustments will the Germans  make to it? And when? M. Burlakov was hopeful that an answer  is in the offing.    Of late, according to the commander in chief, there have  been  plenty of articles in the German press concerning the state of  the WGF and the withdrawal of its units home. Whereas most of  these articles reflect the true state of affairs, there are also  obvious falsehoods. DER SPIEGEL and DIE WELT are particularly  guilty of this.    And another point. Millions of our compatriots have served  in Russian garrisons in Germany. How can we preserve the memory  of the good that has come of our relations? According to the  commander in chief, units are today discussing the idea of  setting up a public organization to continue the history of the  WGF.</p>

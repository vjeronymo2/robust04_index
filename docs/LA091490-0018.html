			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MODEST NET GAINS ;  </P> <P> CSUN BOASTS STUBBORN VOLLEYBALL COMPETITOR IN UNASSUMING SWALEC  </P> <P> Don't be fooled by Shelly Swalec's bashful nature. Behind that gentle smile and  peaceful spirit is a fierce competitor. If nothing else, persistence is  Swalec's trademark.  </P> <P> It carried her through the disappointment of being cut from the Cal State  Northridge women's volleyball team two years ago and it was an ally last season  when Swalec made the team but was limited to a few appearances. Diplomatically,  she tempered her desire to play for the good of the team, and she emerged as  one of its strongest supporters.  </P> <P> The payoff? After a tight battle with teammate Shana Wilson, Swalec is the  starting right-side hitter for the 7-4 Matadors.  </P> <P> "A lot of times people who are shy are viewed as not having self-confidence,"  Northridge Coach Walt Ker said. "But underlying Shelly's modesty is a deep  self-confidence. Otherwise she would not have come out for the team when she  wasn't recruited and she certainly wouldn't have come the second time. Her  self-confidence meshes neatly with her modest qualities, but her neatest  characteristic is that she is a positive person. She's always been one of the  hardest workers on the team. She never complains. She is just sweet and nice  and amazingly funny."  </P> <P> Swalec's humor is unintentional. She is not clumsy; she just falls and runs  into things more often than most people.  </P> <P> "It's almost a slapstick kind of thing," Ker said, recalling the time Swalec  caught her ponytail in the net.  </P> <P> Usually, the 5-foot-11 sophomore is not so noticeable. In CSUN's attack, a  right-side hitter is the volleyball equivalent of a blocking fullback.  </P> <P> Left-side hitters, such as Northridge's Patricia Fitzsimmons and Nancy  Nicholls, are set up more often for the kill. And right-side hitters aren't  called on for the dinks and dumps executed so precisely by middle hitters such  as CSUN's Marianne and Kathleen Dixon, who stand out anyway because they are  identical twins.  </P> <P> But Swalec is out there doing the dirty work -- assisting on the block, diving  after errant balls, and making the occasional dazzling spike that reminds  teammates, foes and fans that she is an attacker to be dealt with.  </P> <P> "My biggest thing is defense," Swalec said, "getting balls up that people think  won't get up."  </P> <P> On a larger scale, making the CSUN team as a walk-on from Sterling Heights,  Mich., is as improbable as some of her digs. One of only two non-Californians  on the CSUN roster, Swalec was not exposed to volleyball until junior high.  Unlike most Division I players, she did not have the advantage of playing club  volleyball.  </P> <P> Consequently, she received no scholarship offers after high school. She wrote  to a few schools about playing soccer but did not generate much interest.  </P> <P> Then Buena High Coach Steve Burkhart spoke to Ker about her. Swalec played for  Burkhart in the fall of 1987 while living with her mother Suzane in Ventura.  The second half of Swalec's senior year, Suzane allowed her to return to  Michigan to live with her father and graduate with the Stevenson High class  that she had been with prior to moving to California.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to graduate with people I didn't know," Swalec said. "Those  (Stevenson High classmates) are the people I grew up with."  </P> <P> But Swalec left them behind after graduation.  </P> <P> "I couldn't live with my dad in Michigan and I had a place to live out here  with my mom and I liked (CSUN) a lot," she said. "They have an adaptive  physical education program so I figured if I didn't make the team, I'd be at a  good school."  </P> <P> Between working and commuting from Ventura, Swalec did not get in as much  practice over the summer as she would have liked, but she thought she had a  chance to make the Northridge team. That is, until official tryouts started and  the intensity picked up.  </P> <P> "I looked around and saw how much better the other players were and I knew I  wasn't playing well," Swalec said.  </P> <P> As picture day approached, Swalec had a sinking feeling. "I was hanging in  there, but I knew I was going to be cut."  </P> <P> The day before the team picture was shot, Ker broke the news to Swalec.  </P> <P> "He told me I was good, but that I wasn't ready," Swalec said. "He said I was  welcome to come back in the spring."  </P> <P> While Swalec was limited to intramurals, the Matadors took runner-up honors in  the NCAA Division II championships.  </P> <P> That spring, Ker had the time to work with Swalec. One of the first things Ker  corrected was her "goofy foot."  </P> <P> "I was totally backwards," Swalec said. "I was jumping with the wrong foot  forward and taking too many steps. Once I straightened that out, I thought I  had a better chance to make the team. I knew how (Ker) wanted me to pass and to  hit and what he expected of me, and I knew the team better."  </P> <P> The following fall, Swalec bid to become one of them.  </P> <P> "The hurt would have been really great if I was cut again," she said. "I had  practiced all spring and summer and I don't know if I would be able to come out  again."  </P> <P> Fortunately, Swalec didn't have to worry. Three days before cuts were  announced, Ker told her she had made the team.  </P> <P> "I went home and called my mother and father," Swalec said. "My mom knew how  much it meant to me."  </P> <P> On picture day, she proudly donned a Matador uniform and lined up with her new  teammates.  </P> <P> Initially, Swalec didn't mind watching from the sidelines.  </P> <P> "I would do anything as long as I was on the team," she said. "But eventually I  wanted to be out there. But I knew the other girls were better and I knew I  could wait my turn."  </P> <P> When Keira Middleton graduated, the right-side hitting position opened up and  Swalec took over last spring. But over the summer, Ker recruited Wilson, a  transfer from De Anza College.  </P> <P> "She is a scholarship player and I am a walk-on," Swalec said. "I thought, 'Oh,  no, I'm not going to start.' "  </P> <P> In fall drills, the pair pushed each other.  </P> <P> "It was real close," Swalec said. "We didn't really know (who would start)  until right before the first match. In practice I really had to go hard because  she is really good. She can go in anytime for me and do a really good job, so  the pressure is still there."  </P> <P> Although Swalec starts, she remains a non-scholarship player.  </P> <P> "It's enough to start," she said. "I don't care about the money. If people  watch you play, they don't say, 'She's on a full ride and she's a walk-on.' I  have financial aid for school so I don't really need a scholarship. I'd rather  Walt gave it to a really great player that he is trying to recruit."  </P> <P> Swalec is too kind; the financial aid doesn't cover it. Her mom helps pay the  bills and she earns money by working at the adaptive P.E. Lab and in the  intramural program at CSUN.  </P> <P> But it is all worth it to Swalec -- she almost needed to make the team.  </P> <P> "Where I came from I never had to try out," she said. "I was one of the best,  if not the best, in volleyball, soccer and basketball. I told myself there's no  way (being cut) could happen. It was a pride thing."  </P> <P> Still, Swalec cannot believe her good fortune.  </P> <P> "I'm from Michigan. I was not recruited and I'm starting on a Division I team,"  she said. "It's like you could never imagine playing teams like UCLA, USC or  Hawaii."  </P> <P> Imagine it. USC is on tap Tuesday night.  </P></p>

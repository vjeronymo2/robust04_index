			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: No evidence shown of instability Sir, You maintain on your front page of June 14 (international edition) that governments across Europe have expressed concern 'about the stability of the European Parliament' after the recent election, but you fail to provide any serious evidence to substantiate this sweeping and alarmist judgment. The political forces represented in the new parliament directly reflect political trends in the member states. The case has yet to be proved that the emergence of new political groupings, or fragmentation into a multiplicity of lists such as in France, necessarily leads to 'instability'. Indeed, instability is more likely to be the cause than the result of this situation. Democratic societies evolve, as the FT would usually be the first to point out: parliaments exist to reflect and integrate that evolution. We were particularly intrigued by your reference to anonymous senior German officials muttering darkly about 'unpredictable factions' threatening to disrupt Bonn's relations with the newly elected parliament. No mention, on the other hand, of the absence from the new parliament of the German Republikaner, surely an unpredictable faction par excellence, who polled 7.1 per cent in the 1989 European elections but failed to win a single seat this time round. Again, your reference to between 80 and 100 MEPs unattached to formal left or rightwing party groups in the parliament is bordering on the gratuitous. In all probability new groups and new alliances will be formed in the new parliament: surely you are not suggesting that there will be 100 unattached French and Italian MEPs continuously fomenting instability between now and 1999? We would urge you to eschew dire predictions and instead to judge the European parliament on its actions over the critical months and years that lie ahead. David Harley, adviser to the secretary-general, European Parliament, Luxembourg</p>

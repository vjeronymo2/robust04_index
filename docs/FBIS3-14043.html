In an interview with the Voice of Germany, she paid glowing  tribute to the Kashmiri brethren for their just and valiant  struggle, and pointed out that India has sent 600,000 troops to  occupied Kashmir to suppress the struggle of the Kashmiris. The  prime minister expressed the hope that India will not be able to  suppress the heroic struggle of the Kashmiris despite all its  military might.    Benazir Bhutto explained in detail her government's efforts  to project the Kashmir issue at the international level, making  particular reference to the gross violation of human rights in  occupied Kashmir. She said the Kashmir issue has assumed  international status as a result of Pakistan's efforts.    The prime minister disclosed that before the deferment of  voting on Pakistan's resolution at the UN Human Rights  Commission in Geneva, India asked Iran to convey to Pakistan  that it was ready to receive a delegation from the Islamic  countries. Citing the actual reason for the postponement of  voting on the resolution in Geneva, Bhutto said the voting was  deferred because Pakistan was getting what it had planned to  achieve with the resolution. She refuted Indian claims that the  resolution has been withdrawn, emphasizing that the resolution  is still effective; voting has been deferred on the condition  that India allow delegations from Muslim countries to visit  occupied Kashmir. If necessary, Pakistan will approach the  commission and raise this issue again. This is the politics of  conscience and principles, the prime minister added.</p>

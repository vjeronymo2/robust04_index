			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under general headline "Step Toward </F> Strengthening Commonwealth. Session of CIS Leaders' Council"]    [Text] Describing the session's work, Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk noted that the Commonwealth countries had found  common views on the matters under discussion.    "The main thing in today's talks between Ukraine and  Russia,"  he continued, "is to make progress on resolving the Black Sea  Fleet issue." Kravchuk announced that "agreement was reached  today between the two countries' presidents for a meeting of  delegations comprising the presidents, prime ministers, foreign  ministers, and defense ministers."    In Kravchuk's opinion, "it is necessary to solve the Black  Sea Fleet problem stage by stage." He proposes for the first  stage to "separate the Russian and Ukrainian naval forces."  "The two countries' naval forces should not have the same base  -- this will always give rise to conflicts," the Ukrainian  president said. He believes that the settlement of  Russo-Ukrainian problems should begin with the resolution of  this issue.    As the second stage Kravchuk proposed setting up in Black  Sea  waters a naval base which would belong to Ukraine. "The two  states would later hold talks on leasing part of the territory  of the naval base to Russia." Kravchuk stressed that there is  as yet no document which would define such a relationship  between the two countries. This is why such a document should  be elaborated.    The Ukrainian president is convinced that Russia has the  right merely to lease a naval base from Ukraine. As he put it,  the two states must work out the international principles for  the existence of such naval bases.</p>

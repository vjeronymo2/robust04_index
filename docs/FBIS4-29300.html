			<p>BFN     [Text] Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit, Deputy  Director of the Lao People's Army General Staff Department on  June 3 denied allegations by Thailand that the Lao People's Army  used chemical weapons along the Lao-Thai border, saying that the  allegations were unfounded.    The army brigadier, who is also chairman of the  sub-Committee  for Lao-Thai Border Security Keeping, said in a press  conference, "Colonel Prasit Mongkhontham, member of the  sub-Committee for Thai-Lao Border Security Keeping, made a  statement through Thai Radio and Thai TV (Channel 3) on the  evenings of May 26, 27 and 28 alleging that the Lao People's  Army put chemical substances into water and on tree leaves in  the area along Thai-Lao border opposite Thai Phayao's Chiang  Khan District, Thai Nan's Mae Rin District and Ban Sok in Thai  Uttaradit and that this caused death to Lao people and animals."    He said the same statement was also published in the May 27  issue of "Thailand Times" and in the May 26 issue of "Daily  News".    Brigadier General Douangchai Phichit categorically denied  the  Thai army officer's allegation and confirmed that the Lao  People's Army neither spread chemical substances over those  areas nor possessed any such chemical weapons, chemical  substances, nor have they purchased any such chemical substances  from abroad. He added that such a news report was simply a  fabrication by Thai authorities. He stressed that not only was  it slander against the Lao People's Army and the Lao PDR [Lao  People's Democratic Republic] but also an act of sabotage  against the Lao-Thai relations, causing trouble in the areas  concerned and creating misunderstanding between the people of  Laos and Thailand.    The Lao army officer also held that the one who created the  event had to solve it. This means that Colonel Prasit  Mongkhontham must admit his statement in front of the Lao side  during the meeting of the committees for Lao-Thai border  security keeping scheduled to take place in Vientiane late June  this year.    He elaborated that to improve cooperation in common border  security keeping both sides had to strictly implement the  relevant agreement signed between the two committees for border  security. Only in so doing would the two armies be able to  fulfill their responsibilities to their respective governments  for safeguarding peace and security along the common border.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: It's in the bag THOSE who are heading north of the border might like to know that Hunters of Brora has used three of its sturdy 22 oz Carrol tweeds to make four splendidly rugged looking bags. Colours are the soft hues of the Scottish highlands - gentle greens, browns, mustards and heather - and the lining is of an olive green canvas. The trimmings are leather. The Weekend Bag, photographed here, is 25 in long by 13 ins wide by 12 in deep - small enough to slip under the seat on the flight to Edinburgh or Inverness, yet large enough for most weekend needs. With an outside pocket and a clip-on shoulder strap it is Pounds 175. The Cartridge Bag can be used as a country handbag. Made from one of three Carrol tweeds, it is 12 in wide by 10 in deep and sells for Pounds 69.50. The Country Bag, with two outside pockets, is big enough to carry books or maps, fishing reels and fly boxes (Pounds 89.50). The Rambler Bag, a bit larger than its country cousin, is large enough to take a packed lunch, binoculars, cameras and maps and costs Pounds 149.50. Visitors to Brora in Inverness can buy them personally from the shop or tel: 0408-621366.</p>

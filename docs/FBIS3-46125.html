The scheme, aimed at developing upgraded new and high-tech  products, is expected to help enterprises in the province to  survive fierce competition on the international market.    The scheme engages in new and high-tech development  including  micro-electronics, computer software science, new materials,  automation and robotics, biological and oceanic engineering,  energy saving, environmental protection and transportation.    The plan will help the province, one of the most important  industrial bases in China, to frame the future expansion of its  leading industries, a government official said.    The province, now dominated by energy-consuming industries,  is expected to shift to technology-intensive production with the  implementation of the scheme.    Four engineering centers concerning the development of new  materials, industrial robots, special integrated circuits and  biological technology will be set up in the province around the  year 2000.    More than 3,500 series of products will be developed, of  which 70 to 80 percent will be put into production.    The provincial government will work out special policies to  promote research and development programs in basic sciences and  technology and help to put them into industrial production, the  official said.    Major programs will seek overseas cooperation so as to speed  up the industrial production of new and high technologies, he  added.</p>

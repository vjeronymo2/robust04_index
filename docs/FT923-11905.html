			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Czechs willing to assume full foreign debt A Czech republican government would be willing to assume responsibility for the entire Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 4.86bn) foreign debt of the present Czech and Slovak federal republic if the 'velvet divorce' of the republics goes through at the end of September as proposed, according to Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the Czech trade and industry minister, writes David Dodwell. Mr Dlouhy, in London to calm western fears over the Czech government's determination to stand by its economic reform programme, said the break-up of the federal state would involve difficult negotiations over the division of foreign exchange assets and earnings - most significantly revenue from the transit gas pipeline from the former Soviet Union.</p>

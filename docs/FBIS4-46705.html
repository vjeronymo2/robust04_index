			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with F. T. Sarkisyan, president of Armenian </F> National Academy of Sciences, by Z. Arevshatyan: "Academy of  Sciences 50 Years Old"]    [Text] "The most urgent cultural-historical task of  the Armenian Academy is raising the self-awareness of the  Armenian people . . . developing in them a conscious love for  their homeland, language, and culture and strengthening their  faith in a bright future. The Academy should be an object of  pride for our people. It should become the acme of our culture,"  said Avetik Isaakyan at a ceremonial gathering dedicated to the  inauguration of the Academy of Sciences of the Armenian SSR.  Since then, 50 years have passed, and during these spring days  we are marking the half-century anniversary of what is now the  Armenian National Academy of Sciences [NAN]. The history of its  creation, the people thanks to whose scientific activity Armenia  today is and always will take a place of honor in the world of  science not only of the former USSR but of the world, and also  the present day of the NAN will be the subject of our  conversation with its president, Fadey Tachatovich  Sarkisyan.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] An anniversary is always an occasion  for remembering the founders once again, for looking back on the  past from the standpoint of that constructive charge that it  nonetheless bore, thanks to vivid, outstanding individuals.    [Sarkisyan] To be precise, our reckoning should begin with  1935, when at the initiative of the USSR Academy of Sciences, a  branch of it was created in Yerevan, headed by the famous  geologist and scholar, Academician F. Yu. Levinson-Lesing. In  1938, the outstanding academician Iosif Orbeli took over the  leadership of this scientific institution. Its obvious successes  and the high level of its scientific personnel made it obvious  that an independent academy of sciences should be created in  Armenia. In November 1943, a founding council of 23 academicians  was approved. Here are the names of these outstanding scholars:  Manuk Abegyan (literary criticism), Abraam Alikhanyan (physics),  Artem Alikhanyan (physics), Pachiya Acharyan (linguistics),  Vardan Gulkanyan (genetics), Ivan Yegiazarov (hydroenergy),  Mikayel Tumanyan (agriculture), Avetik Isaakyan (literature),  Saak Karapetyan (physiology), Khachatur Koshtoyants  (physiology), Aleksandr Akopyan (thermodynamics), Viktor  Ambartsumyan (astrophysics), Levon Ovanisyan (medicine), Gongor  Kapandzhyan (linguistics), Stepan Malkhasyan (philology), Akop  Manandyan (history), Konstantin Paffengolts (geology), Arsin  Terteryan (literary criticism), Iosif Orbeli [illegible], Levon  Orbeli (physiology).    Iosif Orbeli was elected the first president of our academy;  the vice-presidents were Viktor Ambartsumyan and Vardan  Gulkanyan.    During the difficult days of the war, specifically on 29  November 1943, the ceremonial opening of the Armenian Academy of  Sciences was held.    The year 1947 also became a notable landmark in the history  of our academy, when it was newly headed up by and in the course  of 46 years had as its constant president Viktor Ambartsumyan.  Under his leadership the Armenian Academy of Sciences was  formed, following a fruitful scientific path of development and  receiving world recognition in several spheres of science. Today  Viktor Amazaspovich, as NAN's honorary president, is taking an  active part in the Academy's activities.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] So, in the first year of the academy's  creation, its 23 members decided the basic path of its  development. And since at an anniversary you are supposed to sum  up specific results, what scientific potential does the NAN  possess today in figures?    [Sarkisyan] Over the last 50 years, the Academy has held 19  elections and elected a total of 103 active members and 161  corresponding members of the Academy, as well as 13 honorary and  24 foreign members of the Academy.    At present the NAN has 38 active, 63 corresponding, 10  honorary, and 19 foreign members. Of our 2685 scientific  associates, 302 are doctors of science and 1385 are candidates  of science.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] Every era has its own demands:  literally two years ago the issue was raised about the need to  reorganize the academy, its structure and activities. Was an  optimal solution found? After all, it is no secret that because  of the uncertainty of these issues, as well as the difficult  social and economic situation, which does not allow for  full-fledged professional activity, the republic's scientific  potential is decreasing.    [Sarkisyan] Actually, there have been many disputes and  discussions, and acceptable and unacceptable proposals have been  advanced on this subject. And this has happened because under  the new conditions, which have posed the Academy with the  necessity to refurbish its approach to many branches of  knowledge, the Academy's new status has not been approved.    [RESPUBLIKA ARMENIYA] The president's edict of 9 March 1993,  "On the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Armenia," changed  the status of the Academy and the attitude toward it in a  fundamental way, thereby preparing a basis for the further  development of our country's science. In accordance with the  edict, the Academy was renamed the RA [Republic of Armenia]  National Academy of Sciences , which, in the first place,  distinguishes it in principle from other academies that have  opened lately in Armenia. In the second place, the Academy's  role and importance have grown significantly: it is now an  advisor to the leading organs of the republic, and its  recommendations must be considered by the government, with the  issue of specific decisions.    On 2 May of this year, the RA government approved the new  NAN  charter, which was passed recently at its general assembly. In  it the provisions guaranteeing the monolithic nature of the  academic structure, specifying the mechanisms for financing  scientific work, and significantly raising and specifying the  roles and tasks of the NAN in our complex age were reinforced.</p>

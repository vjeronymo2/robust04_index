			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Gardening: Just dying for a drink - Robin Lane Fox is trying to beat the weather in his corner of Oxfordshire The rain has been circling around Britain but it refuses to land on my garden. I am living like the ancient men of Santorini. On their Greek island, they are said to have endured a drought for seven years because they did not do what a god had told them. Since June 3, it has rained once in my Oxfordshire garden and the phloxes are hating it. The Santorini solution was to uproot part of the male population and send them away. The exiles from the drought found a new home in Libya. Later, their new city was famous for saffron crocus, which they had either taken with them or had sent on by a subsequent boat. Should I wrap-up my crocuses and make a bolt for it? Dry weather sorts out keen gardeners from the rest but, unless it lasts for another six years, it will not make me uproot. However, it will teach us all some basic truths about gardening. The first is about weeds. You may wonder why serious gardeners are so keen to pull them out or poison them. The answer is not just visual or psychological. Weeds compete for water and if you let them run around, as the mindless school of 'green' gardening commands, the results show in a dry spell. Weeds make drought worse. The second truth is about roots. Theoretical experts sometimes like to tell us that there is no point in watering plants during dry weather or in feeding them through their leaves. I believe this to be non-gardeners' rubbish. It does not distinguish between newly-planted and established plants, between deep and shallow roots and between loose notions of 'plant food' and their need to drink. Probably, we can make little difference to an established tree which is beginning to flag in hot weather, even if we water it for half a day. We can, however, save newly-planted trees, shrubs and border plants and we must do so, extending our saving act to anything up to three years old. We must also remember that some plants send fine roots along the surface and are always the better for a soaking. Others will either push - or be coaxed into pushing - their roots down to a depth where they can draw on cool reserves. Even so, it is quite wrong to tell gardeners that these sorts of plant can be left alone. In their early years, they also need support from us, whether hostas or hellebores, and only then will they push down and need no further assistance. If a recently-planted hosta or day lily is flagging, for heaven's sake water it at once. Droughts also deny our plants their 'food'. The basic fact is that plants cannot eat, although writers and advertisers imply that they can. They are sustained by liquid intake and uptake. Experts may argue that attempts to spray fertiliser in a liquid form on to a plant's leaves are unsatisfactory because so little hits the target and is taken up. From my constant experience and counter-experiment, I know that their argument is not one for inaction. Those plants which are excluded from this treatment are noticeably worse. Lastly, the matter of leaves and toughness. All around you, you will see once again the evidence that plants with silver, furry, thickly-coated leaves are surviving without any particular trouble. They remind you of the value of matching a plant's natural preference to its predicament in your garden if you want a trouble-free life. I notice the relative happiness of my trees with glossy green or grey leaves, the alders, the ornamental pears and particular forms of Sorbus. I also notice the exceptional happiness of the blue-flowered, grey-leaved Teucrium and the flourishing of all forms of Salvia. If the ancient men of Santorini had grown the curious green and black Salvia discolor and the lovely half-hardy new Indigo Spires, they would have packed them off to Libya with the crocus. If I have to bolt for it, this type of plant is the one which I would take to a second home and a new start on the Mediterranean fringe.</p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Lobby group for advice agencies BRITAIN'S 300-plus enterprise agencies, which provide advice to new and small businesses, have established a national federation to represent their interests, Charles Batchelor writes. Business in the Community, which co-ordinates community activity by large companies, acted as an informal umbrella organisation for the agencies until last June when it announced plans to end the relationship. Sir Graham Day, chairman of Cadbury Schweppes, has agreed to be the federation's founding president. A senior Cadbury executive, Mr John Guest, will be chief executive for the first year.</p>

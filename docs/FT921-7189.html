			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Stock Exchange passes Taurus system milestone THE FIRST milestone towards paperless trading on the London Stock Exchange's long-delayed Taurus system was completed yesterday as users put in place internationally recognised securities codes. The Stock Exchange said the exercise represented one of the biggest and most complex upgrades of its Talisman settlements system since the service was introduced in 1979. Some 270 participants - brokers, registrars, custodians and fund managers - have been involved in the procedure. The cross-over, one of a series of reforms of trading and settlement recommended by the Group of 30 - an international think tank of former economic and financial policymakers - had been originally set for completion in October last year. The Stock Exchange said that more than 1,000 separate programming changes were required at the Stock Exchange's central system alone. 'Overall, we think it was a great success,' it said, adding that there were still a few brokers who had not completed the transfer of old codes. 'There were a few minor hiccoughs, but we think those firms will make the cross-over by Tuesday or Wednesday,' it added. Mr Mike Jones, head of the Stock Exchange group overseeing the transfer said that from today those who did not have the codes in place in their system were effectively barred from trading. He added: 'They may as well pack their bags and go home.' In a letter to Stock Exchange participants earlier this month, Mr John Watson, Taurus project director, warned that those who failed to make the transition on time risked falling by the wayside. 'A number of participants have raised the question of fallback. There is no opportunity to fallback once the process is underway,' he said, but noted that ample opportunity had been given to put the system changes into effect. The exercise will change the identification codes currently used for different securities into internationally recognised ones - a key first step in making the Taurus system an effective means of cross-border trading. The codes, known as International Securities Identification Numbers, are recognised by the world's main exchanges. Without the use of these codes, Taurus would not be able to conduct cross-border transactions with other exchanges when it finally comes on line. Current targets call for it to be in place by April next year. LSE poised to alter rules on disclosure, Page 17.</p>

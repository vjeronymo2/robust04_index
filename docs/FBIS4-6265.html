			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Kang Song-san, member of the Political Bureau of </F> the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and  premier of the Administration Council, at a banquet arranged by  DPRK President Kim Il-song at the Kumsusan Assembly Hall for the  foreign delegations and delegations of overseas Koreans on 15  April -- read by announcer]    [Text] Comrades and respected foreign guests:    Today, all the people across the nation, with infinite joy  and a sense of boundless admiration, are grandly celebrating the  great leader's birthday as the greatest auspicious holiday of  the nation. We feel it an utmost honor and joy to be in the  presence of high-level delegations and goodwill missions of  various countries, and delegations of overseas compatriots with  the respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song in  attendance.    Authorized by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, and on  behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] Central Committee  and the government of the republic, I warmly welcome and extend  my deep thanks to the foreign party delegations, foreign  goodwill missions, and friends who are here in our country to  join in the joy of our people on the occasion of our nation's  auspicious April holiday. In addition, I warmly welcome and  give fervent fraternal greetings to the congratulatory  delegations and figures of overseas compatriots from different  regions and organizations who came here to deliver unanimous  greetings from overseas compatriots to the great leader.    Since he embarked on the road of revoluion, the respected  leader Comrade Kim Il-song has victoriously led the Korean  revolution with his outstanding and tested leadership and  tireless efforts of devotion for a long time. In doing so, he  performed immortal exploits for the country, the revolution, the  times, and history.    Even today, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song -- with  extraordinary wisdom, excelled leadership, and lofty popular  traits -- is vigorously leading our people's struggle for  socialist construction and the national reunification on a  correct road of victory, and is directing big efforts for the  country's ever-lasting prosperity.    Thanks to the respected and beloved Comrade Kim Il-song's  outstanding and tested leadership, our people are powerfully  demonstrating the superiority of the popular mass-centered  socialism of our own style; are effecting a constant upswing in  socialist construction; and are valiantly advancing toward the  denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the independent and  peaceful reunification of the country without the slightest  vacillation under the complex and difficult conditions created  by the continued challenges and obstructions by the imperialists  and reactionaries.    Independence, peace, and friendship are basic doctrines in  the foreign policy our party and republic's government have  consistently carried through.    Our party and republic's government, as in the past, will  invariably and consistently implement the foreign policy of  independence, peace and friendship, and thus actively contribute  to the peace and progress of mankind and the world's cause of  independence.    At this meaningful place filled with a sense of boundless  admiration and warm friendship for the great leader, I propose a  toast to our fatherland's everlasting prosperity, to our  nation's eternal happiness, to national reunification, and to  the completion of the chuche revolutionary cause.    I also propose a toast to the long life and good health of  Comrade Kim Il-song, the great leader of our party and people,  who is observing the 82d anniversary of his birth; to the health  of delegations of foreign parties of various countries; and to  the health of foreign comrades and friends who came to  congratulate the auspicious holiday of the nation.</p>

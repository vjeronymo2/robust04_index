			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Chequers asks for suspension of shares SHARES IN Chequers Group, the renovation contractor, were suspended at 4p yesterday at the company's request pending clarification of its financial position. Chequers, formerly known as Dean &amp; Bowes Group, warned in May that its financial and trading position had materially worsened and it was only able to keep trading with the support of its bankers, Barclays. The group also announced yesterday that it had begun legal proceeding against Mr Stephen Dean, its former chairman and chief executive, who resigned in February. Mr Philip Sims, who took over as chairman and chief executive, said one writ referred to a compensation payment of Pounds 200,000 made to Mr Dean which did not receive shareholders' authorisation. Another writ referred to Mr Dean's failure to complete the acquisition of a loss-making subsidiary of Chequers, Platonoff Harris, the small Cambridge joinery business. Mr Dean said last night he had not yet received any writs, but they would be strenuously defended. He added: 'I strongly deny there is any basis for a claim against me.' He said his compensation payment had been approved by the board, which was advised by the company's lawyers that it did not need shareholders' approval. In any case, all shareholders had been informed about it in a subsequent circular. The acquisition of Platonoff Harris, he explained, had not been completed on the advice of his lawyers, following a change in information regarding the business. Mr Sims said he was involved in talks with other parties which might lead to an offer being made for all or part of Chequers. At its suspension price, the group had a market value of Pounds 800,000.</p>

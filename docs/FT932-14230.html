			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Out of date Oh dear. Spring Ram, a company which used to release its accounts on the same day as its preliminary figures, has had to delay publication of its report and accounts because of a missing piece of text. Could it be the bit from the company's auditors? Fortunately, the missing item is not thought to be so sensitive and should be found in time so that there will be no need to delay the agm, scheduled for May 21 at the Hilton Hotel in Leeds.</p>

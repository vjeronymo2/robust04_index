			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At noon today Albanian President Sali Berisha  received the delegation of the Party for Democratic Prosperity  in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] led by Chairman Arben Xhaferri.    I am happy to receive you, President Berisha said, and I  follow the developments in your party with interest. Its  recently acquired freedom to function, through the democratic  mechanism of free vote in the last assembly and free elections  in your party branches, enables party members to be engaged and  contribute to the guaranteeing of Albanian human and national  rights, as well as the development of democracy of Macedonia and  its stability. An independent and stable Macedonia is in the  interest not only of Albania, but also of all the peoples in the  Balkans who are concerned about peace in the region. That is  why we are determined to increase cooperation with Macedonia in  the spirit of understanding. The Serb chauvinists and its  ultranationalist allies desire the destabilization of Macedonia  today.    Your party must accomplish many tasks and should seriously  work to implement them. The efforts of Albanians today should  be concentrated in order to prevent conflict, develop and  promote democracy, and establish local democratic institutions,  i.e. found various democratic institutions.    I want to tell you that the more evident the principles of  democracy and the present European civilization are for the  Albanians, the stronger they will be, and the more friends  Albania and the Albanian nation in general will have. In all  your efforts, you should assess what has been achieved through  dialogue and democratic means and insist on the implementation  of your rights and freedoms in conformity with the Helsinki Act  and other international documents.    For his part, in thanks for the reception, Arben Xhaferri,  chairman of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of the Albanians  in Macedonia, said that we support and will contribute to  stability in Macedonia, but we are not relinquishing efforts to  raise and strengthen our institutions as centers that generate  values of patriotism and national rights. Thus can we create  common valued of civilization with other nationals, which  together connect us with Europe. I thank the Albanian  Government for the support it has given and is giving to  liberate and educate our students.    Delegation member Mendu Thaci said that we hope, through  hard  work, to give our party its due role, so that the party is  engaged inasmuch as possible in Macedonian political life. The  assembly proceedings confirmed that this party enjoys the  support of Albanians in Macedonia not only through the number of  members, but also because of the assessment made by the Albanian  intellectual world.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / UK Company News: Scruttons shows decline to Pounds 1.87m Scruttons, which operates port, shipping, engineering and other service businesses, saw pre-tax profits fall from Pounds 2.23m to Pounds 1.87m in 1990. Mr Richard Gardiner-Hill, chairman, regarded the result as satisfactory against a background of temporary problems related to the London terminal business. The three service divisions increased profits. In the current year the group had started well, and again higher profits were expected in the service divisions. Turnover rose to Pounds 22.72m (Pounds 19.66m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 336,000 relating to repairs at the Victoria Deep Water Terminal. It will be wholly or partly out of action until September. The shares are traded on a matched bargain basis. Earnings were 28.7p (36.1p) and the dividend is again 15p.</p>

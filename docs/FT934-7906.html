			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Anti-tax lobby offers history lesson LORD BULLOCK, the historian, yesterday offered a little historical perspective to the debate over the possible imposition of value added tax on books and publications. Lord Bullock, who is chairman of The Hands Off Reading Campaign, appealed to Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to respect 132 years of 'educational and political wisdom and keep reading free of tax'. It was in 1861, Lord Bullock, told a press conference, that Mr Gladstone, when chancellor, removed the UK's last tax on learning and literacy, the stamp duty on newspapers. Lord Bullock said that the argument against VAT on publications was 'primarily an argument about literacy'. Current levels of literacy in the UK were little short of scandalous, with about 6.5m people over the age of 16 suffering serious reading difficulties, he said. The government, Lord Bullock said, had made improving levels of literacy its main target in education. It therefore made no sense to 'make it more difficult to obtain books and other reading materials'. Mr Bert Hardy, managing director of Associated Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, highlighted a NOP survey suggesting that marketing's C2, D and E social groups read nothing other than daily or Sunday newspapers. They were the key targets for the government's illiteracy campaign. He said that if VAT were introduced for newspapers it would be the first time that there had been a simultaneous price rise and the effect on circulations could be serious. Mr Ian Locks of the Periodical Publishers Association warned that as many as 1,000 magazines could move to continental Europe to avoid VAT by posting copies to subscribers.</p>

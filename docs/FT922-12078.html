			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Investor loses two seats in board row at San Miguel MR EDUARDO Cojuangco, the Philippine businessman who last week looked set to gain control of San Miguel Corporation, the country's largest industrial enterprise, was yesterday left with only one seat in the board. An order from the chief justice of the Philippine Supreme Court issued hours before San Miguel's annual meeting yesterday restrained Mr Cojuangco from voting a block of shares that last year qualified his group for three seats in the 15-member board. Until last week Mr Cojuangco, on the basis of a separate Supreme Court decision on March 4 ordering a new election at United Coconut Planters Bank, was widely seen as poised for a takeover of the bank and San Miguel. The bank was organised by Mr Cojuangco with proceeds from a levy on the coconut industry. It is administrator of a block of 30 per cent of San Miguel shares. Mr Cojuangco had persistently argued that the shares in San Miguel, although registered in the names of 14 shell companies he and his associates controlled, were actually owned by some 1.4m coconut farmers who paid the coconut levy over between 1973 and 1982. The lower court instructed by the Supreme Court to supervise elections at bank, however, is still to schedule the shareholders' meeting. Furthermore, the present board, composed of government nominees placed after the bank was sequestered in 1986, had already cancelled this year's annual meeting and election when the court decision came. Yesterday's restraining order effectively pushed Mr Cojuangco from the beer-and-food conglomerate, which last year recorded sales of 53.3bn pesos (Dollars 2.2bn). However, the incumbent controlling group, the Soriano family and nominees of the state's Presidential Commission on Good Government - which sequestered the United Coconut Planters Bank-administered shares - nominated only 14 names, leaving one for the Cojuangco group. The shares in question were in the names of Mr Cojuangco, his relatives and a number of companies his family controlled.</p>

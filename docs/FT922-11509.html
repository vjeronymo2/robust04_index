			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Noranda returns to profit NORANDA, the Canadian resources group, returned to the black in the first quarter thanks to a glimmer of recovery in some forest products markets, lower costs and a lighter debt-servicing burden. Net earnings were CDollars 17m (USDollars 14.4m), or 1 cent a share, compared with CDollars 15m, or zero per share, in the first quarter of last year. The company, which has interests in mining, forestry and energy, suffered heavy losses in the second half of last year. Revenues were virtually unchanged at CDollars 2.1bn. Earnings from metals and minerals fell to CDollars 31m from CDollars 58m, due largely to lower copper, gold, nickel and aluminium prices. Forest products posted a profit of CDollars 5m, the first in almost two years. While newsprint prices remain under pressure, the company said that markets were improving for some other products.</p>

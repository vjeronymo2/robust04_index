			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Socialist Party President Camilo Escalona by </F> Raquel Correa; place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted]  <H5>  Palestro's Return? </H5>   His great personal drawing power was demonstrated during the  last election. If he obtained 48,000 votes with the enthusiastic  support of the left (today the MIDA [Allendist Leftist  Democratic Movement]) in 1989, now he received 62,500. This  fact, and that he heads the Socialist movement, has led many to  conclude that "this business of socialist renewal" is just a  fairy tale. The political scientist, trained while in exile at  the University of Madrid, replies with a straight face:    "I believe it is due to my strong ties with my district."    [Correa] Is it not proof that the Socialist grass roots have  not been renewed, as Hernan Larrain said?    [Escalona] No. These arguments are too esoteric for the man  in the street, as Julio Martinez would say. There was a strong  tendency to vote for the person. And without a doubt, I was the  congressman in the Concertation who had the greatest following  in the district.    [Correa] Would you like Mario Palestro to return to the PS  [Socialist Party]?    [Escalona] Of course! He is a bit undisciplined but--he is a  Socialist after all! What are we going to do: we cannot cover  the sun with a finger. In reality, he has become disconnected  from reality.    [Correa] He despises the "renewed ones." Do you, also?    [Escalona] I am very critical of renewed Socialists. But at  the same time, I deeply value the effort and the intellectual  contribution they are making to update Socialist thinking.    [Correa] What is your basic discrepancy with the "renewed  ones?"    [Escalona] Especially a question of style: I find them  artificial, without going to the extreme of Palestro, who says  that they wear pink underwear.  <H5>  Market Economy </H5>   [Correa] With regard to Socialist thinking, do you accept  the  market economy?    [Escalona] It is a conception of the state that I value and  accept. Because if a state is not democratic, even though it  might call itself socialist, it represents a contradiction in  principle with our political thought. In other words, a state  that is administered under the concept of the dictatorship of  the proletariat is incompatible with the basic principles of  Socialist thought, which speak of pluralism, alternation in  power, liberty and the rights of individuals. Now, in the field  of economics, I believe that they are hastening to accept a  model with aspects which today are in dispute.... Even President  Aylwin spoke of a "cruel" system. In renewed socialism, this  discussion is in process. We, who recognize that the economic  process does not work without the market, can give this fact a  progressive twist and, at the same time, the possibility to  resolve the problems that the market does not resolve on its  own: social inequalities. I believe that renewal socialism's  hastiness in dealing with this theme produced a negative  cultural effect: a certain legitimization of the concept of  market economy as it was handed down by the military regime.    [Correa] Are you delegitimizing the market economy?    [Escalona] We accept that the market is indispensable for  the  functioning of the economy, but we want to make corrections in  it that give efficacy to the productive process to enable it to  resolve the social inequalities that the market is unable to  resolve by itself. In 1992, after losing the internal elections,  I published an article called The Socialist Plan for the Market,  in which I argued that we Socialists could not remain paralyzed,  as if barking at the moon, criticizing the market. That instead  we ought to develop program proposals that emphasize the  redistributive function.    [Correa] You do not believe in the social economics of the  market either?    [Escalona] This concept began to be adopted when equitable  growth was pursued, in this government, although we Socialists  found it inadequate. When the 15 percent tax on the First  Category was included, the social concept appears.    [Correa] Would you say that Foxley's policies followed that  path?    [Escalona] I think they followed a progressive path,  although  that will seem an exaggeration to many leftists. There was  progress, but inequalities did not disappear.    [Correa] What system do you think could make inequalities  disappear in four years?    [Escalona] None.  <H5>  Under Suspicion </H5>   [Correa] How would you describe a socialist model today?    [Escalona] I believe that the way to be socialist is about  to  emerge. It does not exist yet. In President Aylwin's government,  we had very important responsibilities and at the same time we  maintained our presence and our responsibilities in the social  movement, with a great many labor union leaders. But this  situation does not exist today as a possibility. This is why the  divorce between the Socialist grass roots and its leadership is  so evident.    [Correa] If the next government were to be presided over by  Ricardo Lagos instead of Frei, what specific difference would  there have been?    [Escalona] We Socialists feel somewhat constrained from  saying anything, because whatever we say is "under suspicion" in  Chile because of the cultural climate. There are those who think  that we want to establish a totalitarian state. The future  minister of education said that education needs a revolution,  and we Socialists agree with that, but if Lagos had said it  there would have been an outcry. When I was a boy, social  mobility was possible through education. Today, the same is not  true, in general, which accentuates inequalities. A first  essential question for the Socialists is that there is still no  program of education for democracy, although there has been  important progress. Second, a revolution is needed in the social  security system: people--not only the elderly--are  extraordinarily unprotected in Chile. We should be the principal  factors in placing those two subjects on the agenda.    [Correa] Do you consider yourself a Marxist-Leninist?    [Escalona] No. Just Marxist. I reached the conclusion that  the humanist content that we want to capture is not contained in  that formulation. The word Leninism is associated with  atrocities and genocide, which are contrary to what we aspire to.    [Correa] You lived in countries that were under real  socialism. What did you feel when the wall fell?    [Escalona] A conception of the state collapsed. What was  latent in my political thinking took form. I was familiar with  several ex-socialist countries, and I was aware of the level of  bureaucracy, the inefficiency, popular apathy, alienation from  power, lack of participation. The destruction of the wall made  absolutely clear that our concept of the state is completely  different.    [Correa] What emphasis do you want to give socialism. Make  it  more leftist?    [Escalona] No. Humanize it. Because we are experiencing a  conflict of realities. We come in from the street, from strikes,  protests, and suddenly we find ourselves in the government. This  is why we have a mixed party, so to speak, and, so that it may  become one again, we must concentrate the activity of the party  on persons. Because if today you compare the profile of a  Socialist who is adviser to the minister of finance with a  Socialist coal miner, you will find two very different points of  view. We need to find common ground.    [Correa] By making the adviser more leftist and the miner  more rightist?    [Escalona] Something like that. We can help greatly to  improve health services, for example. People do not look  favorably on health service personnel because the service is  bad. We have to make an effort so that those workers do not  abandon their legitimate union aspirations and at the same time  understand that they are part of a people who must be well  served.... Our new concept is "a party for the people."    [Correa] And what is it now?    [Escalona] A party for power.    [Correa] As president of the PS, why did you not support  Isabel Allende?    [Escalona] Because the veto against me was still in effect.  Last week's Plenum created a new situation in the party: that  any agreement is possible. Before the Plenum, any agreement was  possible, except that I could become president of the party. In  any case, I never objected to her.    [Correa] Would you have preferred to vote for the priest  Pizarro than for Frei?    [Escalona] No. The integralism of Pizarro's line spared me  any problems of conscience. What a conservative! I doubt that  any Communist could say that Pizarro is more progressive than  Frei.... I believe that Frei is a lucky man: it is his fate to  live during a period that might see the democratic reformulation  of the country. I believe that, over the long term, political  realities will influence the position of the right. As 1997  approaches, there will be movement toward agreement on  institutional matters, although not completely to the  satisfaction of the Concertation.    [Correa] How do you feel about the appointment of German  Correa as chief of the Cabinet?    [Escalona] It is a daring step for the president-elect.    [Correa] Why did the PS oppose the appointment at first?    [Escalona] Only because German's departure could have caused  a problem of governability in the party.    [Correa] Do you consider it a master stroke, to bind the  Socialists to the Concertation?    [Escalona] It is something we cannot ignore. The separation  of the presidential and the congressional elections must have  made the Christian Democrats think that we had to be more  cautious with positions of so much responsibility. But the  important thing is that this shows the extent to which we have  internalized the Concertation.    [Correa] Foxley said that he will be loyal to Frei until the  last day of his administration. Would you say the same?    [Escalona] We will be part of the Frei government for his  entire administration.    [Correa] What could make you leave?    [Escalona] Changes in the situation so radical that I cannot  imagine them at the moment.    [Correa] Is the relationship of the left with the government  strong now?    [Escalona] More intense.    [Correa] Do you think that the Ministry of Public Works is  sufficient for Lagos?    [Escalona] The Foreign Ministry would have been better.  <H5>  PS-PPD: Realization? </H5>   [Correa] Do you favor the convergence of the PS-PPD [Party  for Democracy]?    [Escalona] No, because it irritates and exacerbates  relations  between the two parties.    [Correa] But Lagos is in favor....    [Escaalona] Yes, but when he came to call on us he said that  he understands that this is not possible at the moment; what he  wants is coordination that optimizes the bilateral relationship.    [Correa] What do you think of the statements by Deputy  Shaulsohn that the PPD should exercise hegemony in the  Concertation?    [Escalona] I cannot believe he said that. The idea of  hegemony is so aggressive....    [Correa] He also said that "a great progressive force,"  PPD-PS, "was an abstract realization [entelequia]."    [Escalona] I understand that because of origin, shared  experiences, even Lagos's leadership, there is an aspiration for  a force to exist between the PS and the PPD that would play a  progressive role in the Concertation.    [Correa] How do you intend to manage things between the  various factions of the PS, considering that your faction  represents less than half of the party?    [Escalona] I hope that the agreement that was reached last  week will become a substantive political agreement with all the  factions. I am not going to try to reach an understanding with  one faction to the detriment of another.    [Correa] Are you going to be "above factions?"    [Escalona] I am going to be multilateral.  <H5>  Order and Repression </H5>   [Correa] What will you do on the day that a Socialist  minister, under the obligation to maintain public order, has to  permit repression?    [Escalona] Bernardo Leighton was minister of interior and  went down in history as one of the great democrats. The Ministry  of Interior in a democratic government does everything it can to  avoid excesses of repression. In everything that signifies  maintaining public order with the legitimate means of democratic  governability of the country, the minister of interior has the  unrestricted support of the Socialist Party.    [Correa] But if a mishap occurs during a confrontation...?    [Escalona] What may happen because of a "mishap" is not the  political responsibility of the minister of interior.    [Correa] Does this total commitment of the PS to the  Concertation impede the formation of a leftist alliance with the  Communist Party?    [Escalona] We are not working to recreate a leftist  alliance.  We are not thinking about a Socialist-Communist alliance. It is  impossible: we have a different understanding of the country. We  think that the Concertation is a constructive, progressive,  stabilizing factor in Chilean society, and the Communist Party  sees it as a continuation of Pinochet. There is no meeting point.    [Correa] Do you feel closer today to the PDC [Christian  Democratic Party], which was Allende's adversary, than to the PC  [Communist Party], which was his ally?    [Escalona] Of course. As a deputy for a working class  district, I am at peace with my conscience participating in a  government that has built 90,000 housing units during the year  and not forming part of an opposition that contributes nothing.  In any case, it is a matter of principle for me that we  Socialists cannot form part of a McCarthyite philosophy that  tends to demonize the Communists, a view which can lead to any  extreme.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Al  Thani arrived in Amman this afternoon on a two-day visit to  Jordan, during which he will hold talks on bolstering bilateral  relations and the Arab situation.    On a statement to reporters on arrival, the Qatari minister  said:    [Begin recording] [Al Thani] In the name of God, the  merciful, the compassionate. I am grateful for the warm  reception by the brothers in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.  Of course, the visit comes within the framework of the  long-standing fraternal bilateral relations. Today's visit aims  to bolster this position, and if there is any misunderstanding  or anything else to place things in a sound framework--a  framework of brotherhood and cooperation, and within the  framework of realizing Arab solidarity [sentence incomplete as  heard].    [Reporter] Your Excellency the Minister, what is the State  of  Qatar's view on Arab solidarity?    [Al Thani] We have stated several times that Arab solidarity  is a necessity. If there is something to be discussed, in my  view we can discuss it face to face as Arabs, and there is no  need for estrangement. We should speak face to face and put  things on the right track.    [Reporter] Are you carrying a message to his majesty the  king  from his highness the amir?    [Al Thani] Of course, I will convey the greetings of his  highness the amir and his highness the heir apparent to his  majesty the king and His Highness Prince Hasan. At the same  time, I will convey a verbal message.    [Reporter] Your Excellency, would you sum up Qatar's  position  on the peace process, especially concerning holy Jerusalem?    [Al Thani] Since the very beginning of this problem with the  Israeli occupation of Palestine, the State of Qatar has been  adopting a clear position. Qatar supports the brothers, whether  in Palestine or other Arab countries that were harmed by the  [Israeli] occupation in 1967. We support the Palestinian  people's peace understanding which they reached with Israel. It  is a Palestinian affair, and we only support the brothers,  whether in peace or in other conditions--we support them with  the capabilities available to us.    [Reporter] What about holy Jerusalem?    [Al Thani] Of course, this is the first of the two qiblas,  and it is important to us as Muslims. We do not want to see  Jerusalem remain in non-Islamic or non-Arab hands. [end  recording]    For his part, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state for  foreign affairs, said:    [Begin al-Hasan recording] I would like to point out the  good  and fraternal relations between Jordan and Qatar. These  relations are long-standing and are developing, praise be to  God. His Majesty King Husayn and his brother His Highness  Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani have been eager to bolster  these relations in various fields and on various levels.  Undoubtedly, the visit of my brother and friend Qatari Foreign  Minister Shaykh Hamad Al Thani to his country and kinsfolk in  Jordan will bolster and develop these relations. The visit will  surely lead to a qualitative shift concerning the implementation  of all agreements and protocols annexed to them, which  undoubtedly will foster fraternal relations. This is not  restricted to the bilateral field. The visit of his excellency  the minister will constitute a shift toward bolstering Arab  ranks and Arab solidarity, which we hope to be in its best  shape, God willing. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Taking stock of the in-store format - A US investment house is backing WEW's expansion plans. This month's change of title by Amber Day Holdings to WEW Group - named after the discount retailer's chain of stores, What Everyone Wants - was billed as marking 'a clear separation with the past'. That aspiration was all too understandable. The Glasgow-based company has recently been dogged by boardroom turmoil - with three chairmen in the last 16 months - and in November Pounds 9m of provisions and write-offs left the balance sheet sadly depleted. However, WEW might at last be entering a period of greater stability. A placing and Pounds 15.5m rights issue last month allowed Warburg Pincus, the US investment institution, to raise its stake in the group from 17 per cent to 25 per cent. The US investment house, which likes to take long-term positions, is backing the group's aim to double the number of WEW stores to about 125 over the next five years in the process of expanding across the whole country from its current strongholds in Scotland, the north of England and the Midlands. Mr Peter Carr, who took over as executive chairman in August, is confident that WEW's distinctive formula can turn it into the leading national discount department store chain, but accepts that rebuilding credibility with investors will be a long haul. He says: 'The six new stores opened since August are trading 30 per cent ahead of budget and I am convinced we have a great opportunity to go for.' WEW's stores - which mainly sell clothing - are fairly large, averaging 15,000 sq ft, and are aimed at the less prosperous demographic groups C2DE, which represent 63 per cent of the UK population. However, the group's limited regional penetration means it is currently available to only 29 per cent of that target customer base. Mr Carr says: 'I would like to open 20 stores within the M25.' Analysts continue to be impressed by the underlying WEW business, which has an operating margin of 8.7 per cent. Mr Carr believes sales are too low at Pounds 149 per square foot - and hopes to get up to Pounds 180. One route would be by greater use of in-store concessions - a familiar feature of the department store format which the new management team favours. A licensee selling costume and gold jewellery did well before Christmas and there are similar plans to introduce concessions selling luggage and men's suits across the group. Warburg Pincus is backing the new management team of Mr Carr and Mr Keith Paskins, finance director. They are both experienced retailers, having worked together with Galerias Preciados in Spain and before that with Debenhams. Mr Carr concedes things are very different in WEW from the disciplines he was used to as part of a larger group. He says: 'There was no proper business plan or budget. We are doing the first proper inventory this month. We've got a lot of dud stock - we know that, but we don't know how much.' The group has now installed a 'very basic' computerised stock control system, which - though well short of the advanced electronic point of sales techniques used by other retailers - should give much more financial information. Mr Paskins said: 'The financial systems we inherited didn't even show the profitability of individual branches.' This lack of investment in proper systems is one reason Mr Carr is confident that WEW will prove a money-spinner. He says the discount market has moved on from the days when the company could rely on selling 'cabbage' - a rag trade term for other retailers' surplus stock, seconds and manufacturers' over-runs. By consistently stocking a broader and more comprehensive range Mr Carr believes he will be able to predict the group's needs and source more products directly from manufacturers - particularly low-cost producers overseas. Retail analysts accept that clearing out the stock position might impact on performance in the current year to July, but are still hoping for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 9m. One said: 'It seems to be a good operation, with a very beleaguered past. One problem is that we've never been able to look the same set of guys in the eye and find out what happened. We need a long run of solid trading results. But any more nasty surprises and confidence would go completely.'</p>

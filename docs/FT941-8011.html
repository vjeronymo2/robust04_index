			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / More use prepaid burial or cremation plans Over the past eight years about 100,000 people have arranged and paid for their own funerals using the services of companies which arrange everything from a choice of coffins to hymns, procession routes and headstone inscriptions. Once the fees are paid, prices are guaranteed until the services are needed. The Office of Fair Trading investigation will look into an industry which claims to offer 'peace of mind' to those who wish to plan for their funerals in advance. The four main companies providing pre-paid funeral schemes - market leader Chosen Heritage, Dignity, Golden Charter and CWS - offer a variety of plans ranging from about Pounds 750 to more than Pounds 5,000, though most customers pay between Pounds 850 and Pounds 1,200. Through two voluntary regulatory bodies, the National Association of Pre-paid Funeral Plans and the Funeral Planning Council, the companies believe they already provide many of the safeguards the OFT is looking for. Both regulatory organisations have drawn up codes of practice and demand that members hold fees in independent trust funds with separate custodian trustees. Mr Graham Williams, of Chosen Heritage, which is recommended by the charity Age Concern and claims 60 per cent of the pre-paid market, said: 'Once the fee is paid it does not matter if the funeral takes place next year or in 20 years.' Dignity, which claims to be second in the market - but will not release any figures - offers four basic plans but allows customers to specify anything they want. Dignity claims its fees are 'significantly less than the average price of a funeral'. CWS, the co-operative society, provides 25 per cent of all funeral services and does not contract out any of its services to independent funeral directors. Mr Alan Edwards, operations manager of CWS, said: 'We are one of the very few firms who do everything in-house.' Life policies offered by insurance companies can cover some of the costs of funerals, but payments are made in instalments rather than in a lump sum. The full cost of a funeral is not always guaranteed, as premiums do not rise with the prices of funerals. Mr James Duffell of Norwich Union said that some customers might prefer life assurance plans because they could pay in small monthly instalments. He welcomed the OFT's investigation: 'Since we are both (life and funeral service companies) targeting the same customers, regulation would put us on a level playing field.'</p>

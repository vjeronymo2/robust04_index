			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Manufacturers of engines subject to the inherently low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emissions requirement would submit test results or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engineering evaluation to demonstrate that the certified vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have inherently low evaporative emissions. Test procedures are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in EPA Clean Fuel Fleet program regulations (58 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11888, March 1, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For vehicles certified under chassis-based requirements, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also proposes to require evaporative emission testing using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal test procedure and standards. CARB adopted a new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emission test in August 1990 and is now in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of making improvements to its test procedure before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requesting a waiver from Federal requirements. It is unclear at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this point how closely aligned the two test procedures will be.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If CARB receives a waiver, EPA will consider the appropriateness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of allowing manufacturers to certify vehicles using CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaporative emission test. EPA and CARB specify standards of 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 2 grams per test, respectively, for vehicles between 14,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 26,000 pounds GVWR. EPA proposes to retain the 2  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> g/test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard for California vehicles. The numerical emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards proposed for heavy-duty vehicles apply equally to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification and recall testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other California standards and procedures would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unaffected by the FIP, as described above for light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles. Applicable Federal or California regulations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to apply in all aspects of control programs for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission sources, including certification, assembly line testing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and recall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Heavy-Duty Engine Rebuild Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Introduction. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Heavy-duty engines are generally operated over mileages far  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the useful life specified when the engines are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified. This is due to their high mileage accumulation rates,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high replacement costs, and overall durable designs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the engine life is often extended by one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine rebuilds. Larger diesel engines, for example those used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in line-haul trucks and transit bus applications, are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured with replaceable cylinder liners to facilitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engine rebuilding. Engines with replaceable cylinder liners can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be readily rebuilt numerous times. It is not uncommon for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines used in line-haul applications to continue operating for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many times longer than their statutory useful life. Rebuilds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typically performed by a variety of parties including fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators, small independent garages, the original engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer, and large independent assembly line operations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, there are many independent rebuilders of engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components. <FOOTCITE>113</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 113 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Heavy-duty Engine Rebuild Practices'', EPA Draft Report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Testing conducted on rebuilt engines by EPA has indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that engine rebuilding is generally well done and emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control does not usually suffer. However, EPA is concerned about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether this will continue to be the case in the future. Given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the very stringent enhanced in-use compliance program emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for HDEs being proposed and the new control technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will be applied, the in-use emissions performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuilt HDEs is unclear. There may be cost incentives to rebuild  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these engines to a non-OEM configuration which could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially increase emissions. Given that most of the actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life of some larger engines is beyond the traditional statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life, it is important to ensure that engines continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet standards even after rebuilds. Therefore, EPA is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require rebuilt engines to be subject to the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed today for new engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These requirements will apply to any 1999 and later model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year heavy-duty vehicle subject to the enhanced standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is registered in California and is equipped with an engine that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been certified to engine-based standards as opposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chassis-based standards. Vehicles certified to chassis-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards in these classes would be subject to full life I/M,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to light-duty enhanced vehicles. Both requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensure that enhanced vehicles continue to meet applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> b. Program description <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's primary concern is that HDEs meet applicable standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in use throughout their life cycle, including after engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rebuilding. To do this requires ensuring that, if vehicles are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found not to comply at any time, someone is responsible for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remedying the nonconformity. EPA proposes to require vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owners to be able to demonstrate at all times that their engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is certified to meet the emissions standards it originally met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If the engine is within its original useful life, nothing more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required. After the end of the engine's original useful  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> life, the owner would be required to obtain a useful life renewal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate showing that the engine still met its original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. Such a certificate must be issued by a party that has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brought the owner's engine to a configuration that has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously certified by EPA (certification requirements are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below). The certifier would specify a useful life  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal period on the certificate over which the certifier is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for emissions performance of the engine. Once the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified period expires, the vehicle owner would be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acquire another useful life renewal certificate before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reregistering their vehicle in California.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

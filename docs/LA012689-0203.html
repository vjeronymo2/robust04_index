			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROSSING THE LINE;  </P> <P> WHILE SERVING AS A LOMPOC GUARD, AN ANTHROPOLOGIST RECEIVES A LESSON IN A  PECULIAR PERIL OF HIS PROFESSION  </P> <P> Mark Fleisher's epiphany came during an episode of "Hill Street Blues."  </P> <P> A balding, bespectacled anthropologist at Washington State University, Fleisher  was in his eighth month of field work at the Lompoc Federal Penitentiary,  serving as a corrections officer or "hack" to study morale among other "hacks."  That day, he had spent nine hours investigating the stabbing murder of an  inmate named Juan.  </P> <P> And when he watched a violent street killing on the television cop show, he  suddenly realized he was growing bored. "Slowly it dawned on me that something  in me had changed," he said. "When I began my work at Lompoc, I was anxious  about getting involved in serious violence. Now I was afraid that Juan's death  would be my only killing. What a shame that would be."  </P> <P> Fleisher, 41, had crossed a line that many anthropologists have approached but  that few admit having crossed: He had "gone native," adopting the attitudes of  the people he was studying, to the point that his professional objectivity was  lost.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Thorny Problem  </P> <P> The possibility of going native has bedeviled anthropologists since the 1920s,  when workers in the field first began partaking of their subjects' culture. It  is a particularly thorny problem for anthropology.  </P> <P> "The method that is characteristic of anthropology, and no other science, is  participant observation," said Roy Rappoport of the University of Michigan,  president of the American Anthropological Assn.  </P> <P> "You not only observe, but to the extent that it is appropriate, you also  participate in local activities," Rappoport said. "You try to learn how to do  it as much as you can yourself. . . . What is involved here always, to some  extent, is going native. You are attempting to get an inside view of the  culture as well as an objective outside view.  </P> <P> "That is not to say that this insider's view is more or less valid than the  outsider's objective view. Both have validity, but they are different. The  important thing is that you don't get them confused."  </P> <P> "Mark was doing what any anthropologist would consider difficult field work,"  said anthropologist H. Russell Bernard of the University of Florida, who was  Fleisher's mentor during graduate school. "When you do field work in your own  culture, even if the people are radically different from anything you grew up  with, they speak the same language, watch the same television shows, and so  forth. It's difficult because you can become wrapped up in the local culture,  very much involved in people's problems. You can lose your objectivity."  </P> <P> Fleisher's flash of insight marked the start of a long, difficult process that  included three solid days of discussions with his mentor and months of  introspection. He ultimately recovered his professional demeanor and completed  his study. But along the way, he gained some unusual insights into hacks and  the men they watch over, and a fresh perspective on what has often been called  one of the most violent institutions in the federal penal system. From that,  and from the whole experience of "going native," has come his book,  "Warehousing Violence," due out in February from Sage Publications.  </P> <P> Fleisher began the prison project from a very personal approach. He had  previously done his doctoral dissertation among the Salish Indians of the  Northwest, "but my passion has always been prison studies. I spent many years  studying women who married violent men, convicts" -- studies he is continuing  now that his work at Lompoc is finished.  </P> <P> In 1985, he was hired by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to study morale problems  among correctional officers at Lompoc. He carried out the regular duties of  supervising meals, supervising inmate groups and investigating violent acts  while at the same time he studied the staff.  </P> <P> "I was learning the job and, by being a regular staff member, I had access to  channels of information that outsiders never have," he said. "For example, in  the dining hall, you are standing there watching individuals being fed, making  sure people aren't taking too many hamburgers or packages of sugar, and you  hear correctional staff talk to prisoners and resolve problems."  </P> <P> At first, only a few staff knew Fleisher's true purpose. "It was part of my  job, my skill as an anthropologist, to develop rapport. And the way to develop  rapport was by being there when the men were proving their mettle," such as  during violent incidents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Did a Good Job  </P> <P> "After I developed rapport, then I told them why I was there," he said. In  general, he said, other hacks seemed to accept him because he was doing a good  job and he kept his head in emergencies.  </P> <P> "You're in an intimate relationship with these people where, indeed, what they  say about violence and danger is true: You've got to trust the people you are  around. And you begin to trust them, you begin to like them, to rely on them,  and you begin to identify," he said.  </P> <P> "I began to think of myself as a correctional worker. . . . I began to answer  my own research questions, as if I were a correctional worker. 'I work here.  I've been trained. I have to deal with thugs, too. Why isn't my opinion as good  as theirs?'  </P> <P> "I defended the bureau to my neighbors and friends. I found myself becoming  more aggressive with impolite convicts and, more than once, I caught myself  giving them etiquette lessons."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Exploded' in Anger  </P> <P> In one incident that particularly sticks in his mind, he "exploded" in anger at  a convict who had startled him in his office, then subjected him to verbal  abuse. "I should have paid attention to what he was saying, but instead I took  it personally. . . . That was really outside my role as a researcher."  </P> <P> And "somewhere along the way," he said, "I had gotten hooked on prison  violence. That day (the day Juan was killed), March 6, 1986, a human being, a  real person, was violently stabbed to death. I got to the scene just minutes  after it happened . . . and I didn't care a bit about him."  </P> <P> Surprisingly, the killing -- called an "incident" in Bureau of Prisons parlance  -- "brought on Christmas-like joy in the prison," he said. "Moods were almost  playful, as if someone had hung out a huge sign, reading: 'OK, everybody can  take it easy for a while. We've had our killing for this month. No one else  will die. . . .' This incident was terrific. It was my first killing, after  all, and that is something that no one easily forgets."  </P> <P> Shortly after Juan died, Bernard came to Lompoc for a social visit and Fleisher  started talking about his work. "He said, 'Hold on, wait, hold it!,' " Fleisher  said. "'This is not your job. Your job is to play the role, but remain  separate. . . . Your job is not to believe what people say. Your job is to  listen to what people say, and then to do the research to see the difference  between what people say and what they do.' "  </P> <P> Bernard recalled: "When I found Mark, he was so much a sworn correctional  officer that he was viewing the world from the perspective of a hack. It was  threatening his ability to do the job."  </P> <P> The pair spent three days talking through what Fleisher had learned. "I kept  reminding him of his mission, his primary goal -- to understand and report  accurately. . . . We went over all his notes and extracted places where he had  gone over the line. By the end of three days, I was confident that we had  pretty much solved the problem," Bernard said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Clearer' Look  </P> <P> After Bernard left, "I went back into the institution and things started  looking a little clearer to me," Fleisher said. "But it took a while to  distance myself."  </P> <P> Fleisher also began writing about his experiences and that helped.  </P> <P> "It's the classic problem (faced by) the field worker in anthropology. You go  native. You think you are one. But you're not one. On the positive side,  however, what I saw, what I felt, what I experienced, gives me insight into the  operation of these places, and how men deal with each other, and how men feel  about prison life and all these things most researchers don't have. Because no  anthropologist has done this kind of project before. And damn few sociologists  and criminologists have this kind of experience."  </P> <P> But his conclusions about prison life and Lompoc can be summarized quickly.  </P> <P> "When I went into Lompoc, I was told (by colleagues and friends) that it was a  violent, violent place -- one of the most violent penitentiaries in the federal  prison system. As it turns out, it was the least violent. . . . What you find  is that, in the world of penitentiaries, people always say that they are more  violent and vile than they are. It's part of the folklore of the place."  </P> <P> Fleisher's conclusions are confirmed by Lompoc warden Richard Rison, who called  Fleisher "an extremely perceptive observer." Rison noted that Lompoc had only  two serious assaults and two murders last year, even though 98% of the inmates  are there because they committed violent crimes against people. The average  sentence at Lompoc, Rison noted, is 20 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Risk Losing Jobs  </P> <P> Lompoc is not violent, Fleisher said, because most of the inmates are working  in prison industries and making good incomes, averaging $200 per month and  going as high as $500 with overtime. They risk losing those jobs if they commit  violent acts.  </P> <P> And the morale problem among the hacks? It turned out, Fleisher said, that the  bureau thought they had a morale problem because of a high turnover rate among  the correctional officers, but what they really had, his report to the bureau  noted, was an error in the way they calculated turnover.  </P> <P> "They really didn't have much of a morale problem," he concluded. "I can assure  you that guys who drive buses in Los Angeles live with a great deal more stress  than most guys who work on a correctional staff."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Daniel Kwan, recently in Taipei] </F>   [Text] The separatist tendency within Taiwan's leadership  is far more dangerous to cross-strait relations than the Qiandao  Lake murders, according to former premier Hau Pei-tsun. Mr Hau,  vice-chairman of the Kuomintang (KMT), lamented the decline of  the ruling party and expressed worry that the KMT might lose to  the opposition Democratic Progressive Party in the 1996  presidential election if its leadership failed to "wake up and  face up to" its problems.    In an interview with Hong Kong journalists, the former  premier said the separatist arguments expressed by individual  political leaders in Taiwan hurt cross-strait relations more  than the Qiandao Lake murders. The murders, when three  mainlanders killed 24 Taiwanese tourists on board a pleasure  boat in the Qiandao Lake in Zhejiang Province in March, at one  point almost brought Taiwan- mainland exchanges to a standstill.    Although Mr Hau did not identify the political leaders,  political analysts said he was referring to President Li  Teng-hui who caused an uproar in the island last month when he  described the KMT as a "foreign regime" and compared his  government in Taiwan with those of Moses leading the Israelites  out of Egypt in an interview with Japanese writer Ryotaro Shiba.    When asked to comment on Mr Li's remarks, Mr Hau said: "Oh!  All I can say is that I can hardly understand. I can't agree  with this kind of talk. But I am not in power and I take no  responsibility. These (arguments) are the most important reason  behind the present poor relationship between the mainland and  Taiwan," he said. "They are even far more harmful than the  Qiandao Lake incident," he added.    The former premier, who stepped down last year, also greatly  disapproved of the rise of the so-called "strongman-like  politics" in the KMT and did not hide his frustration in the  interview that the KMT was no longer the same political party  founded by the national father Dr Sun Yat-sen a century ago.    Instead, it was the New Party -- a spin-off from the KMT  last  year -- that could truly claim to be the real KMT, he said. "In  reality, it is the New Party which represents the traditional  value of the KMT... But I can't join the New Party, as a real  KMT, (I believe) one must stay in the party and try to do  something to reform the party," he said. "The problem we (KMT)  face today is that we can't find a consensus within the party.  This is very unhealthy and this struggle for (political) power  got mixed with the lust for (personal) gains. This is a  fundamental problem facing the KMT today and we need to look  into it seriously," he said. And Mr Li, who is the KMT  chairman, could not deny responsibility for the present poor  shape of the party, Mr Hau said.    Although the former premier said he was optimistic Taiwan  and  the mainland would eventually be reunited, he made it clear  Taipei could not accept the "one-country-two-system" formula  suggested by Beijing. Instead of bullying Taiwan, Beijing  should resume political reform and democratisation before both  sides could engage in meaningful discussions on reunification.    But Mr Hau said both Taiwan and the mainland must first  accept the principles of "one China, (reunification) through  peaceful and democratic means" as the "basis for negotiation."  "In my view, cross-strait relations can improve gradually if we  (can accept) these principles."</p>

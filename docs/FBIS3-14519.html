Commenting on this, JANA's international affairs editor says:  The Great Jamahiriyah is the one that adopted the initiative and  all the measures for the trial of the two suspects, the latest  of which was when it called for the trial of the two suspects  before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, and the  implementation of the Montreal convention.    However, the western governments do not want such a trial  because the two suspects are Libyans who have no case to answer,  they are not accused of anything specific, and there is no  evidence against them. If they are tried in accordance with the  law, the West will be exposed and the fallacy of their evidence  will be confirmed.    The editor concludes: All the suggestions put forward by  Libya in this respect are specific and practical suggestions.</p>

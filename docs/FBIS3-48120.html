			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Antonio Kamiya] </F>   [Text] Washington, Jan. 23 KYODO -- Officials in charge  of drafting a so-called "framework" trade accord in time for the  upcoming U.S.-Japan summit met for the first time Sunday [23  January] and left the biggest bone of contention -- how to  measure "tangible progress" on foreign access to Japanese  markets -- virtually untouched.    Japanese officials who attended the day's two separate  sessions later told reporters that they had decided to leave the  contentious issue of objective criteria for negotiations at a  plenary subcabinet session beginning Monday.    Senior officials from Japan's foreign and trade ministries  met behind closed doors for five and half hours Sunday with a  U.S. counterpart -- deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene  Barshevsky -- to address two areas in the wide-ranging framework  trade talks. One area concerns ways to increase foreign access  and sales in Japan's government procurements, and the other  seeks to address U.S. concern on the implementation of existing  bilateral trade agreements.    Japanese officials said talks on how to monitor the  implementation of existing trade accords on such market sectors  as semiconductor, paper and glass drew little dissent from both  sides.    After a two-hour meeting that was described as "friendly and  lively" between Japan's Vice Minister for International Trade  and Industry Sozaburo Okamatsu and Barshevsky, the two sides  struck an agreement on how to monitor past trade accords,  Japanese officials said.    The two sides agreed on three principles -- "objective  description of the situation," stating "different positions in a  balanced manner," and mutual efforts "to resolving any factual  misunderstanding" -- as the basis for keeping track of existing  trade pacts, the officials said.    Japanese officials, however, conceded that there was little  attempt in a separate set of talks Sunday between Deputy Foreign  Minister Koichiro Matsuura and Barshevsky to bridge the gap on  ways to set up "objective criteria" for measuring foreign access  to Japan's government procurement market.    "We will talk about it at the plenary session tomorrow," a  Japanese official said, noting that the issue of objective  criteria is also linked to separate negotiations on foreign  access to Japan's automobile and insurance markets.    Senior U.S. officials have said the framework trade talks  must produce "tangible progress" in foreign access to Japanese  markets, and have suggested using import levels in other  industrial countries as yardsticks for gauging the openness of  the Japanese markets.    Tokyo has balked at the idea, arguing that market shares, or  any measurements that "smack" of market-share arrangements, run  counter to free trade.    Japanese officials Sunday sought to draw the line on what  type of "objective criteria" is acceptable to Tokyo, saying that  the Japanese Government would not mind using past economic data  -- such as the value of imports in specific market sectors -- as  indicators of progress in foreign access to Japanese markets.    "Anything that suggests a future target is out of the  question," said a senior Japanese official, who spoke on  condition of anonymity.    The Japanese and U.S. principals involved in negotiations on  the government procurement, auto, and insurance market sectors  are supposed to complete a progress report on their talks by the  time Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton  meet in Washington on February 11.    U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen has warned Tokyo that  the U.S. Government would rather junk the framework talks rather  than accept "any cosmetic agreement."    "If we do not have credible agreements by the time of the  (February 11) summit, we would have to reexamine the basis of  the framework," Bentsen told reporters on Sunday after a short  visit to Tokyo.</p>

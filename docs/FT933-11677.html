			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Flying Flowers gets Pounds 11.8m tag FLYING FLOWERS, the nation's sole flowers-by-post business, is hoping sunny City conditions for flotations will cheer its listing. The company's unsentimental institutional backers will be relying more on perennial sunshine in the hearts of lovers, as well as prickings of filial guilt on Mothers' Day and at Christmas, to keep up sales of the polystyrene boxes of blooms at Pounds 8.99 a go. The Pounds 4.08m placing of 6.29m shares, of which 3.94m are being sold for the company's main shareholder, is sponsored by Townsley. The shares are being placed at 65p each to value the company at Pounds 11.8m. Dealings are expected to begin on August 2. Flying Flowers has turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3,000 and turnover of Pounds 2.7m in calender 1990, into a pre-tax profit of Pounds 533,000 and turnover of Pounds 5.36m in 1992. It is forecasting a 76 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to at least Pounds 940,000 this year, after interim profits of Pounds 312,000. That gives a prospective multiple at the placing price of 14.73. The notional yield is 2 per cent, covered 3.2 times. After the placing, directors and their family interests will account for 63.13 per cent of the enlarged share capital and have given undertakings not to dispose of any shares before the year's results are published, without the consent of Townsley. Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, said about Pounds 2.5m of the money will go to Hillcrest Investments, the company's majority shareholder, which is owned by family trusts of Mr Jim Evans, a non-executive director. Hillcrest will realise 39.5 per cent of its investment in Flying Flowers leaving it with 33.2 per cent of the issued share capital. The Pounds 1.07m net remainder will enable the company virtually to eliminate its Pounds 1.25m debt and allow for expansion in the UK and almost certainly into continental Europe too. Mr Goldsmith said: 'Apart from the fact that we still have a lot of growth in the UK market, we are exploring the logistics of offering the Flying Flowers service to other European countries.' He said the only constraint was arrangements with national postal authorities. The company would 'probably' move into France this year or next, with only marketing investment necessary for the move. Mr Goldsmith, previously chairman of the Food from Britain quango, believes Flying Flowers is the first non-financial services Jersey-based company to seek a listing. The company's 17-acre Jersey Flower Centre grows about 5m flowers a year, 80 per cent of which are carnations. Flying Flowers takes about Pounds 30,000 a week from tourist visitors who also join its 300,000-strong marketing database. The company employs an average of 90 people a week.</p>

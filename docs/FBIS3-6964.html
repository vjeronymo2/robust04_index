The deputy head of the International Liaison Department of  the Chinese Communist Party, Zhu Shanqing, told YONHAP in an  interview: "China abstained from voting when the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) passed a resolution on North Korea  and this is China's latest position. But the North Korean  nuclear problem should be resolved by continuous dialogue  between South and North Korea, and between the IAEA and North  Korea."    Zhu, who arrived here on March 16 at the invitation of the  ruling Democratic Liberal Party, appeared to be hinting that he  opposes sanctions against Pyongyang.    Asked whether Chinese President Jiang Zemin will come to  Seoul, he said, "Jiang will certainly visit Seoul. Since this  is an important matter, Jiang and President Kim Yong-sam will  consult on it when they meet in Beijing next week."    President Kim's visit to China will help strengthen  bilateral  ties remarkably, Zhu said, adding that the planned trip by DLP  Secretary-General Mun Chong-su to Beijing will help improve  relations and mutual understanding between the DLP and the  Chinese Communist Party.    "This visit to Seoul was very helpful and I found many  common  aspects in politics, economics and culture between the two  countries," he said.</p>

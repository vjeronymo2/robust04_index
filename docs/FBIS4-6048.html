			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Romesh Chandra,  honorary president of the World Peace Council [WPC], in an  interview with the KCNA correspondent in India on April 9 said  that the grave danger of nuclear war created by the United  States on the Korean peninsula is a serious challenge to the  Korean people and peaceloving forces of the world desirous of  peace on the Korean peninsula and its reunification.    In order to achieve peace on the Korean peninsula and its  reunification, he stated, the United States must discard its  anachronistic policy of stifling the DPRK and approach the  DPRK-USA talks with sincerity.    It must, above all, withdraw its nuclear and other mass  destruction weapons and troops from South Korea and stop all the  war games, he said, adding:    Korea must be reunified by founding the democratic  confederal  republic of Koryo according to the "10-point Programme of the  Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the  Country" advanced by the great leader His Excellency President  Kim Il-song.</p>

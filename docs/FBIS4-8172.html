			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by A.K.K.: "Finances of Privatization; How Much for </F> the Treasury"]    [Text] In line with preliminary calculations from the  Finance Ministry, last year's privatization yielded 7.8037  trillion zlotys [Z]. The share of capital privatization--that  is, the sale of stocks and shares of the Treasury--was Z4,8312  billion; the liquidation privatization--that is, the sale of  liquidated companies or parts of their property--was Z1.2199  trillion.    This means that the privatization of state-run enterprises  and banks did not yield the expected revenues: It was expected  in the 1993 budget that privatization revenues would equal Z8.8  trillion. This sum was supposed to be obtained from all sorts  of privatization--that is, capital and liquidation  privatization; this means that not only the Ownership  Transformations Ministry was supposed to work to achieve it, but  also other ministries that supervise privatization as well as  other founding organs--first of all, voivods.    If one wanted to find out what the real privatization  revenues are, one would have to take into account not only the  budget's revenues obtained from privatization, but also costs  incurred because of that. The results concerning all of 1993  have not yet been prepared. In a brochure published by the  Polish Economic Society, the authors Danuta Milczewska, Jacek  Partyka, and Marianna Strzyzewska, using data from the beginning  of privatization until the third quarter of last year, say that  capital privatization yielded Z9.456 trillion for the  state--that is, 64 percent of all privatization revenues. In  that sum, foreign investors' contribution was Z5.541 billion.    At that time, on the basis of Article 19 of the Law on State  Enterprises, 191 enterprises were liquidated, yielding Z592  billion for the state; this means that, on average, one  state-owned enterprise that was liquidated in this way was  handed over to a private owner for Z3.1 billion. The revenues  from the liquidation carried out on the basis of the  privatization law--the liquidation of enterprises that were in  better financial condition (there were 691 such cases)--came to  Z4.575 billion. That means that one firm was sold for an average  Z6.6 billion.    Since the privatization process began, the share of revenues  derived from liquidation carried out on the basis of the  privatization law--that is, voluntary privatization, not  privatization forced by a poor financial-economic situation--has  been 88 percent. At the same time, however, the number of weak  enterprises has recently been growing faster than the number of  companies that voluntarily chose the privatization path. Toward  the end of September, there were 1,095 of the former and 723 of  the latter.    This means that the state will not only have smaller  revenues  from the liquidation of enterprises (smaller direct revenues  plus overdue payments to the budget) but also that the property  will not be managed very efficiently. (After bankruptcy  liquidation, the property is most frequently sold separately,  less often, sold as a whole; after liquidation for the purpose  of privatization, a given enterprise is most often leased or  sold.)    The costs that accompany ownership transformations are,  among  others, outlays for sector research, notary fees, remuneration  for consulting companies, advertising costs, and commissions  paid to banks for the sale of shares. In 1992, outlays for  privatization were set in the Budget Law for Z263 billion plus 4  percent of the revenues from capital privatization. In all,  Z365.8 billion, or 7.6 percent in comparison with all  privatization revenues, was spent for this purpose. In the 1993  Budget Law, outlays were set at the level of Z320 billion plus 4  percent of the revenues from capital privatization. That means  that the outlays should not have been greater than Z594 billion.</p>

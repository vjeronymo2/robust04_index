A tourist coach returning from Turkey arrived at the Roszke  (Hungarian-Yugoslav) border station on Wednesday [9 March]  afternoon. In the course of a routine inspection, Hungarian  customs officers discovered a secret compartment under the back  stairs containing 136 bags of heroin, each weighing about  530-550 grams -- a total of 73.15 kg.    The coach had been hired from a travel agency by a  29-year-old Budapest resident. There were two drivers, but only  one of them, a 25-year-old man from Budapest, allegedly knew  about the hidden drugs. The smugglers allegedly agreed with the  owner of the bus to transport the heroin into Hungary for 600  German marks per kilogram. The owner is said to have been  present during the loading of the drugs but he has not been  located, as he apparently returned to Hungary by plane.    Neither the identity of the owner nor the final destination  of the heroin is known by the police. A Turkish travel agency  manager is also suspected of being involved, but his role has  not been clarified yet.</p>

Hamid Gul: "Kashmir Is the Main Reason for </F> the Pakistan Army"]    [Text] When the independence movement started in Kashmir in  1990, India was not aware of its intensity, breadth, and depth.  It did not have any idea about how it was going to spread and  how strong it was going to become. Therefore, as the intensity  of this movement began to surface, the daze felt by the Indian  government and its various agencies began to show. We wanted to  let India know that we are not only able to defend ourselves but  also are able to take the war inside the enemy's territory.  Thus, India has begun to understand that Pakistan wanted to  resolve the Kashmir issue by the strength of its arms. Prime  Minister Benazir Bhutto visited Muzaffarabad during those days  and expressed her support for Kashmir's freedom struggle. She  even said that her blood was going to join with the blood of  Kashmiri people. The Indian policy-makers concluded that the  government of Pakistan was ready to make a firm effort.    Robert Gates, director of the CIA, visited India and  Pakistan  during this time. He said that clouds of war were hovering here  and there was the danger of a nuclear war. There was not really  a clear danger of a war at that time, however, the United States  was afraid that if a war was started and nuclear weapons were  used, its vision of new world order would get a jolt. If we look  at the background of these incidents, we have to agree that 1990  was a very good year for the Kashmir movement. We not only  showed our strong allegiance to this struggle for freedom, but  also succeeded in making the Indian government aware of how much  sacrifice we were willing to make for this goal. The freedom  fighters were working for the independence movement with full  ardor, although a large number of them were getting killed.  Still, the speed of the independence movement was fairly good.  The most important accomplishment of the movement for  independence was the destruction of India's communication  system. Its information and intelligence system was totally  destroyed, and the government system was forced to cooperate  with the freedom fighters.  <H5>  Foreign Pressure and the Nuclear Program </H5>   The year 1991 did not prove to be better for the  independence  movement because a cap was put on our nuclear program. India was  worried by our nuclear program and its fear was reduced. It is  obvious that when India learned that Pakistan has stopped work  on its nuclear program, it started a new strategy.    It is proper here to briefly define three terms used in the  context of the Pakistani nuclear program:    A. Freezing--It means keeping the technology related to  nuclear weapon where it is now and not making any progress.    B. Capping --It means stopping enrichment of uranium.    C. Roll Back--It means destroying materials already  prepared and ending the capability to make weapons.    Unfortunately, many political circles and persons admitted  to  putting a cap on the program. I oppose this as none of these  political parties had received a mandate from the people. None  of the parties had this included in their manifestos. Instead,  all of them had promised protection of the nuclear program in  their manifestos. However, they did not follow this after they  got power and have admitted putting a cap on the program  themselves. Why did they do that? Who gave them this right? If  they supported democracy then why did they turn away from the  mandate the people had given them? The people did not give them  the permission. All of them admitted that they did it under  foreign pressure.    Actually, the international powers had understood that they  could control the impending war. They put on pressure which was  accepted. India began to get signals in 1991 that we were not  ready to go to war over the Kashmir issue. It was communicated  by various means that Pakistan did not want to take the risk of  a war over Kashmir. Governments make decision over national  issues after a lot of thought as to what they should do and what  they should not. It was not correct to give India the indication  that we could not go to war. As the result of it, India moved  its troops from other fronts and sent them to Kashmir. India  could not have done this from a military perspective. It should  not have taken a position which is termed as a military  imbalance. It did that only after it got hints from Pakistan and  then caused this military imbalance. India was obviously aware  of our weakness ,that is why it moved 550,000 troops to Kashmir.  In my opinion this happened because of our weak policy. These  550,000 troops were brought into the valley against 3.5 million  people in Kashmir.    One other result of our weak policy was that the young men  who had come to Pakistan in 1990 after listening to Madam  Benazir Bhutto's speech faced additional problems. The  government of Pakistan did not provide them full support, and  this gave them the wrong impression. As the result of this the  movement did not spread outside the valley or at least did not  spread as much as it should have. In Jammu, except for in  Mayurdoda, the movement did not make much progress. The pressure  that should have been put on India was not there. The people of  Poonch and other hill regions known for their military character  did not join the movement. Our flaw was that we could not give a  full message to Kashmiri people as to what we could do for them  and how much we could help them. On the other hand, India gave  them the message in an atrocious manner that no one could  protect them from the bayonets of its soldiers and that their  cries could not impress anyone. What affect was there on India  of our making noise against its atrocities? Four years have  passed, India has given permission neither to human rights  organizations nor to Amnesty International to visit Kashmir. It  did not allow any press reporter, either. Had Pakistan done  that, it would have been in a major crisis. Still, Pakistan did  not do anything and it was threatened with being called a  terrorist state.  <H5>  False Threats About Labeling Pakistan a Terrorist Nation </H5>   As for the affair about the threat of being labeled a  terrorist nation, I have said repeatedly these were fake  threats. They could never declare us a terrorist nation. First,  they had to declare the Kashmiri people's freedom fight a  terrorist action. They cannot do that because the Kashmiri  freedom struggle is a valid movement from political, moral, and  legal perspectives. All the laws in the world, and the UN rules  and regulations declare it a valid freedom struggle. On the  other hand, it is the Indian government that was involved in  terrorism. Its armed forces can be called terrorists for their  actions.    The people of Kashmir and the freedom fighters there are  organizing their movement according to old and new laws in the  world. They are struggling in their own region in a very civil  manner. They did not blast any bomb in Indian territory.  Contrary to it, India is terrorizing them in their own land. The  people and the freedom fighters are peaceful. Their peacefulness  is evident by the fact that they do not kidnap the women and  children of their enemies. They do not burn them alive or  amputate their hands and feet. In addition, the whole  nation--the whole population--is with them. Did it ever happen  that the whole population joined the terrorists?    The false threat of terrorism ended. It had to end one day.  I  do not know why were we afraid of it? However, we wasted a lot  of time because of the fear of being labeled a terrorist nation.  We did not do what we should have because of baseless fears.  Many important things could not be done. That caused many  problems and complexities. One of the biggest problem is that  India, instead of accepting any demand, is once again trying to  give the impression to the Kashmiri people that neither they nor  Pakistan will find safety by internationalizing the issue. They  have to accept Indian rule in the end. Now, India wants them to  accept its two conditions. First, to accept the Line of Control  as the border. Second, you will get whatever you ask for if you  remain within the Indian Union. However, the Kashmiris know that  India did not fulfill its promises to them in the past. It  forgot the UN resolutions as well as the promises that it made  to the Kashmiris under Article 370. It had promised them their  own prime minister, their own president, and their own flag. It  tore these promises to shreds. India deceived Sheikh Abdullah  with promises of friendship and then put him in a jail where he  wasted many years. It is obvious that Kashmiris cannot trust  India over anything, and Indian strategy cannot be successful  now.    It is clear that under international pressure India will  have  to accept the fact that the Kashmiris will not stay with it any  longer. Even the secular forces in the West are worried that the  Kashmir region might become the center of an international  Islamic struggle, and this dispute over land might change into a  question of religion. They are especially worried about the  Afghan Muslims coming this way after taking care of their own  problems, and the spread of a desire among the Pakistani youth  to fight for Kashmir. They are worried that the Muslims from all  over the world might gather in Kashmir.    I am sure that the Muslims will come here if we invoke  jihad.  If Bin Baz, the chief justice of Saudi Arabia, can issue fatwa  [edict] against Afghanistan's Rashid Dostam, it is possible that  seeing the brutalities being committed on Kashmiris, he issues a  fatwa for jihad here. Then Muslims from all over the world can  be asked to participate in this jihad. India will be forced to  accept some of our demands. We have to see what demands it will  accept.  <H5>  The Third Option </H5>   The idea of a third option is being floated around in the  West. They are saying with great zeal that India also agrees to  the third option. In my opinion, this third option is premature  at this time. India has first to accept that Kashmir is a  disputed region. It is necessary that the Kashmiri people agree  on one strategy. They must be united on the demand to be free  from Indian occupation and have an ideal government. When India  is willing to leave Kashmir, then we can discuss another option.  In my personal opinion, the people who talk about the third  option are tearing up the UN resolutions. After it, getting a  new resolution introduced and passed in the United Nations that  is according to the wishes of Kashmiri people will be analogous  to harnessing a lion. We should neither be deceived by the  tricks played by any superpower, nor should we play any tricks  ourselves. Those who say that it is important to use the third  option in order to get Western support are wrong. First, it is  contrary to Islamic principles to use deceit instead of talking  openly. Even if we grant that the United States is honest with  us and will be successful in liberating Kashmir, it still cannot  be successful is liberating the whole of Kashmir or pressure  India to do so.    The United States can neither do this nor it will want to  regardless of its personal or strategic interests. The reason is  that all U.S. policies comply with Israel, and Israel considers  India its favorite nation. Both these countries have mutual  defense pacts which include agreement to transfer technology.  Therefore, Israel considers India a very important country for  its own goals.    If we work on the third option, the most we can achieve is  freedom of the valley. The region of Jammu that is on this side  of the Chenab will not be freed. Similarly, the people in Ladakh  do not agree with the third option. It is not easy for India to  give independence to Kashmir under the third option because it  will have to give the option of independence to hundreds of  states that were included in India according to the partition  formula. It took over Hyderabad and Junagarh forcibly by  organized military attacks. Now, if the third option is approved  then the states that were forcibly included in India cannot be  stopped from leaving India. The whole formula used for the  partition will be voided. India will be even more affected by it  as 15 separatist movements are already going on there.  <H5>  ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] Meeting Should Be </H5> Called    Now the question is how to rectify the old mistakes and form  an appropriate policy for the future. What immediate steps  should be taken to really help the present Kashmir movement? In  my opinion, the meeting of the ICO should be called immediately.  This is not just Pakistan's problem; this is an international  issue. We have seen the role the UN played in Bosnia. The United  Nations is not able to play a role for the Muslims. It is futile  to have any hope from the present UN leadership. Therefore,  looking up to the United Nations would be useless. This will  give India more time to take atrocious actions against the  independence movement.    Similarly, negotiations under the Shimla Pact have also  proved useless. The reason is that the Shimla Pact does not  offer any basis for resolving the Kashmir issue. The pact is 22  years old and no talks were held on the Kashmir issue under it.  Instead, this dispute can be resolved only if we hold a  plebiscite within this framework. However, is the UN Security  Council willing to take the initiative to hold a plebiscite  according to its own resolutions? Not at all. Instead,  Boutros-Ghali is talking about negotiations. The United Nations  pays his salary to implement those resolutions. Therefore, at  present the only viable course is to call the meeting of the  ICO. I say that the United Nations and the Shimla Pact have  failed in stopping the bloodshed in Kashmir. The emergency  meeting of the ICO should be of the same nature as the one  called in Islamabad after the Soviet attack on Afghanistan. The  United States seems to be changing its thinking and will not  have any objection to the calling of an ICO meeting. Iran had  presented a resolution on Afghanistan. It would be better if  another country proposes a resolution this time again.  <H5>  Ideological Consensus </H5>   Factionalism and political unrest in Pakistan can be  detrimental to the Kashmir movement. It is an encouraging  development that the whole nation had united on 5 February and  had told India that we are all united over the Kashmir issue and  we will not allow India to shed our brothers' blood. However,  the tug-of-war for power among the political parties again and  again takes us away from the real issue. It is unfortunate that  during the recent election, motorways and yellow cabs were made  important issues, but Kashmir, on which our fate is hanging, was  not made an election issue by any political party. If the  present feeling persists among the people, we will keep drifting  away from Kashmir. At present, it is important to assure all  Kashmiris that all Pakistani people are with them with all their  means.    It is extremely important for the Kashmiri people to develop  ideological and philosophical consensus among themselves. They  should understand it well that whenever any talks are started to  move away from the UN resolutions, it will lead to the danger of  division of Kashmir. If India can accept anything, then it is  the division of Kashmir. As for divisions, India might have to  implement this idea on itself. There are 160 million Muslims in  India [as published] and India must give them a separate land  for them to live on. This will lead to a division like that we  saw in Yugoslavia and this will not be an ideological issue.  Then we can ask India: If a few hundred thousand Dogras  [Pandits] cannot live with the Muslims, how can you expect 160  million Muslims to live with the Hindus in India? If Hundreds of  thousands of Hindus can live with dignity in Pakistan, why not  the Dogras? In my opinion, India will be obliterated one day and  Kashmir will become independent. When Khalistan is established,  where will these Dogras go? It will be atrocious if they are cut  off both from India and Kashmir. They will have no place to go.  Therefore, the Dogras should take full part in Kashmir's  struggle for independence.    Another question that is raised is: If Kashmir is taken out  of India following the UN resolutions, what kind of relationship  will it have with Pakistan? I do not think it is a major issue.  It would be better if Kashmir makes some agreements with  Pakistan. These agreements will be useful for Kashmir and enable  it to benefit from Pakistan. It is in Pakistan's lap  geographically. I do not think Kashmir should become another  state in Pakistan. it will not be appropriate. It will not be  safe from Pakistani administrative drawbacks, and it will not  have the guarantees to protect its political, geographical, and  economic identities for which it is fighting the jihad now.    The way Pakistani governments have shown their weakness and  the way its people have shown their apathy have not given  encouragement to Kashmir's independence movement. We cannot  praise their courage and forbearance enough as they have kept  their struggle alive. Still, because of the change in Indian  military policy, the population in cities is facing innumerable  problems. The Indian military avenges the attacks on the people  living in the cities. There is a limit to the patience of these  people. The freedom fighters have to fight outside the cities  according to guerilla war rules and make the Indian troops pay  the price for being in cities. Instead of making noises about  India, we should console the suffering Kashmiris. India says  that it cannot free Kashmir because it will break up the nation.  However, why should the blood of Kashmiris be used to protect  India's unity? What kind of logic is this? We are not giving you  freedom because it will break up our country! If India breaks  up, let it be. India can tell us that Pakistan must be broken  into many parts. Will we accept this demand?  <H5>  What Should Be Our Policy? </H5>   Our assistance to Kashmir should be free of any weakness or  flaw. We should not worry about India attacking us and or a war  against us. India is in no position to start a war as it has a  lot of its army tied up in Kashmir. Even if it decides to attack  us, our armed forces are capable of dealing with it. We will  make this war go on while India would try to decisively defeat  us in a short period. This is not possible for India. We do not  want a nuclear war. Instead, we have to prepare our soldiers.    We are engrossed in financial profits and our nationalist  thought is limited. We have to look at the issues within the  framework of group and personal interests. The main reason for  our army's existence is defense of Kashmir because defense of  Kashmir cannot be separated from defense of Pakistan--these are  like two lives in one frame of body. The defense of Kashmir is  the combined responsibility of us all, including the armed  forces. The independence of Kashmir is our responsibility from  moral, legal, geographical, and historical perspectives. If the  Pakistani armed forces are sensitive to it, then it is according  to the natural demands. India considers Kashmir an integral part  of it without any moral or legal ground. We have thousands of  such reasons which prove that Kashmir is Pakistan's  indispensable part.    If the Pakistani government demonstrates helplessness or  carelessness in this matter, we will have to wake up Pakistan  urban centers, especially the people. If the major cities wake  up over the Kashmir issue and are prepared to sacrifice their  lives for their Kashmiri brothers, no government will be able to  be careless. We must communicate the fact that Pakistan's  existence depends on Kashmir's freedom to the people, especially  those living in cities and are progressive and support status  quo.    This is a very welcome development that there is a large  number of youth in Pakistan that are strongly opposed to the  Western imperialism. It is true that the power and technology of  the West is superior to us, however, we have one thing that can  make us proud and that is our allegiance to our faith. We can  sacrifice our lives for our religion, which the West cannot do.  Our ability to sacrifice our lives is our main strength and  protection. Those who are proud of being secular despite being  Muslims should learn from the unfortunate situation in Bosnia.  It is a must that the people of Pakistan unite over the issue of  Kashmir. If we united then the Muslims in whole South Asia  including those in India and Bangladesh will also support us  jointly. However, first we have to be united  ourselves.</p>

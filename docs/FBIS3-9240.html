			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vienna, March 21 (CTK) -- New Slovak Finance  Minister Rudolf Filkus, in an interview with the Austrian Press  Agency (APA) today, sharply criticizes the privatization process  headed by ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar.    Filkus says that the privatization process in Slovakia, from  the important instrument of economy transformation, turned into  an instrument for the concentration of political power.    It is therefore important to speed up privatization and  primarily to depolitize it, Filkus says. Millions were  squandered through the "sale" of state-owned enterprises at  funny prices to people who "guarantee" that they will support  the "leading role of the party" with their capital, Filkus says,  referring to Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).  He says these steps by Meciar's cabinet bordered on legitimacy  and that is why he, in the capacity of finance minister, intends  to investigate these operations. Filkus says he has prohibited  trading in the National Property Fund (FNM) shares and frozen  its accounts.    The Slovak state deficit currently reaches 5.174 billion  Slovak crowns (about $172 billion), Filkus says. "It is not  little, but also not much," he says, adding that a 14 billion  Slovak crown deficit can be expected by the end of the year.    The hard currency reserves in Slovakia, excluding gold,  amount to $440 million. However, Slovakia's foreign debt is  enormous -- about 60 billion Slovak crowns ($2 billion). "We  have paid more than 10 billion crowns to the National Bank in  interest only," Filkus says.    The Bratislava government should ensure its income better,  he  says, adding that it is impossible to merely cut expenditures,  any fool could do that. Besides, there is nothing to be cut in  the fields of education, health care, or culture, Filkus adds.  He says he sees state budget reserves in the better control of  income from Value Added Tax (VAT) and custom payments and in  fighting tax evasion as well.    Filkus says he wants to exert pressure on the FNM so that  profits received from privatization are used to lower the state  debt. He gave as an example the Czech Republic, where 17  billion Czech crowns (almost $0.2 billion) were allocated by the  FNM to lower the state debt.    Filkus expresses disappointment about the ineffectuality of  the 10 percent import surcharge introduced by Slovakia recently.  He says that although the import surcharge is an "absolutely  normal instrument of a market economy," whose aim is to free the  market and give domestic products a better chance to succeed, it  affects Czech goods primarily and has failed to activate the  domestic market. He criticizes Slovak producers who, instead of  trying to succeed through cheaper goods, raised the prices of  their good by the same 10 percent, in the interest of quick  profits.    Asked about the political prospects of the new government  and  the possibility of Meciar becoming premier again, Filkus says:  "It cannot happen that he will return to power for the third  time." "It would apparently be a wonder of the world," he adds.</p>

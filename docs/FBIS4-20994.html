			<p>Traffickers,   Users   <F P=102> 94WD0247A Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA in Malay 13 Feb 94 p 8 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0247A </F> <F P=104>  Kuala Lumpur UTUSAN MALAYSIA </F> <F P=105>  Malay </F> CSO     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, 12 Feb--Kerinchi Kampong [community]  is still "heaven" to drug traffickers and users, although police  have made many raids and arrests in the area.    Because drug use and trafficking in the area are sometimes  conducted openly, discontent has emerged among residents, who  worry that their children will be snared by the unhealthy  activities.    Some city residents call the community "the drug users'  kampong."    Several kampong residents say they often encounter drug  traffickers in the act of selling drugs to kampong teenagers.    Drug traffickers are also found roaming the apartment area  looking for prey and trying to entice new users so that the  drugs they sell will be in demand.    As a result, many of them use drugs on the steps of the  apartment houses without any fear, ignoring the people passing  back and forth.    A kampong resident, who did not want his name publicized,  said he once rebuked a group of teenagers using drugs on the  steps of a four-floor apartment house, but he merely incurred  their anger.    Not only that, he said, but they also dared him to report  their drug use to the police.    He added that the drug users not only gather on the  apartment  house steps, but foul the area with their vomit, urine, and  excrement.    Moreover, residents worry about the growing number of thefts  of clothing, shoes, and sandals, which they believe are stolen  by drug users.    "We want those users to be arrested immediately, before the  holidays, if possible," residents added.    Observation of the kampong by UTUSAN MALAYSIA found that  traffickers and users choose strategic places for carrying on  their activities without police interference.    The location believed to be used by them for their  activities  is somewhat hidden from public view and near a squatter kampong  in the area.    Another resident said that every night without fail there  are  teenagers who gather and cause unpleasant conditions for  residents.    "There are more of them on the nights of public holidays and  on weekends," he said.    He added that he once rebuked the behavior of the teenagers,  but five window panes and some sandals were stolen from his  house, too.    Kerinchi Kampong is the area most wanted by people looking  for rental houses because of its strategic location halfway  between Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya.    As a result, many young people rent apartment units and  squatter houses in the area.    Earlier, Second Senior Assistant Commissioner (PKP2) Hassan  Mutalip, chief of the Kuala Lumpur Criminal Investigations  Department, said that last year police conducted many raids and  arrested dozens of drug traffickers and users in the kampong.</p>

			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Doing good, despite themselves: Martin Wolf says the Gatt deal will bring benefits to almost everybody, but getting there was too difficult What will the Uruguay Round trade deal mean to the world economy? There are two answers to this question: the first is that it should be a very good thing, provided it is ratified. On balance, the agreement looks even better than sensible participants might have hoped seven years ago when the round was started in Punta del Este. The second answer is that nobody knows precisely. That analysis is impossible rarely prevents economists from attempting it, in this case at least in an excellent cause. Official studies, sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank and the Secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have estimated the increase in global economic welfare at between Dollars 213bn and Dollars 274bn in 1992 US dollars in 2002. That would be between  3/4 and 1 per cent of gross global income at that time. These estimates are almost certainly too low. The estimate of Dollars 213bn, which appeared in a joint study by the OECD and the World Bank published in May of this year, is based on the assumption of a 30 per cent across-the-board reduction of all tariffs (and input subsidies) on all commodities1. The estimate of Dollars 274bn comes from an OECD study published this autumn, which assumes a 36 per cent global reduction in tariffs and the trade-restricting effects of import barriers for both industrial and agricultural products2. The results differ from the first study, mainly because the calculations made for the latter paper included cuts in industrial non-tariff barriers. Somewhere in the middle comes a study by the Gatt Secretariat, published at the end of November 1993, which estimates an aggregate income gain of Dollars 230bn by 20053. What makes this study significant is that, unlike the others, it is based not on hypothetical liberalisation, but on offers made by trade negotiators by November 19 1993. According to the Gatt Secretariat, those offers included: An increase in the scope of bound tariffs on industrial products in developed countries (that is, tariffs which cannot subsequently be raised, except in special circumstances) from 78 to 97 per cent and in developing countries from 21 to 65 per cent. Offers of tariff reductions from developed countries covering Dollars 464bn of their industrial imports out of the total of Dollars 612bn not already duty free. A doubling, from 20 to 43 per cent, in the proportion of developed country merchandise imports entering duty free. Trade-weighted average reductions of 38 per cent in the tariffs of developed countries, from 6.4 to 4 per cent. Smaller proportionate reductions in tariffs on textiles and clothing, the most important industrial category for developing countries, at least partially offset by a commitment to abolish the multi-fibre arrangement, under which these imports are restricted by developed countries. A 36 per cent overall reduction in the tariff equivalent of agricultural barriers. Market access commitments in agriculture that would make the proportion of bound agricultural tariffs broadly the same as those for industrial goods for the first time in the Gatt's history. Offers to liberalise imports of services from 88 countries. The best estimate of the benefits should come from the Gatt study, which is based on actual rather than hypothetical offers to liberalise. But the final market access agreements have ended up both more comprehensive and more liberal than when the Gatt study was prepared a month ago. There are four, still more fundamental reasons why even the Gatt study, like the other two, underestimates the ultimate benefits of the round. First, they ignore the stimulus to trade in services, already 21 per cent of world trade; second, they do not take account of the benefits of a strengthened set of rules and procedures, culminating in the agreement to establish a World Trade Organisation; third, they assume that the status quo could have been maintained if the Uruguay Round had failed; finally, they ignore the dynamic benefits of a more competitive and integrated global economy. The last is the fundamental point. As is shown in the chart, growth of world merchandise exports has consistently led that of output. Over the whole period between 1950 and 1991, the volume of total world exports grew 12 times, while world output grew six times. More startlingly still, the volume of world exports of manufactures rose 23 times, partly because this is where trade liberalisation was concentrated, while output grew only eight times. It is impossible to prove that rapid growth of trade drove growth in output, but cross-country experience supports that presumption. The rise of the east Asian economies as a source of exports of manufactures, for example, ran alongside their exceptionally rapid increases in real incomes. This success has already made the region a third pole of world trade and world economic activity, along with North America and western Europe (see chart). Because they came to realise that a heavy tax on imports imposes a heavy tax on exports, more than 60 countries, including erstwhile convinced protectionists, announced unilateral market opening measures during the course of the Uruguay Round. According to the Gatt Secretariat, the success of the Uruguay Round might make a 12 per cent difference to the volume of world trade in 2005, increasing it by Dollars 745bn (in 1992 US dollars) over what it would be if it had continued to grow at the average achieved between 1980 and 1991. The largest increases in trade are projected to occur in clothing, textiles and agricultural products, at present the most protected areas of world trade. Assume that the relation between the expansion of trade and output that existed over the whole postwar period continues until 2005. Under the Secretariat's assumptions for trade, world exports would rise at 5 per cent a year until 2005, which would be consistent with annual output growth at 3.5 per cent, as against 2.9 per cent without the Uruguay Round trade expansion. Global economic output would then be some 8 per cent, or Dollars 2,000bn (in 1992 US dollars), higher by 2005 than it would otherwise be. This may well be an overestimate, just as the calculations further above are underestimates. But it may also be no further from the truth. The important puzzle, however, does not concern the size of the gains, but how difficult they are to achieve. In Gatt parlance, the trade liberalisation that is the source of the gain is a 'concession' to one's partners. The aim of clever negotiators is to minimise concessions, while maximising those from others. As a result, the more successful is a country in the negotiation game, the less it benefits. This is why the most peculiar aspect of the gains is their distrubution. As the chart shows, it is the European Union, Japan and European Free Trade Area countries that are expected to have the largest proportional welfare gains. How can that be? It is mainly because they are being forced to liberalise in agriculture, precisely what they have tried hardest to avoid. The Uruguay Round deal is an excellent thing, which will benefit almost all participants in the long run. But if only there were a less agonising way of persuading countries to abandon the protection that does them so much harm. 1 Trade Liberalisation: the Global Economic Implications (Paris and Washington: OECD and the World Bank, 1993); 2 Assessing the Effects of the Uruguay Round, Trade Policy Issues 2 (Paris: OECD, 1993); 3 Background paper prepared by the Gatt Secretariat (November 1993)  ----------------------------------------------------------  OECD ESTIMATES OF IMPACT OF TRADE LIBERALISATION IN 2002,                  Dollars bn 1991 prices  ---------------------------------------------------------- Country/region              OECD             World  ---------------------------------------------------------- Australia                    1.6              1.9 Canada                       5.9              6.6 EU                          78.3             71.3 EFTA                        34.2             38.4 Japan                       35.5             42.0 US                          26.3             27.6 Total OECD                 181.8            187.7 Rest of world               29.9             86.4 Total world                211.8            274.1  ---------------------------------------------------------- In assessing the effects of the Uruguay Round, the OECD has used two scenarios: firstly assuming trade liberalisation only in the OECD, and then in the entire world.

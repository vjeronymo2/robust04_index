			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MANDELA WATCH  </P> <P> Mandela, the Miniseries: Mandela fever seems to have infected even TV network  execs.  </P> <P> ABC Entertainment President Bob Iger, one of the Hollywood leaders who attended  the star-studded fund-raiser for Nelson Mandela and the African National  Congress Friday night, announced that he has green-lighted a four-hour  miniseries about the history of the anti-apartheid movement. The miniseries  would be produced by Jon Avnet and Jordan Kerner. According to Iger, it  probably won't be seen during the 1991-92 TV season. But Avnet says he's aiming  for a broadcast as soon as next May. The script by Carol Schreder ("The Burning  Bed," "A Call to Glory") spans 30 years, and will conclude with Mandela's  release from prison earlier this year. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Skandia The sale of Uni Storebrand's and Hafnia's stakes in Skandia is almost the end of the sorry Nordic saga. With Skandia's share register free of unwelcome influences, and Hafnia in the hands of Sun Alliance, all that remains is to repair Uni Storebrand's balance sheet. Since Uni bought its shares at an average price of Skr220 and has sold at less than half that, it is easy to see how the damage was done. The Norwegian institutions now being asked to plug the gap must keep a tight rein on the imperial ambitions of the company's management. All in all the episode is a reminder of just why continental European insurers trade at a discount to net assets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with "expert" Mr. Ne'matzadeh of the News </F> Research and Commentary Group by unidentified announcer; place  and date not given]    [Text] Yesterday morning, the al-Ibrahimi shrine in the  city of Hebron near Jerusalem witnessed a shattering catastrophe  in which hundreds of fasting worshipers were fired upon by  Zionists while they were praying and were made to wallow in  blood and dust.    The incident was so catastrophic that it caused a swift  eruption in the Palestinians' ranks. The Zionist regime  immediately announced a state of emergency and put the finishing  touches on the atrocity initiated by an armed Zionist by  ordering its usurping soldiers to shoot at another group of  Palestinians who had rushed to assist the wounded and they also  joined the ranks of martyrs. We asked the expert of the News  Research and Commentary Group to give us his assessment of the  political dimensions of this incident:    [Begin recording] [Announcer] Mr. Ne'matzadeh, the Zionist  regime is seeking to exonerate itself from the responsibility  for this catastrophe by attributing it to a so-called mentally  deranged or insane individual. I would like to know your  opinion in this regard.    [Ne'matzadeh] In the name of God, the compassionate, the  merciful. With salutations to our dear compatriots and  condolences on this shattering and soul searing incident, which  has plunged the entire Islamic world in grief, I wish to state  that it is natural that the Zionist regime, or any other  criminal, would not wish to accept the negative consequences of  a crime that he has committed. Therefore he resorts to blaming  others. Israel is capitalizing on this atrocity but totally  refuses to take responsibility for it. Can it be acceptable from  the legal point of view that the Zionist officials are not  responsible for this incident and its consequences?    Incidentally, the facts are contrary to the wishes of the  usurpist regime. According to international law, the convention  on prisoners of war, regulations regarding occupied areas, the  Zionist regime is basically responsible for the security of the  residents of the occupied areas which it controls. Therefore,  regardless of who has perpetrated such a crime, if the Zionist  regime is not able to ensure the security of the residents in  the occupied areas, it should either evacuate these areas  immediately and hand them over to the owners, or it should  delegate the security of the occupied areas to UN forces.    Thus, such rhetoric is unacceptable in international law,  and  incidents with such dimensions and depth cannot be blamed on a  single mentally unbalanced Zionist. In addition, the question  arises: Who armed this allegedly demented individual? In  principle, the arming of the Zionist residents in these  settlements is a policy that the Zionist soldiers are  implementing officially. It is the Zionist army that permits  them to carry weapons. In addition to giving them weapons and  permitting them to carry them about, the armed forces also  trains them to use them. Thus, it is very easy to identify who  is responsible for this incident.    Aside from this, while the al-Ibrahimi shrine is under the  stringent control of the usurper Zionist regime's soldiers, and  the fasting Palestinian worshipers passed through strict  security checks on entering, how could armed Zionists pass  through such a strict security system without any coordination  on the part of the usurper armed forces and plunge the innocent  people into blood and dust while they are praying?    Woe to their shamelessness. The Zionist regime considers  itself absolved of this crime. After this incident--which is  not considered an exceptional one in Palestine and is in  complete conformity with the usual policy of the Zionist  regime--the question that arises is: Why were the compromising  Palestinians not attacked? Why did a mentally deranged  individual not attack the team of Palestinian negotiators who  were holding talks with the Zionist regime? It is clear that  the objective was precisely predetermined. The Palestinian  people are the main elements, the backbone of the people's  uprising -- that is, the devout stratum devoted to Islam. Thus,  the targeting of the worshipers in a mosque while praying and  fasting is in complete conformity with the policy of the Zionist  regime.    The attack was aimed at the real enemy of the Zionist regime  and therefore, the mental derangement of an individual or  individuals involved is a mere fabrication on the part of  political and propaganda apparatus of the Zionist regime.    This is one of the usual ploys of the political and  propaganda apparatus of this regime. The blaze in the al-Aqsa  Mosque in 1967, the holiest mosque in Islam after the Masjid  al-Haram in Mecca and the Prophet's mosque in Medina, was also  attributed to a lunatic. Only three years ago, a large number of  Palestinian workers were massacred, and even that was attributed  to a psychotic. The character of a madman has consistently been  present in the history of the crimes of the Zionists and will  continue to be so.    What is interesting is that we should realize that the head  of the Zionist council resident in the Zionist settlement said  that the main person responsible had no psychological  aberrations or mental imbalance. If we are to assume that the  person or persons responsible did have some degree of psychosis,  then how about those who announced martial law immediately after  this shattering crime? How about those who fired bullets at the  other concerned Palestinians? How about those who shot and  martyred those who had hastened to assist the wounded and had  gathered outside the al- Khalil hospital to donate blood?    [Announcer] What objectives is the Israeli regime pursuing  by resorting to such actions and what does it hope to gain in  this manner?    [Ne'matzadeh] There are some issues the Zionist hierarchy  might have in mind. First, Israel has reaped benefits from the  Gaza-Jericho accord, and has already got what it wanted from the  accord it signed with 'Arafat at present. Political legitimacy,  international popularity, revamping of its warmongering image,  official domination over Palestinian borders, highways, roads,  settlements, internal and foreign security, security control and  all else. So what is the importance of continuing the talks on  accords? Now the time has come to once again show its true face,  which is the same one that appeals to Zionist society and  strengthens the Zionist regime's base inside Israel and at the  same time undermines its political rivals.    In addition, you witnessed that Israel has targeted the  Islamists. This is in itself a message, a threat which has the  support of the West. You have observed that no one has  condemned the Zionist regime or said that it is responsible. At  most, they just condemned the incident.    [Announcer] In your opinion, what could be the repercussions  of this incident? Is it possible that it will overshadow the  negotiations pertaining to the 'Arafat-Israel compromise and  halt this process?    [Ne'matzadeh] In my opinion, this does not seem possible.  'Arafat has burned his bridges and has passed the point of no  return. He does not see any recourse but to succumb to the  enemy. U.S. President Bill Clinton, who has sensed the danger of  the possible repercussions of this incident on the talks, has  invited the two sides, the Palestinians and the Israelis, to  continue their talks in Washington.

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Invesco MIM pulls out of unquoted investments INVESCO MIM, the fund management group, has completed its withdrawal from active unquoted company investments with the sale of Invesco Ventures to Baronsmead, an independent venture capital company. The group's retreat from unquoted investments began when Drayton Consolidated Trust, an investment trust it managed, ran into difficulties. Drayton Consolidated was wound up at the end of last year and primary responsibility for the management of a successor fund, Second Consolidated, was taken over by Foreign &amp; Colonial Ventures. Invesco paid Pounds 9.5m to investors in Drayton Consolidated after it emerged that it had breached the trust's ceiling on the concentration of funds in a single investment. Invesco Ventures, formerly known as Invesco MIM Development Capital, has a portfolio valued at about Pounds 40m comprising a pooled fund and several local authority funds. The local authority funds have geographical restrictions on where investments can be made but the purchase gives Baronsmead about Pounds 12.5m of liquid funds to invest at a time when conventional fund-raising activity is particularly difficult. The purchase represents a considerable boost for Baronsmead which has a portfolio valued at about Pounds 65m, including Pounds 25m managed on behalf of Barclays. Invesco Ventures has investments in 70 companies while Baronsmead has 50 investments. The value of the deal was not disclosed but the payment is performance related. Mr Michael Perman, Invesco company secretary, said the unquoted investments were 'profitable but marginal.' Two Invesco staff will join Baronsmead's 10-strong executive team. Mr Norman Riddell, chief executive of Invesco's European division said: 'Venture capital no longer forms part of our core activities.'</p>

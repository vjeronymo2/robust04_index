			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE DEMISE OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY TRAUMA CENTER  </P> <P> Having been a principal architect of the Emergency Medical Services of Orange  County and founding director of the trauma service at Fountain Valley Regional  Hospital and Medical Center, I have been following with concern the  deterioration of emergency medical services in Orange County and the impending  demise of the Fountain Valley Regional Trauma Center.  </P> <P> The loss of the trauma center impacts almost exclusively on relatively affluent  cities, like Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Fountain Valley, whose  population of about 400,000 is able and willing to pay for emergency medical  services.  </P> <P> The absence of Fountain Valley Regional Hospital from the Orange County trauma  system will force diversion of patients from these communities to Western  Medical Center, UCI Medical Center or even Mission Hospital Regional Medical  Center, which would require an unacceptable surface transport time, according  to national and local standards.  </P> <P> These cities have excellent paramedic coverage and are served by two base  stations at Hoag and Humana Huntington Beach hospitals.  </P> <P> It is conceivable that for the immediate future, these communities could  develop a program in which their citizens can still obtain the benefits of  trauma coverage.  </P> <P> The financial burden of emergency systems and trauma centers now falls on  physicians and hospitals, whereas in fact these facilities benefit society as a  whole.  </P> <P> As with police and fire department services, the burden of paying for emergency  services should fall on the public.  </P> <P> Physicians who back up hospital emergency departments should be reimbursed for  their services at the same level as they would be compensated for treating  patients in their private practices. Funds for payment of physician services  could come from local communities by way of individual taxation or by  contributions from the involved city governments.  </P> <P> Governments have always been derelict about their obligations on behalf of the  poor in hope that the private sector will bail them out. Local emergency  medical services are in need of urgent critical care, and innovative solutions  by the public will be required.  </P> <P> Dr. WILLIAM M. THOMPSON  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

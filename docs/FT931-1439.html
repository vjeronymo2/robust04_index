			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Bundesbank rates cut lights the fuse - Michael Morgan looks at European equity turnover in February The Bundesbank's move to cut interest rates early in February, and the confidence this engendered for further cuts in Germany and elsewhere, provided the key for a sharp rise in trading volume in most of the European bourses during the month. 'Rising volumes reflect strong markets,' says Mr James Cornish of NatWest Securities, noting that the FT-A Europe index recorded a 5.1 per cent rise in January, as investors pinned their hopes on lower rates. Germany was by far the largest beneficiary of the Bundesbank's rate cut on February 4 and the welcome given to the move by investors was reflected in a 46 per cent rise in bourse turnover for the month, compared with January. This also represented a 50.6 per cent increase on the average for November to January and the highest level since January, 1992. 'After a period of fairly level volumes from the beginning of the year, they began to pick up in the second week of February and have remained at these high levels until the last few days as concern has grown over developments in Russia,' says Mr Cornish. Across Europe, month-on-month turnover rose by 15.3 per cent in February after the 12.5 per cent increase registered during January. Paris, initially churlish on the grounds that the Bundesbank had done no more than it had to, turned its attention to financial stocks and the market remained in a state of high expectation throughout February that there could be more good news on rates. This took Paris turnover up 20.0 per cent to the highest level since last September. The Netherlands began the month in a gloomy mood with Daf filing for protection from creditors and doubts over Fokker's sale to Deutsche Aerospace. However, the overall mood was not soured and turnover rose by 15.1 per cent to the highest level since August 1990, 29.9 per cent up on the average of the previous three months. Italy demonstrated its independence with a rates cut of its own, only hours before the German reduction. But it also suffered traumas with the ever widening political corruption scandals. But strong demand for blue chips spurred an 11.5 per cent rise in trading on the month. Spain edged just 1.8 per cent higher; the market's underperformance reflected disappointment at upward pressures on interest rates. The lack of international interest in the market was demonstrated by a 7.7 per cent decline in volume on SEAQ International, the London screen-based system for international stocks. Switzerland fell 21.1 per cent to more normal levels after January's steep rise, but February was still 12.3 per cent higher than the average of the previous three months.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER                 Monthly total in local currencies (bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bourse             Nov         Dec         Jan         Feb        US                   1992        1992        1993        1993    dollarsbn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium          43.93       43.35       62.75       57.35      1.69 France           92.39      120.72      106.66      127.98     22.94 Germany          92.20       82.80       91.67      133.88     81.94 Italy        24,248.80   14,210.72    25,143.2   28,045.20     17.65 Netherlands      11.70       12.50       14.60       16.80      9.10 Spain           619.31      790.00      653.20      664.91      5.68 Switzerland      11.60       13.10       22.30       17.60     11.53 UK               39.57       39.05       42.86       43.58     62.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

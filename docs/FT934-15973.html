			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Higgs &amp; Hill back in black with Pounds 525,000 HIGGS &amp; HILL, the construc-tion and property company, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 525,000 for the six months to June 30, an improvement on full-year losses of Pounds 22m but a small decline from the comparative figure of Pounds 673,000. 'Last year's losses were very much a function of the provisions we made against both the housing land bank and the property portfolio. I would very much hope that the provisions are behind us,' said Mr John Theakston, chief executive. He said Higgs had done 'some particularly good property deals' in the first half of last year. 'Clearly it is difficult to buck the trend in some of the markets but I do think we are in a strong position.' Sales fell to Pounds 125.5m (Pounds 150.1m) with the decline in turnover reflecting 'reduced workload in construction'. Mr Theakston said construction margins remained under pressure. 'There has been as yet no volume recovery and there is a lot of capacity out there.' Housing sold 196 (128) units and prices were generally stable. The company received Pounds 72,000 in interest compared with charges of Pounds 500,000 last time as it reported a cash balance of Pounds 7.4m compared with borrowings of Pounds 4.7m this time last year. Higgs has a 50 per cent liability for borrowings of Pounds 15m held off-balance sheet in a joint venture. Net cash from operating activities fell to Pounds 2.72m (Pounds 15.2m) as the company invested in land and made two small acquisitions. 'Our cash position on the balance sheet will fall and we may draw down some borrowings in the course of next year essentially as we re-invest back in the business,' Mr Theakston said. The board declared a maintained dividend of 1p, uncovered by earnings down at 0.7p (1p) per share.</p>

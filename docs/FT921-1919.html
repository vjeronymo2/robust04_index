			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / How To Spend It: Spare rugs PLUSH CARPETS and highly decorative floral motifs are not what the new pared-down 1990s interior requires - honeyed wood or flat-weave kelims, plain creamy woollen rugs or eco-sound seagrass matting is more the thing. For a newer alternative it is also worth looking at a range of flat-woven pure wool floor coverings by Roger Oates Design Associates. Launched just two years ago the collection has taken off in a big way in America and France where designers like Jacques Grange seized on it for its air of understated quality and its slightly spare aesthetic look. If you like Shaker-style, then this is the floor-covering for you. The floor-covering is woven like very heavy cloth fabric and comes in a range of two-tone herringbone weaves (which are most suitable for those who want a very plain, uniform look) or a series of strongly coloured stripes. The flooring is ideally suited for runners or for being made into rugs or large carpets and it can also be used wall-to-wall. Many customers think the striped versions are ideal for stairs but Roger Oates is keen to point out that, although visually they may look the perfect partnership, they are not hard wearing enough for the stairs. For a plain effect look out for Venetian Hancock (it comes in lots of colour combinations including two greens, a navy and two reds but I like it best in the shades of biscuit) or the small random-textured stripe of Jaspe or Lewis. The strong stripes are Albany, Vernon, Hampton (photographed here) and Charleston. Prices are about Pounds 60 a linear metre. For a full-colour brochure, swatches and details of local stockists write (enclosing Pounds 1.50) to Roger Oates Design Associates, Church Lane, Ledbury, Herefordshire HR8 1DW. (Tel: 0531-2718). In London the range can be seen and bought at Sinclair Till, 793 Wandsworth Road, London SW8 and at Bernardout, 328 King's Road, London SW3. For a more striking modern look for the floor it is worth looking at the collection of limited edition - just 15 of each design - rugs commissioned by The Contemporary Textile Gallery at Vigo Galleries, 6 a Vigo Street, London W1X 1AH. Many of our most distinguished textile designers, such as Sian Tucker and Helen Yardley, have produced rugs for the gallery. Many designs are very strong and a room would need to be planned around them but some, like Suzie Pilgrim's pale Victor Pasmore-like abstract in cream, black and mustard could fit into many an existing modern interior. Prices range from Pounds 395 for the smallest rugs, while Pounds 650 is the average price for rugs of 6 ft by 4ft. The most expensive are just over Pounds 1,000. The gallery always holds a constantly changing selection - as one design sells out, more arrive.</p>

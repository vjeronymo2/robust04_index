			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / UK Company News: ACT reorganises to focus on financial software ACT, the computing services company, has embarked on a programme of restructuring and disposals which will leave it, possibly by the end of this year, as a tightly-focused financial software concern. The company at present comprises two divisions. Financial software products generate Pounds 150m of group annual sales totalling Pounds 250m but account for 80 per cent of profits. Information systems covers a diverse group of companies, including computer maintenance and hospital management systems. The company has already disposed of Cablestream to Siemens of Germany for Pounds 5m and Brann Marketing to its management for Pounds 8m. On the basis of restructuring announcements made earlier this week it is expected that other non-core activities will be sold soon. These could include Network Si, a computer networking subsidiary, Computer Support, which provides maintenance and outsourcing services, Medisys, which specialises in the healthcare market and Logsys, an open systems supplier to central and local government. ACT intends to integrate its three financial software subsidiaries - Kindle, BIS Banking Systems and ACT Financial Systems - under a central operating board. The board will comprise Mr Roger Foster, ACT founder and chairman, Mr Mike Hart, group managing director, and Mr Brian Whitty, finance director, together with managing directors of the three subsidiaries, Mr Kieran Nagle, Mr Paul Newton and Mr Eurfyl ap Gwilym. Kindle, based in Dublin, will be renamed ACT Banking Systems and be responsible for marketing banking products to emerging financial centres in eastern Europe and the Middle East. BIS Banking Systems will be renamed ACT International and will be responsible for marketing in established financial centres. ACT Financial Systems will be responsible for marketing in the UK. Mr Foster said the strategy was designed to give the company a single corporate identity in the financial world, eliminating duplication in offices, marketing, products and research and development. 'The game plan is to establish a global presence in a single niche market, financial services. If you are a UK company without a global presence you will be squeezed by bigger companies.' ACT, with 3,500 staff, is one of the UK's largest computer services groups. Founded as a computer bureau, it moved into personal computers before selling its hardware division to Mitsubishi Electric of Japan four years ago. It has since made a series of acquisitions, chiefly in the financial services areas, including Quotient and NMW, the stock processors and Kindle and BIS Banking Systems, which supply banking packages. BIS cost Pounds 93.5m, financed partly through a rights issue. ACT now has no debt and no cash. The disposals will raise substantial sums, which it is thought will be used partly to buy small companies providing financial software which fill gaps in its packaged software product line. Analysts broadly welcomed the new strategy. Ms Sue Cox of Warburg said it was a logical progression. The company's chief problem had been credibility with such a broad spread of activities.</p>

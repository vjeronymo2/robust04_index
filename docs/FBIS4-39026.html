			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 4 (YONHAP) -- South Korean Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu separated from the presidential entourage  Saturday and hurried to the United States, where sanctions are  being discussed against North Korea. South Korean President Kim  Yong-sam, here on a summit visit, instructed Han to go to the  United States just before he left for Uzbekistan, Kim's aides  said.    Han hopes to stop off in London for special talks with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who is accompanying  President Bill Clinton on a visit to Europe, the aides said.    The U.N. Security Council will begin serious negotiations on  a sanctions resolution against North Korea from next week,  setting deadlines and the degree of sanctions to resolve the  nuclear crisis.    Han is expected to fly to New York for talks with U.N.  Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali and Security Council  President Salim Bin Mohammed al-Khussaiby as well as ambassadors  from the United States, Japan, China and Russia.    In Washington, Han will confer with administration officials  to coordinate policies and future countermeasures on the nuclear  problem.</p>

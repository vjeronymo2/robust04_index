			<p><P> August 21, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> SUMMERFEST '89 OPENS ON STRONG NOTE  </P> <P> In accord with its high standards, the La Jolla Chamber Music Society opened  its fourth annual summer festival at Sherwood Auditorium with three rousing  performances.  </P> <P> SummerFest '89 artistic director Heiichiro Ohyama constructed a pleasantly  varied program Friday night that opened with a Telemann Trio Sonata in C Minor,  followed by the Benjamin Britten "Phantasy" Quartet, Op. 2; it closed with  Brahms' exuberant B-flat Major String Sextet, Op. 18.  </P> <P> Oboist Gerard Reuter, a member of the Dorian Wind Quintet, made a stunning  first impression in the Telemann and the Britten. One of the few newcomers on  this program of SummerFest veterans, Reuter proved to be the perfect foil to  flutist Damian Bursill-Hall in the Trio Sonata. The two wind players traded  deftly turned and vividly etched lines in a lean but vigorous contrapuntal  conversation.  </P> <P> In the "Phantasy" Quartet, Reuter's keen, penetrating timbre cut through the  delicate string accompaniment without overwhelming it. He responded to the  composer's dense arabesques with a sensuously shaded cantilena that was nothing  short of mesmerizing.  </P> <P> David Golub provided a fleet, vigorous keyboard accompaniment in the Telemann,  but his aggressive attacks gave him away as a pianist drafted for harpsichord  duty.  </P> <P> Cellist Peter Reijto was a trusty collaborator in both the Telemann and the  Britten, and Eugene Drucker's violin supplied a sweet innocence in the  "Phantasy" Quartet when it was called for. Violist Cynthia Phelps' dark timbre  could not have been more apt for the work's pathos.  </P> <P> After the intensity of the program's first half, however, the Brahms Sextet was  a minor disappointment. It took the better part of the first movement for the  players to forge a cohesive ensemble, and even then they continued to move in  and out of focus. The players did not fully encompass this youthful work and  give it a coherent interpretive stamp, but there were several exquisite  moments, such as the serene close of the second movement and the vibrant  scherzo.  </P> <P> First violinist Andres Cardenes' strong, decisive approach was perhaps too  stern for this optimistic composition, and he remained uncharacteristically  aloof from his collaborators. Violinist Julie Rosenfeld, violist Francesca  Martin and cellist Diane Chaplin -- three-quarters of the Colorado Quartet --  as well as violist Phelps and cellist Gary Hoffman made up the rest of the  Brahms ensemble.  </P> <P> Hoffman handled his virtuoso solos with aplomb and great conviction, but a more  burnished sonority from his instrument would have better complemented the  idiom.  </P> <P> The opening-night crowd was almost a full house at the auditorium, which holds  about 500. The festival continues through Aug. 27.  </P></p>

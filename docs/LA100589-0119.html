			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> E. BERLIN BARS REFUGEES FROM U.S. EMBASSY  </P> <P> More than 100 East German police officers sealed off the U.S. Embassy here  Wednesday to prevent a crowd of East Germans from pushing their way in after  learning that 18 others were seeking refuge there.  </P> <P> The 18 had slipped into the embassy Tuesday through a side door and insisted on  being helped to flee the country.  </P> <P> But by nightfall they had been persuaded to leave, on the assurance that the  East German government would "view favorably" their applications for emigrant  visas.  </P> <P> Elsewhere in Europe, East Germans swam rivers, jammed railroad stations and  crowded into other Western embassies hoping somehow to get to the West. Such  scenes were being played out in Czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dresden Blockade  </P> <P> In Prague, the Czechoslovak capital, thousands of East Germans were boarding  trains for West Germany. Thousands of others were lining up along the route  hoping to get on board. At just one point, in Dresden, 3,000 people were  reported to have been driven by the police from the right-of-way.  </P> <P> In Warsaw, more than 100 East Germans arrived at the West German Embassy  seeking asylum, bringing the number of East German refugees there to about 400.  Some of them told of swimming rivers and evading border guards to get there.  </P> <P> In Sofia, Bulgaria, four East Germans were reported to have asked for asylum at  the West German Embassy.  </P> <P> At the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin, the 18 unexpected guests -- 10 men and  women and eight children, including three infants -- were kept in an anteroom  off the main lobby. The curtains were drawn, and no outsiders were admitted.  </P> <P> When the door was opened, they could be seen, in jeans and sneakers, lounging  in leather chairs. Cartons of milk and mineral water stood next to three  portable cribs.  </P> <P> "We have a problem," an embassy official said. "We can't throw them out on the  street."  </P> <P> In Washington a State Department official said, "We are devoting every effort  toward finding a humanitarian solution to their plight."  </P> <P> No details were made public here on what might have taken place between U.S.  and East German officials. According to one report, embassy officials had  talked with Wolfgang Vogel, the East Berlin lawyer who has been involved in  earlier such situations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crowd Gathered  </P> <P> When it became known Wednesday morning that the East Germans had managed to get  into the embassy, a crowd began gathering in front of the building. Several  people, some of them carrying suitcases, tried to get in through the front  door.  </P> <P> One of them, a young woman with a 3-year-old daughter, told reporters: "We  heard the news on the radio that people were going into the American Embassy to  leave East Germany -- and we decided to do the same thing. But they wouldn't  let us in."  </P> <P> People crowded around the entrance, but East German police soon arrived and  herded them across the street. Later in the day, the police cordoned off the  entire block and closed it to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.  </P> <P> Sources in West Germany said that the trains carrying East Germans out of  Prague would take a route different from that taken over the weekend, when  scores of people along the way jumped on board. They said the route would move  over a small section in the southwestern corner of East Germany, just enough to  allow the East German authorities -- who have sought to avoid the stigma of  mass defections -- to say the travelers were being expelled.  </P> <P> In Prague, the second wave of freedom-seeking East Germans left the West German  Embassy to the sustained applause of several thousand Czechoslovak onlookers.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak officials, whose evident impatience with the East German  government may have spurred the exodus, estimated that between 11,000 and  12,000 East Germans will make the trip in an operation that was expected to  require at least 12 trains and most of the night to accomplish.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coins Discarded  </P> <P> As the first train pulled out of Liben station in northeast Prague, with about  1,000 cheering East Germans on board, the boarding area echoed with the sound  of East German coins flung from the windows. Czechoslovak police, standing by  with their arms folded, smiled and shook their heads as if in disbelief at the  events of the past few days.  </P> <P> The departure of the East Germans came five days after a similar operation,  which removed 6,000 East Germans from inside and around the West German  Embassy. West Germany confers automatic citizenship on East Germans.  </P> <P> At the time, officials thought the arrangement was a one-time deal struck by  East Germany, West Germany and Czechoslovakia. But within days the embassy  grounds were again full, and East Germans continued to arrive until Tuesday,  when the government in Berlin imposed restrictions on travel to Czechoslovakia,  which has become one of the East Germans' major routes to the West.  </P> <P> By the time East Germany agreed Tuesday to allow a second group of East Germans  to leave Prague, nearly 10,000 were camped on the embassy grounds and in the  streets approaching the 18th-Century palace that houses the West German  mission.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Trouble Clearing Tracks  </P> <P> Officials at the embassy had expected the new departures to begin Tuesday  night. But a Czechoslovak official at the Transportation Ministry said  Wednesday that the East Germans had a problem clearing the railroad tracks of  people who hoped to board the trains.  </P> <P> Diplomatic sources said the Czechoslovak government, increasingly concerned  over widespread public sympathy for the emigrants, pushed the East Germans to  move quickly to bring the drama to a conclusion. Some sources suggested that  the Czechoslovak government may have threatened to open its borders with West  Germany unless the East Germans moved quickly.  </P> <P> Along with East Germany, Czechoslovakia is among the East Bloc's rock-ribbed  resisters to political reform, and the government here has been seriously  rattled by the problem of the East German refugees. Although the Czechoslovak  government has been philosophically inclined to deal harshly with the East  Germans -- and to uphold bilateral agreements that would prevent their  departure to the West -- the involvement of a Western diplomatic mission and  world press attention presented it with an almost insoluble problem.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Apparent Confusion  </P> <P> The confusion of the Czechoslovak authorities was apparent in the sometimes  schizophrenic reaction of the police, who forcibly detained East Germans trying  to scale the fences at the West German Embassy, then relented and let scores --  and then hundreds -- to enter unimpeded. By Tuesday, the police were simply  standing on the fringes of the large crowd, which remained orderly and quiet.  </P> <P> But for a Czechoslovak government that is not averse to turning fire hoses on  its own protesting citizens, the spectacle of massive socialist disobedience --  much of it obviously supported by the population of Prague -- was hard to take.  </P> <P> Many Prague residents offered lodgings to the East Germans, particularly to  young parents with small children. Taxi drivers were ferrying them to the  neighborhood of the embassy without charge. Many brought food to them, offered  to cook and gave candy to the children.  </P> <P> Thousands more came simply to watch, seemingly caught up in the spectacle. When  the buses began to load Wednesday evening, thousands of Czechoslovaks watched  from a closed-off plaza and applauded as the East Germans, in groups of about  60, moved along the street to board the buses.  </P> <P> At the railroad station, the mood, after days of tension, was jubilant. As West  German Ambassador Hermann Huber looked on, the travelers trooped into the train  carrying babies and backpacks, flung down the compartment windows and marveled  at their good luck.  </P> <P> "We are totally happy," said Christiane Busching, a 19-year-old from Dessau.  </P> <P> "I got here only yesterday," said Dianna Krause, 21, from Furstenwalde. "We  were very lucky. We got here just before they closed the border."  </P> <P> Few observers here believe that the move by the East Germans to restrict travel  -- to require exit visas for travel to Czechoslovakia -- will do more than slow  the exodus. They point out that much of the border, about 150 miles of it, is  unguarded, and that many will attempt to cross through the forests to get to  Czechoslovakia, where officials at the West German Embassy in Prague have said  they will be willing to take them in.  </P> <P> The refugee problem has highlighted the growing isolation of the hard-line  states on the western edge of the Soviet Bloc, which are now forced to deal  with the fallout from reforms being made in Hungary and Poland.  </P> <P> It has also brought intense embarrassment to the regime of 77-year-old Erich  Honecker in East Berlin, whose government this weekend will observe the 40th  anniversary of the founding of the East German state. Soviet President Mikhail  S. Gorbachev is scheduled to be on hand for the anniversary, and the sudden  exodus -- and growing restiveness -- of the East German population will almost  certainly be a topic of his discussions with the ailing Honecker.  </P> <P> Tuohy reported from East Berlin and Powers from Prague.  </P></p>

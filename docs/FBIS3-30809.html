			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Bozena Wawrzewska: "PSL-SLD: Conflict or Prelude </F> to Divorce?"]    [Text] Quite unexpectedly, and for what would seem  like a minor reason, Poland's first political crisis since the  September parliamentary elections has arisen. Regardless of how  much politicians for both parties try to minimize the conflict  in their public statements, a situation where a deputy prime  minister responsible for the economy resigns in the midst of  proceedings in the Sejm on the budget is certainly not a usual  occurrence.    The introduction of Bank Slaski shares on the stock market,  as a series of inconsiderate statements coming from Sejm  deputies for the Polish Peasant Party's [PSL], a hurried search  for the guilty parties (or, rather, a scapegoat), led to the  dismissal of Deputy Finance Minister Stefan Kawalec. He heard  about his dismissal on the radio. It is worth recalling that  the dismissal followed Deputy Prime Minister Borowski's  statement, where he took upon himself responsibility for the  case of Bank Slaski in a way that, it should be admitted, was  worthy of recognition. The crisis was slowly brewing, but not  much could be said about its consequences. Things gathered  momentum after the return of the prime minister from Brussels  and Aleksander Kwasniewski from Davos. Some explanations were  made but their contents were not revealed to the public  completely. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] set some  conditions for continued coalition cooperation. The prime  minister refused to approve of the conditions. Deputy Prime  Minister Borowski resigned. The prime minister failed to  explain whether he accepts the resignation. Instead, he went to  visit some fire brigade units.  <H5>  Problems Despite Excess </H5>   It would seem that the current coalition is in the most  luxurious situation possible. A huge and overwhelming advantage  in the Sejm and the capability of enacting into law anything the  government wants gave rise to assumptions concerning the current  configuration's durability. But the crisis appeared rapidly and  quite unexpectedly. It revealed differences that exist between  the coalition members not only with regard to the understanding  of some points contained in the joint program, but primarily  with regard to philosophy and the way of ruling.    Differences in approach to the economy, which are big and  clear, are probably not the basis of the current conflict. The  recently introduced taxes, additional payments, subsidies for  the Food Management Bank [Bank Gospodarki Zywnosciowej] and  other institutions linked to rural areas give rise to suspicions  that the PSL was successful in imposing on the coalition partner  a lot of its own ideas concerning economic policies. Many moves  by the government undertaken in recent months seem beneficial  for rural areas and peasants. But the point is that decisions  giving preference to just one professional group--farmers--are  implemented at the expense of other groups. Protection of the  obsolete Polish agricultural system makes food prices rise.  That in turn has the most disastrous impact, first of all on  the poorest and weakest--those who constitute the SLD's election  clientele. Beyond any doubt, the PSL cares more for its  electorate than the SLD when it comes to implementing election  promises. The SLD tries to make it appear that nothing bad is  happening. It talks about difficulties associated with the  transitional period or about future implementation of election  promises. TRYBUNA, which before the elections wrote about the  dramatic situation of starving senior citizens, right now is  using enigmatic phrases to describe the budget difficulties.    But these kinds of concessions to peasants must be cause  for concern for some SLD politicians, especially given the fact  that other preelection declarations are not being implemented  for now, either. The concordat, abortion, the participation of  women in places of authority--these issues were very  ostentatiously raised during the election campaign, but now  their solution is being put off until the future. The SLD  refuses to deal with difficult problems, ones that could give  rise to conflicts.  <H5>  The "Who Shall Be Better" Method </H5>   So the peasants noticed that they can force a lot on the  coalition partner, which after all won the elections. The means  to achieve this is a secondary issue. The first signal of this  style of conducting politics took place even before the  government was sworn in. Prime Minister Pawlak went to the  Belweder with a slightly different list of ministerial  candidates than what he had agreed upon with the coalition being  formed. The attempt ended in failure. Principles of coalition  cooperation were signed. Today, according to the SLD, these  principles are being violated. Local governors are being  replaced according to PSL criteria, and there are no  consultations regarding some decisions. It looks as if the PSL  wants to be smarter that its coalition partner. Or perhaps it  wants to react the way it used to. Perhaps the heir to the  United Peasant Party wants to show the heir to the Polish United  Workers Party that there has been a reversal of roles. The  peasant party will not be under anyone's heel, as it was in the  times of the Polish Peoples' Republic.  <H5>  That Must Offend the SLD </H5>   But what must really irritate it is the information policy  of  Waldemar Pawlak's Cabinet and his attempts to explain what is  happening. The prime minister, always looking frightened,  running from journalists and trying to get rid of them; Minister  Strak, who is aggressive and not nice to press people; and Miss  Wachowicz [press secretary to the prime minister], who keeps  issuing communiques to the effect that she has nothing to  say--all of these make up the picture of the Cabinet's  information policy. But that is an information policy of the  government, not just of the PSL. Such a trio cannot possible  arouse positive reactions, not just from the media but also from  the coalition partners who, in some cases, are not without sin  but who have many communicative politicians who have traveled to  different countries and who like being in touch with the press.  They also want the current team to come across in the public  eye as an open, European-style government made up of social  democrats.    That disharmony became visible again during the current  crisis. The SLD has been holding press conferences and the  leadership of its main party an urgent session; it explains its  position to journalists. SLD members frequently appear on  television.    But the PSL is quiet. It does not issue statements or  declarations; it takes no position. Only once did we have  [Deputy Sejm] Speaker Zych speaking on television and making an  appeal to listen to what the prime minister has to say on the  whole issue. But the point is that the prime minister gives no  one a chance to listen to him.    It is hard to tell today whether this is a conflict that  will  pass and that is typical for any coalition's initial phase, or  whether it is the prelude to a divorce. It is hard to tell  whether the differences are surmountable and a consensus  possible, or whether they are too deep and radical to be able to  eliminate them. In the beginning, the whole issue was being  minimized. Right now the SLD is trying to make it less radical.  But many words were spoken and the breaking of the coalition  agreement was mentioned, as well as the PSL's "buddy policies"  and mistakes with regard to information policies. If the SLD,  while using the argument of lack of an alternative to the  coalition, tries to make the conflict less radical, if it  encounters the PSL's harsh resistance and therefore decides to  give up what has been described as "terminal conditions," the  PSL will strengthen not only its position but also its style of  ruling. The PSL will simply prove more efficient.</p>

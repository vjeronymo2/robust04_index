			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSTMODERN CHILDREN AND 'IN THE BEGINNING'  </P> <P> I would like to tell you about my own meeting with myth. As a young child, I  liked many kinds of make-believe stories. I think I was about 10 when I  discovered mythology, dipping into Edith Hamilton, checking Padraic Colum's  "Northern Myths" out of the school library innumerable times, and later moving  into the Eddas. My parents taught me, in effect, that religion provides an  outline and a reason for creation and that science explains the details. The  differences among the "reasons" didn't bother me a bit; I don't think I thought  about them.  </P> <P> As an adult, I understand that the distinction between myth/religion and  science, between the play -- space and the "real world" is not absolute, and  that primordial dark is the same as primordial light: each is a field which  becomes a ground as its opposite is created.  </P> <P> My point is that, on the surface, healthy kids get into myths as stories, not  as competing world views. At a deeper level, the psyche is absorbing what it  can, on its own terms. Only much later will a few children, or adults, look at  myth from the outside, whether with positivist condescension, fundamentalist  outrage or humanist interest.  </P> <P> NANCY BROTHERS  </P> <P> UPLAND  </P></p>

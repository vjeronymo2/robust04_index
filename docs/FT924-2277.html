			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Managers report career worries COMPANIES ARE failing to manage their managers and leaving a big gap between company rhetoric and reality as perceived by middle managers, the Institute of Management says. A survey published by the institute today warns that if the gap is not closed it might have long-term consequences for company performance as managers' disillusionment grows. Organisations are increasingly focusing reward systems on individual performance, yet half of the managers surveyed believe their own pay packets bear little relation to their actual contribution. Few organisations have thought through the implications of reconciling the trend towards more team working with the increased emphasis on rewarding managers' individual performance. Any change to pay and benefits is largely imposed from the top down. Fifty two per cent of individual respondents said they had not been involved in developing plans for change. Two thirds of managers believe their organisation pays insufficient attention to their career management and development and two thirds are worried about promotion. Who's Managing the Managers?

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 8/6/1994 -- The current  government makes efforts not to allow peasants to take part in  land privatization, stated today during a press conference  Semion Certan, Alliance of Moldovan Free Peasants [ATLM]  chairman. Land privatization is blocked and there are  anti-reform forces which neglect the provisions of the Land  Code, added Certan. According to him, "the peasants are  deliberately misinformed on the manner of taxation; the  legislation on registering farms is ignored, while the  preferential and foreign credits do not reach their  beneficiaries in fair portions. Often they are distributed to  collective farms." Ilie Untila, deputy chairman of the Alliance,  stated to reporters that in many villages peasants cannot  receive their plots of land; those who received their share of  land did not receive their share of inventory. Contrary to the  legislation, the peasants are forced to pay the taxes in kind.  Thus, today, in Hajdieni, Glodeni, the district leadership met  with the peasants to convince the latter to pay taxes in kind.</p>

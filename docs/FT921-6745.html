			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Canada to cut taxes and public spending THE Canadian government yesterday proposed corporate and personal tax cuts in a budget aimed at boosting public confidence ahead of the general election expected to be called by mid-1993. Saying that he was 'reducing spending in order to cut taxes', Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, also announced the abolition or streamlining of 46 public-sector agencies and the complete withdrawal of Canadian combat troops from Europe over the next three years. Other measures include a cut from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the withholding tax on dividends paid to foreigners, and a radical overhaul of the system of family allowances which have been part of the Canadian social security net since 1945. Mr Mazankowski projected a budget deficit of CDollars 27.5bn (Pounds 13.3bn) in the year to March 31 1993, down from CDollars 31.4bn. The decline is largely due to lower interest rates on debt servicing. Next year's deficit will be well above earlier projections of a CDollars 24bn shortfall, and the government has pushed back its target of eliminating borrowing requirements by one year, to 1995/96. According to background documents published by the Finance Department, Ottawa's deficit will be 4 per cent of GDP this year, compared with 6.8 per cent in the US. Those positions were roughly reversed as recently as 1985. The tax rate on manufacturing and processing will drop from 23 per cent to 22 per cent next January, and to 21 per cent in 1994. Capital cost allowances for manufacturing and processing machinery go up immediately from 25 per cent to 30 per cent. The surtax on personal taxes will fall from 5 per cent to 4 per cent of basic tax on July 1 and to 3 per cent next January. In a nod to the hard-pressed construction and real estate industry, Mr Mazankowski will temporarily allow a portion of tax-sheltered retirement savings to be used for buying or building a home. The budget estimates are based on real GDP growth of 2.7 per cent this year and 4.5 per cent in 1993. Inflation is expected to remain at 2.2 per cent this year and next, while interest rates are forecast to continue dropping for at least the next two years. Mr Mazankowski expects the tax cuts to be entirely offset this year by spending restraint, further privatisations and steps to improve tax compliance. But the measures proposed yesterday will have a net stimulatory impact of CDollars 730m in 1993/94. Candidates for privatisation include the Royal Canadian Mint. Ottawa also plans to abolish the Economic Council of Canada, which is one of the country's leading economic think-tanks. Cabinet ministers are taking a 5 per cent pay cut, and members of parliament and senior civil servants will no longer be allowed to travel first-class.</p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL;  </P> <P> OPTIMISM EVAPORATES QUICKLY IN ATLANTA  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Reds might be April's hot story, but it's Atlanta that is  burning -- the hopes of the Braves and their touted young pitching staff  incinerating faster than you can say William Tecumseh Sherman.  </P> <P> Unless there's a swift and dramatic change, owner Ted Turner might scorch both  Russ Nixon, the manager, and Bobby Cox, the general manager, tossing in Mike  Fratello, coach of his Atlanta Hawks, as kindling.  </P> <P> Turner may have created the Goodwill Games, but the concept goes only so far. A  1-8 record after Saturday's loss to the Reds isn't likely to create harmony.  </P> <P> This was to be a fine season for the National League West's perennial cellar  dwellers. In addition to promising pitching, the Braves had remodeled the  lineup with the $5.7-million signing of free agent first baseman Nick Esasky  and the acquisitions by trade of third baseman Jim Presley and catcher Ernie  Whitt.  </P> <P> It may still happen, but more than the pre-weekend madness of 1-8 has been the  disturbing method.  </P> <P> Consider:  </P> <P>  -- The Braves were outscored 70-28 in the nine games, allowed 10 or more hits  in eight of them and opposing players collected three hits or more 14 times.  The staff earned-run average was 7.63, and of the 28 times Nixon went to the  bullpen, 17 times the reliever came on to allow at least one earned run.  </P> <P>  -- The potential ace of the rotation, John Smoltz, is 1-7 since participating  in last summer's All-Star game and 0-2 this year, the opposition hitting .444  against him. The potential relief ace, Mike Stanton, had a 14.54 ERA based on  seven earned runs in 4 1/3 innings after giving up only four earned runs in his  final 44 innings at Richmond and Atlanta last year.  </P> <P>  -- Esasky was six of 35 after Saturday with no extra base hits, no runs batted  in and was responsible for 15 of the 63 strikeouts the Braves had accumulated  in 303 at-bats. Dale Murphy, seeking to shake two bad seasons, had nine  strikeouts and seven hits in 34 at-bats, with one home run and four RBIs.  </P> <P>  -- Whitt, batting .150, had thrown out only two of 18 base stealers and was  exchanging oral jabs with his pitchers because of it.  </P> <P> "I don't see why some people can hold runners on and others can't," he said.  "It should be an adjustment easily done. The pitcher should know when the  runner goes and cut his release time accordingly.  </P> <P> "I think I've made only one bad throw. It's not like I'm throwing rainbows down  there, but it's a definite concern and something has to be done."  </P> <P> Said Pete Smith: "Nothing against Ernie, but he doesn't have one of the  strongest arms in the world. At the same time, we as pitchers could do a better  job of holding people on."  </P> <P> Said Nixon, of the staggering start: "I never thought it could be this bad. I  mean, I still think this could be a great club. I really had no idea."  </P> <P> The status of the manager and general manager was considered uncertain going  in. What might save them is that no one seems to be paying attention. Or cares.  Atlanta apathy?  </P> <P> The Braves were the only team in baseball not to draw a million each of the  past two years. They averaged 13,917 in 1989 and 9,284 for the first five dates  of 1990.  </P> <P> On Monday, two days after the Dayton Dynamo and Atlanta Attack drew 8,653 for  an indoor soccer game there, the Braves and Reds attracted 6,484.  </P> <P> Strange Twists: Juan Samuel, the Dodger leadoff man, appears to have responded  aggressively to the center-field assignment.  </P> <P> But Devon White, the Angel center fielder, continues to resist the leadoff  role, irritating management with his lack of selectivity.  </P> <P> Then there's Philadelphia's Len Dykstra, who once was considered a center-field  candidate for the Dodgers and remains among the leadoff possibilities for the  Angels if White is traded. Tim Raines of Montreal and Junior Felix of Toronto  also are Angel candidates.  </P> <P> Dykstra has heard all the rumors. "The Phillies have been good to me," he said.  "They gave me the chance to play every day. I'm not saying I want to be traded,  but if I had to be traded, the Angels and Dodgers would be one, two on my list.  </P> <P> "I grew up in Garden Grove. There were many times I rode my bike to Anaheim  Stadium and found ways to sneak in. I'm moving back to Mission Viejo next  winter. It (a trade) would complete the homecoming."  </P> <P> The Angels and Phillies make a perfect trade match. The Angels have a surplus  of the commodity the Phillies require -- pitching.  </P> <P> A package is a possibility, although Dykstra said he talked with Philadelphia  General Manager Lee Thomas in spring training and was told he would not be  traded. Dykstra said he thought that if the Phillies traded anyone it would be  Von Hayes, netting at least two starting pitchers in return.  </P> <P> Dykstra, on the other hand, is more than a leadoff man and center fielder. His  fiery personality is capable of igniting an unemotional team. A veteran Angel,  reflecting on that the other day, said: "Of all the players I've heard  mentioned in trade rumors, Lenny is the one I'd most like to see come here. We  have a lot of guys who care and want to win, but they keep it to themselves. We  need someone to come in and break some bats, rattle some bones."  </P> <P> There is a theory that the departure of personalities such as Roger McDowell,  Randy Myers, Wally Backman and Dykstra have cost the New York Mets their  abrasive and aggressive flavor.  </P> <P> Dykstra said he agrees with that and also finds it amusing that the Mets,  concerned about Keith Miller's play amid overall defensive shortcomings (they  committed 14 errors in 11 games), are again in the center-field market, having  traded three center fielders in the past two years -- Samuel, Dykstra and  Mookie Wilson.  </P> <P> "The Mets have shown bad judgment," Dykstra said. "When you've got pitching  like that, wouldn't you try to get a defense that can catch the ball?"  </P> <P> Dykstra, in the meantime, is off to his best start. He entered a weekend series  in St. Louis with the NL's second-best batting average.  </P> <P> "I'm not thinking about the rumors or anything else," he said. "I'm just trying  to concentrate on playing, being consistent all year. I learned a lot playing  every day during the last two months of last year and went home and wrote down  some things I needed to do."  </P> <P> One was to bulk up, get stronger. The 5-10, 165-pound Dykstra suddenly went to  190.  </P> <P> "I lifted some weights and took some real good vitamins," he said. "I feel a  lot stronger. I just hope I can keep it on. I've already lost six pounds in a  week. I mean, it's hard because your diet changes so much during the season  with all those TWA specials."  </P> <P> Doc on the Mend: After Dwight Gooden allowed 14 hits and 10 runs in the 7 2/3  innings of his first two starts, both winless, there was a suspicion that the  Mets' ace might have been tipping his pitches.  </P> <P> No indication of that, however, when Gooden bounced back Thursday to go seven  strong innings in a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, whose shortstop, Shawon  Dunston, said:  </P> <P> "I didn't see him tip nothing. He was throwing a 95-mile-per-hour fastball on  the inside corner. If he keeps that up, the only tipping is going to be the  other team tipping their caps to him."  </P> <P> The Cubs almost always do.  </P> <P> Gooden has a 19-3 career record against them, winning seven in a row.  </P> <P> Evoking memories of Ted Williams, Boston Red Sox outfielder Mike Greenwell  attacked the New England media the other day, saying, "It's very tough to deal  with those guys because you'd like to wring their necks. I would wring their  necks if the law permitted it."  </P> <P> This all started because of the few base hits ringing off Greenwell's bat. He  was seven of 37 with no RBIs through Friday, compounding Boston's pitching  woes.  </P> <P> While Roger Clemens was 3-0 with a 4.12 ERA entering a weekend series in  Milwaukee, the rest of the Boston staff was 2-4 with a 5.64 ERA, and there was  no indication of immediate help for the three-deep rotation of Clemens, John  Dopson and Mike Boddicker.  </P> <P> "I started looking (for pitching) last June," General Manager Lou Gorman said.  "I understand the fans' frustration because I'm as frustrated as anyone."  </P> <P> Similarly, the Texas Rangers are getting nothing after Nolan Ryan and Kevin  Brown. The Rangers, through Friday, were 5-0 in games Ryan and Brown started,  0-6 when others started. Last year, they were 36-24 in the Ryan and Brown  starts, 47-55 otherwise.  </P> <P> A solid start has served to defuse the always combustible New York Yankee  environment. It's April, Pascual Perez has pitched 11 innings without allowing  an earned run and Dave Winfield, one of George Steinbrenner's favorite punching  bags, says: "What's starting to happen here isn't luck. Some very positive  signs are emerging. There is emotion in the clubhouse. There is a unity that I  haven't seen for quite a while. We have the offense and pitching to do it as a  team. There are no great pitching stars, but a lot of good, solid guys."  </P> <P> The torrid start of Red shortstop Barry Larkin would seem to suggest batting  tips from Manager Lou Piniella, the former Yankee manager and hitting  instructor, but Larkin, 22 of 39 through Saturday, said he couldn't adapt to  Piniella's style.  </P> <P> "I tried it, but I couldn't use his philosophy," Larkin said. "It wasn't  something I was comfortable with. It's more a long-ball swing and I'm not a  home run hitter."  </P> <P> Have Piniella and San Diego Padre Manager Jack McKeon turned over new leaves?  </P> <P> Piniella, who played for McKeon in 1973 in Kansas City, wrote in his 1986  autobiography that McKeon is "a champion second-guesser. I didn't like his  manner, his tone of voice, his sarcasm, and the feeling was mutual. He didn't  like me very much. I couldn't play for the man."  </P> <P> Two years later, McKeon wrote in his own book that Piniella was "the most  selfish player I've ever seen. In my first spring training, I lectured them  every morning on baseball. A couple of veterans thought it was a waste, but  mainly it was Lou Piniella. He's the one who undermined me."  </P> <P> In response to questions this week, Piniella said he respects McKeon, and  McKeon said: "We don't have any problems. I'd like to think we can see past  whatever happened 17 or 18 years ago."  </P></p>

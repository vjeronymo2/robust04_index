			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M.M.: "Something Is Floating in the Water"] </F>   [Text] The series of incidents in the parliament here was  enriched last week (on Wednesday, 18 May) by the scandal in the  parliament involving the spilling of water, shoving, and curses  referring to the opponent's communist mother. When Drasko  Markovic, deputy of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], said  something concerning the reputation of Dr. Radovan Bozovic,  president of the Citizens Chamber of the Assembly of Yugoslavia  -- more accurately, when in proposing an item on the agenda he  mentioned Bozovic's involvement in the so-called ministerial  scandal (stealing on a large scale involving two ministers of  the Serbian Government, headed by Dr. Bozovic), which is still  dragging on in the courts -- the latter turned off the  microphone at the speaker's stand.    In the next scene, the president of the Citizens Chamber  gestured to the Radical deputy to leave the speaker's desk, and  the latter took a glass of mineral water (it must have been  "Karadjordje!") and spilled it on the president's desk, but not  so violently that it would splash the president of the Chamber.    Bozovic then obtained from the Chamber permission to eject  the deputy from the Chamber. (Up to now deputies have been  ejected without a vote.)    The chastised deputy first headed for the exit, and then, at  the suggestion of the party's leader, he sat on a bench. The  Radicals surrounded their colleague and did not allow the  Assembly security to eject Markovic from the Chamber. There  began a test of strength based on credentials--the Radicals  referred to immunity, and the security personnel referred to the  official order of the president of the Chamber. One security  officer shouted: "Mr. Deputy, allow me to discharge my duty!"  Seselj answered: "You are not going to discharge your duty!"    In the fistfight that ensued, Radical Deputy Filip  Stojanovic  got a bloody ear. Seselj shouted in a strong voice: "You have  drawn the man's blood, damn your communist mother. To hell with  Sloba Milosevic!" He advised his deputy to display his bloody  handkerchief, and then, raising the temperature, he said that  "half a liter of blood has been shed"; throughout the entire  Chamber, he called to Radmilo Bogdanovic, chairman of the  Security Committee: "Radmilo, see what your police are doing!"  The latter, after sending a long and significant look in  Seselj's direction, left the Chamber!    When passions cooled, the Radicals left the session, and the  next day (Thursday, 19 May) they did not attend the debate  concerning the new rules of the Assembly, when everyone was  talking about the "dignity of the Assembly."    Incidentally, on two occasions before this incident Bozovic  has left the session when Dr. Vojislav Seselj mentioned his  involvement in criminal scandals. Exactly a year ago, an  incident occurred in which Bozovic took the opposite tack. When  Radical Deputy Vakic dealt a knockout blow to Deputy Mihajlo  Markovic, Bozovic reacted in a manner well-disposed to Vakic.  The Socialists were tolerant for a long time, they approved Dr.  Seselj or encouraged him to do outrageous things in the Serbian  and federal assemblies. Recently, they have been getting a  little annoyed.</p>

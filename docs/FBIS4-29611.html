			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 17 Kyodo -- The Rice Price Council is  expected to convene soon to decide the price for the government  purchase of this year's rice harvest, farm minister Mutsuki Kato  said Friday [17 June].    Kato, minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, told  a  regular press conference after a cabinet meeting the panel is  likely to meet before the summit of the Group of Seven (G-7)  industrial nations in Naples July 8-10.    He said the schedule for the meeting of the council, an  advisory panel to the head of the Food Agency, should be  finalized early next week.    The meeting to decide the rice price is widely expected to  be  held June 30-July 1 unless affected by political developments  after the fiscal 1994 budget passes the Diet.    The method of computing the price is expected to be the same  as last year, by calculating figures taken from selected areas  around the nation.    Kato also said a third round of talks among cabinet  ministers  to discuss farm policy following the agreement on the Uruguay  Round of multilateral trade talks will be held next week.    Details of domestic farm policy in line with the agreement  and budgetary problems are likely to be the major topics to be  scrutinized. The last such meeting was held on April 5.</p>

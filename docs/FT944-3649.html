			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilt traders hoping to get on with their Christmas shopping will have a host of economic statistics to distract them this week. With producer price figures today, the markets will have the chance to assess the state of retail sales, unemployment, average earnings and the public sector borrowing requirement. The most significant number will be November's retail price inflation on Wednesday. Mr Mark Reckless, UK economist at SG Warburg, thinks the market has some rather demanding expectations for the week's statistics, particularly on inflation, and this could result in disappointment and an adverse impact on gilts. But Mr Nigel Richardson, head of bond research at Yamaichi International (Europe), is optimistic about gilts. 'At the start of the week, the government appeared to be losing their authority on the fiscal front,' he says, following the defeat on the VAT vote. 'But they've now regained that authority and also moved firmly on the monetary front with the rise in rates.' The main factor likely to hold back gilts in the short term, Mr Richardson says, is the relationship with other bond markets. The spread over German bunds was only around 120 basis points on Friday, and the US bond market could be affected by further fall-out from the Orange County bankruptcy.</p>

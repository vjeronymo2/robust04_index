Meanwhile, according to the information of the local  Ministry  of Communications, subscriptions to them have been taken out in  Azerbaijan to the value of 150 million rubles. Citing the same  old reasons, the leadership of the national bank has proposed  returning the money to the subscribers. But Nazim Novruzov,  chief of the Azerbaijani Press Distribution Association, has  declared that possibilities have nonetheless been found to  preserve four Russian newspapers for the readers: PRAVDA,  IZVESTIYA, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, and ARGUMENTY I FAKTY.</p>

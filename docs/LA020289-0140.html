			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CLEMSON STUNS THIRD-RANKED TAR HEELS  </P> <P> Kirkland Howling was just following instructions.  </P> <P> Howling hit a 3-point shot to give Clemson the lead with 53 seconds remaining  and added 2 free throws with 24 seconds left Thursday night to give the Tigers  an 85-82 upset of third-ranked North Carolina in an Atlantic Coast Conference  game at Clemson, S.C.  </P> <P> "Coach (Cliff Ellis) told me to take the open 3-pointers, and it was open for a  second," Howling said. "I took it, and I felt it (was good) when I released  it."  </P> <P> The victory was only Clemson's second over the Tar Heels in 20 games and the  first since 1985. North Carolina has an 85-12 lead in the series, which dates  to 1926.  </P> <P> North Carolina (18-4 overall, 5-2 in the ACC) took an 82-80 lead on 2 free  throws by J.R. Reid with 1:21 left, but while Reid was at the line, Ellis  inserted Howling, who finished with 11 points.  </P> <P> "I had a gut feeling Dean (Smith, North Carolina coach) was going to go to a  zone, so I put Howling in," Ellis said. "We were lucky they went to the zone.  We might have been in trouble if they had used a man-to-man because our  ball-handlers were not in the game."  </P> <P> Dale Davis had 21 points and 21 rebounds for Clemson (13-5, 4-3), and Elden  Campbell added 17.  </P> <P> Reid scored 25 points for the Tar Heels and Kevin Madden added 19, but senior  guard Jeff Lebo was held scoreless for the first time as a Tar Heel, missing  all 7 shots he took.  </P> <P> Memphis State 99, Florida State 82 -- Elliott Perry scored 33 points and Rodney  Douglas had 17 points and 15 rebounds as the Tigers surprised the eighth-ranked  Seminoles at Tallahassee, Fla.  </P> <P> Perry made 8 of 20 shots and 15 of 16 free throws and Douglas made 7 baskets  and 3 free throws without a miss for Memphis State (14-7, 3-2), which scored  the first 9 points and never was threatened.  </P> <P> The Tigers made 63% of their shots, built a 19-point lead before halftime and  had an 87-58 lead before Florida State (16-2, 4-1) rallied far too late.  </P> <P> Tony Dawson scored 22 points for the Seminoles, who made just 35% of their  shots, but leading scorer George McCloud was more than 5 points below his  average at 18 points and made just 4 of 20 shots.  </P> <P> Derrick Mitchell, starting in place of injured Tharon Mayes for Florida State,  scored 16 points.  </P> <P> Minnesota 76, Ohio State 73 -- Melvin Newbern, who missed a free throw with 59  seconds left, made a layup with 8 seconds left and the Gophers knocked off the  No. 15 Buckeyes in a Big Ten game at Minneapolis.  </P> <P> Willie Burton scored 13 of his 30 points in the last 8 minutes for Minnesota  (12-6, 4-4), which posted its third upset of a Top 20 team in 19 days.  Minnesota beat then-No. 5 Iowa on Jan. 14 and then No. 1 Illinois last  Thursday.  </P> <P> Ohio State (15-5, 4-3) had a chance to regain the lead after Newbern's layup  made it 74-73, but Jay Burson was called for double-dribble just before he made  a 15-foot jumper with 3 seconds left. The Buckeyes' bench was hit with a  technical and Burton made both free throws.  </P> <P> The Gophers led, 72-71, when Newbern missed the front end of a 1-and-1. Ohio  State's Grady Mateen, who came off the bench to score 19 points, made 2 free  throws with 34 seconds left to give the Buckeyes a 73-72 lead.  </P> <P> Burson, averaging 23.4 points on 52% shooting, had 12 points, making 4 of 15  shots and committing 9 turnovers.  </P> <P> Virginia 91, North Carolina State 71 -- Richard Morgan scored 20 points and  sparked an early surge that carried the Cavaliers to an ACC upset of the No. 13  Wolfpack at Charlottesville, Va.  </P> <P> Morgan and Curtis Williams scored 6 points apiece as Virginia (12-6, 4-2)  jumped to a 25-4 lead midway through the first half. Morgan also made 2 free  throws to cap an 11-1 burst at the start of the second half that gave the  Cavaliers a 64-34 lead.  </P> <P> Rodney Monroe and Chucky Brown scored 18 points each for N.C. State (14-3,  5-2). John Crotty added 18 points for Virginia.  </P> <P> Oklahoma 90, Kansas State 82 -- Stacey King scored 20 of his 27 points in the  second half as the Sooners scored a Big Eight victory over the Wildcats in  their first game ever as the nation's No. 1 team.  </P> <P> Kansas State (12-6, 3-3) tied the score, 80-80, on Fred McCoy's hook shot with  3:23 left, but Terrence Mullins put Oklahoma (18-2, 5-0) ahead for good with a  3-pointer and Tyrone Jones added a basket as the Sooners finished with a 10-2  surge.  </P> <P> Each time Kansas State threatened in the second half, the Sooners responded.  After Steve Henson's basket gave the Wildcats their second lead of the game,  68-67, with 8:32 left, King scored 8 straight points as the Sooners went back  on top, 75-68.  </P> <P> Missouri 91, Kansas 66 -- Byron Irvin scored 22 points and Lee Coward added 19  to lead the fifth-ranked Tigers past the Jayhawks in a Big Eight Conference  game at Lawrence, Kan.  </P> <P> It was Missouri's first victory on the Jayhawks' court in 6 years.  </P> <P> Kansas (16-5, 3-3) was within 54-48 with 14 minutes left when Coward made 2  baskets. Irvin stole the ball and drove the length of the court for a 3-point  play that gave Missouri (19-3, 5-0) a 63-50 lead with 11:27 left.  </P> <P> Milt Newton scored 14 points for Kansas.  </P> <P> Syracuse 90, Villanova 57 -- Derrick Coleman scored 20 points and the No. 14  Orangemen scored 17 unanswered points in the first half of a Big East  Conference victory over the Wildcats at Syracuse, N.Y.  </P> <P> Villanova (12-9, 3-4), which upset Syracuse, 75-73, last month, fell behind,  47-27, at halftime and made its only run early in the second half. The Wildcats  had a 10-2 spurt to make it 49-37, but Syracuse (18-4, 4-4) responded with a  9-3 surge and pulled away.  </P> <P> The Orangemen limited Villanova to 22% shooting in the first half, and the  Wildcats went through a 12-minute stretch with their lone basket coming on a  goaltending call.  </P> <P> Tom Greis, who missed all 10 of his shots in the first half, scored 14 points  for Villanova. Stephen Thompson, who scored 2 points the last time against  Villanova, rebounded with 17 for Syracuse.  </P> <P> Georgetown 74, Seton Hall 66 -- Freshman Alonzo Mourning scored 17 points and  ignited a second-half surge as the sixth-ranked Hoyas avenged their only Big  East Conference defeat by downing the 10th-ranked Pirates at Landover, Md.  </P> <P> Mourning made a driving layup over Ramon Ramos to give Georgetown (16-2, 6-1) a  42-39 lead and start a 9-2 run that made it 49-41 with 9:09 left. Seton Hall  (18-3, 5-3) never got closer than 3 points the rest of the way.  </P> <P> Georgetown made 14 free throws in the final 3:04, including 5 by Anthony Allen.  </P> <P> Charles Smith scored 18 points for Georgetown, which bounced back after  Saturday's upset loss to Louisiana State. John Morton had 15 points for Seton  Hall and Andrew Gaze scored 14.  </P> <P> Louisville 108, Virginia Tech 95 -- Tony Kimbro had 21 points and 12 rebounds,  and Keith Williams added 19 points and 10 rebounds to lead the seventh-ranked  Cardinals past the Hokies in a Metro Conference game at Louisville.  </P> <P> Playing its first full game without injured center Pervis Ellison, Louisville  (15-3, 4-0) took over the conference lead when Memphis State upset Florida  State.  </P> <P> The Cardinals led, 51-44, with 18 1/2 minutes left when Kenny Payne scored 6 of  his 20 points to spark a 13-5 outburst that put the Cardinals in command,  64-49.  </P> <P> Ellison sprained a ligament in his left knee in Sunday's loss to Ohio State.  Felton Spencer started in place of Ellison, who will miss several games with a  knee injury, and had 19 points and 8 rebounds.  </P> <P> Bimbo Coles scored 36 points and Wally Lancaster had 27 for Virginia Tech  (7-12, 0-5).  </P> <P> Louisiana State 105, Mississippi 75 -- Vernel Singleton scored 23 points, and  Rickey Blanton and Chris Jackson added 21 points each and the No. 19 Tigers  trounced the Rebels in a Southeastern Conference game at Baton Rogue, La.  </P> <P> Blanton hit a pair of 3-point shots to start a 26-14 run that gave LSU (15-5,  7-2) a 45-35 halftime lead as Ole Miss (11-7, 5-4) made only 3 of 17 shots in  the final 10:04 of the half.  </P> <P> The loss broke a 4-game wining streak for Mississippi, which has not won 5 in a  row since the 1937-38 season.  </P> <P> Gerald Glass scored 31 points and Tim Jumper added 24 for Mississippi.  </P></p>

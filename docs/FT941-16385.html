			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Israel and PLO resume talks Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation formally resumed suspended peace talks yesterday as Syria, for the first time, welcomed the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement as a first step towards Middle East peace, Julian Ozanne writes. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators met after three weeks of bickering in the Egyptian Red Sea resort of Taba to try to end a stalemate over three main issues blocking implementation of the Palestinian self-rule agreement: control over borders; the size of the West Bank area of Jericho and security arrangements for Jewish settlers. The two sides are also divided on how long it will take to draft a final protocol, with the PLO saying within three weeks, and Israeli officials predicting the talks could last up to two months. Syria, which has been critical of the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord, yesterday endorsed the agreement. Diplomats said this was one of many steps being taken by Damascus before a summit between President Bill Clinton and President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on Sunday.</p>

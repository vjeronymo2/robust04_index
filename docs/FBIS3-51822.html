			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guatemalan Vice President Arturo Herbruger Asturias  has said government security forces will have to "harden" their  attitude in order to suppress groups that want to destabilize  the state through violence.    At a news conference, the Vice President said violent acts  could definitely create chaos before the referendum. These are  censurable terrorist acts that cannot be tolerated and the  government has a duty to punish the wrongdoers, he added.  <H5>  The Army Rules Out Existence of Urban Guerrilla Force </H5>   Army spokesman Edith Vargas de Marroquin denied the  existence  of an urban guerrilla force, but indirectly accused the  insurgents of the terrorist attacks carried out 18th Street,  Zone 1, on Wednesday and in front of Congress Sunday morning.  "These attacks were perpetrated as the Poor People's Guerrilla  Army (EGP) celebrates its anniversary and it is unfortunate that  in order to make their presence felt they affect the lives of  innocent people. In addition, it is irresponsible, because they  employ methods that endanger the population," she said.  <H5>  The Government Rejects Congressmen's Allegations </H5>   Presidential Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli denied  the allegations of several legislators who accuse the government  and the Army of provoking the current situation. "These are  absurd and irresponsible accusations, since not only the  government, but the people themselves are asking for the  legislators' resignations. Unfortunately, this is absurd and  inhumane terrorism, since any differences can be resolved  through dialogue," he added.  <H5>  Violent Acts Have International Impact </H5>   For his part, Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz Moscoso said  these incidents occurred a few days before the referendum, which  leads one to believe they could be fueled by radical groups that  do not want a change in policy. Ortiz does not believe the  violence is being promoted by legally registered political  parties, or by popular groups. Visibly irritated, he said "the  [responsibility for the] blood spilled should fall on the  wrongdoers."    He again pointed out that these incidents occurred at a time  when the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity (URNG) and the  government are getting ready to renew negotiations to end the  more than 30 years of armed conflict. Unfortunately, this  affects us internationally, he concluded.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Military Analyst on Scheme of U.S. Military for New Korean </F> War" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with a military analyst's commentary hitting out at  the scheme of the U.S. military to start another war in Korea.    The U.S. Defense Secretary, William Perry, some time ago let  loose an impudent blast, threatening that the U.S. "will not  rule out a preemptive strike" at the DPRK over its fictitious  "nuclear suspicion."    Signalled by this, the U.S. military is making a massive  shipment of military hardware including Patriot missiles to  South Korea, massing its naval force in the waters around Korea  and frequently staging military drills with the South Korean  puppets in their intensified military actions.    Viewing this as dangerous provocative acts intended to carry  into practice the war scenario which it had rounded off through  the "Team Spirit" joint war games from long ago for the purpose  of stifling the socialism of the DPRK with "strength," the  military analyst says:    The escalation of the U.S. military actions against the DPRK  is an offspring of the strategy of the expansion of arms market  which had been worked out through "back-door dealings" between  the U.S. administration and the U.S. war industrial monopolies.  The officials of the U.S. administration are, without  exception, servants of big monopolies, especially munitions  industrial monopolies. Hence their manoeuvres to ignite a war  on the Korean peninsula and fatten the munitions industrial  monopolies which find themselves in a sorry plight with the  shrinkage of the arms market after the end of the cold war.    Motivated by these interests, the U.S. military raised the  curtain of the Korean war scenario and buckled down to its full-  scale promotion.    Now a very grave situation which might touch off a war for a  slightest casual factor is prevailing on the Korean peninsula.    The U.S. military is shameless enough to harp on "a patient  diplomatic solution," describing its harebrained anti-DPRK  military actions as "for self-defense."    It is well-known a fact that the United States has down  through history cried for "a diplomatic solution" before  invading other countries and then tried to justify its military  actions. The "active and patient diplomatic solution" vis-a-vis  the DPRK advertised by the U.S. is nothing but a war diplomacy  to bring it to its knees and overpower it by armed invasion and  the socalled "defense" on the lips of the U.S. is no more than a  smokescreen to conceal its bellicose and aggressive nature.    Behind the smokescreen of "self-defense" the United States  is  scheming to mass armed forces in and around South Korea and  venture a military action against the DPRK.    But they are committing a mistake.    No strong arm works with us. Should the United States and  its lackeys dare provoke a war, we will answer it with a  decisive counter blow to defend our socialist system and the  dignity of our republic.    The United States would be well advised not to act rashly or  forget the bitter lesson of the past Korean war.</p>

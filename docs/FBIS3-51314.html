			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jayme Brener, Ana Beatriz Magno, Helio </F> Contreiras, Fabio Sanches, and Bianca Alves]    [Text] It is 1979: the largest strike since the 1964 coup  paralyzes the metallurgical industry of Sao Bernardo do Campo  (SP) [Sao Paulo State] under the leadership of lathe operator  Luis Inacio Silva or Lula. The military government treats the  strike as a police (or Army) case and Lula as a criminal. 1989:  the military establishment mobilizes against the victory of Lula  as presidential candidate of the PT [Workers Party]. 1994:  leader in the polls for the October elections, Lula already has  the sympathy -- or at least the tolerance -- of important  sectors of the Armed Forces, from the high command to the  recruits. And the PT returns the courtesy by starting to put  aside old dogmas such as the end of mandatory military service  and the Calha Norte Project that foresees a greater Brazilian  military presence in the Amazon. For the PT leadership, the  rapprochment with the military seems worth the risk of greater  internal disagreements when those who longed for the historic  program begin to criticize the dissidents. Just the same, the  military hard-liners do not trust the PT's softer stand and are  working on the candidacy of former high-ranking conservative  officers. The objective is to transfer the votes for the  military candidate to Lula's adversaries in the presidential  race.    The PT letter of introduction for debating with the military  is a defense program draft project that was entrusted to Colonel  Geraldo Cavagnari, retired, director of strategic studies at the  University of Campinas. The PT leadership has not yet approved  the document entitled Defense Policy and the Armed Forces which  is based on a position shared by the Brazilian high command. The  document says: "Regarding external defense, if war is justified,  the Armed Forces cannot react quickly and do not have the  operational capabilities to allow an appropriate and effective  response." In conclusion, Cavagnari defends the creation of a  Defense Ministry enclosing the four military institutions,  keeping the mandatory military service in addition to a  voluntary service, reequipping the Armed Forces, and continuing  strategic projects such as the Calha Norte Project, the nuclear  submarine project, the space mission, and the AMX fighter. The  most important proposal, and the most controversial, is the  enlargement of the military budget, from the current 0.5 percent  to 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Four times more.  Oddly enough, two days before finishing his project and soon  after the cries of the high command in December prevented the  budget cuts included in the economic plan of Finance Minister  Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Cavagnari in an interview with ISTOE  defended increasing the military budget from 0.5 to 0.75  percent. The cries of the military against the restrictions  Cardoso wanted to impose on their budget also encouraged the  approval on 4 January of a line of credit of $800 million for  the next four years for the purchase of Army equipment.    The PT wing in charge of the main contacts with the military  is known as "the two Joses." They are Sao Paulo Federal Deputies  Jose Genoino and Jose Dirceu who in some way are counterparts of  the generals and brigadiers because they participated with the  guerrillas against the military regime in the 1970's. Genoino is  a veteran in this type of contact but his position in a minority  group within the party has somewhat tarnished his star. Dirceu  is known for coordinating some kind of PT information service.  Another PT expert on military matters is Minister Secretary of  Strategic Affairs Mario Cesar Flores whose alias is Admiral.  Flores, who is often mentioned as the man to head a military  ministry under a PT administration, dismisses that by saying:  "It is just foolish speculation. There was never any contact."  It is known, however, that his friend Jose Genoino is the main  spokesman in Congress for Flores' proposal for reforming the  information services.    The officers' overriding concern in their talks with the PT  leaders is to know exactly who will be at the wheel within the  government if Lula is successful at the polls, since the most  leftist factions control the political party machine. A party  leader contends that "the commanders even accept the  establishment of a Defense Ministry, but are of the opinion that  putting an end to mandatory military service would lower the  quality of their cadres." It is within the Navy and the Air  Force that the PT finds itself more at ease to sail and fly. As  an influential PT leader says, "they are indeed against  authoritarian regimes because their activities largely hinge on  technological development, which dictatorial governments end up  by holding in check." Lula and his followers perceive that the  greatest troubles are to be found in the Army. Besides small  groups such as Our Homeland [Patria Nossa], from Rio de Janeiro,  or Fiend [Anhanguera], from Goias, the PT has pinpointed a  nucleus of hard-liners grouped around former Army Minister  [under Jose Sarney, 1989-1991] General Leonidas Pires Goncalves.  This nucleus allegedly includes General Benedito Leonel, the  Army chief of staff, who during the crisis that erupted due to  cutbacks in the military budget was the one who sounded a note  of warning about the danger of the "wrath of the legions." "The  PT candidate is not an utter disaster, but does not have any  administrative experience," says Gen. Pires.    Dirceu and Genoino frequent the world of the military with a  view to accomplishing two things -- discussing issues directly  with high- ranking officers, thus bypassing established  procedures in military hierarchy -- which makes the military's  hair stand on end -- and leaving Lula out of these contacts so  as to dispel the idea that the PT is knocking at barracks'  doors. Dirceu states that "neither the PT nor the other  political parties can politicize the Armed Forces, which are,  and ought to continue to be, professional." All the contacts  are made with the utmost secrecy. As the rapprochement with the  military is a volatile issue, it is feared that rumors of a  self-inflicted coup d'etat by Lula -- similar to the one  Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori spearheaded in 1992 -- will  be bruited about in order to tie the parliamentary opposition  hand and foot to prevent a possible PT government.    The breaking of that confidentiality law about the  rapprochement with the military earned Genoino and Sao Paulo  Deputy Aloiso Mercadante a stern rebuke from their colleagues  last December. Genoino did not try to conceal a visit he made to  [Strategic Affairs Secretary] Admiral [Mario] Flores to discuss  the constitutional reform. Mercadante, on his part, showed to  Army Minister General Zenildo de Lucena the evidence obtained by  the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee] proving  the involvement of leading firms of building contractors in the  budget scandal.    A general of the Army Staff who asked not to be identified  told ISTOE that "there is no mutual sympathy in the  rapprochement between the PT and the military. It is pure  pragmatism." "It is absolutely normal for the presidential  candidate of a party whose relations with the Armed Forces have  always been difficult to begin his campaign by calming us and by  trying to please us," added a colonel holding a high post at the  Secretariat of Strategic Affairs. "No one has talked as much  with the military as Tancredo Neves did," he concluded.  Historian Selma Rocha, who is preparing a master's degree thesis  entitled "The Brazilian Army Thought, 1964-1984," to be  submitted at the USP [University of Sao Paulo] School of  History, has another opinion. "Things have changed, because in  previous decades both leftist and rightist sectors sought to  attack the military. PT members seem to be willing, for the  first time, to make society debate on the subject and control  the Armed Forces," she said. Army spokesman General Gilberto  Serra made a drier remark. "The PT has merely realized our  problems the way no other party has, but it is not an ally, just  like no party is. Perhaps it is the PT which needs us as  allies," he said.    The facts of the matter are that now that the cold war is  over, except in some areas, the PT no longer appears in the eyes  of the military as the virus of the red danger. "We are not  concerned about ideological or party matters but about the  efficiency of the institution," said Colonel Luiz Henrique  Pirez, professor of the Army Command and General Staff School  (ECEME) of Rio de Janeiro, at which generals are trained.  Supreme Militry Tribunal president Brigadier Cherubim Rosa Filho  has said that "one of the factors that draws the PT and the  military close is that neither military officers nor PT  lawmakers are involved in the corruption scandals." He even  supported the bill submitted by PT Deputy for Sao Paulo Helio  Bicudo, ruling that regular courts should adjudicate the crimes  committed by the military against civilians.    The Superior Military School [ESG] itself, which at other  times was a center for training conservative cadres, is already  considering the possibility of Lula being elected. Says an ESG  document: "The most probable situation, which was chosen because  it is the most probable -- though not the most desirable -- is  an election that will put a leftist candidate in power through a  consensus that will include the following sectors: the largest  industrial entrepreneurs, the Armed Forces, civil organizations,  Congress, etc." The ESG stated that this alliance will cause a  conflict between Lula and the PT leadership.    ESG officers, with whom several PT members have engaged in  debates over the past few years ("Interest on the subject was  second only to the debates with Herbert de Souza, also known as  Betinho, the coordinator of the program against starvation," as  an officer put it), are other channels for contacts between the  PT leadership and the barracks. In this case, the PT  interlocutors are Rio de Janeiro state leader Cesar Queiroz  Benjamin, also known as "Cesinha," who is an ex-MR-8 guerrilla,  and sociologist Marco Aurelio Garcia, who is a Unicamp [Campinas  State University] professor and a former Troskyist leader. ESG  and PT members will meet in February to debate on a common  agenda of priorities. Cesinha has even sent a handwritten  message to one of the officers who is organizing the meeting  saying: "The idea to engage in a debate remains valid. It will  be before the national PT meeting, and Lula has already said he  liked the proposal very much. Greetings, Cesar." The message was  accompanied by a gift of two books: one on the environment, and  the other on the PT as an alternative leftist party.    The courtship between PT leaders and the military gained  ground during the two months in which Luiza Erundina headed the  Federal Administration Secretariat (SAF) last year. Erundina was  considered the goddess of the military, because she supported  their salary adjustment proposals. President Itamar Franco has  even reportedly charged Erundina with "promoting agitation in  the barracks." The command liked very much a decree drawn up by  Erundina banning the transfer of operational military real  estate properties, which former President Fernando Collor had  put on the market. The military believed that transfer of the  properties would paralyze the frequent transfers of contingents  from one state to another. Within the SAF, there are comments  that Itamar Franco reportedly designated General Romildo Canhim  to replace Erundina, not because of Canihm's links with  ex-president Sarney but to compensate the military for the loss  of their goddess.    But the rapprochement between the PT camp and the military  barracks is not all roses. Federal Deputy Jacques Wagner  (PT-BA) [Bahia] has stated that "I do not like this babbling at  all," adding that "the national party leadership is lurching  toward a big brawl with party affiliates." Colonel Cavagnari's  proposal to continue with the nuclear project (and the  nuclear-powered submarine) has triggered the wrath of the green  and ecologist faction within the PT, like Rio de Janeiro Deputy  Carlos Minc.    The public employees lobby, which has a lot of influence  inside the PT and the CUT [Sole Workers Center], does not accept  military demands to do away with the salary equality policy.  Federal Deputy Maria Laura (PT-DF) [PT-Federal District], public  employees' standard-bearer, has promised to oppose any proposal  to end salary equality.    While unhappy PT followers get ready to fight the party's  defense program, military hard-liners start cleaning their  sabers to oppose Lula. The hard-liners have the option of  promoting the candidacy of prestigious reserve officers in many  states [to legislative seats] and thus attracting the vote of  the military toward Lula's presidential adversaries. In Rio de  Janeiro, hard-liners are supporting General Euclydes Figueiredo  (brother of former president Joao-Batista Figueiredo) and  Colonel Pedro Rostey, from the PFL [Liberal Front Party], and  General Nilton Cerqueira (PP) [Popular Party], president of the  military club, to run for seats in the Chamber of Deputies.  General Newton Cruz, also known as "Nini," wants to run for Rio  de Janeiro's governorship but he still has not found a party  willing to support him. Brigadier Ivan Frota will run against  Rio Grande do Norte Deputy Flavio Rocha for the PL [Liberal  Party] presidential nomination. In the Federal District those  opposing Lula will concentrate their efforts on Colonel Kurt  Pessek's candidacy while Goias' radical group Anhanguera will  support Colonel Silesio Gusmao.    Hard-liners want to take the air out of Lula's campaign at  the barracks and prevent the emergence of new leaders such as  Captain and Deputy Jair Bolsonaro in Rio de Janeiro. Bolsonaro  is not liked for having mobilized officers' families at the  Military Village seeking better salaries. At this time Bolsonaro  does not have a party to support his candidacy because Deputy  Alvaro Valle vetoed his entry into the PL. "We recognized Lula  as president-elect. We have studies showing he is winning,"  Bolsonaro said. Lula, who tried hard to keep a very low profile  during the entire process of rapprochment with the military, has  started to speak up. During an interview by THE NEW YORK TIMES  on 27 December the PT candidate said: "The military are treating  us as if we already were the next government." Former President  Jose Sarney took advantage of the quote to ironically say: "If  that is true he should begin taking classes on how to answer  military salutes." We do not know anything about those classes,  but Lula is undoubtedly flexing his muscles.</p>

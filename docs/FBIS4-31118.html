			<p>CSO     [Text] The protesting miners of Dudar will not demonstrate  after all in front of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. The  demonstration planned for today has been canceled because,  through the mediation of the president of the Republic, the  trade union came to an agreement with the State Property  Management Corporation [AVRT], the owner of the Hungarian Power  Plants Trust [MVMT], we learned from Antal Schalkhammer,  president of the Interior Ministry Employees Trade Union [BDSZ].    The BDSZ planned a protest because the Bakony Power Plant  Corporation decided not to receive, as of April, the monthly  5,500 metric tons of coal for the power plant which they  contracted for with the Dudar Coal Mine because the demand on  the Inota Power Plant decreased by half. After the contract was  unilaterally terminated, the mine became insolvent; this, in  turn, endangered the jobs of 340 miners. Furthermore, the  situation of mining companies that were left out of the power  plant-coal mine integration program established through an  agreement between the government and the trade union in January  became impossible.    "The affected mines, the BDSZ, and the AVRT agreed yesterday  that with the help of independent experts they would prepare a  joint analysis of the possibilities for financing mines," Antal  Schalkhammer told NEPSZABADSAG. He added: In this way it will  become possible for mines not included in the integration  program to avoid being closed down. In the next two months, the  experts will scrutinize the situation of the mines. Until then,  the AVRT will help so that the miners can be paid. Furthermore,  the property management corporation introduced a motion that  requests submitted by mines to the Labor Ministry for personnel  power management assistance be evaluated quicker.    "Because the jobs of several thousand people are on the  line,  as a last resort I appealed to President Arpad Goncz," the BDSZ  chairman said. "Without the president's mediation, yesterday's  agreement could not have been concluded," he declared.</p>

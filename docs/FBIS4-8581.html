			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 14 (CTK) -- The International  Monetary Fund's (IMF) approach towards ex-premier Vladimir  Meciar's government was tougher than that towards the current  cabinet of Jozef Moravcik, Sergej Kozlik, deputy chairman of the  shadow cabinet of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS)  and the Slovak National Party (SNS) told journalists today.    The current cabinet has included "their shoe sizes" in many  economic accounts, he said. For the first quarter of this year  personal consumption as well as investment grew, prices  stabilized and gross domestic product also grew against the same  period last year, he added.    Kozlik described as confrontational the program of  Moravcik's  government and asked whether the current premier who formed the  government as a non-confrontational one, was not "under the  pressure of an artificially created opposition."    Commenting on rumors about the possible withdrawal of  further  deputies from the HZDS deputies' group Kozlik said that he  "could not see into deputies' mind." However, the deputies'  group apart, the HZDS was the most stable political party in  Slovakia, Kozlik said.    Spokesman for the shadow cabinet Ondrej Hanko attacked  Moravcik's government for its interference in the media and for  exerting pressure on it. SNS Chairman Jozef Prokes said with  regard to the pro-Meciar daily REPUBLIKA published by the  state-owned Slovak news Agency TA SR, that there should exist a  daily criticizing the government no matter who published it.  "Because there where no criticism exists, objectivity ends," he  added. Asked by CTK whether the state should finance the  publishing of REPUBLIKA Kozlik said: "It does not have to but it  can."</p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Gummer attacks US sanctions plan MR JOHN GUMMER, agriculture minister, yesterday attacked the US for threatening to retaliate in its dispute with the European Community over oilseed subsidies. Mr Gummer, in a Commons debate on reforming the Common Agricultural Policy, described as 'wholly unacceptable' the US action in preparing a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.08bn) list of EC products it may target for high import tariffs. He said the US would be acting illegally if the sanctions were put into effect. Two dispute settlement panels in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have found the EC at fault for subsidies of its oilseeds sector. The US plans to invite comment on the list before paring it to Dollars 1bn and implementing the tariffs.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEW DENVER NUGGETS SALE DEAL NEAR  </P> <P> Two Chicago businessmen have enlisted the financial backing of media executive  Robert Wussler to buy the Denver Nuggets, with the directors of Wussler's  company expected to vote on the deal today.  </P> <P> "We are confirming that we are in discussion to purchase the Denver Nuggets as  part of a partnership headed by Bertram Lee and Peter Bynoe," said Bob Hunter,  spokesman for Wussler's firm, Comsat Video Enterprises of Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> "Discussion has been under way for some time and is on a fast track," Hunter  told the Associated Press today. "It could be concluded within a matter of  days, even hours."  </P> <P> Lee and Bynoe brought Wussler into the picture to gain the monetary strength  they had lacked when their other proposal to buy the Nuggets from owner Sidney  Shlenker fell through last week.  </P> <P> The purchase would make Lee and Bynoe the first black owners of a major league  sports franchise, and the structure of the proposed deal calls for them to run  the team as managing partners.  </P> <P> Closing of the estimated $65 million deal was expected today in Washington,  D.C.  </P> <P> Hunter said Comsat is interested in purchasing the Nuggets "because it will  allow us to differentiate Comsat Video Enterprises from our competition and  allow us to capitalize on our ability to distribute live sports events.  </P></p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / BES successor nets first taker Tax breaks for investors introduced in last year's November Budget are to be exploited for the first time  - by a shipping company. Altnamara Shipping is believed to be the first company to plan an issue of shares under the Enterprise Investment Scheme, designed as a replacement for the defunct Business Expansion Scheme. The BES, introduced in 1983, was abolished at the end of last year after the Treasury lost patience with the way that tax incentives intended to encourage investment in high-risk start-up businesses were instead being applied to rental property schemes guaranteed by banks. BES loan-back schemes, which allowed investors in effect to withdraw their money after six months, rather than the usual five-year qualifying period, while still benefiting from the tax relief, were abolished by the Budget in March last year. The rules for the new scheme have been tightened up to exclude low-risk property schemes and limit the tax breaks to genuine trading companies. Investors are locked in for at least five years. Tax incentives under the enterprise scheme are less generous initially, but geared towards making the risk more palatable. The BES offered up-front tax relief of up to 40 per cent on investments of Pounds 40,000 a year, but no relief on losses, while the new scheme limits up-front relief to 20 per cent. But the annual allowance has been raised to Pounds 100,000, and losses can be offset against income or capital gains tax. Altnamara Shipping, which describes itself as Scottish-based, intends to purchase and operate a second-hand dry bulk carrier. The company was set up last year with capital of Pounds 420,000 raised under the BES.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Kevin Maxwell bankruptcy case adjourned MOVES which would make Mr Kevin Maxwell Britain's biggest bankrupt were adjourned again yesterday after a private hearing at the High Court lasting nearly three hours. Robson Rhodes, liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, issued a bankruptcy petition against Mr Maxwell after obtaining a Pounds 406.8m judgment against him in July. Mr Keith Oliver, Mr Maxwell's solicitor, said the matter had been adjourned 'until at the earliest, Thursday September 3'. He added: 'Given the private nature of the hearing, and the fact that the hearing continues, it would be inappropriate for Mr Maxwell to say anything.' The dispute before the court is over Robson Rhodes' use of an expedited procedure allowing a petition to be filed within the three weeks a debtor is normally given to comply with a statutory demand for payment of a judgment debt. The matter first went to the bankruptcy court on August 17, when it was adjourned until yesterday for the court to hear Mr Maxwell's opposition. Earlier yesterday the prosecution of Mr Kevin Maxwell, his brother Ian and their colleague Mr Larry Trachtenberg on charges of conspiracy to defraud and theft involving Pounds 135m was adjourned until December 1 by City of London magistrates. None of the men was present at the 1 1/2 -hour hearing at which the prosecution said it was hoped the case would be ready for transfer to the crown court early next year. All were remanded on conditional bail, Mr Kevin Maxwell on sureties totalling Pounds 500,000, Mr Ian Maxwell on sureties of Pounds 250,000 and Mr Trachtenberg on sureties of Pounds 300,000. The magistrates varied Mr Kevin Maxwell's bail condition which had required him to live either at 31 Jubilee Place, Chelsea, London, or at Hill Barn, Hailey, Wallingford, Oxfordshire after being told that the Chelsea house had been sold. Mr Maxwell must now live at the Oxfordshire property 'or at any address approved by the Serious Fraud Office with 24 hours' prior notice'.</p>

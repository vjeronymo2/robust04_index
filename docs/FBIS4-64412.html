			<p>BFN     [Text] Hans Stercken, the German parliament's Foreign  Affairs Commission chairman, has denied claims that German arms  are being used against the separatist terrorist organization in  the southeast. Stercken, who arrived in Ankara yesterday, met  with Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin.    In a statement he issued prior to the meeting, Stercken said  that he himself does not believe in these claims and added that  those who previously went to the southeast to carry out  observations were biased. Stercken further added that those who  maintained that German arms were being used against the  population in southeast Anatolia were prejudiced and not  interested in seeing Turkey live in peace.    Cetin, in turn, said that Turkey and Germany have  deep-rooted  and multidimensional relations and added that the two countries  should not be affected by the undesirable situations that may  arise from time to time. Pointing out that Turkey is determined  to resolve terrorism within the framework of democracy, human  rights, and a state of law, Cetin said that terrorism is a  significant threat to democracy.</p>

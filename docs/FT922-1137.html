			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / ANC sets terms to restart talks THE African National Congress last night broke off constitutional talks with the South African government, accusing it of bringing the country to 'the brink of disaster'. The ANC made clear, however, that it wished to keep the negotiating process alive. Many of the conditions set for the resumption of talks can readily be fulfilled by the government and seemed calculated to strike a balance between responding to black anger while not closing the door on a negotiated settlement. A statement issued after a day-long meeting of the ANC executive said there was 'no option but to break off negotiations'. The main demands attached to a resumption of talks include an international inquiry into the massacre of 42 people in Boipatong, an end to security forces' 'covert operations', prosecution of security personnel involved in violence, phasing out of township hostels, and a ban on carrrying dangerous weapons in public. The ANC declared next Monday a day of mourning to mark the Boipatong killings. 'The response and practical steps taken by the de Klerk regime will play a critical role in determining the direction and speed with which negotiations can take place', said Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ANC, reading out the statement at a Johannesburg press conference. ANC officials said they would continue to prepare the ground for 'mass action', such as strikes and demonstrations. The ANC renewed its demand for the creation of a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution and for the establishment of an interim government. The ANC decision brings to a halt, constitutional negotiations under the auspices of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), a multi-party forum whose second round of discussions ended in deadlock last month. A government response is not expected until after today's cabinet meeting in Pretoria. President F W de Klerk was due back in South Africa last night after cutting short his visit to Spain. At a press conference in Madrid before the ANC statement, Mr de Klerk criticised the organisation's irresponsible attitude in recent township violence. He said: 'To stage mass action and protest under such volatile circumstances. . . adds fuel to the fire and can easily erupt into violence.' 'While there is every hope progress can be made with negotiations, it is extremely unwise and borders on the irresponsible to create an atmosphere of greater tension and volatility.'</p>

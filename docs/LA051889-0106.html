			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Energy Department has been forced to delay the scheduled September opening  of a radioactive waste dump in New Mexico, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins  told Congress. Watkins told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the  Environmental Protection Agency had fallen far behind schedule in providing a  legally required verification that toxic wastes at the repository would not  migrate off the site. "We physically cannot get through this process until  November," Watkins said, adding that, under normal procedures, it would take  until next February before the EPA could hold public hearings on the waste  migration issue. He gave no new target date for opening the $800-million  underground repository near Carlsbad, N.M.  </P></p>

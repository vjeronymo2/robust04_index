			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> END URGED TO RASH OF DIAPERS  </P> <P> Declaring that "California needs a diaper change," Sen. Lucy Killea (D-San  Diego) on Wednesday unveiled a bill that would require environmental warning  stickers on packages of plastic disposable diapers.  </P> <P> The proposed legislation, Senate Bill 2342, would set up a toll-free "diaper  line" to advise parents on ecologically safe alternatives to disposable  diapers.  </P> <P> It would also prohibit child care centers from discriminating against children  whose parents opt for reusable cloth diapers.  </P> <P> Killea said she was introducing the bill because 2.5 million disposable diapers  were sent to dwindling landfills or thrown away as litter -- an output that  costs the state $56 million in disposal costs.  </P> <P> If parents were to switch to old-fashioned cloth diapers, or even those with  new Velcro fasteners, the savings over disposable diapers would be $1,500 per  child, she added.  </P> <P> "We've taken on aluminum, glass and plastic beverage containers," Killea said.  "We're recycling newspaper. We're moving forward on recycling oil and tires.  But no one wants to touch diapers."  </P> <P> Killea also said her staff called 266 child care centers and found that 26%  refused to take children whose parents prefer cloth diapers.

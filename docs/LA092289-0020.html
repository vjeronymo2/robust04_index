			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTH HOLLYWOOD MAN GIVEN 12-YEAR TERM FOR DAY-LONG CRIME SPREE  </P> <P> A 27-year-old North Hollywood man received the maximum sentence for a 24-hour  crime spree during which he attacked the wife of a state Court of Appeal  justice.  </P> <P> Anthony Mallotti was sentenced Thursday in San Fernando Superior Court to 12  years and eight months in state prison for five felonies, including the  residential robbery of Tanya Gates, wife of Appellate Judge Donald N. Gates.  </P> <P> Mallotti pleaded guilty last month to two counts of residential burglary, two  counts of grand theft auto and one count of kidnaping, with the special  allegation of great bodily injury to Tanya Gates.  </P> <P> Mallotti said he was high on cocaine throughout the crime spree, which began  June 29, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ken Barshop.  </P> <P> Mallotti broke into Gates' Northridge home and threatened to kill a maid if she  tried to stop him from stealing the Gates' possessions, according to court  documents.  </P> <P> When Tanya Gates arrived home and confronted Mallotti, he punched her in the  face, breaking her nose, Barshop said.  </P> <P> Mallotti fled in Gates' car, which he later abandoned. Early the next morning,  he hijacked a car driven by Javier Ortega in San Fernando. Holding him at  knifepoint, Mallotti forced Ortega to drive him around the area for several  hours in search of drugs and money, Barshop said.  </P> <P> Mallotti also ordered Ortega to call Ortega's friends and ask them to bring  money, according to court documents. Ortega contacted police, who arrested  Mallotti.  </P></p>

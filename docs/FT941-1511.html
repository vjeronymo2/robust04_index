			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Leakey decides to quit wildlife job Mr Richard Leakey, East Africa's foremost conservationist, yesterday abandoned his struggle to protect the Kenya Wildlife Service from political predators by submitting his second letter of resignation to President Daniel arap Moi. He said he would not run the KWS under new directives which could destroy years of pioneering work. 'The KWS dream of a self-financing, efficient, publicly owned but independent conservation authority does not seem viable in this context,' Mr Leakey said. He mentioned only two of the new directives: anti-poaching units, run successfully for the past four years by the KWS, would be placed under the authority of the Commissioner of Police; and that most KWS resources, including millions of dollars of donor funds, should be spent outside its wildlife sanctuaries. Mr Leakey returned to head the KWS, at the president's request, less than two weeks ago. He had offered his resignation in January, after charges of racism and corruption were directed at him by cabinet ministers and politicians. President Moi attempted to defuse the international uproar over his resignation by appointing a committee to examine the workings of the KWS. The committee's recommendations have not been made public, but they appeared designed to curtail Mr Leakey's independence, and to siphon off the millions of dollars of international aid he has raised to fund conservation projects in Kenya.</p>

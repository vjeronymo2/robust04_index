			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Murid Subhi report] </F>   [Excerpt] The Asyut security organs have arrested five  dangerous terrorists whose job it was to monitor the movements  of policemen and their houses in obedience to instructions given  them by fugitive terrorist leaders. The plan was to prepare for  a number of terrorist operations following the capture of some  of their leaders and the liquidation of others in armed clashes  with the police.    A responsible security source stated that these terrorists  were arrested during raids on dens of terrorism in the slum area  of al-Walidiyah in Asyut city. The raid was staged after a  terrorist element informed on this group that was shadowing the  movements of some police officers, watching their houses, and  reporting this information to those charged with implementing  the new terrorist plan despite the failure of most of their  criminal plans. The source added that the security forces are  continuing their encirclement of al-Walidiyah area, which is  regarded as a criminal and terrorist den in Asyut.    The raids resulted in the arrest of 23 active terrorists,  including two important terrorists from Abu Tij, and the capture  of two rifles, one Lee Enfield and a hunting rifle. [passage  omitted]</p>

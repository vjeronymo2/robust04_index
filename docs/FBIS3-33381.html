			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario </F> Cesar Flores by Tania Monteiro; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] [Monteiro] Won't President  Itamar Franco's decision to start Finance Minister Fernando  Henrique Cardoso's presidential campaign threaten voting on the  Social Emergency Fund [FSE]?    [Flores] I believe the president would like to see Cardoso  elected. There are different opinions on whether this was the  appropriate moment for Franco to comment on the issue, and I do  not want to go into this discussion. I do not believe, however,  that Franco did that to focus the country's attention on  something other than the economic crisis. I believe he talked  about the issue because deep inside this is what he wishes.    [Monteiro] His comments, however, had a different effect in  Congress.    [Flores] Congress reacts to everything. Those who oppose the  approval of the FSE and some items of the constitutional  revision supported by the economic team will use the opportunity  to oppose the plan. I earnestly believe that Cardoso's possible  presidential candidacy may become a reality. Nonetheless, we  cannot agree with those who use this possibility as a reason to  create difficulties in the debate and approval of the  constitutional revision issues. This is against the country's  interests.    [Monteiro] Would you vote for Fernando Henrique Cardoso?    [Flores] I will not answer that question.    [Monteiro] Your talks with Workers Party congressmen have  been prompting rumors that you might run with Luis Inacio Lula  da Silva.    [Flores] No one has ever discussed that with me. I have  never  been asked about this possibility, directly or indirectly. From  the candidacy viewpoint, this would be legally impossible  because I am not affiliated with any political party. This is  foolish speculation.    [Monteiro] Would you vote for Lula?    [Flores] One only chooses a candidate when the electoral  scenario is defined. Lula probably will be a candidate, but I do  not know who will be the other candidates. The problem is that  the Brazilian electoral process has a few inconveniences that  create a dramatic situation at the moment of casting a vote.  Instead of voting for someone I believe to be the best  candidate, I am forced to vote for the person who will be less  harmful to the country. So far, this is the way I have been  making my choices and this is bad for the political system.    [Monteiro] How do you evaluate the country's current  situation?    [Flores] Personally, I believe that if we do not overcome  the  constitutional revision bottleneck, we will lose control. There  is imbalance between what is asked from the government and the  government's capacity to answer the requests. This imbalance has  to be overcome in the constitutional revision. We cannot ask  from the government more than it has to give. If we continue to  ask the government for more than it has to give -- we are  witnessing this in the areas of social security, health, and  education -- we will end up in a very difficult situation. I  don't know what will occur. I believe, however, that emergencies  end up creating solutions. Therefore, if the governability  crisis becomes worse, we will have emergencies and the pressure  exerted by them will bring about solutions, which will be  political solutions.    [Monteiro] Could the solution be a military one?    [Flores] Absolutely not. A military solution is impossible  in  today's Brazil.</p>

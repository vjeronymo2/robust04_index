			<p>BFN     [Text] The Human Rights Committee of South Africa says  thedeath toll from violence in South Africa has dropped by 60  percent from 487 in April to 195 last month. The committee says  in a report that the decrease gives a clear signal that the  peace, which prevailed during the election days, has been  maintained. It says that despite ongoing tensions in  KwaZulu-Natal, violence has continued to drop in this region,  with the death toll last month being the lowest recorded by the  committee since January 1993.</p>

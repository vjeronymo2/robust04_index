			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / International Bonds: Debut Eurodollar deal for Cable &amp; Wireless Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK telecommunications group which last week reported a 30 per cent increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 509m (Dollars 750m), raised Dollars 400m yesterday through its first Eurodollar offering. Demand was such that the unrated borrower achieved a yield spread of 73 basis points over US Treasuries on its 10-year Eurobonds, at the tighter end of the indicated range of 73 - 75 basis points. The spread compared favourably with current spreads on other 10-year Eurodollar offerings launched recently by double A-rated UK companies. Traders said that the yield spread on National Power's Dollars 300m offering of 10-year Eurobonds, which was launched last week, stood at 70 basis points yesterday while the spread on the Dollars 500m offering of 10-year Eurobonds issued by BAT Industries on November 9 stood at 80 basis points. Mr Richard Wainright-Lee, director of corporate finance at C&amp;W, said the company was taking advantage of favourable market conditions. The proceeds of the offering would be used to finance the development of the company's business activities in eastern Asia, Europe and the Caribbean. However, he indicated that C&amp;W was unlikely to return quickly to the Eurobond market because it was not under pressure to raise funds. 'There is no heavy need to borrow,' he said. Lead manager JP Morgan said around 20 per cent of the bonds were placed in Asia, 15 per cent in the Middle East, 15 per cent with US offshore accounts, 30 per cent in continental Europe and 20 per cent in the UK. Elsewhere, Treasury Corp of Victoria injected badly-needed liquidity into the Australian dollar sector of the Eurobond market with its ADollars 500m issue of global five-year bonds, its second Australian dollar global bond offering this year. The bonds were priced to yield 12 basis points below the 12 per cent State Electricity Commission of Victoria's domestic bond due 1998. When they were freed to trade the spread remained intact. Lead manager Merrill Lynch said that 60 per cent of the bonds were placed with US investors.</p>

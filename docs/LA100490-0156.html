			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONTEREY PARK;  </P> <P> WAR VETERANS MONUMENT  </P> <P> A black polished granite wall monument memorializing war veterans will be  erected in the city and paid for with private donations, the City Council  decided Monday.  </P> <P> Names of Monterey Park residents killed in action will be engraved on the  monument, which was suggested by resident Frank Arcuri. The monument will cost  about $10,000, said Mayor Judy Chu. No location has been chosen yet.  </P> <P> The idea for a monument was proposed several years ago but was suspended in  1989 when then-Mayor Barry Hatch pushed for a city-funded $50,000 statue of  George Washington in front of City Hall instead. The Washington statue proposal  foundered when some residents objected because it would replace a 15-foot-high  sculpture of the Olympic torch.  </P></p>

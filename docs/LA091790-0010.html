			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE LEAVE BREAKFAST TO CHASE SUSPECT  </P> <P> That was to go, right?  </P> <P> Four uniformed Los Angeles police officers had just sat down to breakfast at a  North Hollywood restaurant Sunday morning when a man allegedly grabbed an  envelope full of cash from a drawer under the cash register and ran out the  door.  </P> <P> Abandoning their coffee, the officers gave chase and apprehended 30-year-old  Jerald Patrick McMurray of Studio City a few blocks from Sitton's Restaurant at  11329 Magnolia Blvd., Lt. Michael Ranshaw said.  </P> <P> Officers found $63 and McMurray was held in lieu of $5,000 bail on suspicion of  burglary.  </P> <P> "All I can figure is he just didn't see them sitting there," Ranshaw said.  </P> <P> The officers returned to complete their meal. It was on the house.  </P></p>

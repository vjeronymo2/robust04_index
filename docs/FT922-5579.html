Mr Eric Lyall, chairman, said the outlook was 'a little brighter' and added that provision had been made for losses on development operations following the decision to withdraw from that sector of the market. Administrative expenses were reduced by a further 10 per cent to Pounds 905,000 and would continue to fall with the reduction in activities, he said. There is no dividend.</p>

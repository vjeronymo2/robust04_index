			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Trade News: Caribbean seeks role as world's paperless tiger / A look at offshore data processing, the region's new 'clean' growth industry IN AN unpretentious factory building on the outskirts of the famed resort town of Montego Bay on Jamaica's north coast, the only discernable sounds are those of computer keyboards and the hum of air conditioners. Several people sit before rows of computer screens, entering data. It is neither an office nor a factory. In fact, the office is thousands of miles away, in New York, Toronto, London. This is the cutting edge of offshore information processing, a new industry in the Caribbean and one which countries in the region are exploiting as companies try to make the technological leap away from paper. 'There are 328bn paper pages in offices in the US and people are looking for better ways of handling these,' says Mr Taher Behbehani, director of US operations for the Information Technology Exchange Group. 'Conversion is costly because this involves substantial data processing. Offshore operations can reduce the cost of this.' Converting such data is only one part of the information processing market which Caribbean countries are seeking. The Dominican Republic, Barbados and St Lucia, in addition to Jamaica, are becoming centres for the offshore information processing industry. The services include processing airline tickets, insurance claims, mailing lists, coupons for credit card companies, banks and other financial institutions, hospital patient lists and electronic publishing, hotel and airline reservations and credit card authorisation. There is continuing and growing demand for other services such as custom-built software programming, voice applications, video conferencing, mapping and geological services and computer-aided designing for architects. In just one example, a subsidiary of American Airlines ships tickets to Barbados and the Dominican Republic where they are processed in computers and the information sent by satellite back to the US. High speed data transmission facilities - teleports - are being constructed in Jamaica, Barbados, St Lucia and the Dominican Republic. This allows the Caribbean to get a slice of the growing telemarketing or phone-based mail ordering industry. A call made in the US on an 800 toll-free line could be answered in one of these Caribbean states and the transaction completed in the US in a few minutes. The Jamaican teleport, located in Montego Bay, is a Dollars 8.5m (Pounds 4.9m) joint venture by American Telephone and Telegraph of the US, Cable and Wireless of the UK and Telecommunications of Jamaica. The teleport offers facilities for voice, facsimile and data transmission, toll-free services and voice-and-video tele-conferencing. 'We tell our prospective clients that if they can move it from the ground floor to the fifth floor, then they can move it from the ground floor to Jamaica for much less,' says Mr Winston Gooden, acting vice-president of Jamaica Promotions, the island's industrial development agency. The Caribbean faces competition from the Philippines, Ireland and Singapore, but feels it can get more than a small share of the fast-growing information processing market, in which Mr Lawson Nurse, a director of the Barbados Industrial Development Corporation, says US companies spend about Dollars 50bn per year. 'The information processing industry began here 25 years ago and has grown steadily,' says Mr Carl Clarke, Barbados' trade, industry and commerce minister. 'During the early period of the industry's development, the type of work done was basic and low-skilled. However, in recent years, there has been a definite shift to the higher value-added type of processing activities.' The Caribbean countries have been able to increase their share of the information processing market through lower wage rates, which are about a third of that paid for similar work in the US. Recent improvements in the region's telecommunications infrastructure have also helped. In addition to the teleports, companies such as Cable and Wireless have been upgrading several national telecommunications systems. Mr Gooden says the turnover of workers in the information processing industry in the US is about 35 per cent, while in the Caribbean a staff turnover of 5 per cent would be considered high. The accuracy level of workers in the Caribbean operations is significantly higher than that of those in the US, he claimed. The Caribbean countries also benefit from the pollution-free nature of the industry, which is environmentally compatible with their tourism.</p>

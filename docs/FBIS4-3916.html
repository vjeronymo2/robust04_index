			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] Plagued by corruption and disorder, China has  unveiled a new weapon in its war against the miscreants -- the  black placard. From now on, work units with a reputation for  wrongdoing will be disgraced by a black sign hung at their front  gates.    The new system was initiated last week in Haikou, the  capital  of Hainan province, where signs reading "bad social order work  unit" were hung outside seven government departments and  enterprises. Among the units forced to advertise their own  shortcomings were the provincial Goods and Materials Bureau, the  Haikou branch of the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Hainan  Fertilisers Factory.    "It's a way of putting social pressure on them to improve  their behaviour," Xu Wei, secretary to the mayor of Haikou,  said. "The police cannot exert this kind of pressure by  themselves." Wen Guangshou, deputy director of the Haikou  committee for comprehensive management of social order, adds:  "The police had many talks with these units but they did not  take any preventive measures." "We have no choice but to hang  the black signs," he said.    Most of the work units had been found guilty of embezzlement  several times over. Other black-listed units had suffered from  "social chaos incidents", Wen said. He did not elaborate. "By  hanging the black sign over the door, we are saying that if more  cases keep occurring the top leaders of the units will be  personally disciplined," he said.    It is probably no coincidence that the system has taken off  in Hainan first. The island was considered to be rife with  corruption and vice even before it became a province with  special economic zone status in 1988. It has been called the  "Wild West of of China". Watching street brawls is regular  entertainment for the pineapple-munching citizens of Haikou,  whose police force often respond by joining the crowd of  enthusiastic onlookers, or else accepting a small consideration  to forget the whole affair. The Haikou police dismissed 41  officers in the first half of last year for accepting bribes.    Wen said the black signs will be removed if the behaviour of  the seven work units improves in the second half of the year.  "At the end of this (lunar) year, we will select another group  of work units with social order problems and hang signs on their  gates," he said. Wen said those which depend on their reputation  with the public were least likely to get black plates. "When we  threaten a hotel with a black sign, it always acts quickly," he  said. "Otherwise nobody would want to stay there."    The system rings eerily similiar to the Cultural Revolution,  when "big character posters" were posted outside the homes and  work units of suspected wrongdoers. "The central government  made a decision last year to begin this system," Wen said.  "It's part of our national campaign to deal with certain  outstanding problems."    From a distance, the signs look like the ubiquitious wenming  danwei (civilised work unit) signs which the Communist Party has  handed out by the stackful since nationalising the economy in  the mid-1950s. "No, those signs are red. They are meant to  praise, not criticise," Wen explained. "Besides, the red signs  are usually hung inside the office where the workers can enjoy  them. With the black signs, they have no choice."</p>

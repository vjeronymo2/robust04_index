			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [G. Ballardin report: "Martinazzoli: Forza Italia's Leader </F> a Megalomaniac"]    [Text] Rome -- "There are indeed some strange coincidences  -- the timing, the investigation right before the election, the  threat of recourse to precautionary detention: All this prompts  [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi to imagine that there is a  political struggle behind it, but nevertheless we must have  confidence in the institutions," the Popular Party's Giuseppe  Gargani said. "I have been saying for some time that the  magistrates are going too far and that justicialism does not  pay," Giovanni Pellegrino -- senator and representative of the  PDS' [Democratic Party of the Left] extreme moderate wing --  said.    Liberal Alfredo Biondi urged Minister Conso to open an  inquiry in order to dispel any suspicions of interference in the  conduct of the elections. "A few days ago," Biondi said,  "Attorney Spazzali asked to have [PDS Secretary] Occhetto and  [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema called as witnesses in a matter  that needed to be clarified, but the court turned down the  request," deeming it "irrelevant." Now, however, the threat of  arrest is brandished even in seeking to discover on what terms a  football player has been bought and sold. The charge is leveled  that justice is being conducted by "alternating current."    The Liberals' Raffaele Costa, a Forza Italia candidate, also  condemned the judiciary, talking about "inquiries conducted  according to the clock." Ombretta Fumagalli Carulli, another  Forza Italia candidate and former member of the CSM [Higher  Magistrates Council], said: "The judiciary has decided to enter  the arena in this election campaign, and it is clear in favor of  whom. The rules of the law-based state are being destroyed: An  inquiry lasting over 16 months and referring to events in  1990-91 is reaching its final stage, just three weeks before the  elections." All this, while the Milan court considers the  evidence of Occhetto and D'Alema "irrelevant" in the Cusani  trial.    According to Gianfranco Miglio, the Northern League's  ideologue, "there is undoubtedly a tenacious attitude on the  part of the judiciary in pursuing certain individuals involved  in the political struggle," while National Alliance's  coordinator Gianfranco Fini criticized "sectors of the judiciary  closely associated with the left." In Genoa Bossi thundered:  "Bribe City is a sham; we have seen no proper sentences" (and  he repeated that the League represents the new and Forza Italia,  the old.)    But not everyone is attacking the judges. Some people defend  them, such as Communist Renewal Secretary Fausto Bertinotti or  former magistrate Giuseppe Ayala (Democratic Alliance): "It is  entirely untrue that the magistrates take orders from Violante  [anti-Mafia committee chairman], as is being whispered in  parliament. I am well acquainted with the world of the Italian  judiciary and I can assure you that such a hypothesis lies  beyond the realm of possibility." According to the PDS' Nicola  Colajanni, a former magistrate, Berlusconi is leveling charges  at the judiciary "because he confuses his economic enterprise,  Fininvest, with his political enterprise, Forza Italia, and this  prompts him to consider that a search carried out at his offices  constitutes a political attack; but it is not so." Massimo  D'Alema, PDS lower house floor leader, said: "The Fininvest  inquiry? I hope that there will be a sense of proportion on the  magistrates' part. I believe in the judiciary," Italian Popular  Party Secretary Mino Martinazzoli said. However, he then made  the following cutting remark about Berlusconi: "In an attack of  megalomania, he asked us to dissolve ourselves. He may be  confident that we will not do so." Former President Francesco  Cossiga cited [former President] Pertini, pointing out that  judges, and especially prosecuting attorneys, "must not only be  independent but also be seen to be so."</p>

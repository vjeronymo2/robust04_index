			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Arts: The innovative spirit of Salzburg - Will Gerard Mortier's reforms get the festival governors' seal of approval? By the middle of next week, Gerard Mortier should know whether he has won or lost his campaign to reform the Salzburg Festival. The festival's board of governors, dominated by public funding bodies, will decide on Tuesday whether there is enough money to cover Mortier's plans for next summer. If he is forced to reduce his programme of 20th century music, Mortier will probably leave when his contract as artistic director comes up for renewal in 1997. If his plans are approved, he will know that the revolution he led at Europe's premier festival is here to stay. The decision hangs on a knife-edge. Although Austria has suffered less from recession than neighbouring Germany, cultural subsidies have come under pressure as politicians adopt a hard-nosed approach ahead of national elections in the autumn. Mortier's reforms have not come cheap: this year's Sch505m (Pounds 30m) budget is nearly 25 per cent higher than in 1990. But self-generated income has climbed proportionately, and Mortier has always argued that a revitalised festival would serve Salzburg better in the long-term. The irony of the situation is that this summer's festival, now at halfway point, is one of the most successful ever. Despite a 20 per cent rise in seat prices, many more people are buying tickets for modern works than could have been predicted when Mortier arrived three years ago. The atmosphere is livelier, more contemporary, less formal than it used to be. Salzburg has regained the innovative spirit with which Max Reinhardt, Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss launched the festival in the 1920s. When Mortier's appointment was announced in 1989, Salzburg was still recovering from the death of Herbert von Karajan. Under his tutelage, the festival had become money-oriented, conservative and stagnant. Mortier's arrival was like an explosion. He publicly criticised Salzburg's business community, the record industry, the Vienna Philharmonic and major artists, accusing them of milking the festival to line their own pockets. He said he wanted a new public, more adventurous programming. Salzburgers raised their arms in horror, fearing the Belgian incomer would chase away their rich clientele. The dust has finally begun to settle. Mortier is less outspoken, more prepared to let his programme do the talking. 'People are starting to trust him now,' says Elke Polzer, owner of Salzburg's busiest ticket agency. 'They see there are just as many visitors as before. Any new intendant would have found it hard to follow Karajan, but Mortier had it particularly tough because he was so direct and provocative. Austrians prefer to speak in roundabout ways.' Behind the polemics, Mortier has kept much that is traditional. This summer's operas include Don Giovanni and Boris Godunov: the most expensive seats, priced Sch3,900 (Pounds 230), sold out when booking opened in January. Der Rosenkavalier and La traviata follow next year - even though Mortier believes repertory works are not a festival priority. He has kept Mozart performances in the 2000-seat Grosses Festspielhaus, knowing they would be better suited to smaller halls. The recital programme, headed by Jessye Norman and Anne Sophie Mutter, is as glamorous as ever. Mortier's most popular move has been to upgrade the drama programme, increasing the festival's appeal to its native German-speaking constituency. Drama now accounts for a quarter of seats sold, three times more than in the Karajan era. Peter Stein's production of Antony and Cleopatra, with Edith Clever as a middle-aged but charismatic Egyptian queen, has been one of this summer's biggest box-office draws, despite a battering from the press. Pirandello's The Mountain Giants, directed by Luca Ronconi, was both a popular and critical success. But the main battleground continues to be 20th century music. Here again, Mortier has been remarkably adept at creating a new audience. Some visitors have discovered they can only buy a ticket for Don Giovanni as part of a subscription including less popular works like The Rake's Progress; many ended up enjoying the lively Stravinsky staging more than the Mozart. Mortier has also introduced a youth subscription scheme, subsidised by Nestle and Asea Brown Boveri, which enables anyone under 30 to hear Boulez, Stockhausen or Birtwistle at a fraction of the advertised price. Mortier plans a new production of Lulu next summer and Moses und Aron in 1996. But these will be the first to disappear if money is tight. That is why he needs the wholehearted endorsement of his paymasters if he is to stay beyond 1997. 'He's proved that this repertoire is not a problem for the public,' says a close Mortier associate. 'The problem is political. He will not accept a situation where he is forced systematically to cut modern music and keep Rosenkavalier. He needs to be able to take risks, to plan adventurously. Otherwise the festival will be back where it was - little more than a commercially successful tourist event.' There are other unresolved problems. While Mortier has the support of most artists (and has patched up his differences with Riccardo Muti), he has reached only a temporary truce with the Vienna Philharmonic. The orchestra has signed an agreement putting a ceiling on its fees for the next three years, and guaranteeing stability of personnel from rehearsal to performance. But it remains extremely expensive, and Mortier has had no difficulty finding acceptable alternatives. Nikolaus Harnoncourt's cycle of Beethoven symphonies this summer, for example, was given by the Chamber Orchestra of Europe - whose virtuoso vitality put their Viennese colleagues in the shade. Although the Philharmonic has the powerful Viennese press on its side, it is running short of bargaining chips. A Shostakovich programme two weeks ago showed how ill-equipped it was to tackle 20th century music without lengthy rehearsals. As resident orchestra at the Vienna State Opera during the winter season, its players look forward to spending the summer in Salzburg, and many have bought holiday houses there. A boycott of the festival would upset their lifestyle. Mortier's other bete noir is Claudio Abbado, artistic director of the Easter Festival. The two seem unable to communicate or coordinate their plans. There has been speculation that if Mortier resigns, the quiet-spoken, politically astute Abbado would be first choice to take his place. That would reunite Easter and Summer festivals under one all-powerful conductor. It would restore the old axis between Salzburg and Berlin, where Abbado is chief conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. And - without ditching all of Mortier's innovations - it would give Salzburg the chance to crown a new king in the Karajan mould.</p>

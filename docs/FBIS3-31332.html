			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Enes Ratkuzic and Faruk Hajtac from Mostar] </F>   [Text] Unfavorable weather conditions for carrying out  combat operations and the significantly more energetic approach  by the world factors, have obviously (?influenced) the behavior  of the aggressor's military forces in Bosnia. Sporadic, or  rather rare small arms provocations and a few mortar shells  directed at the demarcation lines represent the main  characteristics of the aggressor's activity in the operational  zone controlled by the 4th Corps units in the past 24 hours.    However, no one seriously believes in the swift and  permanent  return of peace to these areas. Namely, despite the cease-fire  and negotiations between the two sides in Medjugorje, the  Ustashas yesterday continued carrying out their policy of ethnic  cleansing by expelling another 10 civilians to the left bank [of  the Neretva River]. Therefore, it is obvious that the Croatian  side has not given up its infernal plans and the intention of  making the area Croatian.    This has been Enes Ratukuzic and Faruk Hajtac reporting for  Radio Television Bosnia-Herzegovina from the 4th Corps  Information Service.</p>

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Technology: Shared vision of IT Conventional wisdom about the respective roles of the chief executive and the information technology director in the successful exploitation of computing in business is challenged in a new study from the Oxford Institute of Information Management. The study was undertaken to examine the factors which could help to create a good relationship between the chief executive and the IT director. It is now generally accepted that a successful relationship is a key factor in the effective exploitation of IT. Yet the study found that: A background in marketing or general management is more likely to lead a chief executive to an effective 'vision' of the value of IT than hands-on experience. This contradicts the view that top managers would only come to appreciate IT if they had practical experience. IT directors with a background in data processing are more likely to form a successful relationship with their CEOs than business line managers placed in top IT management jobs. This might seem obvious; but there is a well-known 'culture gap' between computing specialists and line managers. It is not necessary for the IT director to report directly to the CEO as long as he or she is part of the top management team. The study, carried out by David Feeny and colleagues at Templeton College, was carried out under the Impact Programme, now sponsored by KPMG Management Consultants. The study suggests that a successful relationship between CEO and IT director derives from a common vision of computing as a way of conferring competitiveness on an organisation rather than merely automation and efficiency. The relationship can be improved if the CEO sets aside time to explain his attitude to the IT director, if the IT director is a member of the company's 'cabinet' and if the two executives spend time away from the office discussing business goals.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava, Feb 16 (CTK) -- The Slovak Parliament  today rejected a government proposal that parliamentary  elections in Slovakia be held in June.    69 deputies voted for the government proposal which  reflected  the will of a group surrounding Slovak Premier Vladimir Meciar  that elections are called as soon as possible. 49 deputies  voted against the bill and 30 deputies abstained from voting.  90 votes of the 150-member parliament were needed for the bill  to be approved.    A deputies' proposal for calling early elections in November  which reflects the stand of the opposition will be voted on  tomorrow.    The Slovak opposition did not have enough strength today to  push through a proposal to call early elections in November.  However, further voting on the date for early elections is  expected tomorrow.    The opposition proposal was not supported by deputies from  the Hungarian minority parties which make their support  conditional on providing to them guarantees that Hungarian  ethnic minority demands will be met.    Peter Weiss, chairman of the Democratic Left Party (SDL),  the  strongest opposition party in Slovakia, told journalists after  voting that the date for parliamentary elections should be  decided and an amended privatization law should be passed prior  to speculation about a new government which would act until  elections.    Parliament will continue its work tomorrow with a debate on  an amended law on large privatization.</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Bandsman on the run - Nick Garnett finds a company that aims to scale the heights DAVID Haines opts for a subdued pitch when he blows his own trumpet. He could be forgiven for warbling a lot louder. An energetic Welshman with a penchant for permed hair, he studied at the Royal College of Music and, capable on a wide range of brass and wind instruments, was bandmaster at Repton public school for nine years. Then, in 1967, an initial investment of Pounds 750 bought him a share of a music shop in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire. The business, Normans, has six shops these days and has given him a converted farmhouse in 10 acres, a helicopter, and a new Jaguar whenever he wants one. Now owned outright by him, it is one of Britain's largest retailers of musical instruments with a yearly turnover of Pounds 5m. Haines' entrepreneurial instinct was shown more recently when he and his wife, Pam, transformed a potentially serious threat to the company's future into what is now virtually a new enterprise. In only four years, this latest venture has grown to generate annual turnover of Pounds 1.75m and will provide all the company's future growth. Haines explains: 'My main worry in the late 1980s was changes in government funding, which meant that schools were having to take control of their own budgets. 'If local authority music instruction teams - what we call peripatetic teachers - were disbanded, that would hurt demand for our products. Those teachers effectively controlled 90 per cent of the educational instrument market.' The point, says Haines, is that most of the company's sales are to school-children and the parents who encourage them to start blowing wind instruments or twanging guitar strings. If school music teaching were curtailed because of shrinking budgets, instrument sales could plunge. Haines tackled this with some novel ideas which provide a few lessons in the art of franchising. First, the company started a leasing arrangement by which parents could hire, and then buy, instruments through monthly Pounds 13 subscriptions over a three-year contract. Second, Normans started winning contracts to supply part-time music teachers to schools, eventually farming out these teachers into a full-time franchise operation. Under the leasing scheme, there are 30 in-school lessons in the first year; in the second and third year, instruction costs Pounds 28.50 a term. The hirer gets to own the instrument after the third year. This compares with a typical purchase cost of around Pounds 200 for a trumpet or clarinet from one of Normans' shops - around double what the company pays to buy it from its main US supplier. Some 190 schools (all primary and junior) and 3,100 children now have instrument instruction from teachers employed under the franchise system. This makes money for the company and boosts instrument sales. 'The aim is to have 10,000 kids learning instruments with us by 1995, so the Pounds 1.75m turnover will be up at Pounds 4m,' says Haines. To attract parents to its leasing scheme, the company first canvasses head teachers. But the scheme itself is sold by the company's six salesmen, who visit schools and talk to parents in the evenings. Haines says: 'Out of 3,000 people joining up, only four have defaulted on payments.' The scheme hinges on teaching, though, and it is here that Haines has scored most effectively. At first, he employed half a dozen teachers directly, but there were 40 by the start of this year. 'This could not be controlled by us,' says Haines, 'so we decided to use a franchise system where the franchisee organises the teaching in schools under our overall supervision.' The company now has six franchisees and expects to have 20 by the end of next year. Each plays an instrument and acts as a co-ordinator. The target is for each eventually to control another six teachers, with 900 children under tuition. Each pays Normans Pounds 12,000 and, for this, the company provides catalogues, eight instruments for demonstration, help on teacher time-tabling, and cash-flow forecasts. The bait is a target net income for the franchisee of Pounds 25,000 a year after three years. A few headaches have interrupted the new venture. Some county councils seem keen to block Normans' business in senior schools (one court action brought by Haines is now pending) while leasing and teaching arrangements are still confined largely to the Midlands and north. But Haines is confident. 'There are 37,500 primary schools in the UK and at least 500,000 children under 11 playing musical instruments,' he says. 'So, there is a lot of potential out there for us.' While the company's goal is to make money, Haines easily persuades visitors that he has an altruistic interest in seeing more children play instruments. His showroom in Burton-on-Trent houses a music school and he still teaches occasionally at his home. Normans, Unit 1, Moor Street, Burton-on-Trent, Staffs. Tel. 0283 35 333.</p>

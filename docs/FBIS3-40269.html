			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Pavol Hagyari, chairman of the Conservative </F> Democratic Party, by R. Ruzickova; place and date not given:  "First Goal--Get Into the Parliament; Second Goal--Win the  Elections"]    [Text] The Conservative Democratic Party [KDS] is one of  the parties that only came into existence after the June  elections--on the ruins, so to speak, of the former Public  Against Violence [VPN]. Therefore, it is one of the parties that  so far have had no possibility to try for a seat in the  parliament or the government, and, as is known, it has not the  most modest of goals for the future in that respect. We talked  about where it is coming from and where it is aiming with its  chairman and active participant in the area of justice, trade,  as well as production, Dr. Pavol Hagyari:    [Hagyari] I'll begin with the reason why we came into being.  Since the political right lost in the election because of its  fragmentation, this orientation in effect totally lost its  influence in the solving of society's problems. We conceive and  constitute ourselves as a conservative party positioned between  the center and the right, and when we look at this area of the  political spectrum today, we see there, besides us, practically  only the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the  "pseudoright" Slovak National Party [SNS], which embraces the  right in words, but if I am to judge it by its concrete actions  in the parliament--that is, according to its voting on important  laws--then it really is not particularly noted for its right  orientation....    [Ruzickova] Not even Cernak's wing?    [Hagyari] Mr. Cernak, besides the rightist rhetoric, also  knows where SNS should be aiming as a party of the right. Maybe  there are a few more people like that around him, but for the  time being it is difficult to say how the party will actually  develop. Somehow it has not yet crystallized. But I shall go  back to the characteristics of our party, which I mentioned at  the beginning. If we also categorize KDH as a rightist and  conservative party, it should also be said that it speaks to its  followers on the denominational basis. Whereas we cast ourselves  as a civic party. We would like to appeal to the right-oriented  citizens who, let's say, do not share with KDH a common view on  the questions of faith, abortion, and attitude toward the Slovak  state. We have already merged with the former Civic Democratic  Party [ODS] on the basis of this common objective and signed an  agreement on integration with the Democratic Party [DS]. When  you realize that together this political right gained 10 percent  of votes in the last elections, and you add to it our effort not  to engage in needless politicking and philosophizing but to  really pursue practical politics directed at the citizen, I  believe that our plans for the future are not unrealistic even  though they are not, I admit, modest.    [Ruzickova] Will you disclose them?    [Hagyari] We make no secret of them. In the next  elections--and I should point out that I think it should be  early elections--we want to become a parliamentary party, and  even to win as an integrated right the next elections after  that. Because if we want to achieve our goals, we must be in  power. But we are not looking only at the parliament, we are  also systematically preparing ourselves for the local elections.  I can say that today the majority of mayors in towns sympathizes  with us; 90 percent of them are right-oriented. By joining with  DS, we gained influence also with mayors in those communities  where DS is in a good position. Specifically in order to be  useful to them, we are now formulating an agricultural program.  We are making a great effort to bring prominent people into our  party, because without them and their appearances and statements  in the media, we cannot influence public opinion. We hold to the  principle that a person must already be in some respect  prominent when entering politics. He or she must already have  the image of an expert, an influential entrepreneur, or a public  official. We do not want it to be the other way around--that  only through being active in politics they become prominent.    [Ruzickova] Your effort to bring in prominent people  obviously stems from the fact that many known representatives of  VPN, ODS, and DS are actively engaged in KDS--therefore  rightists who lost in the elections, and although they are very  active even now within the KDS, nevertheless, it would probably  not be very good tactics for them to work too arduously at  making themselves "visible" so soon after the election debacle.  But I cannot altogether agree with you when you place primary  importance on personalities. I believe that the  citizen--especially after the innumerable disappointments with  beautiful words and promises--will be paying more careful  attention in the next elections to the programs. And the  programs are what particularly interests us, all the more so  because you are talking about helping entrepreneurs and  transforming the economy, but in the same breath you are also  talking about solving the problems of retirees, health care, and  education. How do you propose to reconcile these interests and  needs that are more antagonistic than synergetic? When our  society, which is in the beginning stage of transformation, is  faced with overcoming cutbacks, difficulties, and failures until  we reach a certain degree of growth? Of course, a populist  program, which only promises that everything will be fine, would  be a mistake. No. The program must also say that there will he  hard times. And a program for overcoming the hard times needs  arguments and prominent people who know how to present the  program and convince people. What, then, in brief are the  characteristics of the individual parts of your program?    [Hagyari] It is essential to tell the truth. Even an  unpleasant truth, so that people would at long last understand  that socialism is really gone. But because there are actually  areas that always and everywhere have to be subsidized, it is  all the more important to think about creating resources. To do  that it is possible to stay with the tried-and-tested approaches  that are in fact used everywhere, and those form the basis of  our programs. They are antistatism, that is, minimizing the role  of the state, anticollectivism, because it was never  progressive, and anti-egalitarianism--which means, the principle  that people are equal under the law but are not equal in their  abilities. We place emphasis on the individual, that is, the men  or women who are able to lead, who know how to take care of  themselves but also of others. The most important is the  economic program....    [Ruzickova] And what about education, for example?    [Hagyari] We propose to minimize state expenditures for  education, establish as many private schools as possible, and,  since we are now talking about the social sphere, privatize  health care. The social sphere is dependent on the economic  sphere, therefore there can be no miracles, they do not exist.  The foundation is the economic program based on privatization by  all the methods.    [Ruzickova] But privatization affects the former socialist  properties. It includes the large enterprises. And as we know,  in every good economy the smaller enterprises are the  foundation. The middle stratum. But it has to grow from  different roots, not from the privatization of the giants, but  from increased private entrepreneurial activity. What mechanisms  do you have ready to help this middle stratum come into  existence? Meaning small workshops, medium-sized workshops,  smaller factories.    [Hagyari] We already have the middle stratum. It was being  formed during the small privatization. I myself am the co-owner  of a small factory, which I acquired in 1991. Since that time,  we substantially increased wages in it and invested in the  development of technology. Truly, the best way to achieve growth  leads through small and medium-sized enterprises. But here we  find ourselves in a vicious circle that we have to break out of.  The small and medium-size enterpreneurs do not have sufficient  credit resources, because banks are still providing loans to  unproductive state enterprises.    [Ruzickova] And the solution?    [Hagyari] Bankruptcies! I do not think that bankruptcies are  some kind of tragedy. An enterprise declares bankruptcy, a  competent entrepreneur appears and buys the factory. He will be  interested in doing well, so he obtains the technology and  employs people again. The second possibility is to bring in  foreign capital. But that requires stabilization of the  political scene. Our party has represented itself from the  beginning as a party that wants to benefit precisely the  entrepreneurial sphere. We enjoy very good cooperation with the  Party of Enterpreneurs and Small Businessmen, and are thinking  about integrating with them. We do not think, you see, that a  special party of enterpreneurs has any prospects; unfortunately,  nowhere in the world are such parties in power. And so we are  making an effort if not to directly integrate with them, at  least to create a bloc of the right.    [Ruzickova] What specifically have you already done for the  small and medium-size entrepreneurs?    [Hagyari] Our economic program is based on creating the best  possible conditions for entrepreneurs. Since we are not a  government party, we at least make proposals in the legislative  sphere that are in their interest. We pointed out, for example,  that the law on land is contrary to the spirit of the  Constitution, that the penal code incorrectly establishes  criminal responsibility for unintentional failure to pay tax,  and we initiated the protest against mandatory settlement of  claims through Fizako. Our proposals are presented as  initiatives for the Constitutional Court.    [Ruzickova] How do you want to cooperate with the Democratic  Alliance, and what possibility do you see for cooperation with  the liberal wing of HZDS [Movement for Democratic Slovakia]?    [Hagyari] I already said that we are ready to create a  rightist bloc. There will be official discussions with the  Democratic Alliance of the Slovak Republic following their  congress. I believe that we will find points on which we agree.    [Ruzickova] I would also like to ask about your foreign  contacts. You indicated that you are endeavoring to become  members of suprastate, supranational central organizations.  Which way do your lean? Toward the liberal or the conservative  ones?    [Hagyari] We are a conservative-liberal, or to put it  another  way, a neoconservative party, and we have applied for membership  in the European Democratic Union. There they welcomed our effort  to integrate the Slovak right and promised us support not only  moral but also specific. They will organize various educational  seminars here. We are interested in becoming members of the  European Democratic Union.    [Ruzickova] If you succeed in that, it will certainly  increase not only the international but also the domestic  standing of KDS, which you head. Your main goal--success in the  elections--will nevertheless depend on whether you find the  correct, balanced, and for other parties acceptable way for  integrating the right. No matter how cautionary the election  loss caused by the fragmentation of the right is, its memory by  itself certainly will not be enough to unite the right.    [Hagyari] It would be ideal if on the right spectrum of the  political scene we had only one or two parties; but, such a  situation pobably will not exist here for a long time yet. As I  said at the beginning, if the right is in fact represented by  KDH and us, I think that KDH should address its people on the  denominational principle, and we should address ours on the  civic principle. We already succeeded in integrating with ODS  and DS, which today also includes the former Movement for  Understanding Between Czechs and Slovaks. I think that  considering the Slovak conditions it is quite a good  accomplishment. I believe that the Party of Enterpreneurs and  Small Businessmen will also identify with our goals. We have an  almost identical economic program with KDH, and their social  program was formulated by one of our members. It is a strong  movement. So far they have not expressed their view on the  coalition of rightist parties--we are really ready to begin  discussions on forming the rightist bloc at a moment's notice.  It would be a good thing if the entire right were to succeed in  uniting. Finally--the acid test of such tactics could come  already in the local elections....</p>

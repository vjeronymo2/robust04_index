			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 16 Apr (ITAR-TASS) -- After the meeting of  the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid  Kravchuk, where an agreement on a stage-by-stage settlement of  the Black Sea fleet issue was signed, the Ukrainian side has  begun to interpret the accords that have been achieved in its  typical cavalier manner. Even before the talks provided for in  the agreement, where the parameters of how the fleet is to be  divided are to be discussed, the Ukrainian side began to put  forward through the mass media its own options of the lease  itself, its length, and the locations where the Russian Black  Sea Fleet is to be based, says a statement by Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the press secretary of the Russian president. In it,  Kostikov said the following:    Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday stated during the  talks that he does not accept the haggling tone, which is  lowering the level of relations and trust. The Russian side has  to remind Ukraine once again about the harsh realities and  imperatives that underline the agreement just signed. Careless  words and actions are out of place here when the Black Sea Fleet  is at stake. Moscow urges the Kiev politicians and the military  not to embark on unilateral actions that could cast doubt on the  sincerity of the negotiation process.</p>

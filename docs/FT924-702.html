			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / UK Company News: DCC offer values Wardell Roberts at IPounds 17m DCC, Dublin-based industrial holding group, has made a recommended bid for Wardell Roberts, the Irish snackfood and healthfood distributor, just a week after backing a IPounds 24m management buy-out of Printech, a printing supplier to the computer industry. The cash offer at 75p per share represents a 25 per cent premium over the last dealt price of 60p and values Wardell at IPounds 17.2m. DCC already holds a 29.9 per cent stake in the company. The buy-out vehicle will be Oare, a DCC shelf company, and 20 per cent of its shares will be held by existing managing shareholders in Wardell. Guaranteed loan notes linked to the Dublin interbank rate (Dibor) are available in lieu of cash. Mr Jim Flavin, chief executive of DCC, said that the bid was part of DCC's strategy to create 'a focused industrial and financial holding company'. He said that DCC had built up cash reserves of IPounds 35m over the past 18 months 'and the time has come to invest that'. Shares in both Printech and Wardell Roberts have been languishing and their continued listing on the London and Dublin stock exchanges 'are not serving shareholders' or the companies' interests in any way', he said. He believes that both will show better profit performance as part of the larger group, rather than as stand-alone second-line companies with little market interest being shown in them. Wardell Roberts joined the unlisted securities market in 1986, and obtained a full listing in October 1991. Its pre-tax profits for the last financial year were IPounds 2.4m on a turnover of IPounds 45.1m. Its share price has fallen by half since the beginning of the year. Three weeks ago DCC spent IPounds 4.9m in increasing its stake from 8.2 per cent to 11 per cent in Fyffes, the UK and Irish fruit and vegetable wholesaler, buying the additional 7.7m shares from the McCann family, which sold them to repay borrowings.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Betterware shares hit by 8% fall in sales Shares in Betterware fell by 7p to 97p yesterday after the direct home-shopping group revealed that first-quarter UK sales were 8 per cent lower than a year earlier. The fall reflected teething problems associated with the opening of a new distribution centre and consumer uncertainty. The decline follows a warning in May when Betterware announced its full year results. That warning prompted the shares to fall by 5p to 123p. Yesterday Mr Walter Goldsmith, chairman, told the annual meeting that the trend in the second quarter was improving with growth about 1 per cent higher. Overall sales for the first 18 weeks were down 6 per cent on a like-for-like basis. Mr Goldsmith said the problems at the new distribution centre were now over and predicted that if the present trend continued the short-fall would be made up over the coming months. Pentos, the specialist retailer which raised Pounds 45m through a 4-for-3 rights issue at 25p earlier this year, confirmed yesterday that it would report a substantial loss for the first half of 1994 reflecting a number of factors. However, Sir Kit McMahon, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that this should represent, 'the bottom of the cycle for Pentos'. The shares closed unchanged at 25 1/2p.</p>

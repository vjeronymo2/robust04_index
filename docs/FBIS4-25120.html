			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Norihisa Sawaki] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 16 May -- A reliable Chinese source  disclosed on 16 May that Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount  leader, has recently criticized President Jiang Zemin by name  for "being bent on forming a faction in an attempt to solidify  his power base." Until now Deng has backed Jiang as his  successor to lead the collective leadership of China. President  Jiang, however, has taken a conspicuously tough stance and has  abandoned his conventional moderate attitude. Deng's response  has been to "rebuke" President Jiang out of fear that his change  of attitude could lead to a split in the CPC.    It remains unclear when Deng issued his criticism of  President Jiang, but the same source said Deng's accusation was  that President Jiang was trying to form a "new Shanghai group."  Early last year President Jiang appointed Ba Zhongtan, one of  his confidantes, as commander of the armed police force. In  response, Deng said: "Efforts should have been made to look for  capable persons among the whole nation, without any attempt to  build factions," adding that he had not been briefed in advance  on the recent shakeup of the military and the police.    President Jiang visited Shanghai for 11 days beginning 26  April. According to the same Chinese source, Jiang visited the  city with the aim of solidifying his power base.    President Jiang served as mayor and secretary of Shanghai  city from 1985 to 1988 and Ba served as commander of the  Shanghai Garrison during that period. Deng named Jiang as  general secretary of the CPC after General Secretary Zhao Ziyang  was ousted from power in the wake of the Tiananmen incident.  Deng gave Jiang the post of chairman of the CPC Central  Military Commission despite his lack of military experience.  Jiang became president last March. Deng is believed to have  approved of Jiang's rise in party and government ranks after  concluding that, as a moderate, Jiang was the best qualified to  lead the Chinese collective leadership in the post-Deng era.    President Jiang has become so powerful that he has exercised  his influence over the military and police shakeup. Deng told a  March session of the National People's Congress: "We should not  fear hyper growth."    In contrast, President Jiang and Premier Li Peng, a  conservative, insisted on curbing growth at 9 percent.</p>

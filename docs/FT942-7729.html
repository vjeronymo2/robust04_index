			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Murray Johnstone halts launch due to demand doubts Murray Johnstone is postponing the launch of a smaller company investment trust because of doubts over the level of investor demand. The Murray Acorn Trust earlier this month announced plans to raise up to Pounds 60m to invest in small companies capitalised at up to Pounds 50m, and some venture capital projects, such as management buy-ins. But yesterday Mr Alastair Stewart, one of the intended managers of the fund, said that after presentations to potential investors, the company decided not to proceed. 'We did not have enough indications of institutional support to give us confidence to continue with the public offer,' he said. Plans for the launch could be revived at a later stage if market conditions changed. Mr Philip Middleton, investment trust analyst with Smith New Court, said he was surprised at the development. 'Murray Johnstone is a capable management house,' he said. However, he added that the current state of the market made it difficult to launch new trusts. 'You are pushing water uphill to get an investment trust away just with institutions, and the retail market has been very slack recently. There have been a number of issues which have not been able to raise the amount they wanted.' Records were set earlier this year for the amount of money raised by new investment trust issues, but since the first rise in US interest rates in February, investors have been much more cautious. The oversupply of funds in the smaller company and venture capital area may also have been a factor. Several new and established smaller company and venture capital trusts have raised new funds recently, and the proposed Acorn launch was overshadowed by the imminent flotation of 3i, the venture capital fund. 'A number of people looked forward to the 3i issue and felt they might keep their powder dry for that,' Mr Stewart said.</p>

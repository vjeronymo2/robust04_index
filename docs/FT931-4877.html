			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BPI in Pounds 8.4m acquisition of rival BRITISH Polythene Industries, the acquisitive polythene film products maker, yesterday announced an 18 per cent advance in pre-tax profits for 1992, an Pounds 8.4m acquisition, and a rights issue to raise Pounds 20.6m. Pre-tax profits were pushed ahead to Pounds 12.1m (Pounds 10.3m) on turnover up at Pounds 177.2m (Pounds 156.1m). Some Pounds 400,000 for redundancies was subtracted giving operating profits of Pounds 14.5m, up 13 per cent. The company has made eight acquisitions since its Pounds 15.5m rights issue in 1991. The current one, its ninth, is the business of Sonoco Polysack Europe from Sonoco, its US parent. Mr Cameron McLatchie, chairman and chief executive, said Sonoco was BPI's biggest competitor in the retail sector. He said he was not concerned about OFT considerations because of the customer-driven nature of the business. He said the acquisition would lift BPI's market share in carrier bags from 16 to 24 per cent. BPI is to acquire Sonoco's Telford business for Pounds 6.7m cash and the non-trading Danish subsidiary which owns plant and equipment, for Pounds 1.7m cash. In the year to November 30 the Telford business incurred a trading loss of Pounds 385,000 (Pounds 1.56m) on turnover of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 8m). The current rights is on a 1-for-6 basis at 405p per ordinary share and 313 ordinary for every 4,000 convertible preference. The shares slipped 4p to 484p. After the acquisition and paying down current borrowings of about Pounds 22m, BPI will have about Pounds 11m of debt. A final dividend of 6.5p makes a total of 10p (9p), payable from earnings of 25.82p (23.79p). COMMENT The 1-for-6 cash call, rather than, say, 1-for-3 a little later, suggest that one or two juicy acquisitions could be in the pipeline. And that's on top of the Sonoco deal which is clearly a logical and positive move. It puts the very focused BPI, six times larger than its nearest competitor, in a much stronger strategic position and should be earnings-enhancing. Margins will improve with the most troublesome competitor out of the way and as general raw material prices rise. Pre-tax forecasts for 1993 range between Pounds 14.6m and Pounds 15.5m. If earnings per share are 27p, the multiple will be 17.5, if 29p, then 16. Investors will have no trouble deciding to take up their rights in full.</p>

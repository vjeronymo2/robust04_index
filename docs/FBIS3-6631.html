Six members of the  Parliament, representing the coalition of the Mongolian National  Democratic Party and the Mongolian Social Democratic Party, have  stopped participating in work of the spring session of the State  Great Hural. On Wednesday [16 March] they announced that they  would not participate in the session till the Parliament  discusses the initiatives of the president of Mongolia, which he  has put forward in his speech at the opening of the SGH session,  and adopts a corresponding decision on them.    The State Great Hural Standing Committee on Hurals and  Administration has considered as expedient to submit for  consideration to the present session of the Parliament the  president's proposal on elaboration of the draft law on  elections to the State Great Hural, on making amendments and  additions in the Law on State Great Hural in a new fashion. But  the Parliament has not accepted the president's draft resolution  concerning ensuring the guarantees of work on propaganda of  activity of the State Great Hural through the state mass media.</p>

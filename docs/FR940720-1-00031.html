			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Publishers have also complained about the subjective nature of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards concerning what material may not be included as a loose supplement at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second-class rates. For example, current rules state that an independent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication may not be sent at second-class rates. Those rules then require the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewer to determine the independence of material by making a subjective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> judgment based on a number of factors. Although the specified items (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent publications) remain ineligible for mailing at second-class rates (even if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bound into publications), the Postal Service has undertaken to respond to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publishers' concerns by explaining these restrictions more clearly. For this reason,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed C200.2.1 sets forth a general standard that all the impermissible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components in 2.2 to 2.5 are prohibited from being mailed at second-class rates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether they take the form of a run-of-press page, supplement, bound-in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advertisement, or other component of the publication. Proposed C200.2.2 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> base the decision on what constitutes impermissible matter on a review of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> questionable material against a list of objective criteria, any one of which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically make that material ineligible for mailing at second-class rates. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria are a separate price or subscription instructions; <!-- PJG 0000 unknown --> the <!-- PJG 0000 unknown --> word <!-- PJG 0000 unknown --> ``catalog''; <!-- PJG 0000 unknown --> a <!-- PJG 0000 unknown --> First-,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> third-, or fourth-class permit imprint; an International Standard Book Number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ISBN); or an International Standard Serial Number (ISSN). The Postal Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that this change will simplify the determination of what constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impermissible second-class matter. This change is expected to benefit publishers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by reducing the uncertainty and confusion they have experienced with regard to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current and more subjective standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current standards restrict the inclusion of products and product samples (see  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C200.1.8) in items mailed at the second-class rates. Proposed C200.2.3 would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to exclude products, such as stationery, cassettes, and floppy disks, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not printed sheets, but the proposed section would no longer prohibit product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples that are otherwise formed of printed sheets. The Postal Service believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that applying the general requirement that all second-class matter must be formed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of printed sheets is a sufficient standard to limit the inappropriate mailing of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products and product samples at second-class rates. Additionally, this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would relax current interpretations on what constitutes a product or merchandise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when the item is a printed sheet. For example, under specific conditions, a 12-month calendar or a poster will now be eligible to be mailed at second-class rates if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is not separately distributed or offered for sale. Including the name of the host  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication, issue or issue date, and relating such a piece to advertising or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonadvertising within the content of the host publication would provide further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proof that the piece is properly prepared as a page of the publication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that second-class mail is transported and delivered intact, proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C200.3.3 specifies what may be included loose within a second-class publication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without requiring wrapping. For consistency, proposed C200.3.4 has been added  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide guidance on when wrappers are required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed C200.3.5 includes all the standards governing protective covers in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current C200.4.1. In recognition of the practicalities of publication production, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that a protective cover cover completely a publication is changed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allow the cover to be smaller than the publication if it extends to within 3/4 inch of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the edge of the publication opposite the fold or binding. No similar allowance has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been proposed for the top and bottom edges of a protective cover because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Postal Service has had no indication from publishers that there is any problem with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covers matching a publication's top and bottom edges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed advertising standard in C200.4.3 blends the contents of current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C200.6.1 and 6.4 and explains that all advertisements must be prepared as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integral part of the publication and that, except for advertisements prepared as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplements and advertisements on printed matter included as part of a receipt or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> order for subscriptions (or requests), all advertisements in a bound publication must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be permanently attached. The provision in current C200.6.3 concerning the types  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of material that can comprise printed sheets has been moved to E211.3.0, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility section that includes the printed sheet standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, several new proposed sections have been added to provide clarifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definitions, such as C200.1.6 (covers), 1.7 (mailing wrappers), and 3.1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (bound/unbound). Other sections have been proposed to clarify further what is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable and what is excluded at second-class rates, e.g., the proscription against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combining fourth-class mail with second-class mail.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also contains an expanded definition of public service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> announcements in E211.11.2, to clarify those announcements that do not have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be treated as advertising matter. An expanded standard explaining procedures to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be followed when measuring advertising in second-class publications is proposed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> new P070.1.7. This provision, which is based on Postal Service rulings, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to ensure uniform treatment of blank space in publications. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E211.7.3 has been revised to clarify that materials such as annual reports,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directories, and lists may be included as supplements to second-class publications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor nonsubstantive changes have also been proposed to DMM modules A, E,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and P.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although exempt from the notice and comment provisions of the Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedures Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (c)) regarding proposed rulemaking by 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 410(a), the Postal Service invites public comments on the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed amendments of the Domestic Mail Manual, which is incorporated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference in the Code of Federal Regulations. See 39 CFR part 111.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 111  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Postal Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 111_[AMENDED]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

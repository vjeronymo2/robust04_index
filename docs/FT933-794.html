			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / People: Non-executive directors Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer based at Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, has appointed David O'Shaughnessy as chairman. He replaces James Summerlin, the group's co-founder. O'Shaughnessy became a non-executive director of Plysu in July. He is chairman of Pira International and already holds non-executive directorships at Barry Wehmiller International and Britton Group. He spent 35 years with Metal Box where he became a main board director in 1979. He retired from the board of Carnaud Metal Box in September 1992. Summerlin, whose retirement was announced at the AGM in July, has been appointed honorary life president. He remains a non-executive director. Last year non-executive directors led a boardroom coup against Richard Gordon, managing director. There was criticism that Gordon had been unable to delegate following a series of acquisitions by the group. He was replaced by Malcolm Macintyre, the former manufacturing director.</p>

We are going to Jordan  because clearing the air is good. We view our brothers in  Jordan as one people and one country, and our interests are  common and interlinked. It is therefore impermissible for vital  differences to exist between us.    As for the issues of economy and agreements, we believe that  first, we must be on our territory so that we might reach an  agreement. We have concluded no agreements over the past year  or two because our land is occupied. This land must first  return to its owners so that we can build establishments and  have our own economy that can cooperate with other economies.    [Al-Damardash] 'Amr Musa said he expects the negotiations to  resume soon. Can you tell us on what he bases his expectation  and if there is any sign of such a thing?    [Qaddumi] Our acceptance of the Madrid conference means we  accepted the resumption of negotiations. These negotiations  have gone on for 22 months and we are still negotiating. There  is no alternative but negotiations, because international  changes dictate that all parties resort to negotiations for the  sake of a comprehensive solution.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: Liberating theme for Lucerne - Andrew Clark concludes a two-part report from Switzerland's premier music festival Lucerne has long prided itself on its programme themes, but few have been so liberating or so intelligently pursued as this summer's 'Forms of Interpretation'. At first glance, it seemed little more than a convenient way of wrapping up whatever was available on the international festival circuit. After all, when is musical performance not a form of interpretation? On closer examination, the theme has clearly stimulated the imagination of Lucerne's festival director, Matthias Bamert. At one extreme, he invited a clown and an 'alternative' musician to give their own bizarre interpretations of traditional concert form. At another, he devoted a whole evening to orchestral arrangements and transcriptions, those dubious vehicles which composers use to interpret the thoughts of their noble predecessors. Gennady Rozhdestvensky conducted one bloated hybrid after another with impish pleasure, but it was hard to decide which was worse - Hamilton Harty's soporific suite from Handel's Fireworks Music, or the turgid orchestration which Liszt made of the slow movement from Beethoven's Archduke trio. The more sound you add, the more you bury the spirit of the original. The only composer to emerge with credit was Schoenberg, whose subtle, respectful arrangement of two Bach chorale preludes underlined the whole point of interpretation - to divine the character of a work, and filter it through the personality of the interpreter. Ravel and Webern, two other master-arrangers, were well represented elsewhere in the festival. So too were Beethoven's Leonore overtures - a vivid example of a composer struggling to interpret himself. And there was no shortage of period-instrument specialists to illustrate the changing fashions of interpretation. But the biggest single interpretative focus was Winterreise: Peter Schreier sang the original Schubert; Hans Zender and Klangforum Wien presented a 'composed interpretation' of the song-cycle; and a new Winterreise opera received its premiere. With music by the Austrian composer Ingomar Grunauer and a libretto by Francesco Micieli, the opera gives a 20th century political resonance to the chill despair described by Schubert. Set in the Pyrenees in September 1940, it is a psychological study of the German poet Walter Benjamin, on the night before he committed suicide while fleeing from the Nazis. In 11 interconnected scenes, he hallucinates, dreams of the past, and sways between the angels of life and death. The music, hyper-expressive rather than poetic, is scored for small orchestra and chorus, and maintains a lean Bergian flow. Its impact was considerably enhanced by Philipp Himmelmann's semi-abstract production and the vivid performance of the American tenor Neil Wilson. That was one of the more original 'Forms of Interpretation' at Lucerne this summer. Without being dogmatic, the theme underlined again and again that interpretation is never definitive, it can never be fixed. In an age which likes to see music recorded in tablets of stone, it was a salutary reminder. The choice of Klaus Huber as composer-in-residence was a mixed blessing. A neat and sprightly 70-year old who has spent much of his professional life outside his native Switzerland, Huber has had more influence as a teacher than as a composer (Brian Ferneyhough being his best-known pupil). His music is difficult and expensive to perform, and does not sit easily in mainstream concert programmes. The festival did its best by commissioning a piano concerto, which Andras Schiff played in the same programme as Mozart's K595. Entitled Intarsi, it tries to echo a Mozartian world in a succession of trills and half-tones, like a precisely calculated miniature. But it offers the soloist little more than sophisticated doodling. In other events, Huber's idiom came over as wearisomely dated. His idealistic engagement with politics and religion was represented by a performance in the Hofkirche of Cantiones de Circulo Gyrante (1985), and a film of the 1983 Donaueschingen premiere of the oratorio . . . Erniedrigt, geknechtet, verlassen, verachtet . . . Both require a vast auditorium to create the necessary spatial effects, and both employ a narrator to declaim portentous texts, against a background of gloomy choral intoning. Both sound like muzak for purgatory - a complete contrast to Huber's small-scale works, of which the soulful, suggestive Plainte for viola d'amore (1990) was the most impressive. Les Jeunes Solistes and Ensemble Recherche were the faithful interpreters. My own festival impressions were dominated by Felicity Lott's ravishing account of Chausson's Poeme de l'amour et de la mer, accompanied by the Suisse Romande Orchestra under Armin Jordan; and by Heinz Holliger conducting the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie in Mozart's Prague Symphony (in the same programme as the Huber piano concerto). Holliger's artless podium manner, his natural sense of style and sheer verve were a joy to behold, because they transmitted themselves intuitively to the players and were placed entirely at the service of the music. Now there was an interpretation to remember. The Lucerne festival runs until Saturday. Box office: tel (41) 233080; fax (41) 239464</p>

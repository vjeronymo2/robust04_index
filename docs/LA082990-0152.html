			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SANDBERG SURPRISED AT 2ND 30-HOMER SEASON;  </P> <P> BASEBALL: SPACIOUS ASTRODOME UNEXPECTED SITE FOR CUB INFIELDER'S RECORD FEAT.  </P> <P> The Astrodome was full of surprises for Chicago's Ryne Sandberg, who didn't  expect to hit 30 homers this season and didn't expect to reach the milestone in  the spacious home of the Houston Astros.  </P> <P> But there he was in the fourth inning Tuesday night, hitting a solo home run  over the left field fence and making history.  </P> <P> Sandberg became the first second baseman to hit 30 or more homers in  consecutive seasons as he led the Cubs to a 5-2 victory over Houston.  </P> <P> "It's tough to hit home runs here," Sandberg said. "I was very fortunate to get  one tonight."  </P> <P> Sandberg hit 30 homers last season and didn't realize before the season that he  could become the first second baseman to do it consecutively.  </P> <P> "Before the season, I knew nothing about it, but it's a nice accomplishment,"  he said. "I didn't expect to hit 30 again this year. Last year was a career  high and I'm surprised to see it happen again."  </P> <P> Sandberg is glad he's reached the milestone homer. Now he can return to his  normal style.  </P> <P> "For the past couple of weeks, I've been swinging for the fences too much,"  Sandberg said. "Now I can just hit the way I normally hit and if the home runs  happen, they happen."  </P> <P> Houston starter Bill Gullickson (8-12) had pitched three hitless innings when  Sandberg came to the plate to start the fourth. He hit an 0-2 pitch over the  left field fence to set the record. It marked the ninth time a second baseman  has hit at least 30 homers.  </P> <P> The others were: Dave Johnson, Atlanta, 1973, 42; Rogers Hornsby, 1922, 42 and  1925, 39 with St. Louis and 1929, 39 with the Cubs; Joe Gordon, Cleveland,  1948, 32 and with New York Yankees, 1940, 30; Bobby Grich, California, 1979,  30, and Sandberg, 1989, 30.  </P> <P> No one appreciates Sandberg more than Cubs Manager Don Zimmer.  </P> <P> "How would you like to be a manager in the major leagues and have a guy who  makes all the plays, hits .300 and gets 30 home runs?" Zimmer asked. "He's the  best at his position in baseball."  </P></p>

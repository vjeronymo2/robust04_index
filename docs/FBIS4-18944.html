			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe by </F> correspondent Franz-Olivier Giesbert; place not given -- live]    [Excerpt] [Giesbert] Good morning, Mr. Juppe.    [Juppe] Good morning.    [Giesbert] You are the key person behind three issues in the  news in the last few hours: Edouard Balladur's visit to China,  NATO air strikes in Gorazde, and chaos in Rwanda against the  background of tribal war. I would like you to give us details  on these issues, preferably without any stereotypes. Let's  start with the visit to China. According to today's newspapers,  this was not a great success, this was a failure. Are you  satisfied?    [Juppe] We achieved our goal. What was our goal? It was not  to establish democracy in China within three days. It was not  to sign contracts, as I have read in some newspapers. Our goal  was to reestablish a political dialogue with China. What was  the situation when we came to office last year? China and  France were not on speaking terms. I will even reveal a detail,  since you do not want stereotypes: Our ambassador was unable to  meet Chinese ministers, either in their ministries or in the  French Embassy. There was no dialogue at all. Can you imagine  France not communicating with China?    [Giesbert] The dialogue was difficult. You ducked the issue  of human rights.    [Juppe] Not at all. We did not duck the issue. France  outlined what its concept of human rights was in talks between  the two prime ministers and the two foreign ministers and it  explained why it considers the human rights situation in China  to be unsatisfactory.    [Giesbert] Dissidents were freed as soon as Edouard Balladur  left China.    [Juppe] I must tell you that I am quite amazed by this way  of  presenting things; I was there, things were slightly different.  When we arrived in Shanghai, we saw press agency reports  indicating that one or two dissidents had been questioned, not  arrested, but questioned. We immediately demanded explanations  -- I did so myself by summoning the Chinese ambassador to my  office -- and we said that we demanded to know what the real  situation was. The accompanying Chinese minister, commiting the  Chinese government, solemnly told us that these arrests had not  taken place. The Chinese press agency confirmed this  information the day after our arrival. When I hear today that  they were freed the day after we had left, I say there has been  disinformation somewhere.    [Giesbert] Are you saying that there were false reports  somewhere?    [Juppe] There was disinformation somewhere. What I can say  is that we were perfectly clear -- I said so myself to my  interlocutors -- we came to talk, it is normal, it is necessary  for France and China to talk to each other; however, we do not  agree on a certain number of issues and we clearly explained  which ones.    [Giesbert] We noticed a different emphasis between the prime  minister and yourself. You were firm, extremely firm, and  Edouard Balladur said that this issue of human rights should be  settled, I quote, with discretion.    [Juppe] I believe that distance is a distortion. I was with  Edouard Balladur and I did not feel the slightest difference  between our respective positions.    [Giesbert] In an article published in LE JOURNAL DU DIMANCHE  Bernard Kouchner reproached Edouard Balladur for having given in  to the Chinese leaders. He spoke of a policy of silence and  blindness, he blamed you for sacrificing human rights for trade,  a state trade paid for by the French taxpayers. I was quoting  Bernard Kouchner.    [Juppe] Mr. Kouchner was doing his job -- this time rather  poorly and in a sectarian manner -- he is in the opposition. He  preferred to kneel down in front of CNN cameras with a sack of  rice on his shoulders, this period is over now.    [Giesbert] Some weeks ago French diplomacy made a rather  grand gesture toward China by abandoning -- so the rumor went --  Taiwan. Following your return from China, do you have the  feeling that you have been paid back?    [Juppe] This comparison is interesting. We are being told:  Moral values are at stake, we should not have spoken to China,  we should have stuck with Taiwan. What was the moral stand  concerning Taiwan when Mr. Joxe was in office? It was to sell  Mirage aircraft and frigates. I cannot understand. We did not  break with Taiwan, we simply told Taiwan that we would honor our  commitments, whatever the cost. In the future, we will try to  show a certain restraint concerning arms sales to Taiwan. We  are ready to continue our cooperation with Taiwan and we will do  so. Meanwhile, we have quite a lot of things to do in China.  Do you realize that this country with a population of 1.2  billion has an annual growth rate of 13 percent? It needs  telephone lines, nuclear power plants, high-speed trains, it  needs wheat, it is currently importing wheat. These are issues  on which we have been working. This will take time because it  is not the government which decides, but firms which are  negotiating. It is with this in mind that we resumed the  dialogue.    Let me say that I would like to place this visit to China  alongside the visits I made to India and Japan. These three  countries of the world, rather distant from each other, include  nearly half the world's population. I noted that France had  been absent from these countries for five to six years; there  was no visit by ministers, no real political dialogue, no  commercial ambition. I am being a bit unfair because,  fortunately, there are French firms working there. Can we have  a foreign policy while being absent from a region like this? I  believe that this was the meaning of my visit, too, and I wanted  to stress this.    [Giesbert] Mr. Juppe, let's now talk about Bosnia. We do  not really understand what happened in Gorazde yesterday when  two American planes bombed Serb positions. Was it to protect UN  soldiers or to prevent Serbs overrunning Gorazde?    [Juppe] Both. Gorazde is a safe haven, I will not repeat  what this means. The United Nations has decided that a certain  number of zones in Bosnia should be specially protected. I  believe that we waited for slightly too long; I am delighted  that we eventually strongly intervened to put on the brake.  However we must now know what the future holds.    [Giesbert] Is this really aimed at putting a brake on? Isn't  it rather a pinprick?    [Juppe] Listen, bombings are never a pinprick. A turning  point was reached about a month ago with the ultimatum in  Sarajevo. At the time I said that all this should be part of a  political and diplomatic plan. What worries me -- besides the  situation on the ground, obviously -- is that the diplomatic  process is currently at a virtual standstill. There are talks  with the Muslims and the Croats on one side; contacts with the  Serbs have not really resumed yet. What I am asking -- and this  is rather urgent now -- is to include all these diplomatic  initiatives into a coherent framework. There is only one such  plan now, which is the European Union action plan, which makes  provisions for the sharing of territory between the various  communities, for lifting sanctions as soon as the Serbs commit  themselves to peace. I invite all parties -- including the  Serbs, obviously -- to resume talks on this basis.    [Giesbert] Does this mean that you are launching a new Juppe  initiative?    [Juppe] This is not a new initiative. I am reasserting a  conviction that I have been defending for months. We made a  significant step forward on the ground by demonstrating our  will, our resolution and our strength. This should not lead us  to forget that the one and only possible solution is a  negotiated settlement.    [Giesbert] Do you believe that the United Nations is capable  of imposing a cease-fire in Gorazde today?    [Juppe] I know that steps in that direction have been taken  and that UN Protection Force officials and a certain number of  diplomats are trying to get the Bosnian Serb leader, Karadzic,  and leading Bosnian Muslim officials together so as to resume  talks.    [Giesbert] The Bosnian Muslims are saying, this is too late  now. This is what the Bosnian president, Alija Izetbegovic,  said yesterday.    [Juppe] Let me stress that it is never too late and that  such  words are unacceptable.    [Giesbert] We had the feeling yesterday that the Americans  were ruling the roost; was that the case?    [Juppe] No it was a decision by the Atlantic alliance,  following a request from the UN secretariat general in the  framework of an operation in which we are full participants.  These planes could have been French, French planes are part of  the Alliance forces.    [Giesbert] Let's now discuss the situation in Rwanda, where  it is the Americans who are absent. We have reports of  appalling ethnic massacres: Hutus are hunting down Tutsis  throughout the country and the other way round.    [Juppe] We just have to watch pictures to understand that  there are no limits to horror. As you know France has been  deeply involved in Rwanda in the past few months in attempts to  restore peace.    [Giesbert] Not very successfully, it seems.    [Juppe] We did get results: The Arusha agreements were  signed, French soldiers were on the scene to help in the  reconciliation process, and things were moving forward.  Unfortunately the attack on the plane transporting the  presidents of Burundi and Rwanda provoked a resumption of the  fighting. We decided very rapidly, very calmly, and very  efficiently to set up a plan of action at Kigali airport to  evacuate our nationals, this has now been nearly achieved.    [Giesbert] Some 60 are still there, are you optimistic about  the evacuation of these last remaining French nationals?    [Juppe] We will evacuate them today.    [Giesbert] When we see what is going on, do you believe  France should maintain a presence in Rwanda, in Burundi?    [Juppe] We cannot abandon our nationals and I believe that  it  is our duty to help the resumption of dialogue. This seems  impossible when you see what is going on, the level of hatred  between Hutus and Tutsis, but the Arusha agreements were signed  and France's role is to attempt everything possible, with the  neighboring countries, with the OAU, with the United Nations, to  see reason prevail over the currently raging madness. This is  our role. [passage omitted]</p>

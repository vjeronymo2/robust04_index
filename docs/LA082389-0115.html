			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Postal Service Cuts Jobs: The Postal Service said it is eliminating 1,000  managerial and administrative positions at 39 facilities nationwide in a  consolidation move. The agency said the cuts will have no effect on mail  service. The consolidation, which takes effect Sept. 23, is expected to save  $30 million to $35 million a year, the Postal Service said. Jobs will be  eliminated through early retirements and other forms of attrition, postal  officials said. In California, three management sectional centers are to be  eliminated in Pasadena, Redding and Marysville.  </P></p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Haiti cleared for loan The impoverished government of Haiti could receive a Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.7m) emergency loan from the World Bank before Christmas, following the clearance of its Dollars 85m arrears at the bank, the International Monetary Fund and the Inter-American Development Bank by a US-led consortium of donors from Asia, Europe and Latin America. Ms Marie Michele Rey, Haitian finance minister, said the money would 'get us through a difficult time to the end of January'. By then, she hopes to have an agreement with the IMF on a national economic programme that would open the doors to more international lending, and to have aid pledges from donor countries. After the clearance of arrears, the newly reinstated government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide will be eligible for project loans totalling more than Dollars 200m and approved by development banks, which were frozen after the military coup that ousted President Aristide in 1991.</p>

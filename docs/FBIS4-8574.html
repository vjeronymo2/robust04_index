			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 14--The Central Office of Planning  (CUP) has drafted a four-year economic development programme for  Poland under which it is assumed that the gross domestic product  in the coming four years will grow by 22 percent, real wages  will increase by 1.5 to 2.5 percent annually, and overall  consumption in 1997 will be higher by 15 percent that it is at  present.    The programme will be submitted for debate and evaluation to  the Government Economic Committee (KERM).    According to CUP President Miroslaw Pietrewicz who unveiled  the main assumptions of the programme at a press conference here  Thursday, the proposed scenario is ambitious but can be  implemented, given social support for it.    The plan calls for creating 1.2 million new jobs. This will  mean a drop in unemployment by some 600,000 from the present 3  million. The plan can be implemented only if Poland continues  along the path of sustained economic growth which began some 18  months ago, Pietrewicz noted.    Growth requires larger investments, savings and exports. The  success of the programme also hinges on external conditions,  chiefly the rate of economic growth in Western Europe which  influences the volume of imports from Poland. "The starting  point for the programme is not easy," CUP president observed and  added that the Polish economic situation was still difficult.</p>

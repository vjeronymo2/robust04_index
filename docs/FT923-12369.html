			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Instrument of fear: Competition for the building societies For the first time in nearly a decade the building societies are facing strong competition from National Savings for the nest-eggs of mainstream personal savers. During the late 1980s the building societies had almost a clear run, pulling in net new deposits at Pounds 17bn to Pounds 20bn a year, adding back interest credited. The banks were becoming rather more competitive for retail savings deposits than earlier in the decade. But National Savings was in decline, and was actually shrinking in 1989 and for most of 1990 because the government was at that stage repaying its debts. Since then, however, the government has swung massively back into budget deficit. The public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at Pounds 28bn for the current financial year ending next April 6. Most independent forecasters expect a big overshoot because of the failure of the economic recovery to materialise. Public borrowing is likely to be well in excess of Pounds 30bn this year and possibly more than Pounds 40bn - some even say Pounds 50bn - in 1993-94. Most of the deficit will be financed through sales of government bonds, but National Savings has been ordered to play its part. Its contribution to the PSBR was a negative Pounds 1.7bn for 1989-90 - that is, there was a net outflow of funds - but in 1991-92 it raised more than Pounds 3bn and this year it is thought to be targeting Pounds 6bn. That amounts to an increase of almost Pounds 8bn in three years. Not surprisingly this is biting deeply into the resources of the building societies. In a number of recent months the societies have suffered a net loss of deposits, and net receipts have been only Pounds 0.65bn for the first five months of the year. The particular instrument the building societies fear is the new National Savings First Option Bond launched last week, with a rumoured initial target of Pounds 1bn. It offers 7.75 per cent net of standard rate tax (equivalent to 10.34 per cent gross) on savings of Pounds 1,000 or more, and this rises to 8.05 per cent on Pounds 20,000 plus. This beats most building society high interest accounts out of sight. It is hard to get more than 6.5 to 7 per cent net out of building societies. This intrusion of National Savings upon private sector savings media, can be seen as part of the process by which the huge government deficit threatens to 'crowd out' private sector activity. In the 1980s the Conservative government under Mrs Margaret Thatcher argued that the opposite shift was desirable. Low interest rates and low government borrowing were desired. But now, under the influence of membership of the European Community's exchange rate mechanism, the government has shifted to a high interest rate, high government borrowing pattern. There is much less room for new mortgage lending by building societies and banks, which reached a peak of Pounds 42bn net in 1988 but has now eased to an annual rate of only about Pounds 20bn. Not only is the government becoming a potent competitor for savings but the depression in the housing market is also making it necessary for lenders to widen their margins to accommodate bad debt risks which used to be negligible but have now become serious. Different but connected factors are therefore interacting to cause an upward shift in building society deposit rates and mortgage rates at a time when, officially, interest rates have remained stable.</p>

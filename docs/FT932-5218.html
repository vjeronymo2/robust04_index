			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei gains 1.9 per cent for a new high for the year INVESTORS were encouraged by currency factors as the Nikkei average rose 1.9 per cent to close above the 21,000 level for the first time since May 10, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 384.30 to 21,076.00, a new high for the year, after an early low of 20,692.80 and a high of 21,186.33. Volume rose to 611.6m shares from 433m, as life insurers and foreign investors once again bought blue chip electricals. Advances led declines by 856 to 215, with 114 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose for the third consecutive day, gaining 30.67 to a year's high of 1,676.13 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.27 to 1,277.64. Exporters were firm on the easing of the yen, as investors welcomed repeated intervention by the Bank of Japan on the currency market. The dollar closed at Y107.87, up Y0.75 from the previous day. Foreign investors were net stock buyers for the fifth consecutive month in April, buying a net Y1.3bn. However, analysts said that foreigners appeared to be more cautious this month. A UK broker said that share prices were too high considering that sluggish consumer spending and capital expenditure were expected for the next few years. High-technology stocks were traded actively.

HONG KONG dropped 2.3 per cent on heavy selling pressure, turnover rising from HKDollars 3.9bn to HKDollars 5.5bn. The Hang Seng index fell 166.94 to 7,155.29 as worries persisted over a move by China to let its currency float freely on some markets. Investors continued to sell stocks with exposure to China. Hutchison led the active list as it fell 50 cents to HKDollars 20.90. Cheung Kong shed 70 cents to HKDollars 27.30 and HSBC Holdings was off HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 72.50. SHANGHAI's B-Share index fell 2.9, or 4.9 per cent, to 56.45, while the SHENZHEN Bs held relatively firm, off only 0.1 at 98.98. 'Foreign investors lost their confidence in China's economy and currency,' said a broker. SINGAPORE saw broadly based selling and a 42-point drop in the Straits Times Industrial index at one point. Bargain hunting cut the loss to 20.83 at 1,869.48 as turnover rose from SDollars 437m to SDollars 499m.

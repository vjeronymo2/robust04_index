			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Hoskins sale discussions may lead to new directors HOSKINS Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer, said yesterday that its board was 'in discussions with a third party which may lead to the appointment of new directors.' In view of the development, the company said Mr Richard Holman, a dissident shareholder, had agreed no further action should be taken for the time being over his request for an extraordinary meeting. The discussions are believed to involve the sale of most of the 30 per cent shareholding in the USM-quoted company of Mr Barrie Hoar, the chairman, and his family. Mr Hoar said the family had decided to sell a majority of its stake 'provided we can ensure that new management will be in the best long term interest of all shareholders.' He and his brother Robert fought off an attempt by rebel shareholders to remove them from the board last year and have been facing a further challenge from Mr Holman. Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure whose plan to reverse three theme bar businesses into Hoskins collapsed, said he had reached a verbal agreement to buy the Hoar shareholding. However, he had been informed the following day that the family was negotiating with another party.</p>

			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PAROLE OFFICE SITE STILL UNDER STUDY  </P> <P> A state parole administrator told the Pasadena Board of Directors that  placement of a parole office at 468 N. Rosemead Blvd. remains under  consideration despite strong opposition from Hastings Ranch residents.  </P> <P> Frank Marino, parole administrator who has taken charge of the search for a  parole office site in Pasadena, said his agency is willing to look at other  sites in Pasadena, but "we have to get something going in the next couple of  months." The Department of Corrections is under pressure to find a new office  because it has promised to close one of its two Alhambra offices by October.  </P> <P> Pasadena directors, expressing frustration at conflicting figures they have  received about how many parolees live in Pasadena and how many would be  serviced by the proposed office, asked Marino to supply accurate information.  </P> <P> Director Rick Cole said the least objectionable location would be in the  downtown area, but Director Chris Holden said he would oppose any effort to  place it in the portion of the downtown area he represents. Cole said he could  not accept it in the downtown portion of his district unless other directors  were willing to look at sites in their districts, too. He noted that nearly all  districts include some portion of Colorado Boulevard or other downtown  commercial streets.  </P></p>

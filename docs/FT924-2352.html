			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / How To Spend It: Bargains you can picture - Lucia van der Post puts you in the right frame of mind for Christmas THIS YEAR, as if you needed telling, has been grim for almost everyone and that has been strongly reflected in the art world. Some of Britain's most famous dealers have shut up shop, others are struggling to stay afloat by offering some of the best bargains seem for many a long year. As scarcely anything can be nicer than a picture for Christmas here are just a few places where you could find something appealing for the walls without spending a fortune: The Art Collection of 3-5 Elystan Street, London SW3, has always made a point of selling affordable, accessible original drawings and paintings, almost exclusively representational. But, this year, it is making a point of having a range of work that sells for less than Pounds 200. As the pictures are nicely framed they make a complete and ready present. Roy Miles, possibly most well-known for popularising Russian Art, this year has 'Art from China' - a wide choice of framed oils at Pounds 300 each at his gallery at 29 Bruton Street, London W1. Photographed centre is 'Young Shepherd', a typical example of contemporary Chinese Folk Art, a mixed media on paper measuring 23in by 232in. There are also lots of ceramic pots from China ranging in price from Pounds 30 to Pounds 900. Burlington Paintings, at 12 Burlington Gardens, London W1, has a collection of watercolours by the Norfolk artist, Philip Gardner. Working in watercolour and reed pen there are serene East Anglian landscapes, portraits (such as the delightful one of Yvette photographed here left, Pounds 925) and London scenes. Prices start at Pounds 250. La Galerie, at 225 Ebury Street, London SW1, goes in for very decorative French work but, this Christmas, has watercolours, pastels and drawings at prices that start from as little as Pounds 50. Not strictly art, but of great decorative value nonetheless, is the fine porcelain sold by Zelli's of 30a Dover Street, London W1. All the porcelain is hand-made, hand-pierced and hand-painted and almost all of it comes from Germany. At Zelli's there are pieces of purely decorative value (such as Paul Scheurich's drummer boy or the immensely popular Dresden cockatoos) but more appealing are the pieces with a functional use - intricately decorated candlesticks by Meissen at Pounds 185 the pair, vases by Nymphenburg from Pounds 90, white and gold bowls from KPM Berlin Pounds 82, a Dresden pierced pot-pourri at Pounds 125. Almost in the collector's class are the beautiful porcelain dolls being sold by Barclay &amp; Bodie of 7 Blenheim Terrace, London NW8. All are delightful, all beautifully dressed to fit the part - choose from sailor girl (Pounds 36), skater (Pounds 55), Alice in Wonderland (Pounds 34) and Lily (photographed here below, Pounds 35). Each comes in a nice old-fashioned cardboard box and can be posted for Pounds 4.50 post and packing. Do not forget the museums as useful sources of some surprisingly inexpensive presents - the Horniman Museum, for instance, at London Road, forest Hill, London SE23 has hand-carved wooden puppets from Burma at Pounds 14.95, Ikat shawls from Tibet (Pounds 22.95) and candlesticks from Mexico (Pounds 19.95). Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Chamberlain Square, Birmingham, has a Dinostore where all manner of dinosaur goodies can be bought from bendy dinosaur rulers at Pounds 1.99 to walking dinosaur wind-ups at Pounds 1.99. At The Bodleian Library, Oxford, there is lots of lovely stationery but, for a serious present, there is always The Bodleian Chair, a reproduction of a 1766 library chair in English ash and elm which comes in kit form for Pounds 295. Finally, at Charleston Farmhouse, near Firle, Lewes, Sussex, there are hand-made and hand-decorated replicas of original vases, jugs, mugs and fish bowls by Quentin Bell and Duncan Grant starting at Pounds 9.50. There are also hand-painted lampshades, each one different, by Robert Campling and Quentin Bell (prices start at Pounds 42). Candlewick Green of 35 Neal Street, Covent Garden, London WC2, sells a wide range of candles and candleholders so anybody still looking for decorative devices for walls, tables, trees should make a point of looking in on Candlewick Green. In particular there is a wide and appealing range of wrought iron candleholders, all designed by Candlewick Green and made exclusively for it. A single wall sconce would sell at Pounds 25, while the four-branch table candle-holder photographed above is Pounds 95 and an elaborate 16-branch chandelier of considerable elegance is Pounds 395. Beside the usual range of hand-dipped and moulded candles Candlewick Green also does wonderful candles for special occasions - orange-shaped for hallowe'en, floating ones, pillar-shaped, square, cone-shaped and a whole series suitable for out of doors.</p>

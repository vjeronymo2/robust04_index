			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Records: Plain tales for the summer SO Trollope has his plaque in Westminster Abbey. Now there is more good news: Cover to Cover Cassettes and Timothy West have begun to record the Palliser novels. Having completed the Barsetshire series lost year, they have now issued Can You Forgive Her?, published in 1864-5 (CTC 0H4; 21 cassettes; 28 hours 2O minutes; unabridged): from diocesan politics to Parliamentary, viewed from the sawdust level of tricky political agents and from the dinner table of the great Duke of Omnium. We are asked to forgive motherless Alice Vavasor, young, well-bred but not rich, for having become a jilt. She longs to be useful and capriciously rejects a worthy suitor who prefers a quiet life; she is even willing to con template a marriage with her blackguard of a cousin, George Vavasor, if her money can be used for his political career. Another cousin, the adorable Lady Glencora, also wonders what to do, but stays with her husband, Plantagenet Palliser, long enough to find happiness within her marriage. Timothy West's reading is as impressive as ever. Penelope Lively's novel of 1991, City of the Mind (Chivers Audio Books CAB 735; 5 cassettes; 7 hours 15 minutes; unabridged), beautifully read by Terrence Hardiman, is preoccupied with the continuum of Time. The London in which the architect hero, Matthew, is building a tower in Docklands co-exists for him with the city of the Blitz, and with an earlier city where a ragged child survives in the gutter. A celebration of London, and incidentally a tale of romantic love as well. Highly enjoyable. In 1987, Bill Bryson, an American journalist living in Britain, set out from Iowa to find the ideal small American town. He drove 13,978 miles and visited 38 states, and the result was The Lost Continent (CAB 804; 8 cassettes; 10 hours 30 minutes; unabridged). He saw much to grieve over: a loss of dignity; over-visited historical places full of hamburgers, junk souvenirs and 'fat people in noisy clothes'. But some places were lovely: Savannah, Georgia; Santa Fe, New Mexico; Colonial Williamsburg. (but what a rip-off that bus trip would have been, had he fallen for it). His bad temper and streams of invective might have become wearisome but for the vitality and charm of the reader, William Roberts. Among Isis Audio Books' bargain reissues, Mary Wesley's Harnessing Peacocks (TE 563; 7 cassettes; 9 hours 45 minutes; unabridged) is lively and funny. Hebe, having escaped young from grandparents who wanted her to have an abortion, has made a comfortable life for herself and her son by cooking and 'tarting' - she is good at both. An entertainment, attractively read by Carole Boyd; not for Aunt Edna. From Random Century Audiobooks comes a good abridged version of one of Ruth Rendell's Wexford stories, No More Dying Then (RD 125; 2 cassettes, 3 hours), superbly read by Christopher Ravenscroft (Wexford's sidekick, Mike Burden, in the ITV series). Burden is the star in this search for a missing child. Six episodes from the TV series featuring John Thaw as Inspector Morse have been adapted for audio cassette from the original TV soundtracks, an initiative of Central Independent Television via Music Collection International. Each 2-cassette set lasts for two hours. The titles are: Deceived by Flight; The Ghost in the Machine; The Secret of Bay 5B; Masonic Mysteries; Driven to Distraction, and Infernal Serpent. Catalogue numbers from TALKMC 001 to TALKMC 006 respectively. From 5A Telltapes, Plain Tales from the Hills - Pt 2 (TTDMC 418; 2 cassettes; 3 hours), read by Martin Jarvis, has 12 of Rudyard Kipling's tales of the Raj, published in 1888. With comedy, pathos, irony and horror, they gave a foretaste of future triumphs. The Pat Hobby Stories (TTDMC 420; 2 cassettes; 3 hours) is a humorous series written by Scott Fitzgerald for Esquire (1939-40), about a has-been of the film world who haunts the Hollywood lots hoping for work, but remains his own man. Kerry Shale reads nicely. Random Century Audiobooks have recorded Kenneth Branagh reading 21 of Wilfred Owen's war poems and some of his letters in Anthem for Doomed Youth (RD 126; 2 cassettes; 1 hour 12 minutes), a recording which the BBC broadcast in five 15-minute gobbets to celebrate the centenary of Owen's birth; 15 minutes being as much as one can take of this at one time. Perhaps no actor could do justice to the pity and terror of the poetry, but Branagh reads the admirably chosen letters with sensitivity.</p>

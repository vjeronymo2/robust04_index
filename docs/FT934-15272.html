			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Italian magistrates cry foul on football finance THE high-spending world of Italian football has received a rude shock from magistrates investigating alleged phoney transfers, tax evasion and falsified balance sheets. Five first division and two second division clubs are involved along with nine of their players. At stake are the reputations of the best-known and richest clubs - including AC Milan, owned by media magnate Mr Silvio Berlusconi, and Juventus, the team of Mr Giovanni Agnelli, head of Fiat. These clubs, along with Cosenza, Inter-Milan, Genoa, Torino and Venezia, have all had their offices raided by police this week. Police have also visited the homes of players and managers. The top-named players are Milan's Gianluigi Lentini, who reputedly was responsible for the game's record transfer fee of L60bn (Pounds 24.92m), and one of Italian football's idols, Dino Baggio, now playing for Juventus. Almost a year ago Turin magistrates were alerted by a small Torino shareholder to the suspicious circumstances of a player's transfer to Venezia. Inquiries revealed the L570m transfer was fictitious and the player's name was none other than the son of a Torino employee. As a result, the magistrates extended their investigations into the management of the then Torino chairman, Mr Gian Mauro Borsano, a socialist member of parliament. Apart from transfers of fictitious players, the magistrates are examining the disparity between the figures for which transfers are booked and the figure quoted. Lentini was transferred from Torino to Milan in July 1992 for a sum said by his old club to be around L60bn. He appears in Milan's books worth L27.2bn. Again Dino Baggio was party to a curious triangular deal whereby in the space of a few days he was transfered from Torino, to Juventus to Inter for a mere L4.5bn - a figure considered surprisingly low for someone of his reputation. One of the tricks magistrates believe they have uncovered is the accounting for a player's transfer for half the real price in one year, then next year the remainder is paid over to a 'ghost' player. By splitting the fee in two the payment to the fictitious player looks more realistic. The Italian press has carried statements from former football managers claiming the practices have been long known and tolerated.</p>

			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Doubt over engineering groups' investment plans ONLY a small proportion of UK engineering companies have devised investment strategies which will allow them to develop their core businesses and come out of the recession in a strong position, according to a survey. Beddows, the international consultancy, says the UK economic and legislative environment is hindering companies from making key strategic investments. 'High interest rates mean a high cost of capital and a squeeze on cash availability - two factors which have been preventing even investments with good levels of return,' says the Beddows study. 'This, coupled with the impact of restructuring during the recession, places a significant question mark against the potential for this sector to benefit from any economic upturn.' The survey is based on interviews with senior managers from 20 companies with annual sales exceeding Pounds 25m each, along with analysts and industry commentators. It will give ammunition to those arguing that the recession is harming the engineering sector's ability to respond to long-term factors such as internationalisation of markets, focus on core businesses and technological change. Beddows says a third of the companies surveyed had increased their investments - which include everything from capital projects to new product development - during the past five years, while 22 per cent reported a decrease. But the base levels of investment have been low for some time, says the study. It adds that patterns of investment are changing, with most of it geared to the removal of excess capacity and short-term survival. Apart from high interest rates, managers believe that, amid intense international competition, UK companies suffer from not being granted some of the tax advantages which assist their competitors elsewhere. The study also warns of the danger that the devaluation of sterling will lull some companies into a sense of false security on the need for new investment.

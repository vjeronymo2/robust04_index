			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Management: Why pensions pay off - Perks / Norma Cohen continues the series with a look at one of the most expensive benefits that companies provide for their employees Of all the benefits provided to employees, perhaps none is more costly than a good pension scheme. Employers typically contribute anywhere from 10-12 per cent of payrolls to finance the classic 'final salary' scheme - no small outlay. Yet, as an increasing number of employers is discovering, the pension is among the least understood and appreciated of all benefits on offer. Mark Duke, benefits consultant at actuaries Towers Perrin, says that an increasing number of corporate clients are conducting surveys of employees' attitudes to various benefits. 'You often find that employees' appreciation is in inverse proportion to the expenditure involved,' he said. Towers Perrin's own employee studies have found, for instance, that the company car and subsidised mortgage mean a lot more than the really high-cost items such as pension. Why, then, do employers bother? According to Charles Evans, partner at actuaries Mercer Fraser: 'The traditional view is that it helps recruitment, motivation and retention. It is also promotion for the company's image. It says 'this is a company which cares about its employees'. And it really does help retention.' More generally, pensions remain on offer because employers feel they must offer them in order to be able to compete for the best staff, adds Evans. The need to offer the same benefits package as other employers in similar industries has been one factor inhibiting large companies from curtailing pension benefits and, indeed, has encouraged their enhancement over time. But if employees, particularly younger ones, do not know or care about the structure of pension benefits, why do employers continue to insist that they must offer them? Significantly, figures from the National Association of Pension Funds' latest survey show that in 1991 some 16 per cent of all new employees rejected the opportunity to join their company scheme. And since 1988, when membership in an employer's occupational scheme became no longer mandatory, the number of scheme members in Britain has fallen. While this may partly reflect demographic trends, it is clear that some employees are electing either to join personal pension plans or none at all. Some pensions experts argue that pension provision is not wholly a charitable exercise. Employers earn benefits other than a happy workforce. 'The reasons are tax, tax, tax,' says John Cunliffe, partner at McKenna and Co and a leading pensions lawyer. Employers' contributions to a scheme are tax deductible and investment income rolls up tax-free. Those employers who avail themselves of the surpluses through contributions holidays are, in effect, able to make use of tax-free investment gains to offset expenditure. Also, Evans points out, the availability of a fully-funded pension scheme offers an employer a relatively painless way of funding redundancies. Pension benefits can - and frequently are - enhanced to induce workers to leave quietly, without threat of industrial strife and with no effect on profits. Kevin Spring, partner at international benefits consultants The Wyatt Co, says that some impetus for corporate pension schemes has come from UK tax legislation. Tax rebates were offered to those companies that agreed to pick up the salary-related portion of state pension benefits through so-called contracting-out arrangements. 'That tax rebate was used by many companies to build up their pension funds,' Spring says. Ron Amy, compensation and benefits director at Grand Metropolitan, argues that some employers' reasons are shrouded in history. Since the 1920s, when employers first began offering organised occupational pensions, they have grown to the point where they now account for more than 70 per cent of retirement income. The growth of occupational pensions has blunted political demands for more generous state provision and Britain has one of the least generous schemes in Europe. Says Amy: 'We are now in a situation where there is no alternative state provision.' He feels his company has no alternative but to provide a good scheme. 'But we also have had the phenomenon in the 1980s of pension fund surpluses which have sharply reduced the cost. Perhaps the real question is what will happen when the contributions holidays are over and companies have to begin making provision again.' Already, there are rumblings that the classic final salary scheme, which promises workers two-thirds of their last year's pay, is under threat. Trevor Crowter, principal actuary at KPMG Peat Marwick Actuarial Services, notes that among small companies, the trend is towards so-called money purchase schemes. Instead of guaranteeing a worker a set pension for as long as he or she lives after retirement, these offer a lump sum instead. The sum should be sufficient to guarantee the purchase of an annuity, but they rarely offer inflation indexing or other benefits attached to final salary schemes. However, from the employer's point of view, money purchase schemes cost less and are thus more attractive. Meanwhile, the recent wave of pensions legislation, and the promise of more to come, is driving up costs. Since 1985, for instance, employers have been required to increase the value of deferred pensions by up to 5 per cent a year and, when the provisions of the 1990 Social Security Act come into effect, pensions being paid will have to be increased by a similar amount. Earlier this year, Standard Life, one of Britain's largest insurers, announced that it would no longer offer final salary schemes - widely interpreted as a sign of shrinking demand for a product of increasing complexity and cost. 'There is an element of paternalism here on the part of British employers,' says Brad Nelson, head of employee communication at Towers Perrin. 'And I wonder how long they can reasonably be expected to keep that up.'  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Proportion of employers taking a contribution holiday or temporary reduction of contributions in 1991                                     PRIVATE    PUBLIC    ALL SCHEMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Full holiday                          34%        13%         33% Reduction                             14%        21%         14%  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample size                           810         63         873  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Proportion of employers who actively encourage new employees to join scheme where new employees are not automatically entered                                     PRIVATE    PUBLIC    ALL SCHEMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Actively encourageing                 93%        76%         92% new employees  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample size                           371         17         388  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Employees joining scheme                                     PRIVATE    PUBLIC    ALL SCHEMES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Average of eligible employees         84%        85%         84% entering scheme  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Sample size                           436        25          461  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

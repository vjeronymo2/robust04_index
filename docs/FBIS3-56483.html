			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov has  stated that the tripartite declaration on the elimination of  nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory and the accompanying  appendix, which was just signed in Moscow, is an historic  document which has laid the foundation for the actual process of  ending Ukraine's economic and political isolation. In addition,  the package of documents on denuclearization will enable Ukraine  to receive international financial aid, including much-needed  investment to help resolve conversion issues, overcome the  economic crisis, and provide for the social protection of our  people. Scientific studies on the dismantling of nuclear  warheads and their secure withdrawal from Ukrainian territory  have already been performed. This process will be completed in  several stages and controlled by appropriate monitoring  commissions.</p>

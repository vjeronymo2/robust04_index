The document, which was treated as  confidential and was put together by prominent Christian  Democratic economists and financial experts, clearly states in  its recommendation that "the KDNP should announce officially  that it protests the fact that Lajos Csepi has been named  director of the AV Rt. [State Property Management Corporation]  and attempts to merge the AVU [State Property Agency] with the  AV Rt., and it should demand that the organizational system  remain unchanged until the election. It should also protest the  planned firing of personnel at the AV Rt. and, finally, carrying  out any privatization that goes beyond what was originally  planned." [passage omitted]    The KDNP economic committee's announcement, which was  expressed in 17 points, clearly states: "We can say  unequivocally that the privatization question has been handled  badly by the coalition and that this will be one of its greatest  burdens in the election. This burden is made even greater by  the personnel changes that have taken place recently: the firing  of Szabolcs Szekeres and the naming of Lajos Csepi to take his  place." [passage omitted]    According the the Christian Democrats, a drive led by the  SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats] lurks in the background of  the government's move. [passage omitted]    Analyzing the "activities" of Lajos Csepi, the Christian  Democrats emphasize that he immediately set about making  personnel changes that reflected his own taste; he started  firing AV Rt. workers and merging the entire AV Rt. into the  AVU. "In the last months of the coalition's power, therefore,  all the state enterprise assets and the entire privatization  process ended up in the hand of those who follow a liberal  ideology and of the former system's apparatchiks. This  situation is catastrophic from the points of view of the  country's economy and future, as well as from the point of view  of the coalition's election prospects." [passage omitted]</p>

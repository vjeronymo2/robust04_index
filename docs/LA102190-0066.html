			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: 84, CHARING CROSS ROAD BY HELENE HANFF (PENGUIN: $7.95)  </P> <P> The popular television dramatization of "84, Charing Cross Road" has not  diminished the charm of Helene Hanff's book.  </P> <P> A collection of letters between a struggling young writer in post-World War II  New York City and the staff of a small used-book store in London, "Charing  Cross" chronicles the changes England underwent as rationing and austerity gave  way to prosperity. A voracious and discriminating reader, Hanff filled her  letters with concise, intelligent discussions of English literature and the  joys of book-collecting. The ideal book to tuck away for a rainy afternoon.  </P></p>

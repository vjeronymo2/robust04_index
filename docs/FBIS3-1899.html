The U.S. secretary of state made the remarks this afternoon  in the U.S. State Department during an interview with Chinese,  Japanese, Australian and South Korean reporters, on the eve of  his departure for a 10-day trip to Australia, Japan and China  which begins March 4.    "That new relationship is symbolized most importantly by  President Clinton's meeting with China's President Jiang Zemin  in Seattle last November," Christopher stressed.    He said that he met with China's foreign minister last  September in New York following Clinton's directive and the two  countries agreed to develop a broader set of relationships.    That resulted in U.S. Secretary of Finance Lloyd Bentsen,  U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and U.S. Secretary of  Agriculture Mike Espy meeting with or having contact with  high-level officials from China.    "At the same time we sought to deepen our relations as we  are  two prominent and great nations with tremendous resources,"  added Christopher. "It's important we have more communications  so that we understand each other's viewpoints and problems."    He said that he is looking forward to meeting with Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian and discussing a full range of topics  which would include security, political and international  issues, trade, non-proliferation and human rights.    At the end of his fourth 10-day Asian trip Christopher will  proceed to Vladivostok to meet with Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev to discuss developments in the Balkans as well as  the tension created over the arrest of a CIA official who  allegedly spied for Russia.    Christopher also answered reporters' questions concerning  U.S.-Japan trade and the situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>

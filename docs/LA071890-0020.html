			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TAX FUNDS FOR ARTS AGENCY  </P> <P> The Times has once again demonstrated how out of touch it is with the values  and morals of it readers, when it insists that their tax money be spent on the  "performance art" of Karen Finley, John Fleck, etc.  </P> <P> One of Fleck's acts, called "Blessed Are the Little Fishes," consists of  urinating on stage onto a picture of Jesus Christ in a toilet bowl. The  viewpoint that the NEA's existence is worthwhile only if it funds such material  would be inane beyond belief, except that it came from The Times.  </P> <P> REP. DANA ROBRABACHER  </P> <P> R-Long Beach  </P></p>

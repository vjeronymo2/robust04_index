Approximately $75,000 is available in FY 1995 to fund this project. It is expected that the award will begin on or about February 1, 1995, and will be made for a 12-month budget period within a project period up to three years. Funding estimates are subject to change. Continuation awards within the project period will be made on the basis of satisfactory progress and availability of funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary purpose of this project is for the March of Dimes to provide an assessment of the current state of knowledge and behavior among U.S. women of reproductive age relative to folic acid consumption and the prevention of SBA, as well as other pregnancy-related health issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment will be done by conducting a study of reproductive-age women (ages 18&hyph;45). It is envisioned that results from the study will be used to direct planning for national, State and local SBA prevention programs, and will provide a baseline from which to later evaluate progress in knowledge and behavior relative to folic acid consumption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of ``Healthy People 2000,'' a PHS-led national activity to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life.

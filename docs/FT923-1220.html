			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Recovery in US 'slow but uneven' THE US economy is improving slowly and prices are generally stable aside from a jump in lumber costs caused by Hurricane Andrew, the Federal Reserve said in its latest national survey, Reuter reports from Washington. 'Economic activity has been improving slowly in most of the nation, but the pace of recovery has been uneven across regions and sectors,' the survey by the 12 Federal Reserve banks said. The report, known as the Beige Book, was based on information gathered before September 15 and is the last one before the November 3 presidential election, in which joblessness and economic weakness are key voter concerns. 'Little upward pressure on prices has been evident, except for products such as lumber and natural gas associated with storm-related damage,' the summary said. Rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew would eventually stimulate economic activity in Florida and Louisiana. Retail sales were 'steady or slightly higher' in most regions, except for lacklustre new-car sales. Manufacturing activity had weakened for cars, aerospace and defence-related industries. 'In manufacturing outside these sectors, however, improvement is noted in orders, production and sales.' The survey found that the pace of new homebuilding was improving slowly, particularly for low- and mid-priced homes, although commercial and other non-residential construction was weak. The Fed banks in Minneapolis, Philadelphia and Richmond, Va, said retail sales in their regions had picked up in recent weeks. Merchants in Chicago and New York also saw some sales growth for most consumer goods in August and early September. But auto sales were weak. The Chicago and Cleveland Fed districts said dealers there were cutting orders below sales to keep inventories under control.</p>

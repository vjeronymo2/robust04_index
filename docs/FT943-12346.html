			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Watchdog discovers defects in fair ride Investigators from the safety watchdog said yesterday they had found 'deficiencies' in the world's tallest rollercoaster after a crash that injured 26 people. The 235 ft ride at Blackpool, Lancashire - the 'Pepsi Max Big One' - was officially opened a week before the accident earlier this month. It will remain closed under a Health and Safety Executive prohibition notice issued last Friday while investigations continue. The watchdog said the notice was served on Blackpool Pleasure Beach, the operator, 'requiring it to address deficiencies in the ride's braking and control systems'. The accident happened when a train travelling at 35mph was not halted by a computer-controlled brake and ploughed into the back of another. Pleasure Beach said its staff would test the ride now that the watchdog had returned it to the company's control. 'We are now allowed to start implementing their recommendations. We are still no nearer a conclusion regarding the computer,' it said. Arrow Dynamics, the US maker of the ride, is still examining the computer systems that should have made it impossible for two trains to collide.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Hans Joerg Sottorf article: "Germany To Assume the Role of </F> Advocate"]    [Text] Bonn, 8-9 Jan -- Numerous views were expressed in  Bonn in the past few days before the NATO summit in Brussels.  The same question was raised time and again: To what extent  should the North Atlantic defense alliance, whose meaning and  purpose must be redefined as a result of the changed world  political situation, open up to the Central and East European  states without offending Russia?    The confusion of voices culminated in reports on a quarrel  between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe, which were quickly denied, however. Differences of  opinion between Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Ruehe were  also detected in the statements they issued.    If one analyzes the flood of declarations and listens  carefully to the voices in the political camps, one discovers  more agreement than one would at a superficial glance. Bonn  advocates the integration of the Central and East European  states into a new security architecture whose core should be  NATO. The problems that might arise for Russia from a sudden  NATO expansion to its borders are apparent, however. On the  other hand, Bonn wants security agreements with Moscow.  Russia's membership seems ideal, but is not feasible because of  the domestic political problems in the eastern part of the huge  empire. Moreover, no president -- no matter what his name is --  would be able to implement that.    Basically, the differences of opinion in Bonn concern the  right steps and the appropriate way as to how to shape the  complicated security-political relations between the old NATO  countries and the former members of the Warsaw Pact, some of  whom are urgently pressing for NATO protection. Bonn's defense  politicians have adopted a pragmatic approach. They claim the  larger NATO is, the smaller is the danger that Russia might seek  military adventures in the old Soviet sphere of influence.    Bonn's foreign policy experts, however, recommend cautious  steps toward a rapprochement with the Central and East European  states, in order to prevent sudden conflicts. Bonn's Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel, who has been advocating long-term  thinking on this issue for some time, naturally plays a major  role here. Shortly before the beginning of the NATO summit, he  spoke of a very difficult dilemma that NATO, and in particular  Germany, will have to solve. A "double message" must be  conveyed to the Central and East European countries: Basically,  NATO wants to be open for new members. On the other hand,  however, this is a lengthy process, and it will not be possible  for them to join the Alliance as fast as some would like. There  is no order and no timetable for new members. The only thing  Kinkel wants to promise for the time being is consultations at  the political level.    Germany's special position is characterized by the fact that  the Central and East European states view Germany as the  advocate of their interests in the expansion of cooperation.  Besides Kinkel, Chancellor Kohl also made it clear that Bonn  must link two goals: The justified security needs of the Eastern  neighboring countries must be taken seriously, but at the same  time security relations must be developed with Russia. Kinkel  is right: This will be a difficult balancing act.</p>

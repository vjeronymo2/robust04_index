			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Inquiry urged into US-Iraq dealings TWENTY Democrats on the US House Judiciary Committee yesterday asked for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate whether Bush administration officials lied to Congress about US dealings with Iraq before the Gulf War, AP reports from Washington. Democratic committee chairman Jack Brooks announced the move after a caucus of the panel's Democrats generated enough support to trigger the request to attorney general William Barr. The evidence 'makes it clear that the attorney general needs to appoint an independent counsel' to investigate possible criminal violations in US assistance to Iraq, attempts to conceal information from Congress and interference with prosecution of an Atlanta bank, BNL, that made loans to Iraq, Mr Brooks said. An investigation could be loaded with election-year significance, focusing attention on Mr Bush's efforts to use US loan guarantees and other rewards to moderate Baghdad's behaviour - a policy the administration now admits was a failure. There is growing evidence that the taxpayer-financed benefits for Iraq, far from encouraging moderation, helped President Saddam Hussein build up military forces and further Iraqi missile and nuclear weapons development - and that some people in the administration knew it. Under the law the attorney general has 90 days, with a possible 60-day extension, to decide whether there is enough evidence to seek appointment of an independent counsel. Democrats said they believed Mr Barr was unlikely to decline the request, because such a move could prompt charges of a cover-up. The committee wants the independent investigator to examine inconsistencies in congressional testimony by administration officials on US policy toward Iraq before Mr Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.</p>

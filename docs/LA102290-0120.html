Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> CZECH COMMUNIST CHIEF OUSTED  </P> <P> Parliament today ousted the Communist Party chief from its upper house after  his criticisms of government reforms prompted nationwide anti-Communist  protests.  </P> <P> The dismissal of Vasil Mohorita followed President Vaclav Havel's firing last  week of Gen. Miroslav Vacek as defense minister -- to regain civilian control  of the military after four decades of Communist rule.  </P> <P> Mohorita was dismissed today from the 40-member Parliament Presidium, the upper  house in the 300-seat bicameral national assembly. Presidium members are chosen  by the lower house in proportion to the popular vote for each party in the  lower chamber. Legislators in the lower chamber, the House of the People, voted  117 to 86 to replace him, the state news agency CTK reported. Mohorita will  remain a deputy in the lower house. CTK did not say who would replace him in  the Presidium.  </P></p>

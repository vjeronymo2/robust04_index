			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Switch in demand for workers Patterns of demand for temporary and permanent staff have diverged radically over the past few years, Reed Personnel Services, the employment agency group, said. Demand for permanent staff outstripped temporary demand throughout the 1980s. However, during the recession the demand for temporary staff fell less sharply than that for permanent staff. In the last quarter the agency's index for temporary staff rose eight points to 97, against the 1990 base level of 100. The permanent-staff index rose seven points to 50.</p>

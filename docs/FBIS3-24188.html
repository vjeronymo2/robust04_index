			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Tordes: "Siberia Demands an Increase in </F> Export Quotas: and the Far East Military-Industrial Complex  Demands a Supplemental Feeding From Moscow"]    [Text] It is not just in the capital that passions over the  budget are heating up: Demands by members of the Council of  Ministers from the army, agriculture and the military-industrial  complex are being backed up by the voices of their subordinates  from remote Russian regions.    On behalf of the defense industry in the Far East (which  remains the patrimony of the military-industrial complex), a  "conference of commodity producers" that convened in Khabarovsk  has already expressed its views perfectly clearly. The directors  who gathered there stated that in the pst two years their  production volume has amounted to nearly 30 percent, and more  than 122,000 specialists have left the region than have come  there during the same period.    The major council of the Siberian Agreement Association that  met yesterday identified a similar situation in Siberia.  However, Siberia's raw material producers may count not only on  Moscow but also on themselves. The main proposals to the  government from the governors of the krays and oblasts across  the Urals have to do with a very sizeable expansion of the  territories' export rights. The Siberians believe that the  "institution of special exporters" ought to be abolished as a  concept, granting everyone equal rights to engage in foreign  economic activity. At the same time, export quotas should be  increased to 20 percent of the output produced in the region--by  decision of local authorities, without getting the Center's  consent.    In the opinion of Siberian Agreement, the share of collected  customs duties and export taxes that is left in the region  should be raised to at least 30 percent. However, the export  duties themselves, the Siberians insist, should be reduced, and  import duties for medicines, food and equipment should be  abolished entirely.    Aleksey Gumilevskiy, director of the Russian Federation  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relation's Main Administration for  Coordinating the Foreign Economic Activities of the Components  of the Federation, told ITAR-TASS that "such favorable treatment  cannot be granted to any one territory taken by itself," and  that "a number of the problems mentioned would be eliminated if  there were a gradual transition from nontariff methods of  regulating foreign economic activity to purely tariff-based  methods of regulation." However, it does not look as though  Siberia will agree to wait until that finally happens. Valeriy  Zubov, governor of Krasnoyarsk Kray, has repeatedly stated that  the use of regional export revenues may become the only  alternative to federal budget subsidies to money-losing  enterprises.    As for the military-industrial complex's directors  themselves--the "commodity producers" (although the word  "commodity," i.e., what is bought and sold, is somewhat strained  when applied to their products)--they continue to count on being  bailed out by one form of support or another. Despite the  industry's crisis, fewer than 4 percent of the enterprise's in  Khabarovsk Kray have been shut down, and just a little more than  another 7 percent have gone to a reduced work week. Employment  is being artificially maintained: with official unemployment of  6,500 persons, hidden unemployment exceeds 50,000.    In the meantime, in neighboring Maritime Kray the defense  industry has already wangled money from the government to pay  the power engineers. What's sensational about the situation is  that the power engineers' debts were not paid anyway, and the  emergency economic situation in the kray has been extended until  7 March. According to some information, the directors of the  defense industries preferred to put the money into circulation  and put off repayment of the debts "until later."</p>

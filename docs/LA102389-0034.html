			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF;  </P> <P> CASPER SHOOTS 68 TO WIN BY 3  </P> <P> Billy Casper, who began the day in a four-way tie for the lead, shot a  four-under-par 68 Sunday to win the $400,000 Transamerica Senior Championship  by three strokes over Al Geiberger at Napa, Calif.  </P> <P> Casper, who was tied with Geiberger, Dave Hill and Charles Coody after three  rounds, had four birdies in his bogey-free round that gave him a 54-hole total  of 207, nine under par for three rounds on the 6,632-yard Silverado Country  Club course.  </P> <P> Casper earned $60,000 with the victory after he bogeyed only three holes in  three rounds and three-putted just once.  </P> <P> Geiberger's final-round left him in second at 210. He won $35,000.  </P> <P> Coody, with a final-round 72, and Larry Ziegler (70) tied for third four  strokes back, while Bob Charles (72) was fifth at 212. Hill was never in  contention, finishing with a 74 to wind up sixth at 213.  </P> <P> "I had my chances, I just didn't do anything," Geiberger said. "So, Billy said,  'I'm going to do it,' and bam, bam, bam."  </P> <P> Geiberger quickly took a two-stroke lead in the final round with birdies on the  first two holes. Casper caught him with birdies on the third and sixth holes.  Geiberger then lost a stroke with a bogey on the seventh hole, a par three.  </P> <P> Casper, whose previous best finish this year was a tie for second, moved out to  a three-stroke lead with birdies on 14 and 15.  </P> <P> "Sometimes that's the most dangerous way to start out," said Geiberger, who  made birdie putts of 10 and 15 feet on the first two holes, then struggled.  </P> <P> "I think I was trying so hard to make the putts to get out of that logjam,"  Geiberger said.  </P> <P> "This was the old Billy coming through here today," Geiberger said. "But when I  look back on this tournament I'll probably, in the back of my mind, feel like I  should've won."  </P></p>

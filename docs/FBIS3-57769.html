Embassy under secretary Ali Koprulu evaluating the incidents  said Turkish citizens should be calm against provocations.    Koprulu said he talked to Belgian Foreign Ministry officials  and wanted them to put an end to the outlawed separatist  terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's  activities in this country.    Ten Turkish citizens and five Belgian policemen were wounded  in a clash in Brussels on Saturday when Turkish citizens were  protesting the outlawed separatist terrorist PKK organization's  meeting. Turkish citizens were trying to prevent a meeting of  between 150 and 200 terrorists from taking place in a hall in  the Saint-Josse area of north Brussels. Turkish citizens became  angry when the terrorists attempted to hang a flag outside over  the balcony.    Police intervened later and dispersed the crowd with a water  cannon shortly after midnight. Police officials said many  Turkish citizens were taken into custody and several windows and  car windscreens were broken.    PKK terrorists were taken from the spot in small groups.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Commodities Prices: Chinese sales hit copper - Market report Persistent Chinese selling of COPPER gradually undermined market sentiment at the London Metal Exchange and sent prices lower late yesterday. The three months delivery price, which had earlier reached Dollars 2,454 a tonne, closed at Dollars 2,449.50, up Dollars 5 on balance. 'This is a poor close, although the Chinese were looking to buy just under the market,' one trader commented. Three months ALUMINIUM came under liquidation pressure when it became apparent it was not going to hold above the Dollars 1,550 resistance level that was briefly breached in the morning. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta COFFEE futures reversed early losses after see-sawing wildly on thin volume as the market awaited fresh news on the Brazilian frost damage. The September position closed at Dollars 3,898 a tonne, up Dollars 58. 'Trade and fund buying this afternoon on thin volume caught the market by surprise and the sellers backed off,' one trader explained.

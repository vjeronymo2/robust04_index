			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR WHEELS: 'LEMON LAW' PROVIDES FOR REMEDIES TO OWNERS OF DEFECTIVE CARS  </P> <P> Question: I purchased a new Nissan Sentra nearly a year ago. I've taken it into  the dealership repeatedly because it tends to stall in traffic jams. I am  frustrated because I don't think the dealer knows how to fix it. I am  considering filing a lawsuit under the "lemon law," but I don't know where to  begin. I understand various groups offer arbitration, but I have friends who  advise me to get a lawyer. What should I do? -- S.A.  </P> <P> Answer: You will find no shortage of books, pamphlets and guides to help assert  your rights under various arbitration programs and lemon laws. The problem is  selecting the route that will satisfy your goals with the least headache and in  the shortest possible time.  </P> <P> In the simplest terms, lemon laws are intended to force a manufacturer to  replace your car if it cannot be satisfactorily repaired after a limited number  of attempts. California has the nation's strongest lemon law, known as the  Song-Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, but almost every state has a similar law,  and the federal Magnuson-Moss Act applies all over the nation.  </P> <P> Under the Song-Beverly law, a motorist is entitled to a full refund or a  replacement car if, during the first year, a specific problem cannot be  repaired after four attempts or if the car is out of service for more than 30  days for any problems.  </P> <P> The law also provides for punitive damages. About half of all cases are settled  with punitive damages, which can range from $1,000 to $100,000, according to  Norman Taylor, a Los Angeles attorney with one of the largest lemon law  practices in the nation. Most lemon laws provide for attorney fees to be paid  by the manufacturer, and most attorneys take cases on a contingency fee, so  there is little downside risk for the motorist.  </P> <P> "We have touched only the tip of the iceberg under this law," Taylor said.  "There aren't enough people who are aware of their rights."  </P> <P> Consumers can also go to small claims court, but damages are limited to actual  losses and are capped, typically, at $2,000. You cannot be represented by an  attorney in small claims court and if you lose your case, you generally are out  of luck, because such decisions cannot be appealed.  </P> <P> Finally there are the arbitration boards, set up by the manufacturers  themselves or by organizations such as the Better Business Bureau. In many  cases, arbitration is a required first step before a lemon law suit. (Lawsuits  may drag on for a year and a half, during which time you will continue to  suffer with your lemon.)  </P> <P> Taylor insists that such arbitration boards are not neutral bodies and  generally are not licensed by state consumer affairs organizations. And they do  not operate under the strict regulations set down by lemon laws. Such boards  generally are panned by consumer advocates as well.  </P> <P> Before deciding on a course of action, you may want to read some specialized  publications. The Center for Auto Safety, a Ralph Nader group, publishes the  368-page Lemon Book, which contains details on almost every state's lemon law,  suggestions on small claims cases and information about various arbitration  boards. It is available in bookstores.  </P> <P> The California Department of Consumer Affairs publishes Lemon-Aid for New Car  Buyers, an easy 12-page guide to the Song-Beverly law. You can get it by  sending a stamped, self-addressed legal-size envelope to the department, P.O.  Box 310, Sacramento, Calif. 95802.  </P> <P> The Better Business Bureau publishes How BBB Auto Line Works, concerning its  arbitration program. It is available from the Council for Better Business  Bureaus, Southern California Auto Line, 5800 S. Eastern Ave. 370, Commerce,  Calif. 90040.  </P> <P> Q. Of what use is a ported vacuum switch? Mine was broken off and the car still  drove all right.  </P> <P>  -- L.F.S.  </P> <P> A. A ported vacuum switch is part of a vacuum-operated system, such as the  vacuum advance for the distributor or the exhaust-gas recirculation system. At  idle, the switch provides no vacuum, and once the car is under way, it provides  vacuum to whatever system with which it is connected.  </P> <P> Without knowing which ported vacuum switch broke on your car, its effect is  difficult to determine. If it is the vacuum advance on the distributor, you  might not notice any change, but you may be losing fuel economy and  performance.  </P></p>

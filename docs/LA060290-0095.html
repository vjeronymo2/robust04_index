			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> LIFEGUARDS WARN OF PERIL AT SOUTH JETTY  </P> <P> Lifeguards in charge of patrolling Marina Cove Beach in Ventura Harbor say they  are fed up with risking their lives in belated rescue efforts to save lives at  the south jetty beach while local authorities look the other way.  </P> <P> "It's the most dangerous beach in the county, said veteran lifeguard Steve  Miskulin, who has spent 12 years working on Marina Cove. He said that "99 out  of 100" accidents that take place there could be prevented if the city of  Ventura or the port district would provide lifeguard service on the south  jetty.  </P> <P> State, city and port officials disagree with the lifeguards. They believe that  the beach is too dangerous for bathers and that offering lifeguard services  there would send the wrong message.  </P> <P> They say they want swimmers and inexperienced surfers to stay out, and for that  reason, they have warning signs advising the public not to use the beach. But  the signs, which read, "Warning: Hazardous Riptides, No Lifeguards On Duty," do  not prevent public use of the south jetty.  </P> <P> On Friday, at least a half dozen surfers, boogie boarders and swimmers bathed  dangerously close to the jetty to take advantage of the strong waves, which are  non-existent in the calm, enclosed Marina Cove Beach on the other side of the  artificial rock barrier.  </P> <P> Standing atop the jetty, Miskulin and California State Lifeguard Assn.  President Kirk Sturm looked down at the surfers with obvious concern.  </P> <P> Sturm and Miskulin said that in the last five years at least three people have  drowned at the south jetty and that lifeguards make at least 100 rescues a year  there, often risking their own lives because the call for help comes too late.  </P> <P> The problem is further compounded, Miskulin said, by the fact that the Ventura  Harbor District has promoted the south jetty by building several parking lots  and restrooms nearby, including a 37-car lot recently completed.  </P> <P> Steve Treanor, superintendent of Channel Coast District State Parks, which has  75 lifeguards on Ventura beaches, says he understands the lifeguards' concerns  but does not believe the solution is more supervision.  </P> <P> "We feel it's not a safe beach, and any increase in use will make the problem  worse," he said. "I think the lifeguards are looking at the problem on emotion  and not with the facts. Statistically, south jetty beach is no worse than many  other areas along the coast in terms of accidents."

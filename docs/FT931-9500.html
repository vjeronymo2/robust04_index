			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Letter: Legislation needs costing Sir, You report that the number of civil servants is increasing ('Whitehall fails to keep its numbers in check', February 8). If the government is serious about reducing their numbers, may I recommend that it passes the following Act of parliament: 'Each Bill placed before parliament shall contain an accurate estimate of the number of civil servants needed to implement the provisions therein.' This would be a useful lever to encourage the government to give a cost-benefit justification of proposed legislation. It is not unreasonable to hope that it would at least marginally reduce the flow of legislation, thus easing the pressure on the civil service.

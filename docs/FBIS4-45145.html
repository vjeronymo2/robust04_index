			<p>BFN     [Text] Ukrainian MPs who are members of the country's  Officers' Union will insist that Ukraine stay nuclear if the  Crimean parliament does not align the Crimean legislation with  the Ukrainian laws. Vyacheslav Belous, the union chairman, made  this statement in Kiev Wednesday.    Kiev wants Crimea to rescind the original wording of its May  6, 1992 Constitution that calls for a treaty-based relationships  between Crimea and Ukraine and enables the Crimean residents to  have dual citizenship.    Belous said that his organization would support Leonid  Kravchuk in the June 26 elections.    The Officers' Union, he said, opposes the attempts that  anti-state forces inside and outside the Supreme Soviet mount to  eliminate or disable the presidency in Ukraine. It regards the  president as the guarantor of the country's unity and  independence.    The Ukrainian Officers' Union has a membership of about  10,000.</p>

Hong  indicated a decision soon on canceling South Korea-U.S. joint  military exercise "Team Spirit," saying the two countries will  consult on the matter.    Widespread speculation is that the two countries will  announce the cancellation around the time the IAEA inspection  team begins activities in North Korea.    "This is only a beginning," said Hong after welcoming North  Korea's decision to accept IAEA inspections after nearly a  one-year break. "But to completely resolve the situation, North  Korea must accept special inspection on its two undeclared  facilities, fully return to Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  (NPT), and implement inter-Korean agreement on  denuclearization," he said.    Hong repeated earlier position by Seoul and Washington that  North Korea must reopen inter-Korean dialogue before the United  States will hold next round of high-level talks with it.    "There are many issues to be settled through South-North  Korea dialogue," the vice foreign minister said. The dialogue  is not necessarily linked to the outcome of IAEA inspections, to  begin as early as this week, he said, "the talks can be held  before or after the results are out."</p>

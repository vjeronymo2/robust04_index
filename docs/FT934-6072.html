			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Personal View: Balkan crisis comes between friends As European Union officials prepare for Bill Clinton's first trip to Europe as president, in January, there is a growing awareness that something is seriously wrong in Europe-US relations. Trouble was in the air even before President Clinton, strengthened by his recent North American Free Trade Agreement victory, signalled to Europe that the US would favour its Asian trading partners if the EU does not move far enough to make possible a deal on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Is there a Europe-US crisis in the making? Is trade the problem? The answer to the first question is maybe and to the second no. The real problem is the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia and the questions it raises about who should do what in world peacekeeping. There are trade disputes, but for now each side is doing what it could be expected to do - bargain. The Balkan crisis is deeper and harder to talk about. Some in Europe have difficulty understanding why this should keep coming up in transatlantic relations. Americans are seen in Europe as naive, self-righteous and hectoring, or at least unrealistic when they seemingly preach to Europe about a problem that has no easy solution, no single villain and apparently nothing but political downside. At least in trade the EU can understand the US interest, but in the Balkans Americans seem like boy scouts. In fact, the US does have an essential interest in knowing its closest allies share a sense of peacekeeping responsibilities. The fall of the Soviet Union and end of a world dominated by two superpowers has ignited a debate within the US about its role in world peacekeeping. There is little consensus on when it is necessary to use force and who should do it. But many key US policymakers, especially in Congress, continue to believe the primary responsibility for the Balkans lies with Europe. However well-intentioned and skilful Lord Owen's efforts have been, including the most recent round to try to exchange sanctions for territory, they appear to lack two essential ingredients of world peacekeeping: muscle and moral basis. As to muscle, there is intense resentment both on Capitol Hill and among some administration officials towards the perception that Europe will not or cannot use force where it must. Americans do not want to be the bouncers or bodyguards for other wealthy nations that sit comfortably indoors. Europeans have not forgotten the stinging comments of Senator Joseph Biden, the ranking Democrat on the foreign relations committee, a few months ago, to the effect that Americans were tired of Europe 'holding our coats' while urging the US to do the fighting. On the lack of moral basis, the Now York Times columnist, Anthony Lewis, wrote in March that the EU was a 'dead. . .soul-less creature' because of its failure to act meaningfully to stop the carnage in Bosnia. It is not just Americans who have been critical. The Czech Republic's president, Vaclav Havel, said in his October 9 address to the general assembly of the Council of Europe: 'The former Yugoslavia is the first great testing ground for Europe in the era that was initiated by the end of the cold war.' Havel added that Europe's response is a failure on a scale with its failure to deal with Nazism and Soviet tyranny. The moral vacuum of Europe's actions - or non-actions - is underscored by the plan for a partial lifting of sanctions in exchange for more land for Bosnian Moslems. In itself, this is probably a good stop, and the US does seem so far to favour it. However, the problem is that it lacks any condemnation, let alone deterrence, for the unspeakable acts of inhumanity that have transpired and will almost certainly continue. What if such trades succeed in calming the hostilities and even providing relief from the winter? Of course, that would be a blessing, but what lesson would it give? Kill, rape, torture, maim innocent people, including the old and young, until it gets you no more - then sit down and do business. By accepting its responsibility to stop the atrocities, punish the guilty and restore what Havel referred to as 'the values of a civic society based on the peaceful coexistence of different ethnic groups and cultures', Europe would prove itself a trusted and trustable ally with which the US can join to preserve world peace. This is not to say that Europe and North America must always agree on peacekeeping, the role of force and who must do what and where. But they must at least both be in the same game, willing to take similar risks to preserve common values.

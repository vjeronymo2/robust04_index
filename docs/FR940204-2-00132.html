The Portfolios are sold primarily, but not exclusively, through offices of the Distributor, including locations in offices of Home Savings of America, FSB, a federally chartered savings association, which is affiliated with the Adviser and the Distributor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Adviser, an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, serves as investment adviser to the Portfolios. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Distributor, a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, serves as the sponsor and distributor of the Portfolios. The Distributor has entered into a distribution agreement with Griffin, pursuant to which it has responsibility for distributing shares of the Portfolios. The Portfolios also have adopted distribution plans pursuant to rule 12b&hyph;1 under the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants propose to establish a multiple distribution system (the ``Multi-Class System'').

In addition, the Funds may create additional 12b&hyph;1 Class, Non-12b&hyph;1 Class, and Trust Class shares that differ according to the characteristics described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.

Shares of the 12b&hyph;1 Class will be sold to investors purchasing directly from a Fund's distributor, or to clients of certain financial institutions that have entered into agreements with the Fund or the Fund's distributor to provide necessary distribution and administrative services with respect to the 12b&hyph;1 Class. Distribution activities financed in accordance with a 12b&hyph;1 Plan may include advertising and marketing expenses, printing costs for new prospectuses and sales literature, and payments to broker/dealers and others for distribution assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Non-12b&hyph;1 Class will be offered pursuant to a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 servicing plan (the ``Services Plan,'' and together with the 12b&hyph;1 Plans, the ``Plans'') approved by the board of directors of a Fund under which a Fund will enter into servicing agreements with qualified financial institutions (``Organizations'') to provide necessary administrative support services to customers of Organizations who are the beneficial owners of Non-12b&hyph;1 Class shares. Services provided pursuant to a Services Plan may include subaccounting; establishing and maintaining accounts and records; aggregating and processing purchase and redemption orders; investing customers' assets in shares of the Non-12b&hyph;1 Class; providing periodic statements; arranging for bank wires; processing dividend payments; answering routine inquiries; assisting customers in changing divided options, account designations, and addresses; forwarding shareholder communications; and other similar services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

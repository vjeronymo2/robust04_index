			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OIL PRICES DROP AS SAUDIS LOWER COSTS;  </P> <P> OPEC: A NEW PRICING FORMULA MAY SIGNAL AN END TO THE SAUDIS' SINGLE-HANDED BID  TO SUPPORT A SAGGING OIL MARKET.  </P> <P> Oil prices fell sharply today on fears that Saudi Arabia has abandoned its  single-handed, monthlong attempt to support the sagging oil market.  </P> <P> Traders, alerted to a change in the kingdom's oil price formula, said that the  Gulf nation may now be intent on forcing prices lower to punish other OPEC  members for overproducing crude.  </P> <P> The U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate crude, fell 52 cents to $16.62 per  barrel -- its lowest level in more than two months -- while overseas oil prices  dropped even further.  </P> <P> North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely traded crude, was quoted below $15 a  barrel for the first time since December, 1988. It fetched $23 early this year.  </P> <P> The latest fall in spot prices accelerated a steady decline of recent weeks  that is taking the real value of the barrel, allowing for inflation, to levels  last seen in the gluts of the mid-1980s.  </P> <P> The new drop reflects concern among traders that Saudi Arabia, exasperated by  continued quota violations by others in the 13-member Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries, may soon increase output again to punish the  transgressors.  </P> <P> The fears were prompted by telexes that Saudi Arabia was lowering its contract  price formula for its July oil shipments.  </P> <P> Several traders saw this as a signal that the Saudis might be getting ready to  raise volume after a cut in its output in May, which it made under a new OPEC  agreement intended to reduce the glut. Saudi Arabia has already made known that  it is vexed by how few of the 12 other members joined in cutting output.  </P> <P> But Gulf sources said today that the kingdom regarded its pricing step as a  marketing matter not connected with any decision on output. "We are still at  quota and continue to be," one said.  </P> <P> Western industry officials say that the Saudis will fix their July loading  program in mid-June. If output indiscipline in the rest of OPEC is still trying  their patience then, they could yet rescind their production cut.  </P> <P> "A lower pricing formula would help them push more volume if they wanted to,"  said Steve Turner, an analyst with London stockbrokerage Smith New Court.  </P> <P> Saudi terms are based on a formula of average spot values minus a discount.  Traders said Saudi Arabia was widening the discount by 35 cents to Europe, 40  cents to the United States and up to 70 cents for heavy grades sold in Asia.  </P> <P> The West's energy watchdog, the Paris-based International Energy Agency, today  assessed total OPEC output in May at 23.4 million barrels per day, down only  400,000 from April.  </P> <P> The new output agreement aimed to cut more than three times as much oil as  that.  </P></p>

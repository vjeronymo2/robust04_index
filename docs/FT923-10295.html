			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant export markets help Dale Electric surge 50% ROBUST EXPORT markets helped Dale Electric International, the Yorkshire-based power and lighting company, report a 50 per cent rise to Pounds 1.9m in 1991-92 profits before tax and exceptional items, in spite of a small drop in sales. Mr Iain Dale, chief executive, said exports had jumped from 40 per cent to 55 per cent of turnover last year. Overall, sales fell from Pounds 56.6m to Pounds 55.9m for the year to May 3. Demand in the Pacific Rim continued to be strong, Mr Dale said, while the UK remained depressed. 'Ten years ago we invested heavily in the export market,' he said. 'That investment has helped us to sustain recovery in these difficult times.' He added, however, that Dale might struggle in the dollar denominated export market if the currency remained weak. Pre-tax profits were buoyed by lower interest charges of Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 2.3m) and a Pounds 395,000 increase to Pounds 456,000 in the contribution from associated companies. The restated 1.02p loss per share moved back into the black with earnings of 10.15p. The final dividend is maintained at 3.1p, for a same-again 5.1p total.</p>

			<p><P> August 11, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. HARD ROCK READY TO ROLL IN THE U.S.S.R.  </P> <P> The massive official name of the Saturday-Sunday rock spectacular at  75,000-capacity Lenin Stadium here is the Moscow Music Peace Festival.  </P> <P> But several of the organizers and musicians have another name for the most  ambitious Western rock event ever staged in a country where the American-bred  music was once denounced as bourgeois decadence.  </P> <P> Their name: the Russian Woodstock.  </P> <P> Alex Belov, lead guitarist for the Soviet rock band Gorky Park, likes the ring  of the term. But Belov, whose band will be on the bill with such Western acts  as Bon Jovi, Ozzy Osbourne and Motley Crue, believes that the connection with  Woodstock is more than simply a convenient media term on a weekend that happens  to be the 20th anniversary of that landmark U.S. rock event.  </P> <P> Belov says the Moscow concerts may come to represent the same revolutionary  turning point in this country's rock development as those three days and nights  on Max Yasgur's farm had on rock in Upstate New York.  </P> <P> Despite occasional appearances here over the last 10 years by such mainstream  pop-rock figures as Elton John and Billy Joel, Soviet officials have been  reluctant to open the door to Western acts, especially the rebellious,  high-energy "bad boys" who compose much of this weekend's lineup.  </P> <P> Belov, 31, said the government has also discouraged the development of Soviet  bands by "forbidding" any group that was deemed unacceptable for any of a  number of reasons, including themes.  </P> <P> But all that has changed greatly in the age of glasnost, the guitarist said  Thursday as his band walked in a light drizzle from the Ukrainia Hotel to the  van for the ride to the stadium for an afternoon sound check. Not only are  there signs of greater flexibility in allowing foreign bands to play here, but  Soviet bands are also being given increasing freedom.  </P> <P> Boris Grebenshikov, a veteran singer-songwriter who has been called the Bob  Dylan of the Soviet Union, has recently made an album produced by British  rocker Dave Stewart for Columbia Records and is now on a U.S. tour.  </P> <P> Belov's Gorky Park, a harder-rocking group whose sound has been likened to that  of '60s power trio Cream, is something of a Soviet supergroup, formed two years  ago by the leading musicians from several competing bands.  </P> <P> The group has spent much of the last six months in the United States and Canada  recording an album due soon from PolyGram Records. Belov said that most Soviet  bands are "too inexperienced" to mount a serious challenge against Western  groups, but feels the loosening of restrictions will change that. Seeing  Western bands this weekend should inspire more young Soviets to start dreaming  their own rock dreams -- a difficult, nearly impossible dream for many until  now.  </P> <P> "In many ways, our music scene is just beginning because it was held back for  so long," said Belov, who was once in a band that was declared "forbidden." But  he added proudly: "There has been a new government attitude the last three  years and this concert should give our bands confidence and inspiration."  </P> <P> Doc McGhee, who manages several of the bands on the weekend bill including Bon  Jovi and Motley Crue, also likes the "Russian Woodstock" image, but for  different reasons. McGhee, 38, hopes that the shows' anti-drug message will  erase much of the Woodstock legacy of permissive drug use.  </P> <P> "The musical aspect of Woodstock was very important, but there were some sad  consequences of the social aspects," he said.  </P> <P> "The message many people came away from Woodstock with was that drugs were OK,  even a necessary part of the rock 'n' roll experience. A lot of lives have been  lost because of that over the last 20 years, and we are trying in these  concerts to say that drugs don't have to be part of rock. You can still have  fun and you can still be rebellious without drugs -- and the bonus is you will  have a better chance of living."  </P> <P> McGhee said the concerts are designed to raise money for and promote the goals  of the Make a Difference Foundation, which he started last year with a $250,000  contribution.  </P> <P> The goal is to raise between $6 million and $10 million from the festival and  such related events as a pay-per-view telecast in the United States (5 to 9  p.m. Sunday in Southern California), a syndicated radio broadcast (on KQLZ-FM  (100.3) in Los Angeles) and an album. Rather than simply featuring songs from  the festival, the album will feature new studio versions of songs by artists  who were drug casualties.  </P> <P> Tickets for the shows were $15 to $22 -- high by local concert standards, some  teen-age rock fans said Thursday. But, they quickly added, "there has never  been anything like this," so it is difficult to compare. At any rate, the shows  are sold out and dozens of fans hung around the hotel most of the day, taking  photos of the musicians and getting autographs.  </P> <P> McGhee, who has offices in Los Angeles and New York, started the Make a  Difference Foundation last year as part of a community service provision on  probation given him after he pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to "aiding  and abetting" in the distribution of an estimated 40,000 pounds of marijuana in  1982.  </P> <P> The manager said he has experimented with drugs but had sworn off them long  before last year's court action and was involved in anti-drug campaigns before  the community service order.  </P> <P> Several musicians on the bill, including Jon Bon Jovi, Osbourne and Vince Neil  of Motley Crue, have also acknowledged drug or alcohol use, but now say that it  is in their past and warn young people about its dangers.  </P> <P> The bands landed here late Wednesday after a flight on the "Magic Bus," a  chartered 757 that left Newark, N.J., and stopped near London to pick up  additional passengers. In keeping with the concerts' theme, no alcohol was  served on the plane and there was no apparent drug use.  </P> <P> The latter observation was confirmed -- perhaps unexpectedly -- when uniformed  officials brought a dog on board during the 45-minute stopover in Britain. Most  of the estimated 175 passengers were off the plane while the dog roamed the  aisles, stopping here and there to sniff the area.  </P> <P> But some members of the tour party saw the dog enter the plane and, even with  the drug-free policy, at least one member of the group became momentarily  anxious.  </P> <P> "My first thought was, 'Oh my God, are they going to find anything?,' " the  tour member said. "Then I realized I had flashed on the old days when a dog on  a plane could have been a disaster. I guess times really do change."  </P> <P> After a press conference at the airport in Moscow, the musicians were taken on  a brief tour of the city, stopping only for a glimpse of giant Lenin Stadium,  scene of many of the activities in the 1980 Olympic Games.  </P> <P> The band members -- many in their unmistakable hard-rock attire -- caused a  flurry of interest among tourists when buses stopped to let them view the  stadium from a scenic point near the facility.  </P> <P> Various American and European tourists who had been shooting pictures of the  landscape suddenly turned and began snapping photos of the visiting musicians.  </P> <P> Because many of these bands don't have as much of a profile with the non-rock  audience as mass-media stars like Mick Jagger or David Bowie, the tourists  scrambled about asking members of the tour party just whom they were taking  pictures of.  </P> <P> Informed that the tall fellow with the row of tattoos was a member of Motley  Crue, a woman from Indiana all but gasped. "I made my son throw away some of  their posters. I couldn't stand looking at them in his room. What are they  doing here?"  </P> <P> Most surprised, however, were the local residents who happened to be in the  area. Though punk touches -- rainbow-colored hair, an occasional Mohawk,  leather jackets with skull and crossbones, biker boots -- can sometimes be seen  here, seeing all these bands together was something of a culture shock.  </P> <P> "Who are these people?" one local woman asked in halting English. She didn't  show any signs of recognition of the visiting bands, but a mention of Gorky  Park did cause a reaction. It wasn't that she had heard of the Soviet band. She  thought the American visitor was asking how to get to the real Gorky Park, a  combination recreation area and theater zone similar to Griffith Park in Los  Angeles. After a brief huddle in Russian with her husband, she started pointing  directions.  </P> <P> Before getting back on the bus for the ride to the hotel, a member of the New  Jersey-based band Skid Row band showed that even on a drug-free journey there  is room for some old-fashioned rock tomfoolery. As he neared the bus, singer  Sebastian Bach lowered his pants and mooned the crowd of onlookers, including a  pair of Moscow policemen sitting in a parked squad car.  </P> <P> One woman put one hand over her eyes and pulled her young daughter away. The  Moscow police? They just seemed to shake their heads in wonder.  </P> <P> How did this rambunctious bunch ever get into the Soviet Union? Driving force  McGhee said that his stress on the anti-drug message was a key, because drug  and alcohol abuse is a growing problem in the Soviet Union. The word peace in  the title also made it more appealing.  </P> <P> Still, it wasn't easy. McGhee made nine trips to the Soviet Union to set it up  and had to deal with several government agencies. He was aided by Soviet  musician Stas Namin, whose grandfather was formerly a high Communist Party  official. McGhee also introduced the Soviet officials to Jon Bon Jovi, the most  diplomatic and acceptable-looking member of the rock roster. McGhee didn't  detail the background of all the other acts, especially Ozzy Osbourne, who  seems to attract controversy -- he has been accused of everything from  advocating satanism to inspiring suicide to intentionally biting the head off a  dead bat (he did do the last, but it was an accident).  </P> <P> Some of the Western concert organizers speculated that the concerts may be  another gamble by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his continuing effort  to sustain the glasnost spirit and renew the spirits of disaffected youth. They  believe that Soviet officials will be watching the shows closely to see what  happens when they ease up after repressing rock for so long.  </P> <P> "I can't help but think what happens here this weekend is going to be pretty  historic," Jon Bon Jovi said seriously. Then, referring to the weekend's  biggest example of culture shock, he quipped, "I imagine Mr. Bush and Mr.  Gorbachev are both going to be aware of who Ozzy Osbourne is."  </P></p>

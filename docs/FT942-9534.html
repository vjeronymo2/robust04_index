			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Books: History in the balance - Malcolm Rutherford admires Kissinger the academic DIPLOMACY by Henry Kissinger Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 25, 912 pages If you want to pay someone a compliment, give them Henry Kissinger's Diplomacy. True, it is immensely long: half way through, I began withdrawing my initial impression that it is one of the best books I have read on any subject. But it picks up again and is certainly one of the best, and most enjoyable, on international relations past and present. Kissinger has many advantages. He was born in Germany in 1923, moved to the US in 1938 and served in the American army in the second world war. He was an historian at Harvard long before he worked for any American administration. Comparisons between 19th century Europe and the 20th century world come naturally to him. He wrote A World Restored: Castlereagh, Metternich and the Restoration of Peace, 1812-1822, some of which is reflected in Diplomacy, in the mid-1950s. It was intended as the first of series running up to the first world war. Real diplomacy then intervened. Kissinger has benefited from the experience. He now takes us to 1994, sometimes with an inside view, and with a look beyond. Moreover, Kissinger, the academic, can write better than Kissinger, the practising statesman, ever spoke. The book is a pleasure to read. There are also defects. Kissinger is not much interested in social or economic trends: a country's economy is relevant to him only in so far as it adds to political and military power. He is not greatly interested in democracy either, still less in human rights. On the latter he advises President Clinton not to push too hard in America's relations with China; if he does, the Chinese might not take him seriously in his pursuit of equilibrium in Asia. Again, there is a curiously old-fashioned approach to the 'great men' of history. Kissinger has his heroes: Richelieu, Bismarck and, to some extent, the German chancellor Stresemann among them. Even where the bad far outweighs the good, he cannot always avoid a sneaking admiration. For instance, 'Stalin was indeed a monster; but in the conduct of international relations, he was the supreme realist - patient, shrewd, and implacable, the Richelieu of his period'. Kissinger is not a moralist. For all his brilliance, neither is he perhaps as good as he thinks he is at reducing his thoughts to a thesis. If Diplomacy has a single theme, it is that there is a fundamental distinction between a foreign policy based on the pursuit and maintenance of a balance of power and one based on altruism. Kissinger prefers the former. His main illustration comes from the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson. Roosevelt, he writes, went in for 'muscular diplomacy'. He was the first US president 'to insist that it was America's duty to make its influence felt globally, and to relate America to the world in terms of a concept of national interest'. Thus he was a 'warrior-statesman' whereas Wilson, with his belief in the power of public opinion as a force for good, was a 'prophet-priest'. The difference between the categories is that 'statesmen, even warriors, focus on the world in which they live; to prophets, the 'real' world is the one they want to bring into being'. Yet one wonders if the real world is anything like tidy enough to sustain such a distinction. Kissinger makes very little allowance for accidents, mistakes or the sheer unexpected (Pearl Harbour, for example). There is also a tendency to idealise the past. One of the reasons he believes a balance of power was maintained for so long after the Congress of Vienna in 1815 was that the participants had shared values. He is distinctly shaky about saying what those values were, save perhaps a preference for the status quo, just as he seldom denies one of his favourite words - 'legitimacy'. Sometimes he seems to be saying that if only everyone had been as intelligent as Bismarck, the European peace might have lasted even longer. Germany would have simply emerged as the dominant power in Europe without war and, as Kissinger observes, the Germans have got there in the end. It is not ultimately for the judgments, however, that Diplomacy should be read. It is for the sheer historical sweep, the characterisations, the story-telling, the ability to look at large parts of the world as a whole. The failings in British policy between the two world wars, for instance, look quite different when viewed by a dispassionate American historian. Kissinger thinks that it was the reluctance to make alliances that let Britain down, and a failure to understand Stalin. He is also notably sympathetic to Britain and France at Suez. He never makes the mistake of condemning with hindsight. Kissinger's own role in history emerges very gradually. The first use of the first person comes in shyly on page 347 when he mentions a disagreement with AJP Taylor. Vietnam and the opening to China come much later and are among the best sections in the book. They are not quite autobiographical, but he has a marvellous way of combining past and present experience. Richard Nixon, he thinks, had the most sophisticated grasp of the global balance of power of any president since Theodore Roosevelt. In the 19th century the US had no need for a balance because it was not confronted by any powers needing to be balanced. The change by the end of the 20th, Kissinger concludes, is that America is 'an island off the the shores of the large landmass of Eurasia, whose resources and population far exceed those of the US'. That is why a balance, or a series of balances, still matters.</p>

			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OFFICERS BRING 'FRONTIER JUSTICE' TO PANAMA;  </P> <P> LATIN AMERICA: INVASION AFTERMATH FINDS THE MILITARY FILLING IN FOR A DEPLETED  JUDICIARY.  </P> <P> Navy Lt. Pete Pedrozo squealed his jeep to a dusty halt and strode into what  serves for a jail these days in this small provincial town. With pistol  strapped firmly to his side, the judge had come.  </P> <P> The man behind bars had reportedly stabbed his wife in a drunken rage. But the  acting local magistrate, a schoolteacher, had refused to rule on the case for  fear that any decision might invite bloody retribution.  </P> <P> And so judgment was left to Pedrozo, whose new judicial circuit covers more  than 200 square miles on the west bank of the Panama Canal. The Navy lieutenant  deliberated, and he ruled: Jose Arauz would be bound over for trial.  </P> <P> In a nation in which violence and political fragility in the aftermath of the  American invasion have posed severe tests on those attempting to rebuild the  judicial system, Pedrozo and others who represent the temporary U.S. solution  see themselves in the role of Wild West magistrates such as Judge Roy Bean, who  rode a circuit to enforce the law when no one else would.  </P> <P> "It's frontier justice," said Marine Corps Capt. Barry Cronin, the military  governor, in effect, of the region in which Pedrozo acts as chief judge. "But  it's a start."  </P> <P> The circuit-riding scheme is part of a larger U.S. military effort to impose a  semblance of order on Panama while working gradually to restore full power to  civilian authorities. For now, while lightly armed Panamanian police join U.S.  machine-gunners on joint patrols and night courts have begun to take on  misdemeanor cases, the establishment of a full-scale Panamanian legal system  seems unlikely to occur very soon.  </P> <P> "It's really a tall order for them," Army Gen. Joseph Kinzer, the incoming  deputy commander of U.S. Army South, said in an interview. "What occurred in  the whole operation was that you just neutralized the whole infrastructure.  There isn't much left to grab hold of."  </P> <P> Indeed, crime ran rampant in many parts of Panama in the first days after the  Dec. 20 invasion. Even after the looting stopped, the American soldiers  guarding the streets gave top priority to pursuing suspected members of the  Panama Defense Forces, and for more than a week paid scant attention to the  slew of reported robberies and other street crimes.  </P> <P> The pace of progress since has varied, with the familiar trappings of justice  most visible in the capital, whose return to normalcy was given top priority by  the United States. Members of the newly constituted Panamanian police work  closely with U.S. military police, while some Panamanian courts have begun to  hear minor cases on their own. In a further step, chief prosecutor Rogelio Cruz  said last week that he had issued formal criminal complaints against more than  50 former associates of ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> But in the zone of Arraijan, on the far side of the canal from the metropolis,  the visage of justice more often bears smears of camouflage paint, and its  bearing remains unmistakably that of the U.S. military.  </P> <P> It is Marines, not MPs, who patrol the region, peering coolly from their jeeps  and trucks through Vuarnet sunglasses. Although they are joined by members of  the newly renamed Panamanian Public Force, that group's near-universal PDF  heritage breeds wariness among the populace and relegates its members to a  secondary role.  </P> <P> And it is Lt. Pedrozo, and not temporary magistrates like Juana de Gonzales,  who decides at least the immediate fate of suspected criminals like Arauz, the  accused wife-stabber.  </P> <P> Gonzales, a middle-aged woman who before the U.S. invasion worked for 29 years  as an elementary schoolteacher and now is filling in for a Noriega-era judge  who fled and another who has been jailed, said she simply felt uncomfortable  deciding a case as grave as a stabbing. But Panamanian and U.S. authorities  said they believe fear was a factor as well, given the instability of her  authority in a town that has not yet even settled on a mayor to run the city  under the new regime.  </P> <P> "Old hatreds are a problem," said Capt. Milton Castillo, who had been  imprisoned for 21 months at the time of the invasion for his role in a failed  March, 1988, coup attempt against Noriega and was appointed last week as the  Panamanian Public Force's commander in the Arraijan region. "There is a lot  that remains unsettled here."  </P> <P> Echoes of that apprehension raise the very real possibility that Panamanian  leaders might be the last to accept the complete withdrawal of American troops  back to the United States and back inside U.S. bases that were here before the  invasion and will remain, with their primary mission being the defense of the  Panama Canal.  </P> <P> "We probably will want them out sooner than the Panamanians," U.S. Ambassador  Deane R. Hinton told reporters Saturday. "I hear more people saying keep the  troops than get them out."  </P> <P> Another problem that limits Panamanian autonomy is reflected in a situation in  this region west of the canal: The regional jail adjoining Castillo's  headquarters in La Chorrera, the area's largest town, was destroyed in the U.S.  attack. Left with the prospect of housing prisoners in makeshift facilities,  such as a small shed that serves as a holding tank in Arraijan, U.S.  authorities have opted to dispatch them to a central detention area on Empire  Range, a U.S. military area outside Panama City.  </P> <P> That facility is the same one that processed about 4,300 suspected former PDF  members in the aftermath of the invasion, permitting nearly all of them to  return to active duty. About 400 of the prisoners of war remain behind bars,  100 of them in secure cells at Ft. Clayton, a U.S. Army base near Panama City.  Only a few of the latter have been permitted to see visitors, an Army lawyer  said last week. They face continued interrogation by military intelligence  experts before being turned over to Panamanian prosecutors.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the common criminals also will face Panamanian justice; there are  no plans for U.S. military magistrates to conduct proceedings more extensive  than pretrial hearings. But both U.S. and Panamanian authorities concede that  it could be months before that process is fully under way.  </P> <P> In the meantime, U.S. military commanders are prepared for a time to continue  acting as police and prosecutor and judge. "Right now, it's just holding down  the fort," said Capt. David de Silva, a Green Beret assigned to oversee the  transition in La Chorrera.  </P> <P> For his part, Lt. Pedrozo -- who owes his incarnation as circuit judge in the  tropics to his Ohio State law degree and the fact that he is the only Navy  lawyer in Panama -- says he is eager to see the Panamanian magistrates take his  job away from him.  </P> <P> "I've enjoyed it," he said. "But I'm ready to get out of this business just as  soon as they're ready to do the job."  </P></p>

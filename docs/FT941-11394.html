			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Arts: One Day Tradition - New music Under that opaque label, London New Music is presenting four concerts in the Lilian Baylis Theatre. Each is devoted to a pair of 'contemporary' composers, not necessarily alive: the opening concert included the American avant-gardist Henry Cowell, long dead. I went to the second concert on Wednesday, because it included music by Wolfgang von Schweinitz, German, and 41 next Monday. Four years ago I wrote about the Munich Biennale premiere of his Patmos, a very long opera on the complete text of St. John's Revelations in the Lutheran version. Parts of the Munich audience were predictably outraged by Ruth Berghaus's staging, studded with echoes of the Holocaust. I thought Schweinitz's score impressively rich and varied; so I wanted to hear more. Sadly, the LNM concert proved to be one of those bitty affairs that 'contemporary music' fans know too well. The programme is confined by its budget to modest-scale works (some of which will be cancelled at the last moment), and because few contemporary pieces stick to standard ensembles a large part of the running-time will go towards carrying chairs and music stands off the stage and on again. In the event, we heard only the last of Schweinitz's promised three Etudes from 1984, uncertainly delivered by LNM's pianist-conductor Michael Blake. One could hear why he chose not to play the other, more difficult Etudes, but this third one lost much of its effect without its contrasted siblings. With Blake finger-strumming directly upon the piano strings, the soprano Beth Griffith warbled engagingly through 'Sehr kleine Drachen' (1992). We could not tell whether the words lived up to the promising title ('very small dragons'), nor whether the music lived up to them, for they were largely inaudible. Much the most rewarding was his String Trio from 1978. A piece of disillusioned romantic rebellion: frail, heartfelt echoes of Schumann and Brahms are regularly deflated by ruthlessly sinking pitch. Amidst the flamboyant decay, enough lyrical structure survives to carry a sharp, regretful point. The second half was given over to Gerald Barry, an Irish composer who enjoys more of a cult following on the Continent than here. His music sounds like the work of an intelligent composer who is so anxious not to trade upon any established musical modes that he leaves himself room for little more than carefully uncommitted, repetitious tootling. Only his recent Triorchic Blues traced a feisty little vein of its own, in the violinist Charles Mutter's expert hands: laconic, tautly syncopated, dryly witty. We could do with more.</p>

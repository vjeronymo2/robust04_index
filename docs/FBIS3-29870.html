			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 23 (YONHAP) -- South Korean officials  were hopeful Wednesday [23 February] morning that the United  States and North Korea would be able to conclude their talks on  Pyongyang's resumption of nuclear inspections.    Pyongyang and Washington were reportedly negotiating details  at the New York meeting that began early Wednesday (Korean  Standard Time), specifically how and when the two Koreas will  reopen dialogue, how and when South Korea and the United States  will announce suspension of their joint military exercise "Team  Spirit" and the date of the next North Korea-U.S. high-level  talks.    The U.S. State Department maintains that on the same day  that International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections begin  in North Korea, it expects inter-Korean dialogue to resume.    Simultaneously, suspension of Team Spirit and the date for  the third round of U.S.-North Korea high-level talks will be  announced.    Pyongyang and Washington are said to exchange non-paper  [word  as received] on contents of their agreement at the end of the  talks, expected to last until later in the afternoon.</p>

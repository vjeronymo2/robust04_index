			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Money Markets: Short rates firm SHORT TERM interest rates were firm in London yesterday after the Bank of England's operations on the money market, but three-month interbank continued to discount a cut of  1/2 point in bank base rates, while longer rates declined. The Bank of England bought bills for repurchase by the market around the end of the month, indicating caution about an early reduction in base rates, but the market still regards next Friday as a possible date for a cut following publication of the UK retail price index for April. Apart from the repurchase agreement the authorities also indicated caution, and kept the short end firm, by not supplying enough assistance to take out the day's full underlying credit shortage. Overnight money traded around 12 3/4 per cent after the authorities had intervened in the market, with three-month money quoted at 11 9/16 -11 1/2 per cent against 11 9/16 -11 7/16 . One-year funds fell to 11 1/8 -11 from 11 3/16 -11 1/16 per cent. Prices of short sterling futures were firmer on Liffe. June delivery opened slightly higher at 88.89 and closed at 88.91 compared with 88.98 previously. Credit remained in very short supply on the London money market. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1,650m, but revised this to Pounds 1,700m at noon and back to Pounds 1,650m in the afternoon. Total assistance of Pounds 1,548m was provided. An early round of help was offered and at that time the authorities bought Pounds 743m bills, including Pounds 193m outright, by way of Pounds 15m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 6m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 172m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. Another Pounds 550m bills were purchased for resale to the market in equal amounts on May 29, 30 and 31 at rates of 11 29/32 -11 15/16 per cent. Before lunch a further Pounds 428m bills were bought outright, via Pounds 43m bank bills in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent; Pounds 163m Treasury bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent; and Pounds 222m bank bills in band 2 at 11 13/16 per cent. In the afternoon Pounds 222m bank bills were purchased in band 1 at 11 7/8 per cent. Late assistance of around Pounds 155m was also provided. Bills maturing in official hands, repayment of late assistance and a take-up of Treasury bills drained Pounds 806m, with exchequer transactions absorbing Pounds 690m, a rise in the note circulation Pounds 40m and bank balances below target Pounds 115m.</p>

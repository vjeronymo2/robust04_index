			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> That was quite an editorial ("Misplaced Sentimentality," April 27). I don't  think I've ever seen the animal rights movement -- excuse me, the "so-called"  animal rights movement -- so easily dismissed. Since you obviously can't  address the real issue -- that animals are not ours to use, period -- you  resort to name calling: eccentric, cranks, self-righteous, zealots, silly,  self-absorbed, vulgar.  </P> <P> It seems to me that those who defend using helpless animals any way they please  are the ones who are self-absorbed. The fact that you came out against animal  rights was no surprise, since you virtually ignore the movement and run  pro-research articles. But such a shrill, mean-spirited editorial does all your  readers a disservice, regardless of where they stand on the issue.  </P> <P> In fact, it was the most self-righteous, silly, and vulgar thing I have ever  seen written on the subject.  </P> <P> JOYCE WISWELL  </P> <P> Santa Barbara  </P></p>

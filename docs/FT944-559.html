			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / Mexico struggles to avert crisis as peso slips further Mexico's financial difficulties deepened yesterday as the peso fell to record lows and the government struggled to find a way out of the crisis. The currency's sharp fall heightened concerns about the overall health of the Mexican economy, especially with regard to inflation, economic growth and the burden of rising interest payments on foreign debt. The US Treasury Department said yesterday that the peso had fallen too far, adding: 'We have every confidence in the underlying soundness of Mexico's economic policies. We are in close contact with the Mexican and Canadian authorities, regarding the currency markets, and recognise that excessive depreciation is in none of our interests.' It was not clear whether the last part of the statement indicated that the US Tresury was ready to intervene in the peso market on its own account. Mexican government officials indicated to bankers and senior officials in the US yesterday that a comprehensive economic plan would be announced by next Monday at the latest. It would include details of accelerated privatisation - including petrochemicals, electricity generation and transport - further deregulation of the economy, and measures to cut demand. Outlines of some of these measures have already been announced. There are no plans, the officials were reported as saying, for exchange controls. The government is also trying to assemble further international financial support beyond the Dollars 7bn (Pounds 4.5bn) pledged by the US and Canadian governments. One important question is whether Mr Jaime Serra Puche, finance minister, who is widely considered to have handled the devaluation badly, will keep his post. US bankers said it was important that there should be no change of minister during the implementation of the plan. At the close yesterday, the peso was trading at 5.6 to the US dollar, 8.2 per cent lower than Monday's close. Since December 19, the peso has lost 39 per cent against the dollar. President Ernesto Zedillo plans to address the nation on Monday evening, when he will explain the roots of the problem. Mr Zedillo will also outline a plan to confront the crisis and to stabilise the economy. The president's office cautioned that Mr Zedillo may not offer the complete details of a new economic plan in his speech. The main indicator of the Mexican stock market was down 2.81 per cent at the close yesterday. Lex, Page 14; Peso's fall packs a double whammy, Page 15; Currencies, Page 20; World stocks, Page 28</p>

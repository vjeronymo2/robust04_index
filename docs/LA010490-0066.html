			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WESTWOOD;  </P> <P> STUDENT LAW OFFICE OPENS  </P> <P> The UCLA School of Law is opening a teaching law office where attorneys will  supervise students working on actual cases for clients.  </P> <P> Located in a newly completed wing of the law school, the campus law office is  unusual in that it will choose cases primarily for their educational value, a  UCLA spokesman said.  </P> <P> Many of the cases will be small-scale ones that students can complete in a  single semester.  </P> <P> The school is now looking for a lawyer to head the office and assist in  teaching other clinical or practical courses offered by the school. Additional  attorneys will be added to the staff next year.  </P> <P> The office will open on a limited basis this month and will be fully  operational by the 1990-91 school year. The type of cases emphasized will vary  from semester to semester, a spokesman said. Initially, all will be civil  cases.  </P></p>

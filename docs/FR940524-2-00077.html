Inherently Governmental Functions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the response to the first question is affirmative, the contract requirement is for an inherently Governmental function that must be performed by Government officials; if the response to the second question is affirmative, the contract requirement may be for an inherently governmental function: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is the requirement for a function that is listed in appendix A of OFPP Policy Letter 92&hyph;1, Inherently Governmental Functions? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) If the function is not listed in appendix A, do any of the factors in the ``totality of the circumstances'' analysis discussed in section 7(b) of Policy Letter 92&hyph;1 indicate that the function may be inherently governmental? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> B. Cost Effectiveness <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If the response to any of the following questions is affirmative, the agency may not have a valid requirement or not be obtaining the requirement in the most cost effective manner: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is the statement of work so broadly written that it does not support the need for a specific service? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is the statement of work so broadly written that it does not permit adequate evaluation of contractor versus in-house cost and performance? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Is the choice of contract type, quality assurance plan, competition strategy, or other related acquisition strategies and procedures in the acquisition plan inappropriate to ensure good contractor performance to meet the user's needs? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) If a cost reimbursement contract is contemplated, is the acquisition plan inadequate to address the proper type of cost reimbursement to ensure that the contractor will have the incentive to control costs under the contract? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Is the acquisition plan inadequate to address the cost effectiveness of using contractor support (either long-term or short-term) versus in-house performance? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Is the cost estimate, or other supporting cost information, inadequate to enable the contracting office to effectively determine whether costs are reasonable? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Is the statement of work inadequate to describe the requirement in terms of ``what'' is to be performed as opposed to ``how'' the work is to be accomplished? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Is the acquisition plan inadequate to ensure that there is proper consideration given to ``quality'' and ``best value''? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> C.

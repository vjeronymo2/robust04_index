			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing &amp; Advertising): Getting corporate projection in the Cannes - Professionals who beat a path to the film festival but never watch the movies George Eccles managed to get to the showing of the movie 'Braindead', but was soon slumbering. He observed the on-screen cannibalism and decided he could use the sleep instead - 10 days' of marketing his accountancy firm at the Cannes film festival is exhausting work. Not to be at Cannes these days is more of a marketing than a social gaffe. Europe's film industry now has an annual turnover of Dollars 1.4bn; this year, three of the main four prizes went to European movies. None of those are likely to match the commercial success of the latest US box office hit, 'Wayne's World', which took more than Dollars 100m in its first two months. Yet closer EC political and economic ties offer the prospect of greater co-production funding and distribution deals within the community. That in turn creates a need for more efficient marketing. How to achieve that is an open question; one answer for many is to go to the film, music and television festivals held annually at Cannes. Some 20,000 people go to considerable trouble to get to the Cannes festival but many do not see even one film. Instead, they pay inflated prices for accommodation and services to join in a 10-day marketing jamboree which they hope will result in cinema-associated business. The marketing moves at Cannes are mostly down to old-fashioned direct selling, focused almost entirely on rented hotel suites and the esplanade where the US, Canadian, Japanese and European pavilions house producers, tax lawyers, accountants and assorted other fixers, all renting space or sponsoring the pavilions to market their services. Even the economic development department of Gwynedd county council in Wales was there, dishing out brochures announcing: 'Fairytale lands . . . The Great Wall of China . . . The dark depths of Transylvania . . . Gwynedd has the film location you're looking for'. Eccles heads the media group at accountants, Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte. For him, Cannes is 'a trade and marketing event. We are here to serve existing clients and get new ones. It's impossible to know how much new business we attract by being here. But we are now working for a client who has acquired cable rights in Nigeria. He said he came to us because he picked up one of our brochures in Cannes 11 years ago.' Coopers spends more than Pounds 20,000 to mount an exhibition with five staff at Cannes. Eccles says it is 'very difficult for accountants to market ourselves and our activities. We can't do blanket television advertising, so we have to pick our marketing opportunities much more carefully.' This year was the first at Cannes for Howard Bass, a partner at Ernst and Young's New York office; clearly it will not be his last. 'We have at least 20 large clients here this year and it's important for them to see us. 'The cinema industry is a huge business for us, worth perhaps Dollars 100m a year, so the investment of perhaps Dollars 60,000 to bring a small team here and set up an exhibition is definitely worthwhile.' But much more than that, Bass has a choice of spending perhaps Dollars 25,000 on a full-page advertisement in a glossy trade magazine which few might read, or to shake hands in the most direct form of marketing available. He opts for the latter and intends expanding Ernst and Young's exhibition at Cannes 1993. The European pavilion is organised annually by Button Eventures, part of the Reed group. For Steve Jaggs, UK marketing manager for Agfa, the film stock producer which is sponsoring the European pavilion, it is a vital aspect of his marketing strategy. 'Cinema is something of a cottage industry and a people business, so conventional advertising is not so appropriate.' Jaggs says that some 20 per cent of Agfa's costs in the UK are on marketing but he spends 70 per cent of his budget on event sponsorship and support for professional cinema organisations, and only 30 per cent on conventional advertising. He hopes that by being highly visible at Cannes, Agfa will stick in the mind of producers and film companies thinking of purchasing stock. If Cannes provides a marketing forum for business, it is equally attractive as a centre for marketing new productions and forging contacts. Nicholas Steil, general manager of Euro Aim, an EC-funded organisation, regards Cannes as the centre for plugging in to the European film industry. In the end, 'Braindead' - in which 'a zombie mother interferes with the course of true love' - will probably fade alongside hundreds of other movies shown at Cannes. But the movie business itself is set to expand both in Europe and elsewhere. And as European integration speeds up, the leisure industry may find that marketing events become an increasingly important means of making both contacts and profit.</p>

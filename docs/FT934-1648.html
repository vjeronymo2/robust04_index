			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Electra confident as asset value rises 23% Net assets per share at Electra, the UK's largest venture capital investment trust, rose by 23 per cent to 341.3p over the year to September 30, on a fully diluted basis. More than two thirds of Electra's portfolio is held in unquoted companies in the US and UK, which suffered badly during the recession. The trust's net asset value per share has yet to regain the 1989 value of 345.7p. However, Mr Michael Stoddart, chairman, said: 'I believe that Electra Investment Trust is positioned to resume the growth that it enjoyed during the 1980s. I look forward to the future with some optimism.' Mr Hugh Mumford, managing director, said the trust had benefited from a number of factors, including the improvement in smaller company share prices, gains on realisations of holdings and from listings, and from the strength of the dollar. Electra said it would, for the first time, describe in the annual report and accounts the principles it follows for valuing unquoted holdings. Doubts over the valuation of its unquoted holdings, caused Electra shares to trade at a discount to net asset values of more than 30 per cent in early 1993, although this has since narrowed. Based on yesterday's closing price of 302p, up 7p, the shares are trading on a discount of 11.5 per cent. The trust said its objective was 'to produce a valuation of the unlisted portfolio which is both consistent and conservative.' The application of its valuation principles, said Electra, 'normally allows for a resonable margin of increase in value at the time of realisation or listing.' Parker Pen, the trusts's largest unlisted investment, was sold at a substantial premium to last year's valuation. Meanwhile, Sphere Drake became the trust's second largest investment following a listing on the New York Stock Exchange, which more than doubled the previous valuation. Electra's pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.1m (Pounds 16.7m). Earnings per share were 7.544p (7.526p). The proposed final dividend is increased to 3.55p, making a total of 7p (6.7p). The trust's board is about to undergo a number of changes. Mr Clive Clague and Sir Christopher Wates will retire on December 31; in addition Mr Colin Black and Mr Brian Peppiatt will retire at the next annual meeting. Three additional non-executive directors will be appointed.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The residents of Vitez, Travnik, Novi Travnik, and  other towns in central Bosnia watched a kind of air show today.  At 1612, two Super-Galeb aircraft of the former Yugoslav  People's Army appeared in the sky above central Bosnia.  Choosing their targets, they obviously wanted to demonstrate  the planes' capabilities and the pilots' skills. Judging by  appearances, the aircraft were only a bait for NATO planes  because they did not engage in combat activity. So as not to be  hit by ground weapons, one aircraft released protective flares  over Vitez. The exhibition by Serb pilots ended at 1635, when  NATO planes appeared flying at a very high altitude. The Serb  Galebs gained height and flew away toward their home base,  accompanied by whistles of many people who watched the display  and obviously did not understand the aim of such a show of force.</p>

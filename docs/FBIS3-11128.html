The Army is now seeking the "brains" of the  espionage system, the local press reported today.    Unofficial sources at Miraflores Palace remarked that the  microphones had been placed in the main rooms of the building,  including the office of President Rafael Caldera and the room  where the Council of Ministers meets regularly. Although it has  not yet been confirmed, it is believed that, through this  high-technology system, those responsible for telephone  espionage also had access to the main offices of the Ministry of  Defense.    A report published by the daily "EL GLOBO" states the  system's connections reportedly linked the network to the  private offices of former President Carlos Andres Perez and the  main office of Banco Latino, in which the government intervened  last January and where a sophisticated espionage center was  discovered.    Following the bank intervention, congressional investigators  asserted that hundreds of telephones of prominent Venezuelan  political and business personalities were wiretapped from that  office, but the wires leading to hidden microphones were not  discovered.    However, it has not been ruled out that the investigation  will follow this course, especially if it is confirmed the  network discovered at Miraflores leads to terminals located at  the main office of Banco Latino, whose former President Gustavo  Gomez Lopez is accused of planning a coup d'etat.    The location of Gomez Lopez, for whom an arrest warrant was  issued over the bankruptcy of Banco Latino, is not known. It is  only known that he is abroad. However, on several occasions  Gomez Lopez has contacted local media to reject the accusations.    Even so, Venezuelan political leaders view Gomez Lopez as  the  main ideologist of a coup d'etat, planned with former Defense  Minister Radames Munoz. This coup attempt was reportedly aimed  at preventing the electoral victory of Rafael Caldera last 5  December.    Those who made accusations against Gomez Lopez argue the  intentions of the banker and Munoz were definitely foiled after  the military officer disclosed his plans to U.S. Government  officials, who warned they would not go along with an attempt  against the Venezuelan democratic regime.</p>

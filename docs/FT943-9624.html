			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Commercial power of Tory conference Sir, I was amused by the Labour Party's claims in your story 'Companies queue to appear at Labour's show' (August 8) that it has the largest commercial exhibition of any political party in Europe. This is, needless to say, another wholly unreliable socialist statistic. We expect to raise well above three quarters of a million pounds in commercial income at our conference, the organisation of which has been contracted out to CCO Conferences, compared to Labour's claim of Pounds 600,000 for its conference. Our exhibition is, as usual, completely sold out and has a steadily growing waiting list. This is despite the fact that we charge significantly more stand for stand than Labour. Many companies have told us that they would exhibit at the Labour conference solely for reasons of balance - and only if they could secure a space at ours first. British companies continue to recognise that their commercial interest will only be served by the continuation in office of the Conservative party - the only party committed to deregulation and low personal and corporate taxation, and the only party opposed to socialist idiocies such as a minimum wage and the Social Chapter. Tim Collins, director of communications, Conservative Party, chairman, CCO Conferences, 32 Smith Square, London SW1P 3HH</p>

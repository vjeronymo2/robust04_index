			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Declaration of Russian Commodity Producers, adopted by the </F> Congress of Representatives of Members of the Federation of  Public Associations of Russian Commodity Producers: "Plow, But  Without Seeming To"]    [Text] For some reason, this event was left unnoted by most  of the newspapers. Essentially, only PRAVDA and NEZAVISIMAYA  spoke out fully and sincerely about this congress. After all,  the congress, held in Krasnoyarsk, was a meeting of virtually  all the workers in Russia -- directors of the country's  industrial enterprises, who were tired of the fact that some,  pardon the term, condom dealer was living better than the  Worker, the Plowman or the Laborer.    PRAVDA has already written about the sort of congress this  was. About 300 directors of enterprises from 43 regional  organizations and 8 federal unions, headed by Yuriy Skokov,  decided how things were to be and how to go on living.    Today we are publishing the DECLARATION on the rights of  Russian commodity producers, adopted at this congress. With  respect to its style, perhaps, this document looks conventional.  Essentially, though, it is a cry, an SOS shout, a powerful voice  in defense of the workers of our land.    Commodity producers, managers (directors) and entrepreneurs  -- everyone who is employed in the sphere of commodity  production, regardless of the form of ownership, type of  economic activity and political orientation, stated:    The chosen model of radical economic reforms in Russia has  led to a progressing recession in commodity production and the  growth of the crisis. No consideration is made of the fact that  the entire infrastructure of the country's industrial,  technological and scientific-technical potential has formed  under conditions different in principle, and that a transitional  period is needed to adapt to a truly market milieu. The main  goal of the reforms -- raising the people's standard of living  -- has been sacrificed.    The Federation comes out in favor of carrying out reforms,  and sets its goal as achieving the recognition and protection of  the rights of commodity producers on the basis of  self-organization and coordination of their interests in the  process of reforming the economy.    THE FEDERATION OF COMMODITY PRODUCERS, AWARE OF ITS  RESPONSIBILITY TO THE COUNTRY AND SOCIETY, PROCLAIMS:    --its right to conclude a general agreement with the  Government of the Russian Federation that secures a  qualitatively new system of mutual relations in the  implementation of economic reforms, for the purpose of creating  efficient commodity production;    --its right to draw up and sign, in the shortest time  possible, regional agreements with the organs of state authority  of the subjects of the Russian Federation, on working out the  optimal mutually acceptable mechanisms for carrying out economic  reforms in the provinces;    --its right to participate in the drawing up of all  legislative and normative acts pertaining to commodity  production, and to submit them for the consideration of the  Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation and other organs of  state authority, in accordance with existing legislation;    --its right to state guarantee of protection of the vitally  important interests of commodity producers as a necessary  condition for preserving and strengthening Russia. The state's  attempt to evade solving the problems of supporting domestic  commodity production is inadmissible;    --its right to state guarantee of the priorities of domestic  commodity producers in the process of privatization. We are  against hasty redistribution of the national wealth, to the  detriment of the interests of the overwhelming majority of the  population;    --its right to a long-term state protectionist policy in the  interests of domestic commodity producers. We are for Russia's  active entry into the world market in the interests of the  national economy, but we are against turning our Motherland into  a raw-materials appendage of the developed countries;    --its right to participate in the creation of a complete  system of social protection of commodity producers.    The Federation will try to vindicate and protect the rights  of domestic commodity producers within the framework of existing  legislation in interaction and cooperation with the organs of  federal and regional authority and administration and with all  the domestic organizations and movements which express the  interests of business circles and work collectives.</p>

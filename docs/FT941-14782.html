			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Economic aftershock for City of Angels: Worst disruption may be yet to come The City of Angels seems to be bedeviled. Monday's vicious earthquake added to the troubles of a region that has already seen its economy severely hit by defence cuts, violent race riots in 1992 and devastating fires last summer. 'We are a resilient people,' Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan declared in the wake of Monday's quake, which hit 6.6 on the Richter scale and left at least 34 dead, thousands injured and as many as 15,000 displaced from their homes. But as he urged residents to 'keep cool' while more than 200 aftershocks rocked buildings and frayed nerves, the full magnitude of the earthquake's impact was beginning to emerge. Collapsed freeways and bridges, buckled roads, landslides and ruptured gas and water mains have crippled the transport system of a city that relies, possibly more than any other, upon the car. Nearly 3m vehicles use the 616 miles of freeway in Los Angeles during an average evening rush hour. Yesterday, as many residents ventured out of their neighbourhoods for the first time since the earthquake, huge traffic jams quickly built up. However, with many businesses and virtually all schools and public offices closed, commuter traffic was much lighter than normal. Despite desperate efforts by local and state officials, it may be 'at least a year' before portions of main highways can be rebuilt, California Governor Pete Wilson acknowledged. Even this estimate is probably too optimistic. In the San Francisco region of northern California, which suffered a quake of 7.1 on the Richter scale in 1989, portions of city freeways remain closed while repairs continue more than four years after the event. Unlike San Francisco, Los Angeles has little public transport to fall back on. Rail lines were buckled by the quake, halting train services for residents of the hard-hit San Fernando Valley. The city's fledgling subway system covers only 4.4 miles in the downtown area and was yesterday closed for inspection. Commuters who routinely have coped with jammed highways now face the prospect of long-term gridlock. Five inter-state motorways have been seriously damaged. 'You're talking about millions and millions of vehicles and travellers who will be impacted,' said Mr Jim Drago of the California department of transportation. The Santa Monica freeway, a big east-west artery through the city and one of the most heavily travelled motorways in the country, was severely damaged when an overpass collapsed onto the street below. The earthquake also destroyed an arching intersection of two big freeways in the San Fernando Valley, to the north west of the city. The Golden State freeway, the primary north-south route in the state, collapsed onto another highway, crushing several cars. Questions remain about why so many roads, supposedly built to stand severe earthquakes, should have collapsed. So far there are few answers, but the state faces massive costs if it is to strengthen the system further. The quake's destructive force could have a serious long-term impact on the region's already battered economy. In the past year, job losses in southern California roughly equalled those of all the US's other states combined, said Mr Robert Arnold, a senior economist at the centre for the continuing study of the California economy. The freeway disruption can only make matters worse, said Ms Genevieve Giuliano, a transport expert at the University of Southern California. 'It's a huge problem for commercial traffic. The fact that so many places are affected will interrupt commerce in all sorts of ways.' Long distance truckers, who carry freight to and from Los Angeles, said that the damage would add two hours or more to their journeys, raising costs significantly. Although damage from the quake is largely limited to the north-west section of Los Angeles, nobody in the city has escaped its wrath. At Los Angeles International Airport yesterday, airlines struggled to maintain their schedules with many staff members unable to get to work. The tourist trade, normally a pillar of the local economy, is expected to be hit hard. The earthquake could be yet another deterrent to visitors who have seen the city scarred by fires and riots. Water and electricity supplies, although restored in many areas, remain uncertain. All residents have been warned to boil tap water for drinking. With most shops closed, obtaining basic supplies remains difficult. Some inevitably profit from others' losses. Roving crews were charging shops and businesses as much as Dollars 1,000 to board up broken windows. Already, insurance companies have posted claims adjusters in the region. As many as 60 per cent of residents of the affected regions lack any earthquake insurance, according to the Personal Insurance Federation of California. Since the 1989 San Francisco quake, state measures have been enacted to ensure that earthquake insurance is more widely available in California. However, its cost has risen sharply and the extent of coverage available has been limited, deterring many home and business owners. With insurance payouts not expected to cover much of the damage, the prospects for a short-term economic recovery seem bleak. In Oakland, hard hit by the San Francisco quake, many damaged commercial buildings were simply abandoned by their owners. 'Once people realise that buildings aren't coming back and customers start to leave, you get a cycle of decline,' said Mr Ezra Rapport, Oakland deputy city manager. The one big hope for Los Angeles is federal aid. City and state officials have been encouraged by President Bill Clinton's promises to assist the region and are now hoping for a multi-billion infusion of funds from Washington.  -------------------------------------------------    Year                             Richter scale  ------------------------------------------------- 1  1906   San Francisco                  8.3 2  1952   Tehachapi-Bakersfield          7.7 3  1927   Offshore San Luis Obispo       7.7 4  1992   Landers                        7.4 5  1923   North Coast                    7.2 6  1989   San Francisco                  7.1 7  1980   Eureka                         7.0 8  1950   Imperial Valley                6.7 9  1994   Los Angeles                    6.6 10 1971   San Fernando                   6.6 11 1992   Los Angeles                    6.3 12 1987   Los Angeles                    5.9  -------------------------------------------------                THE RICHTER SCALE  ------------------------------------------------- 8    Capable of tremendous damage 7    Widespread damage      Monday's quake: 6.6 6    Severe damage 5    Considerable damage 4    Moderate damage 3.5  Some local damage  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Associated Press and Reuters  -------------------------------------------------</p>

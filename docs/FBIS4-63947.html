			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 25, BNS -- The director of the  Ignalina nuclear power plant, Viktor Shevaldin, categorically  denied reports that an accident as if occurred at the plant.    Rumors about an accident reached Lithuania Wednesday [25  May], first from Belarus and later from Latvia. Shevaldin even  received telephone calls from the Belarussian atomic energy  inspection.    "The rumors are completely groundless. Both reactors are at  a standstill and there were no accidents," Shevaldin told BNS.    Ignalina's first reactor is still undergoing maintenance  repairs which started March 26. The second reactor was shut  down April 12 when excess energy appeared at Latvian  hydroelectric power stations.    Shevaldin said neither of Ignalina's reactors should be  started earlier than June 20 and added that public announcements  will be made in advance.    Povilas Vaisnys, head of the Lithuanian Atomic Energy Safety  Inspection, said the rumors that were set afloat Wednesday are  "misinformation," which may be related to political process in  one of the neighboring countries that he did not specify. The  official said "it's all quiet at the Ignalina nuclear plant."</p>

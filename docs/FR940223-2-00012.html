NMFS is currently analyzing the activities proposed in those applications in accordance with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act; however, this process is not yet complete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notice is hereby given that on February 14, 1994, NMFS issued extensions to the above permits, authorizing the permit holders to continue the activities therein until July 1, 1994, or until the authorization is superseded by a new permit. All other conditions associated with the permit remain in full force and effect. No release of hatchery fish are authorized at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Issuance of these extensions, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that: (1) The taking would be incidental; (2) the applicant would, to the maximum extent practicable, monitor, minimize and mitigate the impacts of such taking; (3) the taking would not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild; and (4) there were adequate assurances that the conservation plan would be funded and implemented, including any measures required by the Assistant Administrator. These permits were also issued in accordance with and are subject to Parts 217&hyph;222 of Title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The applications, permits, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices by appointment:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Protected Resources, National Marine Fisheries Service, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, Maryland 20910 (301&hyph;713&hyph;2322); and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Environmental and Technical Services Division, National Marine Fisheries Service, 911 North East 11th Ave., room 620, Portland, Oregon 97232 (503&hyph;230&hyph;5400). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: February 14, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William W.

			<p>BFN     [Text] STRASBOURG, 14 Apr, BNS -- Abolition of the death  penalty and relations with Russia dominated the questions that  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was asked after his  speech in the CE [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly  Thursday [14 April]. There were also questions about the status  of Poles and sexual minorities in Lithuania, as well as about  the private TELE-3 TV station.    Answering a question on Russian transit to the Kaliningrad  region through Lithuania, Brazauskas said he and Russian  President Boris Yeltsin agreed that the problem would be  discussed after a package of bilateral agreements between their  countries is signed. The Lithuanian president claimed Russia's  demand "to open an unrestricted corridor" through Lithuania is  hardly understandable.    Commenting on Russia's statements about the "near abroad,"  Brazauskas said it would be best if Russia would explain itself  the meaning of the concepts "near abroad" and "zone of  influence." If a zone of influence means cultural and economic  cooperation, Lithuania has interests in Russia, where some  100,000 Lithuanians live since the times of Stalinism, he said.    Discussing the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic  states, Brazauskas said the problem and Russia's admission to  the CE are interrelated. In his view, the problem will be  resolved this year.    Discussing the irreversibility of independence processes,  the  Lithuanian leader said he is an optimist and thinks that times  of interfering with the internal affairs of a another country  have passed.    Brazauskas confirmed that capital punishment still exists in  Lithuania. The Lithuanian leader said three persons have been  executed during his term of office, and two more convicts are on  death row. The president noted that a virtually Soviet-type  criminal code is still effective in Lithuania, but a new one is  ready, according to which the death penalty would be applied  only in special cases, such as cruel murder of several persons.  Brazauskas expressed hope that the Lithuanian parliament will  adopt the new criminal code this year.    Answering Polish representative Janusz Szymanski's question  about the status of the Polish minority in Lithuania, Brazauskas  said the rights of ethnic minorities in Lithuania are protected  by the Constitution and other laws. The president also noted  that the number of Poles in Lithuania is 270,000, but not  400,000 as was indicated by the Polish lawmaker.    There is no international aspect in the status of the Polish  minority in Lithuania, and all minor problems that do occur are  successfully resolved by the governments, Brazauskas said. In  his words, such problems, if they will occur, can be discussed  during his upcoming meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa in  Vilnius 26 April.    Estonia's representative asked about Lithuania's  contribution  to the creation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion and its  functions. Brazauskas said the battalion is primarily meant for  maintaining peace in other "or maybe our regions." The president  said a Baltic peacekeeping battalion should be ready for action  after about a year.    Brazauskas said sexual minorities is not a problem requiring  special attention in Lithuania. The president said he never  dealt with any such problems, except knowing that punishment for  homosexuality has been abolished in Lithuania.    A representative of Iceland asked whether it is true that  the  private TELE-3 TV is being closed down in Lithuania. Brazauskas  answered that two out of three TV channels in Lithuania are  commercial and nobody intends to close them down. "But  transmitter rent has to be paid."    Brazauskas denied allegations that government positions are  too widely represented in the Lithuanian press. "We have so  much freedom that we don't even know how to make use of it," the  president said. He noted, however, that the press "works hard,  reveals much evil and helps the government."</p>

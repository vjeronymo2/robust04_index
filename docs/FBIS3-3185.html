			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Years spent toiling for a powerless committee of a  powerless body of the Chinese government can wear down even the  most intrepid spirit. To the point where, during the annual  exercise in democratic window-dressing known as the meeting of  the National People's Congress (NPC), such a committee worker  might mumble to a foreign journalist he saw taking notes at a  meeting of provincial delegates: "I'd like to talk to you. I  could tell you about all sorts of things you don't understand."    For more than 20 years, a man we shall call Wang has worked  on the staff of one section of the NPC's education, science,  culture and public health committee. Working in a dingy  Soviet-style building only a stone's throw from the real centre  of power--the party's national headquarters at Zhongnanhai--Wang  has pushed paper on everything from religious organisations to  teachers' salaries. Paid a monthly salary of 210 renminbi  (HK$185), Wang is one of those responsible for ensuring that  members of the NPC's Standing Committee, which does most of the  real legislative rubber-stamping, receive background information  on certain categories of laws handed down from the State  Council, to be passed without delay.    Wang harbours no illusions about his country's political  system. "There is a small group of leaders who basically have no  need to listen to the people," he said. "We still have not  overcome the power of emperors."    Meeting with foreign journalists, for Wang, is not easy.  Sequestered in a distant hotel with delegates from three  provinces, he must make up an excuse late one night in order to  be excused from the mass movie outing organised to keep the  docile delegates entertained. But in the safety of a hotel  where no delegations are staying, Wang gives vent to many years  of frustration.    "As long as I've been here, they've been talking about  raising the influence of the NPC. But nothing has happened," he  said. "During this meeting, for example, the delegates should be  amending the work reports in many different ways but, in fact,  they're just here to study documents. All they do is study the  documents."    Asked about the views of the committee chairman, Zhao  Dongwan, a former minister of personnel, Wang seems bemused:  "It doesn't matter. He would never dare to say anything which  goes against unanimity. Nothing ever goes against the critical  need for unanimity with the party. The NPC has never disagreed  with the party. Do you understand?" But despite the congress's  long tradition of obedience, the party often does not even  bother to obtain its concurrence, he said.    Like many closet democrats in China, Wang has written a book  about democracy. Published in 1988, his book went through a  first printing by a semi-private publisher before the company  was shut down in 1989 for publishing books that had not been  approved. "I don't even think about it anymore. Now, I'm more  interested in other topics like the place of religion in China,"  he said. "That's an area which still has some hope."</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY'S LARGEST RETAIL, OFFICE PROJECT GETS OK  </P> <P> The Glendale Redevelopment Agency on Tuesday approved final design plans for a  20-story office and retail development on a key downtown block that has stood  vacant for five years.  </P> <P> The 3-2 vote allows the Homart Development Co. of Chicago to begin construction  in January on the city's largest project, to be built at Brand Boulevard and  Broadway, north of the Glendale Galleria shopping mall.  </P> <P> Downtown merchants have long complained that the site is an eyesore and a  detriment to retail sales in the area. Old-fashioned stores, including the  historic Egyptian Village Cafe, were demolished years ago to make way for a  previously proposed project that never materialized. Most of the block has  since been surrounded by a deteriorating mauve construction wall.  </P> <P> The development on the west side of Brand will feature a large open plaza with  a water fountain, shaded seating areas and sidewalk cafes.  </P> <P> The 20-story building, which will have retail stores and restaurants on the  first two floors below an office tower, will be built at the southern end of  the block. A temporary park will be constructed on the northern end of the  block, where the developer eventually plans to build a second 22-story tower.  </P> <P> A multilevel parking garage with space for 1,537 cars will be built along  Orange Street, with retail stores on the ground level facing the street.  </P> <P> Agency members Larry Zarian and Ginger Bremberg on Tuesday again voted against  the project, charging that the 790,000-square-foot development is 90,000 square  feet larger than the city had deemed suitable for the site and that it would  worsen downtown traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The developer has agreed to install additional traffic lanes, update traffic  signals and provide other measures to speed traffic flow on streets around the  project.  </P> <P> The development is designed to draw shoppers from malls into the downtown  retail zone, which will include a two-block shopping area on the east side of  Brand called The Exchange, where 1920s-era buildings are being renovated or  rebuilt.  </P> <P> Homart had proposed to begin construction in October. However, city officials  delayed the start until after the holiday shopping season at the Glendale  Galleria, where traffic is congested. The first phase of the $41-million  project is to be completed within two years.  </P></p>

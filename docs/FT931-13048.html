			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Observer: Waltzing Matthey Take your partners please for the Johnson Matthey waltz. Suitors, stakeholders and others interested in the future of one of the most famous precious metals groups are taking sides in what promises to be one of the more complicated takeover routines of the season. Merchant bankers Hambros and Barings are already stepping out with Charter Consolidated and Johnson Matthey, and SG Warburg made its debut yesterday at the bottom of a Minorco press release. Given that Peter Wilmott-Sitwell, chairman of SG Warburg Securities, has recently gone on to the Minorco board, Warburg's return to centre stage is no great surprise. Britain's premier merchant bank and South Africa's Anglo American Corp have been getting closer and closer together and Anglo holds the key to JM's future. This latest liaison presumably leaves out in the cold Morgan Grenfell, Minorco's banker during the infamous Consolidated Gold Fields bid, and raises the question of whether Warburg's arrival will result in James Capel, Minorco's broker, being jilted. However, all is not lost, Johannesburg Consolidated Investments may still be looking for a merchant banker to partner its broker, Smith New Court.</p>

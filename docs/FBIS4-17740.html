			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Before Signing Your Autograph"] </F>   [Text] Some crucial documents were adopted at a conference  of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation [CPRF] held  last weekend. They include the theses "The CPRF on the Path to  Accord for Russia's Sake." They say: Formulating a tactical  task, the CPRF proceeds from the premise that it is insufficient  to put forward general program aims, whose full implementation  is only possible when the people of labor come to power -- there  must be a plan for specific actions.    The CPRF believes that preserving civil peace and  strengthening it on the basis of switching to a socialist method  of development are vital conditions for averting a  national-state disaster.    To this end, the CPRF proposes:    -- to form a broad coalition of left-wing, centrist,  patriotic, and popular-democratic forces capable of  neutralizing, and then politically, economically, and morally  isolating, the "party of civil war";    -- to bring the coalition to power as the result of victory  at elections or another peaceful, non-violent method.    The CPRF realizes that achieving civil peace is not a  one-shot act of signing some kind of solemn statement, it is not  a declaration, but a package of steps which are perceptible in a  practical sense and are primarily aimed at eliminating specific  sources of civil confrontation. Today these sources, "risk  factors" of a kind, include the sharp property stratification  against the backdrop of an unrestrainable fall in production and  inflationary processes, and the violation of the workers'  socioeconomic rights.    The Communists are prepared to propose a package of measures  to reestablish legality in the country.    The Communists see a change in the socioeconomic course as  another very important precondition for reestablishing civil  peace. A full program for the economic improvement of the  situation in the country and a way out of the crisis may be  agreed only through the joint efforts of all interested parties.    But a number of measures will brook no delay. These include:    -- putting a stop to the plundering privatization, checking  the legality and economic expediency of all deals which have  already been concluded, and clarifying the origins of the  capital invested in privatization;    -- making legislative provision for the most important  rights  of working collectives to own and use national property and to  choose specific forms of destatization where this is  economically justified, and banning interference in the economic  life of enterprises in collective-group forms of ownership,  particularly in the agro-industrial complex;    -- recompensing the losses borne by citizens and economic  organizations as a result of the "shock therapy," and finding  ways of settling the nonpayments crisis, eliminating debts in  wages, and indexing savings deposits, and indeed not by means of  an extra emission but by freezing illegally accumulated capitals.</p>

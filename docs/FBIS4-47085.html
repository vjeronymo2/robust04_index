			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Ajarian First Deputy Industry Minister Tamaz </F> Bolkvadze by Givi Tevzadze under the rubric "The Economy:  Problems and Prospects": "If We Put Our Heart in It"; place and  date not given]    [Text] For decades, not only guests from foreign  lands but even Georgians who have come here to vacation by the  sea have considered Batumi and Ajaria as a whole strictly a  resort oasis, with only a tourist's eye for the dawn-to-dusk  blazing sunshine and the soothing waves, viewing this blessed  nook of Georgia as just a place of sea, citrus, and  relaxation.    Thus, except for a narrow circle of persons concerned  with their official duties, few people have thought about the  fact that Ajaria is a major artery of Georgia's industry, whose  vigorous pulse has a great deal to do with the republic's  economic potential.    Now that Georgia's economic sectors, including  industry, are having a hard time of it, it may be of interest to  take a look at the problems of the autonomous republic's  enterprises; for this purpose we interviewed Ajarian First  Deputy Industry Minister Tamaz Bolkvadze.    [Tevzadze] Batono Tamaz, in these times of warped political  and economic conditions, when the country faces difficult  problems, Ajaria is most often cited as an example of stability,  calm, and relatively better economic conditions. In this  context, how are things now in the autonomous republic's  industrial sphere, despite the fact that many of Georgia's major  enterprises are now at a standstill?    [Bolkvadze] Despite the difficult political and economic  situation, a number of Ajaria's industrial sectors have done a  certain amount of work and taken very useful--even bold--steps  in order to meet the forecast targets on time.    But in order to show that these are not just empty words, I  will cite some figures. In 1993 we produced 100.5 billion  coupons worth of commercial output (in comparable prices) and  manufactured 7.2 billion coupons worth of various kinds of  goods. The construction and repair administration completed 81.3  million coupons worth of project work. Also last year, 13.7  billion coupons worth of goods were shipped to consumers. That  figure includes 5.5 billion coupons worth of goods shipped  outside the republic. A total of 462.3 million coupons worth of  various kinds of items were shipped on the basis of  inter-governmental agreements.    [Tevzadze] You probably have a number of problems as well.  What obstacles do you encounter?    [Bolkvadze] The basic reasons for declining production  volumes are difficulties in supplies of materials, raw  materials, and energy. I guess it would be useful to cite some  facts. Last year our enterprises only obtained 630 tonnes of  rolled metal stock from various sources, versus our requirements  of 10,000 tonnes. Again, we obtained 51 tonnes of nonferrous  metal instead of 950 tonnes. We also got much less than we  needed of particle and fiber board, fabrics, and so on. As a  result, our enterprises were not even able to work at half  capacity throughout the year. Not only that, but some of them  stood altogether idle for a long time.    In addition, problems in transportation brought it about  that  large amounts of finished goods piled up in enterprise  warehouses. By January 1994, 166.9 billion coupons worth of  finished goods had been charged to production establishments,  including major enterprises such as the electromechanical,  shipbuilding, machine building, and transformer plants.    Despite our difficulties, most of our enterprises managed to  earn the profits called for in the forecast, but some of them  are in an unsatisfactory financial position.    [Tevzadze] What is the Ministry doing to rectify the  situation, and what help are you getting from the autonomous  republic's leaders?    [Bolkvadze] Almost all the credit for the fact that Ajaria  is  in a comparatively better position than Georgia's other regions  today goes to the republic's leadership, in particular Ajarian  Supreme Council Chairman Batoni Aslan Abashidze.    As for our Ministry, it is working intensively to attract  investments. Here again, Abashidze's prestige and efforts have  helped us greatly. It was at his initiative and personal  invitation that Ajaria was visited by British experts who helped  us prepare investment projects. The projects were translated  into Russian and English and distributed to client enterprises  in accordance with sectors and enterprise potentials. Plans call  for rebuilding and re-outfitting those enterprises, completing  projects that have been started, forming joint enterprises, and  so on.    Right now, negotiations are underway between the Batumi  Electromechanical Plant and Bulgaria's Balkankar regarding the  joint development of electric hoisting machines. A joint  Russian-Georgian-Turkish enterprise, Kimikos [Chemist], has been  formed. There is also a deal between the Batumi Sewn Goods  Association and a British firm, by which the firm brings  supplies and raw materials to Batumi and the factory makes the  goods; as a result, we have already earned hard currency.    This year we plan to produce about 200 billion coupons worth  of goods for which we will have to import about a billion  Russian rubles worth of raw materials from Russia. For this  reason, the Ajarian Autonomous Republic's Industry Ministry has  prepared a list, which has been sent to the Republic of  Georgia's Ministries of Industry and Material Resources for  Trade.    [Tevzadze] You have mentioned Russia and the Russian ruble.  Is your Ministry concerned with restoring business relations  with the CIS countries?    [Bolkvadze] Of course. And the republic's leaders are  helping  us in this as well. I have mentioned the restoration of  relations with Russia. In January, in addition, along with the  Georgian Industry Ministry an agreement was concluded with  Ukraine's Machine Building and Military Industrial Complex and  Conversion ministries, Belarus's State Committee for Industry  and Intersectorial Enterprises, and Tajikistan's Industry  Ministry.    The new contacts should help us obtain sufficient supplies  and raw materials--in particular, 8,542 tonnes of rolled ferrous  metal, 847 tonnes of nonferrous metal, 1,200 tonnes of metal  products, 1,000 tonnes of plastics and so on. Enterprises have  started working to inaugurate new products in 1994. In  particular, the Transformer Plant is working to inaugurate the  production of new types of electroconvectors and electric  heaters. The Electromechanical Plant is developing test models  of a new type of enclosed 5- and 15-passenger electric vehicles.  The Batumi Consumer Goods Machine Building Plant is doing  preparatory work to inaugurate the production of low-power  washing machines, series production of which is planned for the  end of this year. The Batumi Shipbuilding Plant has begun to  prepare the technical documentation for a new model of launch.    A certain amount of work is being done to use available  material resources to renovate products. The Shipbuilding Plant  has basically completed the development of an oceanarium. The  Machine Building Plant is manufacturing uniform buttons,  insignia, and chest decorations for the national army and  Georgian police officers. The Consumer Goods Machine Building  Plant has inaugurated the manufacture of plastic boxes. In the  Furniture Production Association we have inaugurated the  production of new kinds of dining room and kitchen furnishings.  The Woodworking Plant has inaugurated the use of a local raw  material--bamboo--to make tables, chairs, booths, and  modern-style children's beds. The Leather Goods Plant has  reactivated a shop which uses remnant materials to make leather  lining goods, also a section which uses remnants to make belts,  handbags, and watchbands.    In short, we are not sitting idle, and we have high hopes  for  the future.</p>

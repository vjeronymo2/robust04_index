			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Leading Article: ITV tangle FROM ONE point of view, yesterday's report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on Channel 3 networking arrangements is an elegant solution to an intractable dispute over the operation of Britain's reorganised independent television system. From a longer-term perspective, however, the exercise smells unmistakeably of fudge. The MMC's achievement has been to find a formula for bringing the contractual arrangements between the newly franchised ITV companies and independent producers into line with competition law, while managing also to leave both sides claiming victory. Yet it has done so only by devising an elaborate and provisional compromise. The MMC itself is unsure how well it will work, arguing that it would be unwise to impose rigid prescriptions on an untried broadcasting regime. Indeed, the MMC explicitly recognises that the Office of Fair Trading, which will monitor the arrangements, may be required to intervene again in the future. In the circumstances, the MMC has probably done about as much as it reasonably could. Its remit extends simply to the specific competition issues raised by a somewhat technical dispute over the contractual arrangements between independent programme makers and broadcasters. However, that dispute is a reflection of strains caused by deep contradictions and uncertainties in government policy towards broadcasting. In drawing up the ITV franchising regime, the Thatcher administration set two main objectives. One was to create a vigorous independent production sector. It now appears that insufficient thought was given to creating market conditions in which independent programme makers could gain network access while earning returns adequate to attract outside capital. That shortcoming stems in part from confusion about the second objective - making the ITV system more commercial by exposing it to market forces. The new franchise system has undoubtedly put pressure on the ITV companies to cut costs. However, the policy stopped well short of driving competition to its logical conclusion. The ITV companies are supposed to behave like commercial animals. Yet they inhabit an environment which retains many of the paternalistic features of the old system. They are subject to necessarily subjective quality standards. Their ownership structure is hemmed in by restrictions on cross-ownership and merger, which also inhibit the development of a UK television industry able to compete internationally. In the longer term, competition from satellite and cable broadcasters - which are subject to none of these conditions - is likely to subject the system to overwhelming pressures for change. In the meantime, its internal contradictions threaten to produce further strains and conflicts, to which the intervention of competition authorities can offer, at best, only a partial solution.</p>

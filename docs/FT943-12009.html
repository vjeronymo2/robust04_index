			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Northern Telecom shows improvement Northern Telecom's share price jumped yesterday after the Canadian telecommunications equipment maker's second-quarter earnings raised hopes that its problems of the past few years might be receding. Net earnings were USDollars 37m, or 15 cents a share, compared with a Dollars 1.03bn loss, equal to Dollars 4.13 a share, a year earlier. Last year's results included one-time restructuring and other charges of Dollars 940m. Revenues rose by 14 per cent to Dollars 2.12bn. Northern's shares gained 88 cents to Dollars 31.38 on the New York stock exchange in early trading yesterday. Mr Lap Lee, an analyst at Gordon Capital in New York, described Northern as staging a turnround. 'Slowly but surely, they're coming back,' he said. The Toronto-based company has been bedevilled in recent years by a variety of setbacks, including fierce competition, delays in new product development and management upheavals. Mr Jean Monty, chief executive, expressed satisfaction with the results in 'this year of transition'. He said Northern's financial condition had been improved by cost-cutting and the sale of several businesses. The trend towards improved year-on-year earnings will continue in the second half, Mr Monty predicted. The recent improvement is due largely to stronger demand for central office switches, especially in the US, partially offset by a sharp fall in orders from Canadian phone companies. Revenues also picked up in the Far East and Latin America, while multimedia communications systems enjoyed a double-digit sales increase. Northern has put a high proportion of recent investments into international marketing and new products. The latter include a portfolio of wireless phone equipment, in which Northern had lagged behind its rivals.</p>

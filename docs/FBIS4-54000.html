			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Too Many Regulations Block the Way Toward </F> Realization of High Information System"]    [Text] The mood toward building a base for the  next-generation information and communications infrastructure is  growing. The Telecommunications Council, an advisory panel to  the posts and telecommunications minister, has also recently  come up with a report recommending construction -- in three  stages -- of a optic fibre network, which by 2010, will become  the mainframe of the information and communications  infrastructure.    Completion of an information and communications  infrastructure will bring forth tremendous economic and social  effects.    First, it will become an incubator for the next general  industry. There is no telling what kind of new industries will  emerge when the existing industries of telephone, broadcasting,  cable television (CATV), computer, movie, video, electric power,  and city gas infuse with information and communications  technologies. On the multimedia-related market alone, the  council predicts the size of it to grow to 123 trillion yen,  providing 2.43 million new jobs by 2010. Naturally, the industry  will also become a base for technological reform.    Second, the information and communications infrastructure  can  be used in medical, educational, and administrative services to  improve living conditions and peoples' welfare. It can be  expected to play the role of a social infrastructure that will  support industrial development and improve living standards.  <H5>  Regulatory "Infrastructure" </H5>   Despite this bright picture of the future, we become shocked  when we see the walls of regulations blocking its arrival. The  condition is so bad that networks of the regulations have become  an infrastructure of their own. As long as they stand  unabolished, there will be no way for the information and  communications infrastructure to be built up. Nor will there be  a multimedia market or new information society because they can  only develop when there is an infrastructure.    Let us cite some specific examples.    First, if a company wants to start a telecommunications  business by laying a communications system, or wants to withdraw  from its business, it has to have a permit from the posts and  telecommunications minister. But what if one might like to be  entrepreneurial and start a new service at his own risk. The  one who makes decisions on whether or not there is a demand for  such a service is the government. The government nips the new  businesses in the bud.    It is indeed difficult to believe that bureaucrats have  capabilities to predict what demand there will be for which  service areas. The success of a service business depends on  ideas. The process of supervisory government offices reviewing  business plans, taking as much as they like in doing so, results  in compromising creative ideas, and only discourages the  entrepreneur's desire to create new businesses.    The authorities' rationale is that this area of business  belongs to one which commands high public interests, and thus,  if companies are allowed to come and go as they please, it will  not serve the people's interests. We are not saying we cannot  understand that rationale, but we must note that this kind of  justification has been too easily used to hide the fact that it  has restrained competition.    Suppose a permit was issued to a company for startup and the  company was ready to go into business. There are other binding  and fettering regulations waiting for it.    "What are all these charts with drawings like spider webs?"  When engineers from a U.S. CATV company arrive at a Japanese  company to provide technological assistance, they all ask this  question in amazement upon being shown project prospectus papers  that cover the whole process leading up to the beginning of  construction of a CATV network.    In the United States, when a local government decides to  approve installation of CATV networks in a certain area,  businesses can start construction of networks right away without  any government office's approval. In Tokyo, on the other hand,  CATV companies that want to open interactive V service stations  by the end of this year need to wait for half year to file an  approval on its construction plan, and then wait about a year to  receive an approval. Only then can it start the actual  construction work.    That company needs to explain specific details of its  business plan to the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.  It must then go through a process of obtaining a myriad of  permits and approvals before actually being able to lay its  circuits. It has to obtain approvals for all construction  details -- use of roads and utility poles, crossing of railways,  and construction of networks beneath roads. Drawings must be  prepared on all individual work sites as well.    Take roads for example. Because some roads belong to the  central government, some to prefectural governments, and some to  city governments, the company has to contact concerned offices  and police stations of the central and appropriate local  governments regarding the use of them. Even when the company  comes up with a most efficient CATV circuit layout plan through  the use of computers, the plan will become useless if even one  government office says it cannot approve the crossing of roads  at certain points. The company has to find different routes to  make the necessary crossings and come up with a new layout plan.  The company will have to receive approvals on tens and hundreds  of utility poles -- at the huge cost of people's time and energy  and the work of copy machines. It is only natural that  companies insist approvals should be at least be given on the  basis of certain blocks.    Public utility utilization charges imposed on the use of  roads and utility poles are bound to be higher than those  imposed on uses of such facilities as electric power, city gas,  piped water, and sewage systems, and are heavy burdens on the  CATV image-transmitting service whose facilities have a  relatively short life to begin with. Let us suppose a new  communications or CATV business has somehow managed to install  hardware. What is awaiting it now are more regulations, this  time, dealing with the substance of the services it wants to  provide.  <H5>  "Halt" to Service </H5>   A typical case is medical service. Remotely conducted  diagnosis by using an information network is technically  possible, and much expectations are given to it at present. But  according to the Law on Medical Practice, diagnosis made based  on remotely provided information is not recognized as an act of  diagnosis. As such, physicians cannot add diagnosis charges to  their services; therefore, remotely conducted medical service  will not make headway in this country. Even when diagnostic  records are computerized on floppy disks for instance, under  law, the medical cards need to be maintained anyway.    Reservation of [train, bus, and airline] seats and the  issuance of tickets can be considered as readily workable cases  wherein benefits of the information network can be conveniently  used to make people's lives easier. But even when people have  computer terminals at home, they cannot have access to travel  companies' systems. That makes it impossible for these people  to make reservations or do anything at all. Even convenience  stores, as they are not registered as travel agents, cannot  provide reservations services. Furthermore, as far as the  matter of issuing tickets is concerned, only offices with proper  registration and with people in charge of ticketing are allowed  to engage in such business services. Suppose reservations are  made by phone or other means. The only way for the would-be  travelers to get the tickets is for them to go to the  ticket-issuing offices or to have them mailed. There is no way  to get the tickets issued by a system like automatic vending  machines.    The government is set to complete the outline of external  economic measures and intends to make deregulation a major part  of it. Meanwhile, Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations] and other private-sector organizations are  calling for actions on this situation, citing existing  regulations in the information area. If government offices are  only concerned about which offices should take control of what  interests, doing nothing about the substance of deregulation,  not only will relations with the United States be jeopardized,  but also the future of Japan itself. With eyes set on the  future new information society, the regulations which no longer  fit reality or which are too vague to define should be revised  and changed at their foundations.</p>

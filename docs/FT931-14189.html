			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Poorest forced to play their part THE Uruguay Round of global trade talks has marked a sea-change in the role of developing countries in the world economy. Previous rounds have been confined mainly to the leading traders, with other Gatt members on the sidelines. This time, 65-70 nations are taking part in the talks, most of them from the third world. The change reflects a fundamental shift in attitudes within developing countries over the past decade or so. This stems from two main factors: near-universal adoption of growth strategies based on trade expansion and economic liberalisation, and disappointment with the results of special trade preferences, which have proved a poor substitute for more open markets for their goods. Since the round was launched in 1986, 13 developing countries have joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including several least developed countries (ldcs) as defined by the United Nations. Mali, which became a member last week, exported just Dollars 230m (Pounds 151m) worth of goods in 1991. Of Gatt's 105 members, three-quarters are developing countries. However, among the 112 nations entitled to take part in the Uruguay Round about 40 rarely show up. Some very poor or very small countries do not have permanent staff in Geneva. Others have only one or two officials who may have to cover all the UN organisations in the city as well as Gatt. Small exporters may also find it hard to get a hearing from the big economic powers. In past rounds, this did not matter much. It was possible to be a 'free rider' on tariff cuts negotiated between others, which are automatically generalised through Gatt's 'most-favoured-nation' rule. Poor countries were not asked to make concessions in return for benefits, in accordance with the Gatt principle of giving them 'special and differential treatment'. But recently non-participants have become uneasily aware that this time they may be in for more than they bargained for. Uruguay Round negotiators have not left much room for charity. Though developing countries are not required to make concessions 'inconsistent with their level of development', most have opted to swap concessions for bigger trade gains. Overall, 'special and differential treatment' has been reduced to little more than a longer grace period before developing countries have to apply the same rules as everybody else. Least developed countries have been given longer transitions and are exempted from commitments to reduce farm subsidies. It looks as if 'free-riding', too, may not be possible. The draft Uruguay Round agreement to create a Multilateral Trade Organisation, with far wider powers and scope than Gatt, requires all intending MTO members to produce tariff schedules and formal offers, however exiguous, to open their services markets. If they are to reap the round's benefits, the smallest and poorest nations will have to contribute their tuppence-worth.</p>

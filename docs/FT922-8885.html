			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / International Company News: An improving performance that lifted everyone's tails - The much happier frame of mind at Glasgow-based Murray Johnstone FIFTEEN months ago Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow-based fund management company, presented an unhappy spectacle. It had been forced to admit failure in its attempt to find a partner who would buy part or all of the company and help it move into a bigger league among fund managers. Even allowing for the uncertainty then prevailing because of the Gulf war, the company was not presenting either a confident or coherent picture of where it intended to go next. Mr Nick McAndrew, the managing director, was then fidgety and gloomy as he expounded the situation. Now Mr McAndrew, a 57-year-old former managing director of NM Rothschild, is cheerful and positive as he ticks off a list of recent successes for Murray Johnstone. For example, whereas in February 1991 he was lamenting that the Dollars 230m (Pounds 130m) under management by Murray Johnstone International, its US-based subsidiary, was too little to be profitable, today MJI is announcing a jump of Dollars 150m in its funds under management taking them to Dollars 550m. Looking back, he says: 'The six months we spent looking for a partner in the second half of 1990 helped us decide what we wanted to do and we then set out to do it.' That meant tightening up the management of the different sectors of the business and giving them a clearer focus. A number of senior executives left and coupled with the arrival of a new computer system Murray Johnstone's payroll fell from 300 to about 250. The core of Murray Johnstone is its pension fund management business which, including MJI, accounts for half the Pounds 3.4bn it has under management. Then there are its investment trusts, accounting for Pounds 900m. The four main ones, led by Murray International Trust, between them own 70 per cent of the fund management company. There are also exempt funds and unit trusts, as well as a venture capital operation, and a personal asset management business. It was partly the weakness of the pension fund management business which led to the loss of self-confidence which inspired Murray Johnstone to put itself on the market in mid-1990 - an initiative that was disastrously timed because it was almost immediately followed by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Poor pension fund performance since 1987 had caused the departure of a series of pension fund clients. In the summer of 1990 Mr McAndrew brought in Mr Giles Weaver as investment director from London, where he had successfully run Prudential's pension business. He began reorganising the UK pension fund business, both by improving communications with pension fund consultants and trustees, and by re-positioning the different funds in the market. 'The advantage of Giles Weaver was that being new to Murray Johnstone he didn't have friends there. So he could make unpleasant decisions very quickly,' says someone at a rival fund management house. Yet between 1990 and 1991 the value of pension funds under management fell by four per cent and the number of clients dropped from 43 to 34. Although the performance of the funds has improved substantially over that period Murray Johnstone's pension business is suffering from two problems. First, there is almost always a time-lag in the pension management business between a fund manager's performance improving and new clients being recruited. This is because the consultants who advise pension fund trustees look at the five-year record rather than the short term performance and for Murray Johnstone this record is still cloudy. Secondly, a number of clients were lost because some funds under management were reorganised or reassessed following the takeover or merger of the companies they served. Unfortunately for Mr Weaver this process could not be disguised because new clients were not being taken on. 'We're marking time,' says Mr Weaver. 'Because of the way the business works it could be a year before we start winning new business on a large scale.' In other parts of Murray Johnstone, success is more obvious. In investment trusts the company last year successfully launched a new trust, Murray Split Capital, and recently won a beauty parade to manage the European Project Investment Trust. The four main investment trusts recently won a collection of awards from Micropal, the performance analysis concern, for investment performance over the past ten years. Murray Johnstone's relatively small unit trust sector, which Mr Richard Elliott Lockhart was recruited last autumn from Mercury Asset Management to reorganise, pulled off a coup in February by being the first unit trust manager to cut initial charges from five to one per cent. Since then more than 6,000 inquiries have come in and many have been converted into sales. The venture capital sector is now closing its leveraged buy-out fund having used up almost all the Dollars 100m raised - it made Pounds 17.7m with the flotation of Burn Stewart, a whisky company in which itn invested Pounds 1.5m in 1988 - and is now launching a new fund, the MJ Private Acquisition Partnership, hoping to raise Pounds 100m. Mr Geoff Burns who is in charge believes there will be several new opportunities for management buy-outs and buy-ins in the next few years and notes that several venture capital players have left the market. Mr Weaver has a simple explanation for the buoyant mood which is evident among senior executives at Murray Johnstone. 'It's all down to performance. When your investments are doing well it just lifts everyone's tails.' The company decided the Conservatives would win the general election and invested heavily in the UK market accordingly. 'We had sleepless nights for a bit but it all came out right in the end.'</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / Waiting in the wings: The Hanson succession When Lord Hanson, chairman of the acquisitive conglomerate that bears his name, rises to address fund managers in London today, they will be keeping a close eye on his shirt cuffs to see what he has hidden up his sleeve. Something is hiding there. At Hanson's annual meeting last month, the 70-year-old chairman told shareholders that successors had been identified to take over from him and the 69-year-old co-founder of the group, Lord White. But he declined to name them. Their identity is unlikely to be revealed at today's first full presentation to British institutional shareholders since 1988. Yet the question will increasingly be asked: who are the mystery men? The lords have tried to defuse the issue since they announced last year that they would stay on until 1997. The briefing today is the latest step. Lord Hanson will parade a clutch of his top managers, including Mr Irl Englehardt, president of Peabody mining, Mr Donald Borst, chairman of SCM Chemicals from the US, Mr Ronald Fulford, chairman of Imperial Tobacco, and Mr David Snowdon, managing director of the London Brick Company. But they will not be presented as potential successors. The point is to show that there is strength in depth. As one adviser to Hanson put it: 'James (Hanson) has been stung by criticism surrounding his management style. He is anxious to show the world today that there is a lot of talent in his company that will continue with or without him. So there is no need to name a successor.' It is unlikely to allay the concerns of some institutional shareholders, who are growing restive. They are particularly concerned about the role of Lord White, following the controversy over the use of company funds to make failed investments in bloodstock. Lord Hanson's loyalty to his partner is unconditional. The two have complementary skills: Hanson is the operator and administrator, White the deal maker. Having risen together, they will probably step down together. So the task is not just to find a couple of able executives but a partnership which provides that combination. They could reach deep into the organisation to bring up a young entrepreneurial executive with the energy and flair they exhibited when they started out in business together in 1963. The problem is that because the two lords play such a central role in the company, people with entrepreneurial ambitions have tended to leave. Former Hanson executives are flowering in British industry, most notably Mr Greg Hutchings at the conglomerate Tomkins. One option would be to bring back someone like Mr Hutchings, possibly through a takeover. The drawback might be Lord Hanson's sense of loyalty to those around him, which might prevent him installing an outsider. It is unlikely that Lord Hanson would appoint a pair of senior divisional operating executives to the top posts. While such managers are highly skilled at running individual parts of the business, they have no record of identifying and masterminding the type of big acquisitions that fuelled Hanson's growth in the 1980s. The appointment of operating chiefs would signal to shareholders that Hanson was shifting strategy. The main candidates are thus likely to be a group of long-serving Hanson senior executives who are responsible for broader aspects of the overall business. Mr Derek Bonham, the 48-year-old finance director is a prime contender, the architect of Hanson's sophisticated tax and financial systems which have played a vital role in maintaining the group's financial performance despite recent poor trading results. A former colleague says of him: 'He is very bright, has a grasp of the whole business, a formidable character.' Mr Tony Alexander, Hanson's 53-year-old chief operating officer in the UK, is described by one Hanson financial adviser as 'clinically ruthless and extremely able'. Mr Alexander is the man who often goes into acquired companies to start rationalisation. A conglomerates analyst says: 'There is something of the grim reaper about him.' His counterpart in the US, Mr David Clark - described by Lord White as a brilliant manager - is also a candidate. Yet Hanson still has the feel of an old-fashioned family business and there are two family options. Mr Christopher Collins, director of corporate development, is a former jockey married to Lord Hanson's niece. He is a chartered accountant, reputed to be personally wealthy after selling his family's Goya perfume business. He played a central role in deciding that Hanson should buy its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI. The other is Lord Hanson's 30-year-old son Mr Robert Hanson, who trained as a merchant banker. The row over Hanson's personalised management style in the past year must make it less likely that the top seat will be handed down to the family heir. However, a former Hanson executive warns against expecting the lords to do anything obvious. 'They will be thinking how best to serve the shareholders,' he says. 'That could involve something really dramatic, like selling most of the businesses and giving the money back to shareholders.'</p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Building order books weaken ORDERS for construction work in the second quarter of this year were 11 per cent lower than in the first quarter, but 11 per cent higher than in the second quarter of 1992, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. The department's figures follow the Federation of Civil Engineering Contractors' quarterly survey of workload trends, which found a further slight decline in work and jobs since April, and a renewed weakening of order books. At current prices, the total value of new orders in June was Pounds 1.65bn. New orders in the private housing sector in the second quarter were unchanged from the first and 9 per cent higher than in the corresponding period last year. Public housing and housing association orders in the second quarter were 25 per cent higher than in the previous quarter and 77 per cent higher than in the same quarter a year earlier. Infrastructure orders in the latest quarter were 31 per cent lower than in the previous three months but 1 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year earlier. Public non-housing orders (excluding infrastructure) in the latest quarter were 40 per cent lower compared with the previous three months and three per cent lower than in the corresponding quarter a year ago.</p>

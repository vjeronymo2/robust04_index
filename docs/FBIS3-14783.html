			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Anca Florea and Mircea Dascaliuc report from Chisinau] </F>   [Text] On 27 August 1991, the Republic of Moldova  proclaimed its independence, thus making a first step outside  the Soviet Union and outside the system to which it belonged  more than 50 years.    On 27 February 1994, the first multiparty elections were  organized, free elections whose final results will undoubtedly  exert a tremendous influence on the future of the Republic of  Moldova.    Since last night at 2000 [1800 GMT], when the polling  stations closed, the Central Electoral Commission has constantly  been receiving information from the 1,966 electoral commissions  set up throughout the country.    A total of 1,751,278 voters participated in the current  elections, representing 73.29 percent of the total electorate.  In the east rayons, of the 400,000 citizens entitled to vote,  6,829 citizens of both Dniester and Moldovan citizenship cast  their vote.    The Gagauz people participated massively in the elections,  so  that in the south rayons, where most of them live, the  participation rate was 74-98 percent. The lowest participation  rate was recorded in the four electoral districts in Chisinau  and the city of Balti -- somewhat higher than 50 percent.    The latest data provided by the Central Electoral Commission  reflect a partial situation based on information gathered up to  0400 [0200 GMT] from the city of Chisinau and the south of the  Republic of Moldova. According to this information, the options  expressed by vote stand as follows:    For the Agrarian Democratic Party -- 49.65 percent;    For the Bloc of the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity  Movement -- 23 percent;    For the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals 7 percent; and    For the Christian Democratic Popular Front Alliance 7  percent.    These partial results, as Chisinau radio commented, could be  completed with a general assessment on the situation in the  south rayons, where the majority of votes will go to the Bloc of  the Socialist Party and Edinstvo Unity Movement.    A summarized review at 0400 [0200 GMT) revealed that the  electorate is oriented toward just four political formations,  namely the Agrarian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party and  Edinstvo Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Popular Front  Alliance, and the Bloc of Peasants and Intellectuals.    We have to specify that the figures presented here will  undergo changes, which will be made known to you.    And now my colleague will brief you on the final episode of  the incident in Tiraspol yesterday.    The Romanian citizen Ilie Vaduva is outside any danger. Last  night he was escorted to Chisinau by two diplomats of the  Romanian Embassy. Our country's ambassador, Mr. Marian Enache,  told us that he had enjoyed the support of the authorities of  the Republic of Moldova in solving this case, together with  whom, he hopes, that he will be able to clarify the problem of  the automobile of the Romanian Senate that was confiscated in  Tiraspol.    Ilie Vaduva expressed his gratitude to the Romanian Embassy  in Chisinau, which, through the efforts it made, put an end to  this unpleasant incident.</p>

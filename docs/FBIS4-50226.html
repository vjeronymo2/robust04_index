			<p>BFN     [Text] Tianjin, May 15 (XINHUA) -- With the recent  establishment of an international commodities exhibition and  marketing center, this port city has taken another step towards  establishing an international free trade zone.    Officials in charge of the free trade zone, or bonded zone,  here said that the zone has been expanding rapidly since it was  established three years ago. It is also one of the largest  among China's 14 bonded zones.    So far, the free trade zone has approved a total of 2,338  enterprises involving some 1.76 billion U.S. dollars in  investment volume. Investors include those from 54 countries  and regions as well as from inland provinces in northwest China.    Some 1,000 companies in the zone have started operation.  Total import and export volume in the first quarter of the year  topped 400 million U.S. dollars.    Within six months after the approval of the establishment of  the zone, about 180 km from Beijing, infrastructural facilities  were completed. Later, a series of laws and regulations for the  zone were issued to safeguard the interests of overseas  investors.    Following that, ventures from both abroad and within China  began to pour into the zone, and within one year, all 1.2 sq  [square] km of land had been parceled out to investors. Then  another 3.6 sq km of land was added to the previous zone.    A series of preferential policies including tax reduction  and  exemption were adopted in the zone. More than a dozen famous  international companies, such as Honeywell Inc. and the American  President Shipping Company of the United States, the New World  Group Company of Hong Kong and the Singapore Shipping  Corporation, have set up operations there.    The Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone,  neighboring the free trade zone, has also harbored more than  1,000 industrial enterprises, making it the largest development  zone in China in terms of the amount of investment.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL RUNS WIN STREAK TO 22 MATCHES  </P> <P> Royal High boys' volleyball Coach Bob Ferguson thought 1990 was going to be a  rebuilding year.  </P> <P> Maybe he meant the Highlanders were going to add on another Southern Section  championship.  </P> <P> Royal, the defending Southern Section 2-A Division champion, won its 22nd  consecutive match Tuesday and fifth this season, upending visiting Crespi in  three games, 15-3, 15-12, 15-3.  </P> <P> The Highlanders, 38-4 since the inception of their volleyball program three  years ago, have won all 24 of their home matches.  </P> <P> "Our streak is still alive," Ferguson said afterward. "We're actually probably  better now than we were last year at this time. Everything we tried today  worked."  </P> <P> Crespi will vouch for that. The Celts (4-1) trailed by just 4-3 in the first  game when Royal broke away, capitalizing on Crespi mistakes to score the final  11 points.  </P> <P> The Celts collected themselves in the next game and led, 12-8, behind Mike  Palumbo's five kills. But Royal scored seven points in a row to win the game.  </P> <P> In the third game Royal, behind Jeff Colton's five kills, jumped to a 9-1 lead  and coasted to the win.  </P> <P> "The big factor was they played better defense than we did, and their kids  wanted it more than our kids did," Crespi Coach Kevin Slattum said.  </P> <P> "We just came out fired up and took them out of their game from the start with  some tough serving and good defense," said Royal's Adam White, who had eight  kills.  </P> <P> Colton led Royal with 12 kills. Miguel Ramirez and Kevin Hambly each added 11  kills and Travis Ferguson had 30 assists.  </P> <P> Palumbo led Crespi with 10 kills.  </P></p>

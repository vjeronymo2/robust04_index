The  joint funding approach has been undertaken to facilitate the  prioritization of allocating important national S&amp;T  resources,  promote closer ties between basic and applied research, enhance  national economic construction, and to accelerate development  and conversion of basic research results. The NSFC and 20 other  related departments including the Ministry of Construction and  the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources, provinces,  municipalities and industries have cooperated in funding 262  projects, with 9.777 million yuan coming from NSFC and 7.445  million yuan from the other participants. This cooperation  effort has resulted in a marked improvement in S&amp;T research,  an  increase in the number of qualified S&amp;T personnel, and the  promotion of high-tech industry growth. According to statistics,  19 of the `Seventh 5-Year Plan' and the `Eighth 5-Year Plan' key  projects are funded jointly, with a total amount of 51.43  million yuan coming from the participants; and the `Eighth  5-Year Plan' key S&amp;T projects were also supported by 5.7  million  yuan of joint funding. The joint funding effort also worked  successfully from collaboration with the State key laboratories  and the State open laboratories on S&amp;T research projects. In  1992, 62 of the 186 NSFC-supported projects, which received a  total funding of more than 95 million yuan, had close ties with  the State key laboratories, and 37 of them were linked to the  open laboratories. Meanwhile, the NSFC is also encouraging the  research institutes and industries, and also colleges,  universities and industries to apply for joint fundings for  their research projects for the purpose of bringing industries,  institutes, and universities closer.    The NSFC has also been very successful in promoting other  multi-channel fundings through international cooperation. For  example, on 28 October 1993, the NSFC signed a `Ford-China  Research and Development Foundation Agreement' with U.S. Ford  Motor Company to initiate the international cooperation.  Furthermore, the NSFC is exploring other cooperative channels  with the local governments to promote S&amp;T progress and to  foster  training of qualified S&amp;T personnel. Presently the NSFC is  establishing the `Zhongmi S&amp;T Revitalization Foundation' with  the Mi County of Henan Province.    Zhang Cunhao [1728 1317 3185], Chairman of NSFC, pointed out  that in order to promote ties between S&amp;T and national  economy  to a new level, the NSFC is planning a new joint research  project to cover all industries, universities, and research  institutes under this joint funding program.</p>

			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Rocky road ahead for EC motor parts sector: A secret report says drastic action is needed to fight off Japanese competition EUROPE'S automotive components industry must restructure in the 1990s to close an 'alarming' competitive gap with Japan, according to a confidential report prepared for the EC Commission. The industry, which has a crucial role in shaping the fortunes of European carmakers, is 'the weak link in the European motor industry's competitiveness today', says the report. 'It will be under even greater pressure in the future.' The industry employs around 940,000, and has annual output worth Ecu92.7bn (Pounds 72bn). Commissioned by the EC industry directorate from the Boston Consulting Group, the study claims that 'unless drastic action is taken soon, the competitive gap in components risks widening even further'. The report says: Employment in the industry is likely to fall from just below 1m to around 500,000 by 1999. The fragmented industry will be forced to restructure and concentrate as vehicle makers drastically reduce the number of direct suppliers - by around two thirds between 1988 and 1997 - to a core of around 500 first-tier suppliers across Europe. The number of remaining supplier companies is likely to fall by a third. The productivity of Japanese vehicle makers is around 30 per cent higher than their European rivals but in the components sector Japanese productivity is 2.5 times greater. The profitability of European components manufacturers has fallen between 1988 and 1991, reflecting 'the slowdown in demand, increases in capacity, reduction in prices, and the fierce competition that is accompanying the sector restructuring'. The report says the European Commission can play 'a useful supporting role' in facilitating restructuring of the industry, although the main efforts must come from the companies themselves. EC initiatives are called for in training and employment measures, in harmonising standards, in encouraging co-operation in research and development and technology, and in competition policy. The upheaval now under way most critically in the German motor industry among both vehicle makers and their components suppliers is central to the restructuring of the entire industry. Germany alone accounts for 47 per cent of the production of the EC independent components industry (excluding production by the vehicle makers themselves), for 53 per cent of the sector's added value and for 46 per cent of employment. France accounts for 19 per cent of production, the UK for 12 per cent, Italy for 11 per cent and Spain for seven per cent. Original equipment - components used in new vehicles - accounts for 77 per cent of the total EC components market of Ecu88.8bn. Growth in demand of 21 per cent from 1988 to 1992 has come from a small increase in vehicle production, but chiefly from moves by vehicle makers to buy more components from outside suppliers to reduce their own in-house components manufacturing, from the use of more sophisticated components in vehicles and a shift to the production of higher value vehicles. More job losses will follow those already announced this year, says the report. Several leading European vehicle makers are already demanding cost and price reductions of more than 10 per cent a year from their suppliers. 'Employment is likely to decline dramatically. . . as the growth of consumption and production slows down and the rate of productivity by necessity accelerates.' If productivity continues to grow by 4 per cent a year as in recent years, employment in the industry would be reduced by 11 per cent by the end of the decade. 'However, this level of productivity growth would leave the industry hopelessly unviable at the end of the period and in danger of collapse,' says the report. 'If the European components industry were to reach, in 1999, the level of productivity of the Japanese industry in 1992, then employment would be reduced by 54 per cent, implying a 14 per cent per annum improvement.' Even such a drastic cut in jobs, however, would not guarantee the EC reaching parity with the Japanese industry, which has lifted productivity by 5-6 per cent a year in the last decade. The report says the productivity gap must be at least halved as 'the absolute minimum necessary for the industry to be in a position to survive after 1999'. European components producers are turning over stock only 5-7 times a year on average compared with nearly 19 for their Japanese rivals. Concentration of ownership is one of the main structural changes facing the sector. The process is being driven, says the report, by 'the lack of competitiveness of many suppliers in an extremely fragmented industry', and by changes in vehicle makers' policies towards: more outsourcing and the transfer of design and development to the supplier industry; the sourcing of components to single rather than multiple suppliers; the purchasing of systems rather than individual components; and the formation of strategic buying alliances. As the industry restructures drastically, the report says it will be transformed, having fewer but larger suppliers with a European presence; assembling systems in factories near the car plants; subcontracting non-core production to second- and third-tier suppliers, and enjoying supply contracts for the life-time of vehicles and shared R&amp;D with vehicle makers. From a structure based on confrontation between the vehicle makers and their suppliers, the motor industry would have to move 'towards one based on partnership where profit is shared among the different players in the value chain'.  -------------------------------------------------       EC AUTOMOTIVE COMPONENT PRODUCTION 1992  ------------------------------------------------- Country                Ecu bn          percent  ------------------------------------------------- Germany                  43.6            47 France                   18.0            19 UK                       10.8            12 Italy                    10.2            11 Spain                     6.9             7 Rest of EC                3.2             4 Total                    97.7           100  -------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Return of the pessimists We don't hear so much nowadays about the New World Order. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, you could hardly turn a page without stumbling over some novel prescription for perfect peace. If it was not The End of History, it was the model of the Solitary Superpower. And if it was not collective security in a pan-European confederation, it was the coming-of-age of the UN and emerging world government. The utopians have mostly fallen silent now, because their recipes have curdled. Whatever Francis Fukuyama thought he meant, History continues to plague us in all of its familiar dimensions; and however glad we may be to see the back of the Old Order, the new world is characterised by a degree of disorder which far exceeds the capacity of our existing institutions to contain it. At the time, the Gulf war was a heartening exploit of UN solidarity and American military leadership; with hindsight, it does not look so good. Only six months ago, the second Start agreement seemed a historic move to put the genie of nuclear holocaust back in the bottle; today it is re-emerging in Ukraine, Pakistan, North Korea and even, conceivably, Japan. And then there is Bosnia; even an agreement in Geneva would only mark a new phase of that particular nightmare. Pessimists always expected things to go wrong; and policy analysts always emphasise the down-side. Otherwise they have nothing to sell. Sooner or later, one of the pessimistic policy analysts was bound to come along with a counter-theory, to explain why things will be just as bad as before, but for different reasons. Samuel Huntington is professor of the Science of Government at Harvard. And his theory is that global politics will in future be dominated by the clash of civilisations. 'The fault lines between civilisations,' he says, 'will be the battle lines of the future.'* That, is just the kind of sentence you would expect from a pessimistic policy-analyst. Mr Huntington identifies seven or eight large civilisations: Western, Confucian, Japanese, Islamic, Hindu, Slavic-Orthodox, Latin American and possibly African. And he suggests that the deep-seated differences between these civilisations may also become battle lines in future. The world is getting more crowded: so people fall back on kith and kin. Economic modernisation weakens the nation state, so religion moves in to fill the gap. But economic modernisation also builds up regional economic integration. Finally, the power of the West, now at an all-time peak, provokes the other civilisations to return to their cultural roots. Central to the Huntington hypothesis is the idea that these civilisations will be not just distinct but antagonistic. And the future, according to Mr Huntington, will be defined by relations between the West and the Rest. These relations will be essentially conflictual, because there cannot be a world civilisation of universal values transcending cultural differences. 'Western ideas of individualism, liberalism, constitutionalism, human rights, equality, liberty, the rule of law, democracy, free markets,' he says, 'often have little resonance in Islamic, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, Buddhist or Orthodox cultures.' In particular, there is a deep-seated antagonism over political and human rights values. The West is now 'at an extraordinary peak of power', according to Mr Huntington. As a result, the strategic postures of other civilisations will be defined by their attitudes to the West; and they have three broad options. They can choose isolation, like Burma and North Korea; they can try to join the West, like Mexico; or they can modernise while seeking allies against the West, like the countries of South East Asia. But the most likely prospect, according to Huntington, will be conflict between the West and several Islamic-Confucian states. To meet this threat, the West needs to promote greater solidarity within its own civilisation, especially between Europe and North America; to co-opt related cultures in Eastern Europe and Latin America; and to co-operate with Russia and Japan. It must also maintain its economic and military power to protect its interests. The problem with the Huntington thesis, is that he does not provide convincing arguments for expecting the age-old antagonisms between civilisations to get much worse in future. The rise of fundamentalism in India and the world of Islam, or the growth of regional trading arrangements around the world, do not seem adequate reasons. On the other hand, there is one development which could easily cause antagonism between civilisations to degenerate into conflict, and that would be a serious shift in power relationships between them. Mr Huntington asserts the West is at a peak of its power, as if this were a peak on which it could expect to remain. But it is more likely that Western power is really at a high water-mark, shortly before the tide starts to ebb. Fifty years ago, the US totally dominated the world economy. It is now rivalled by Europe and Japan. In a generation it could be challenged by China. Europe is a partner in the Western civilisation. Japan professes an uneasy associate membership of the West. But China will always be another civilisation. For hundreds of years the West has dominated the world economy, because it controlled technology and dictated the terms of trade. In future, technology will be more equally accessible, and others will start determining terms of trade. It is this which will bring the clash of civilisations. *The Clash of Civilisations?, Samuel P Huntington, in Foreign Affairs, Summer 1993, 58 East 68th St, New York</p>

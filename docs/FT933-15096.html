			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Securiguard recommends Rentokil bid RENTOKIL'S improved and final Pounds 75.7m offer for Securiguard was assured of success yesterday after it was recommended by the board of the security and cleaning company. Rentokil, the environmental and property services group, bought 29.7 per cent of Securiguard last week when it lifted its bid to 345p per share. Securiguard directors also said they would accept the offer in respect of their own 8 per cent stake in the com-pany. Mr Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil, said he was delighted with the recommendation: 'We intend to develop extensively Securiguard's businesses and therefore believe that the opportunities and prospects for Securiguard's employees will be much improved within Rentokil.' Securiguard's board said it believed that uncertainty over the future ownership could damage the business by adversely affecting both customers and staff. This could prevent the company taking advantage of opportunities and have an impact on shareholders. Against this background, the board believed the final offer fully valued Securi-guard. Securiguard said it had been assured that Rentokil intended to retain the separate identity of Securiguard's busi-nesses and had no plans to dispose of any of its core businesses. Mr Alan Baldwin, Securiguard's chairman, and Mr Peter Dunckley, the finance director, agreed to stay on as directors for a further six months to effect a smooth handover. Rentokil has asked the other executive directors to continue in their roles.</p>

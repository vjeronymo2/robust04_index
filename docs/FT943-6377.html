			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / World Bank says other solutions must be found to poverty Slower population growth will not be enough to solve the problem of poverty in developing nations, the World Bank says in a report prepared for next week's United Nations population conference in Cairo, writes George Graham in Washington. Although slowing down the rate of population growth should still be a high priority for developing countries, the report says, a broader programme involving investment in education, health and nutrition will be needed to address poverty. 'We need to combine reproductive health and family planning with better infant and child health, education of girls and overall improvement in the status of women,' said Mr Armeane Choksi, the bank's vice-president for human resource development and operations policy. The bank expects world population to grow over the next 35 years to around 8.5bn, with almost 90 per cent of the rise occurring in developing countries.</p>

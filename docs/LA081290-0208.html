			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS.  </P> <P> Banner Year -- The numbers are coming in on the recently concluded breeding  season for the endangered California least tern, and 1990 shaped up as a banner  season at the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. Last season, 115 pairs of least  terns nested there; this year, 239 total nests were counted.  </P> <P> Because some birds build more than one nest for various reasons, the number of  breeding pairs this season was probably slightly less than 239. But the most  important number is how many successful fledglings were produced: 150, compared  to last year's 45.  </P> <P> The news on the small, gull-like bird was mixed at the Huntington State Beach  colony. Last year, 70 pairs nested there, a number that dropped to 40 pairs  this season. The good news is that 20 fledglings were produced, up from a  disastrous five last season. The chicks at Huntington continued to fall prey to  kestrels, while no predation problems were noted at Bolsa Chica this season.  </P> <P> Estimated numbers for least terns at Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve  remained relatively steady, between 60 and 70 pairs compared to last year's 74.  About 50 fledglings are likely, according to state Fish and Game biologist  Esther Burkett. She has not received numbers for the colony at Seal Beach  National Wildlife Refuge.  </P> <P> "Overall, I would say that we had a really, really good year," Burkett said.  </P> <P> This is the first season that all the least terns nested on Bolsa Chica's south  island, having been pushed off the reserve's north island by the continuing  success of larger tern species that have moved northward in recent years.  </P> <P> At Bolsa Chica this season, counts estimate 1,000 elegant tern nests, 100  Caspian tern nests and 100 Forster's tern nests. Black skimmers are at 295  nests, up from 170 last year, and their breeding season continues. The breeding  success of the skimmers comes despite the fact that many received some oil  damage in the Feb. 7 American Trader spill off Huntington Beach.  </P> <P> We're With the Band -- The state Fish and Game department is continuing to band  many of the tern chicks that fledge at Bolsa Chica, particularly elegant tern  and black skimmers. Chicks hatched this season have pink bands; 1989 birds have  blue bands and 1988 birds have yellow bands.  </P> <P> If you spot birds with these bands, you can help biologists by noting the date  and location of the sighting, the number of birds with bands, the color of the  bands and the species. Call Esther Burkett with the information: (714)  537-0696.  </P> <P> Museum News -- The Museum of Natural History and Science, which recently closed  its doors in Newport Beach, has announced a Nov. 17 opening date for its new  interim site in Aliso Viejo. Exhibits planned for the new facility include  space exploration, robotic dinosaur models, local Indian artifacts and local  marine mammal fossils.  </P></p>

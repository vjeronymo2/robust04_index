			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Ulster's isolation compounded by lack of integration The isolation of Ulster is compounded by its lack of integration with the republic of Ireland, the institute says in its review, Stewart Dalby writes. It sees hope in the peace process, saying that an end to the troubles could help bring about an integration in the vital areas of manufacturing and food. The institute calls into question a perception that Ulster's fringe position in the UK could be a deterrent to inward investment. The review says transport costs from the province to places such as Berlin and Milan are substantially lower than costs to the same places from Dublin. Costs to New York are 27 per cent less.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Currency fears unsettle equities again RENEWED weakness in sterling depressed the UK stock market yesterday, casting a shadow over hopes that domestic interest rates might be trimmed again later this week. Share prices moved erratically in London, rallying after a 22 point fall on the FT-SE Index reflected a dip in sterling towards the DM 2.50 rate. The final reading put the Footsie at 2,553 for a net fall of 12.5 points on the day. Trading volume on the Seaq network increased to 641.7m shares from Tuesday's 533.8m, with a batch of trading programmes crossing the electronic screens as institutions made final re-arrangements to their third quarter showcases. But fund managers showed little interest in opening up new equity positions ahead of the final quarter of the year which begins today. Stock Exchange data showed that retail business on Tuesday was worth Pounds 1.1bn, maintaining the improvement of recent sessions. A very large trading programme arrived overnight from a leading US investment bank, to be followed later in the London session by a substantial two way programme from a UK securities house and then by a small sell programme from a London investment bank. Traders stressed that there was no heavy selling but said that investment confidence seemed to have weakened since the heady days which followed Britain's departure from the ERM system. Equity strategists are disturbed by the sharp rises marked up in Government Index-linked bonds, the prime anti-inflation investment instruments. Indications of an increasing risk factor in equities were reflected in the continued flow of brokerage downgradings of leading UK companies. Yesterday brought hints of a re-rating of Courtaulds, a further blow to a chemicals sector already disturbed this week by downward revisions on ICI. Hopes of a further cut in UK base rates, dented on Tuesday by the warning on exchange rates from the governor of the Bank of England, were unsettled afresh when a Bundesbank spokesman discouraged speculation on German interest rate policies ahead of tomorrow's council meeting of the German central bank. 'Sterling is not going back into the ERM because nobody really wants to go back in, they do not really want us back in and we would not last even if we went back in,' was the summary of City views put forward by Nick Knight of Nomura Research. Weakness in the US dollar against sterling brought falls in the US-influenced stocks which have played a significant role in the market's advance over the past fortnight. The fear that sterling's continued fall will undermine the chances for base rate cuts kept store and retail issues on the downward path. Ratners, the retail jewellery chain, disclosed a Pounds 30m loss, re-affirming the bearish tone of other trading reports from the retail sector over the past week. Banking stocks, which have been badly hit by warnings of widespread profits downgradings ahead from the brokerage analysts, staged an uncertain rally yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir considers  his visit to Cambodia a historical event because he is the first  Malaysian leader to visit the country in 30 years. This is  because the conflict that took place in Cambodia following the  visit by the late Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime  minister, made it impossible for other Malaysian leaders to  visit Phnom Penh. Here is Shah Bahrom Datuk Shah Ya, a RTM  [Radio Television Malaysia] correspondent reporting from  Vientiane. [as heard]    [Begin Shah Bahrom recording] Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir  said the above when addressing the state banquet hosted in his  honor by the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Ranariddh  and Hun Sen, at the Government House tonight.    He said that even though visits to Phnom Penh were  impossible  then, the leaders and the people of Malaysia continued to pay  attention to Cambodia. Malaysia sympathized with the situation  in Cambodia when it was bogged down by civil war. Now Malaysia  is happy to see the country being restored to an everlasting  peace with the help of friendly countries. Malaysia is also  happy to be involved in the peace process in Cambodia, including  participation in UNTAC [United National Transitional Authority  in Cambodia]. As for Malaysia, it is important that peace is  restored to Cambodia because this is also important for the  stability and prosperity in the Southeast Asia region.    Malaysia's involvement in Cambodia's peace process is mainly  due to the fact that Malaysia is a neighboring country and a  close friend of Cambodia. It has become ASEAN's new practice to  open up opportunities and boost cooperation among its member  countries as well as with peaceful countries in Southeast Asia.  This includes a peaceful Cambodia.    Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir reiterated that when there is unity  in  Southeast Asia, the countries in the region will definitely be  much stronger to face future challenges.    Malaysia hopes that finally all 10 countries in Southeast  Asia will become members of ASEAN. Laos and Vietnam have taken  various steps and make preparations to join ASEAN.

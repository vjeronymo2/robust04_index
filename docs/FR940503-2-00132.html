			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. There is no surrender charge on amounts surrendered: After the eleventh certificate year, due to a participant's retirement under the plan on or after age 55; due to the death of the participant; or upon settlement of the certificate under an annuity payment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. IDS Life of New York will assess the Variable Accounts of a daily mortality and expense risk charge equal to 1 percent of the average daily net assets of the Variable Accounts on an annual basis. IDS Life of New York estimates that two-thirds of this charge is for assumption of the mortality risk and one-third is for the assumption of the expense risk. This charge cannot be increased during the life of the Contracts and does not apply after retirement payments begin. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. IDS Life of New York will assume certain mortality and expense risks under the contracts. IDS Life of New York assumes certain mortality risks by its contractual obligation to continue to make retirement payments for the entire life of the annuitant under annuity obligations involving life contingencies. This obligation assures each annuitant that neither the annuitant's own longevity nor an improvement in life expectancy generally will have an adverse effect on the retirement payments received under the Contracts and related certificates. This assurance relieves the annuitant from the risk of outliving the amounts accumulated for retirement. The payment option tables contained in the Contracts are based on the 1983 Individual Annuity Mortality Table. The use of these tables is guaranteed for the life of the Contracts and related certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. IDS Life of New York assumes additional mortality and certain expense risks under the Contracts and certificates by its contractual obligation to pay a death benefit in a lump sum (or in the form of an annuity payment plan) upon the death of a participant prior to the retirement date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. IDS Life of New York assumes an expense risk because the administrative charge may be insufficient to cover administrative expenses. These include the costs and expenses of processing purchase payments, retirement payments, surrenders, and transfers; furnishing confirmation notices and periodic reports; calculating mortality and expense risk charges; preparing voting materials and tax reports; updating registration statements; and actuarial and other expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. If the administrative charge and the mortality and expense risk charge are insufficient to cover the costs and expenses assumed, the loss will be borne by IDS Life of New York. Conversely, if the amount deducted proves more than sufficient, the excess will represent a profit to IDS Life of New York. As noted above, IDS Life of New York does not expect to profit from the administrative charge. However, IDS Life of New York does expect to profit from the mortality and expense risk charge. Any profit realized from this charge would be available to IDS Life of New York for, among other things, payment of distribution expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Legal Analysis and Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 26(a)(2)(C) and 27(c)(2) of the 1940 Act prohibit a registered unit investment trust and any depositor or underwriter thereof from selling periodic payment plan certificates unless the proceeds of all payments (except such amounts as are deducted for sales loads) are deposited with a trustee or custodian having the qualifications prescribed by section 26(a)(1) of the 1940 Act and held under an agreement that provides that no payment to the depositor or principal underwriter shall be allowed except as a fee, not exceeding such reasonable amount as the Commission may prescribe, for bookkeeping and other administrative services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants request an exemption from sections 26(a)(2)(c) and 27(c)(2) to the extent necessary to permit the issuance and sale of the Contracts and related certificates providing for the 1 percent mortality and expense risk charge. Section 6(c) of the 1940 Act, in pertinent part, provides that the Commission, by order upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or transactions, from any provisions of the 1940 Act to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that, for the following reasons, their exemptive requests meet the standards set out in section 6(c) and, therefore, an order should be granted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants represent that the level of the mortality and expense risk charge is within the range of industry practice for comparable variable annuity products. IDS Life of New York has reviewed publicly available information about other annuity products, taking into consideration such factors as current charge levels, charge guarantees, sales loads, surrender charges, availability of funds, investment options avaiable under annuity contracts, market sector and the availability of retirement plans. IDS Life of New York represents that it will maintain at its principal office, and make available upon request of the Commission or its staff, a memorandum setting forth its analysis, including its methodology and results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants acknowledge that the surrender charge described above may be insufficient to cover all costs relating to the distribution of the Contracts and certificates and that, if a profit is realized from the mortality and expense risk charge, all or a portion of such profit may be offset by distribution expenses not reimbursed by the contingent deferred sales charge. In such circumstances, a portion of the mortality and expense risk charge might be viewed as providing for a portion of the distribution costs of the Contracts and related certificates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IDS Life of New York has concluded that there is a reasonable likelihood that the proposed distribution financing arrangements made with respect to the Contracts will benefit the Variable Accounts and investors in the Contracts and related certificates. The basis for such conclusion is set forth in a memorandum that will be maintained by IDS Life of New York at its principal office and will be available to the Commission or its staff on request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. IDS Life of New York represents that the Variable Accounts will invest only in an underlying mutual fund that, in the event the fund should adopt any plan under Rule 12b&hyph;1 to finance distribution expenses, would have such a plan formulated and approved by a board of directors, a majority of the members of which are not interested persons of such fund within the meaning of section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Conclusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth above, Applicants represent that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

State  help for company investments and the labor market in the new  laender must be concentrated more strongly in the future, a  study conducted by the Ifo Economic Research Institute in Munich  and the Halle Economic Research Institute (IWH) at the order of  the FRG Finance Ministry says. The balance sheet after three  years of intensive subsidy policy is mixed. Promotion programs  continue to be a cornerstone of economic development in the new  laender.    Without this massive help, unemployment would have risen  even  more strongly. The study, which is partly based on a poll among  companies, also shows that both investment promotion and labor  market policy primarily secure employment. So far, too few new  jobs have been created. According to the poll, about half of  the companies have used labor market policy help. Two-thirds of  the 931 polled companies complained in particular about the  excessive wage costs, seeing them as a hindrance of further  development.    In view of the competition in the East European low-wage  countries, the two institutes especially point to the problem of  the too fast adjustment of wages to the western level, which  have a negative effect on the competitiveness of existing  companies and the staring prospects of newly founded companies.  The state's promotion policy is in danger of becoming only a  "repair instrument for misconduct in wage policy." The key to a  successful promotion policy primarily is, therefore, a moderate  wage policy, linked with the fastest possible abolition of still  existing obstacles in administration regarding problems with  ownership or regarding old burdens.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI expands in US THORN EMI, the music and rentals group which last week decided to withdraw from UK electrical retailing, is to expand further in the US by acquiring Remco America, a rent-to-own company, from a group of private investors for about Dollars 55m (Pounds 30.3m). Texas-based Remco operates 64 stores in Houston, Dallas, Chicago and North Carolina and achieved turnover of Dollars 69m in the year to September 30 1991. Remco's profits were not disclosed, but Thorn said the record was good. Thorn's Rent-A-Center subsidiary, acquired in 1987, claims to be the largest rent-to-own company in the US, with about 20 per cent of the market. Remco will retain its existing management, but its operations will be incorporated with those of RAC or of Thorn International Rentals, a small US chain set up in an attempt to create a second trading brand.</p>

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Charge and fall in sales push Caterpillar into red CATERPILLAR, the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment, reported a Dollars 404m annual loss for 1991, compared with earnings of Dollars 210m in 1990. The loss per share for last year was Dollars 4.00, against earnings per share in 1990 of Dollars 2.07. The loss was attributed primarily to a Dollars 373m pre-tax, non-recurring charge, most of which was taken in the fourth quarter, and a 12 per cent decline in sales volume. The charge was for plant closings and employee redundancy costs. Although the company has been embroiled in a labour dispute with the United Auto Workers since the beginning of November, it said this did not have a significant effect on the deterioration in sales. It did admit that with some 9,300 workers idled, operations have been disrupted. The company's outlook for this year is also clouded by the labour dispute. It said that because of the uncertainties about the economy and resolving the labour problems, it was 'not practical to forecast 1992 profitability at this time'. But it is expected the first quarter of 1992 will be unprofitable. In the fourth quarter, the company reported a loss of Dollars 318m, or Dollars 3.16 per share. This compares with earnings of Dollars 11m, or 11 cents, in the year-ago period. Sales and revenues in the fourth quarter were Dollars 2.46bn, down by Dollars 299m from the 1990 period.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Manaus (Brazil), 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Manaus Federal  Police Superintendency reported today that the armed forces of  Colombia, Venezuela, Bolivia, and Peru have been invited by  Brazil to join a large operation to block the drug trafficking  mafia operating in the Amazon River basin.    Superintendent Mauro Sposito said the plan was presented to  those countries during the Sixth Military Exchange Meeting of  the Armed Forces held in Sao Gabriel da Cachoeira last week.    Sposito said Venezuela already has confirmed its  participation in the campaign that will be named "Operation  Blockade" [Operacion Bloqueo] and Colombia hinted that it also  will support it.    The Manaus (capital of Amazonas State) police superintendent  explained that the plan includes the establishment of an  information network among the armed forces of the countries  sharing the Amazon basin.    Sposito added that in Brazil the operation will cover all  the  federal organizations in Amazonas State and the national and  multinational fuel distribution companies. Sposito said 200  Federal Police officers will work exclusively on the operation.    Sposito also indicated that "Operation Blockade" has the  basic purpose of fighting drug trafficking at the Brazilian  border with the other four countries.    Brazil also intends to be excluded from the list of  countries  used as transit routes by international drug traffickers.  Sposito pointed out that Brazil and Venezuela have become the  first countries on the cocaine route that starts in Colombia and  ends in the United States and Europe.    Therefore, said Sposito, the Colombian Armed Forces'  participation will be essential for the operation's success.    "Operation Blockade" seeks to intercept the flow of cocaine  on the Amazon River by integrating the Brazilian river police  patrols in Tabatinga (at the Colombian border) with the Manaus  police.    The operation also includes a follow-up by Brazil on actions  against drug traffickers in Colombia.    Strict air traffic control in the Amazon region that  includes  the destruction of fuel supply networks and clandestine  airfields, as well as the neutralization of the air space in the  large Amazon basin, are the main aspects of "Operation Blockade."    The operation also will include two radio centers, which  began operating last November, in Tabatinga and Tefe (Amazonas  State) to intercept the drug trafficking routes.</p>

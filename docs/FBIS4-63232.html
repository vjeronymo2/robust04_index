			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Aleksey Bukalov and </F> Dmitriy Polunin]    [Text] Tirana May 20 TASS -- New democratic Russia,  committed to the values of freedom and progress, can and should  play an important role in European politics, conforming to its  status of a great power, Albanian President Sali Berisha said in  an exclusive interview with ITAR-TASS here on Thursday.    "There were different periods in relations between our two  countries: 'From love to hatred'," the Albanian leader noted.  Present-day Albanian-Russian relations are based on equality and  mutual respect.    Cooperation between Albania and Russia in the international  arena is of great importance for the establishment of peace in  the Balkan region, Berisha stressed. He also favoured broader  bilateral relations in the economy, politics and culture.    Speaking on Thursday at the ceremony of launching a factory  of the Coca Cola firm in Tirana's suburb, where foreign  journalists accredited in Rome were invited, the Albanian  president said of his country's readiness to liberalise the  economy and invite foreign investments.    In the past, legislation forbade the participation of  foreign  capital in the Albanian economy. It will now play the key role  in the country's transition to the market model of development.    Albania hopes for an inflow of foreign investments in the  power industry, agriculture and the food industry as well as in  the tourist industry. The president noted in this connection  that his country has rich natural resources and cheap labour.    The new course of the Albanian leadership for openness and  international cooperation offers broad opportunities for the  development of the national economy, the president continued.    This course has opponents inside the country. But the  overwhelming majority of Albanians support the policy of  reforms, he added.    The Albanian leader also touched on some pressing foreign  policy issues in his speech. He said that Albania is following  with great concern the development of the Bosnian conflict,  advocates the immediate end to combat operations and expresses  readiness to cooperate closely with the international community  in a search for a peaceful settlement.    The president dwelt at length on Albania's relations with  neighbouring countries. He pointed to the successful  development of Italian-Albanian relations and also stressed that  his country is interested in a stable situation in the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and seeks normal contacts with  Greece.    Berisha, together with Premier Aleksander Meksi and other  cabinet members, opened the Coca Cola enterprise built with  Italian and American assistance. The factory with a capacity of  16,800 bottles per hour was built for [as received] 80 days.    Albania has become 197th country where the Coca Cola company  puts out its soft beverage.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Sharp growth in Irish opposition to Maastricht OPPOSITION to the Maastricht Treaty in Ireland has doubled since the Danish voted to reject it last week, according to an opinion poll published in Dublin yesterday . The Market Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI) poll, commissioned by the Irish Times, found that opposition to the treaty has doubled from 11 per cent to 23 per cent of voters since a similar poll taken a month ago. Those indicating an intention to vote 'yes' have dropped from 57 per cent of those surveyed to 47 per cent. This still gives a proportion of two-to-one in favour of the treaty, but a significant 30 per cent of voters are undecided, giving little cause for comfort to the government whose campaign for a 'Yes' vote looks increasingly as though it is foundering. The interviews for the poll were carried out 24 hours before EC finance ministers in Brussels rejected the Delors II package to increase EC funding by 30 per cent, under which Ireland had hoped to receive a big increase in structural funds. On posters appearing around Dublin this week, and in leaflets dropping through letterboxes, the government has been highlighting the importance of the EC structural funds to Ireland's economy and to point out that Ireland could expect to receive a doubling of EC structural and cohesion funds, amounting to IPounds 6bn, for the 1994-98 period if the treaty is approved. The government yesterday put a brave face on the turn of events in Luxembourg. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said he will continue to press his EC colleagues on the issue, and to hold out for a doubling of funds to Ireland, although he acknowledged that compromise, and a scaling down of expectations may be necessary. 'We are still at an early negotiating stage' he said. A ministry spokesman said 'Either there is a commitment to cohesion and equality in the community or there isn't. If there were to be a retraction by a number of member states on those commitments, then that will change people's attitudes significantly'. Opponents of the treaty yesterday drew encouragement from the poll results and the rejection of the Delors package. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the leader of the opposition Democratic Left party, who is leading a small parliamentary grouping against the treaty, said: 'Doubts about the treaty are likely to intensify as a result of this snub from the EC finance ministers.' The opposition Fine Gael party, which on Tuesday joined forces with the ruling Fianna Fail party, to campaign on behalf of the treaty was also critical of the government's handling of the campaign. The party said: 'We thought it very unwise of the government to make promises that could not be kept'.</p>

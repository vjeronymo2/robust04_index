			<p>BFN     [Text] Johannesburg May 4 SAPA -- The African National  Congress on Wednesday [4 May] night strongly denied it had  withdrawn charges of electoral fraud against the Inkatha Freedom  Party [IFP] in KwaZulu/Natal.    The organisation's secretary general, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa,  issued the denial barely two hours after IFP leader Chief  Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had learnt that the ANC had  withdrawn these charges. Stressing the anc's commitment to  accept the results of a free and fair election, Mr Ramaphosa  said his organisation had presented new evidence of irregularity  to the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC). "The ANC has new  evidence that it has submitted to the IEC, further strengthening  its case on the irregularities in KwaZulu/Natal. It is the firm  hope of the ANC that outstanding problems contributing to the  delay in counting will be speedily resolved to allow the country  to embark on the many tasks awaiting the government of national  unity."    Earlier, IEC spokesman Mr Glenn McDougall confirmed the  commission had found no evidence of extensive voting fraud in  KwaZulu/Natal, as claimed by the ANC.</p>

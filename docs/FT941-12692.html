			<p>940128 FT  28 JAN 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical optimistic as deficit is cut to Dollars 48m Dow Chemical, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported net losses of Dollars 48m for its fourth quarter because of heavy provisions for litigation against Dow Corning, the biggest US manufacturer of breast implants, in which it holds a 50 per cent stake. However, the deficit marked a sharp improvement from the net losses of Dollars 250m in the previous year's fourth quarter, and the figures were accompanied by an upbeat statement about the outlook from Mr Frank Popoff, chairman and chief executive. 'While many of the challenges facing us will persist in 1994, we expect earnings to improve because of the company's on-going efforts to enhance productivity and as a result of recovering world economies and improved industry fundamentals,' Mr Popoff said. Dow has been suffering from poor cyclical demand for its products, particularly from Europe. Volume was flat in the fourth quarter, but sales were 5 per cent lower at Dollars 4.5bn because prices fell. Fourth-quarter earnings benefited from a Dollars 90m pre-tax gain on investments, but this was heavily outweighed by a Dollars 192m after-tax provision for litigation against Dow Corning over leaking implants. The result translated into losses per share of 18 cents, compared with losses of 92 cents last time. However, Dow said that excluding both unusual items from the latest figures, and a Dollars 433m charge against the previous year's fourth-quarter pre-tax profits, the group would have reported earnings per share of 30 cents, against 10 cents a share last time. For the full year, Dow reported a 5 per cent drop in sales to Dollars 18.1bn because of a 4 per cent fall in prices and a 1 per cent fall in volumes. Net income was Dollars 637m, compared with net losses of Dollars 496m last time, and earnings per share were Dollars 2.33, against net losses of Dollars 1.83. But Dow said that if unusual items were stripped out, earnings per share would have been flat at Dollars 2.02, compared with Dollars 2.01.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Joe Macabalang] </F>   [Text] Cotabato City -- A separate government peace  negotiation with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is  "not needed" as long as the ongoing peace talks between the  government and its rival rebel front will implement the 1976  Tripoli Pact, the MILF said yesterday.    However, Ghazali Gaafar, MILF vice chairman for political  affairs, warned of a "more protracted and rigorous" struggle by  Muslim rebels if the government's current peace talks with the  Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) bogs down anew.    Gaafar said the MILF "will not ask for more" as long as the  government and the MILF will agree on the full implementation of  the 1976 Tripoli Agreement.    "The success of the RP [Republic of the Philippines]-MNLF  talks depends much on the government's willingness to abide by  such agreement," he added.    Gaafar refuted earlier reports that the MILF has had direct  participations in earlier atrocities in Cotabato, Sultan  Kudarat, and Maguindanao provinces to attract attention and  "force" the government to hold separate talks with their front.    He said, the MILF consider the MNLF a "friendly force" and  that there is no difference in the two fronts' objectives.    Sources said the sudden attitude of the MILF leadership  towards its rival MNLF could be a result of the recent  "consolidation dialog" between leaders of the two fronts, in a  bid to strengthen the Bangsamoro rebels' revolutionary stature.    MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari, in his "incognito visit" here  last  Good Friday, had avoided "to contemplate on the alternative to  peace," a statement interpreted locally as a gesture of all-out  efforts by the MNLF to end the peace talks successfully.    Corroborating Misuari's statement, Gaafar said, "there can  be  no other solution to the Mindanao problem except the grant of  genuine autonomy in the area."    Both the MILF and the MNLF have been demanding for the full  implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement, which calls for  the grant of autonomy in Mindanao.    Under the Aquino Administration, a plebiscite was conducted  on the 13 provinces and 10 cities, but only four opted to join  the Constitutionally-mandated Autonomous Region in Muslim  Mindanao, an institution both the MNLF and MILF have rejected.    The agreement's implementation "in letter and in spirit" is  the main agendum of the resumed RP-MNLF peace talks which began  last year in Jakarta, Indonesia and resume this month or the  next in the same host foreign country.</p>

The government issued  the warning because of mounting tensions in the region following  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision last week to  allow air strikes, the officials said.    According to the officials, there were 66 Japanese in Serbia  as of December 1 last year. While there were no Japanese listed  as residing in Montenegro, the area was included due to  increased tensions there.    Those residing in Serbia include government officials,  company officials and members of the press as well as their  families, they said.    NATO warned the Serbs last week that its warplanes could  bomb  their heavy weapons supplies positioned around the besieged  Bosnian capital of Sarajevo unless the weapons are withdrawn or  put under U.N. command by February 21.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The two-way switch in world economy The most valuable guess about the impact of the Uruguay agreement is the one made by Gatt's own secretariat: that it will add nearly Dollars 750bn to world merchandise trade by around the year 2005. This is apart from the benefit to trade in services which no one seems able to quantify. The trade gain should be equivalent to an increase of 12 per cent, compared with what that trade might otherwise have been. Although speculative, the estimate is less unreliable than the attempts to translate the gain into changes in economic welfare, which is what the headline figures - which politicians quote without understanding - mostly try to do. For the moment, a Gatt agreement's most important effect will be on confidence. It will be a green light to firms hesitating about investment projects which depend upon products crossing national frontiers. It will also stop the damage that a blow to confidence would inflict on a sluggish world economy. The hope in the longer run must be, however, that it will restore some impetus to world trade. The need for this is shown in the accompanying table prepared by an Oxford economist, Peter Sinclair, in an article unfortunately buried at the end of the Autumn 1993 Oxford Review of Economic Policy (published by Oxford University Press). In the table, export values have been deflated by a general price index to put them into real terms. The usual practice of deflating them by export prices is misleading as makers of traded products tend to experience faster productivity increases than other businesses; as a consequence their goods rise less in price. The table shows that, until about 1980, it was the rule that world trade grew a great deal faster than output. But in the subsequent decade that rule was reversed and trade grew less than output in all the members of the Group of Seven, except France and Germany. The general conclusion applies even if oil is taken out of the figures or if intra-EC trade is excluded. Sinclair attributes a great deal of the lost trade dynamism to policy. The gaps between Gatt rounds have grown larger. It is now, for instance, 20 years since the Tokyo Round was concluded. Since then agricultural protection has been increased; there are more non-tariff barriers; and some regional groups like the EC may have diverted trade from inter-continental channels. The author also puts some of the blame on so-called new trade theories among academics. These suggest that, when firms have market power, countries may gain by intervening on their behalf. I suspect these theories have been taken up only as rationalisations by administrations heavily lobbied by producers. Sinclair tackles these theories head-on and shows that, even under the assumed trading conditions, there may actually be gains from freer trade. Meanwhile, warnings keep landing on my desk from analysts who believe that the next European upturn will be even more disappointing for jobs than the upturn of the 1980s, and will put even more pressure on the pay of less skilled workers. In some versions, the threat looks like a return visit of the 'yellow peril' from the east which so terrified Europeans and Americans at the beginning of the 20th century. There is, indeed, a profound two-way change taking place in the world economy which is most convincingly summarised - without any yellow peril nonsense - by Richard Brown and DeAnne Julius in the first 1993 prize-winning essay in the Amex Bank Review, also published by Oxford University Press. One change is a big shift in the geographical centre of gravity away from the traditionally rich countries that make up the 24-nation OECD. The shift has been disguised by the habit of comparing GDP at current exchange rates, which undervalue the output of the hitherto less-advanced countries. On the conventional basis, the combined GDP of the OECD countries is 2.7 times as high as that of the rest of the world. But, using estimates based on purchasing power parity instead, it is only 1.1 times as high. The other associated change is a steep decline in the share of manufacturing in total employment in the OECD countries. In the US, the manufacturing share peaked as early as 1920. Countries such as Germany - which is a real outlier with a manufacturing share of 32 per cent - face a really steep decline in this sector. The authors expect the manufacturing proportion to reach 10 per cent or less in most OECD countries within the next 30 years. In so doing, it will be following the path of decline traced by agriculture over the past 50 years. The authors see nothing horrifying in these trends. Service workers are not just 16-year-olds flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. Managers, sales personnel, brain surgeons and bankers are all in the service sector. A recent survey in Manchester found that employees in the leisure and media sectors were the highest paid and those in manufacturing the lowest. Because of the difficulty of measuring service output, the rate of inflation in this sector is exaggerated and its productivity growth greatly understated. Manufacturing companies in the west will face competing options. They can continue to compete on cost if they switch production to developing countries. Or they can seek high value-added niches with a big service component. Either way there will be a shift of employment to services. It does not take great genius to predict great pressure to subsidise or protect the manufacturing sector. But, the authors remark, it would be 'a critical mistake to yield. The agricultural experience shows that such a reaction would be costly and ultimately fruitless.' They would prefer western governments to concentrate on promoting free trade in services and still greater freedom for international investment. They make the conventional plea for European and American governments to 'focus on people' and upgrade and broaden education and training to improve performance in the newer sectors. But 'in the traditional areas of industrial policy and direct support to industry, we are asking politicians to do what they find most difficult: nothing]' There is, however, more to say. A problem is created by the rapidly increasing differentials in earnings between high- and low-paid workers. While this has been most evident in the US and Britain, the protection offered by continental institutions of the Social Chapter kind is crumbling. Many parts of the welfare state are being trimmed in Sweden; and, further south, nationwide wage agreements and minimum wages are being seen as obstacles to employment. International studies, such as those summarised in the 1993 OECD Review of Industrial Policy, suggest that technological change has hitherto been more important in creating these labour market pressures than either Reagan-Thatcher policies or international trade pressures. But whatever may have happened in the past, it is likely that imports from developing or former communist countries will in future depress the market-clearing levels of pay among the least skilled or least adaptable groups. If trade opens up the prospect of increasing the national income, the losses of particular groups are a distributional problem and cannot be shrugged off by references to training. The challenge is to find non-vindictive ways of redistributing income towards the losers; it is to find methods of redistribution that do not assume that all income belongs to the state; it is to find methods of redistribution which do not destroy the gains from trade and technology, while compensating those who would otherwise lose out from change. The statement of the problem - which is still far from recognised - comes before the answers.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ANNUAL EXPORT GROWTH AND OUTPUT GROWTH FOR THE G7 COUNTRIES (% PA)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Real export growth        Real output growth                    --------------------      --------------------                    1970-80      1980-90      1970-80        80-90  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada                7.37         1.82         4.59         2.97 France                6.86         2.82         3.28         2.32 Germany               5.29         3.54         2.69         2.15 Italy                 7.43         1.20         3.76         2.22 Japan                 7.31         1.80         4.53         4.22 UK                    4.68         1.79         2.00         2.52 US                    9.99         1.30         2.82         2.51  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Sinclair, Oxford Review of Economic Policy  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

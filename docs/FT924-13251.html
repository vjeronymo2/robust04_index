			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities bombarded with bad news A UK equity market bombarded with bad news at home and from abroad came under more heavy selling pressure yesterday, as sterling fell sharply against the D-mark and the dollar. The strong gains in blue chip shares recorded on Monday and Tuesday, when the move to cut mortgage rates by Abbey National was interpreted by dealers as presaging a UK interest rate cut, have now been wiped out. Similar hopes of imminent interest rate reductions by the German Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve have also perished. There was unmitigated gloom around the City's trading rooms from the outset as the Conservative government was taken to task by the Press over worsening economic news and its handling of the massive job losses in coal mining. Worse was to come with news of the latest jobless figures, which showed unemployment in the UK running at 10.1 per cent in September, up for the twenty-ninth consecutive month, with male unemployment of 13.4 per cent, the highest since the 1930s. The Footsie 100 began the session over 22 points down at 2,552.3, as marketmakers chopped their opening levels to deter sellers. The move proved reasonably successful with the index holding around the level until the unemployment, unit wage costs and average earnings numbers were announced. These figures, confirming recent bad news on the UK economy, touched off a further flurry of selling pressure which drove the index down to 2,536.6, for a fall of 38.1. Wall Street's opening brought no respite for London with the US market down some 15 points soon after trading commenced, following an extremely cautious statement on prospects from Philip Morris, the US foods-to-tobacco giant. BAT Industries' shares immediately tumbled in sympathy with Philip Morris but ended the session well above the day's lowest levels. Towards the close, however, London stabilised and managed to edge off the bottom with the Footsie 100 closing a net 28.1 lower at 2,546.6. The Footsie Mid 250 index lost 27.1 to 2,373.9 and the Footsie 350 index 13.6 to 1,223.4. One senior trader at one UK securities house said the market would have fallen further and faster had it not been for a number of short positions and persistent stories of possible takeover bids. But he was extremely wary of the equity market in the run up to the US Presidential election on November 3. Another specialist, whilst not seeing much upside scope, felt the downside was also limited, saying: 'There are plenty of buyers of the market around 2,500.' Turnover of 476.8m shares remained disappointing. The absence of the much-hoped for interest rate cut cast a shadow over a building sector badly in need of support. Banks were exceptionally weak as fears of a 'double-dip' recession prompted renewed concerns of more bad debt provisioning. Utilities, traditionally good buys for their defensive qualities when the cyclical stocks come under pressure, performed well with water stocks particularly firm after their responses to the industry watchdog proposals on cuts in water charges.</p>

			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Labour's 1992 campaign 'lost before it was begun' A powerful challenge to the conventional wisdom that Labour lost the 1992 general election as a result of a last-minute revolt by the electorate against the party's tax policies has been made by a group of leading academics. In the most comprehensive analysis yet produced of the factors which gave the Conservatives their fourth consecutive election victory, the study casts serious doubts on the validity of opinion polls taken in the election campaign. The analysis concludes instead that Labour had in effect lost the battle before the election campaign started, and that tactics employed by the main parties immediately prior to the election had little impact on the outcome. Turning to Labour's future electoral prospects, the team of academics says that Labour does not need to be defensive about its tax policies and should stick firmly to its commitment to preserve and improve the welfare state. Instead it should focus on its policies for managing the economy. The key to Labour's success must be to persuade 'a sceptical electorate that it has the economic as well as the social formula to succeed in office'. The Conservatives' reputation for economic competence has been seriously eroded since 1992 but it is not clear how permanent the damage is. The authors question the traditional judgment that a strong performance by the Liberal Democrats would damage Labour's chances of forming a government. Instead a high third party vote would allow Labour to win an overall majority with no more than 35 per cent of its 1992 vote. But it warns that an electoral pact would not help Labour because too high a proportion of Liberal Democrat voters prefer the Conservatives to Labour. The study was produced by the Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends and edited by a team of election specialists including Mr Anthony Heath, Mr Roger Jowell and Mr John Curtice. It says the root cause of Labour's electoral failure has been a sharp fall over the past 20 years in the number of voters who instinctively identify with the party. In 1970 they constituted 42 per cent of the electorate. In 1992 the proportion was 34 per cent. The main cause of the erosion was Labour's lurch to the left and the split with the SDP in the early 1980s. By contrast the proportion of the electorate which identifies itself as Conservative remained remarkably constant at 42 per cent. Basing its conclusions on detailed interviews with a carefully weighted sample of voters both before and after the 1992 election, the study says that the Conservatives started the campaign at least six points ahead of Labour. Any late swing was therefore much too small to make any significant difference to the outcome. The study also explodes the myth that the Tory tabloid newspapers won the election for Mr John Major. Conservative support among readers of the Tory tabloids fell three points during the election campaign while it rose one point among readers of the Labour-supporting Daily Mirror.

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts After the gilt market's positive reception to last week's Budget, tomorrow's auction should go like a dream. In practice, cover could disappoint. Not only has the market's strength made it hard for market-makers to build up short positions to absorb the Pounds 3bn issue, but the strength of demand for 10-year paper is also questionable. Domestic investors may be reluctant to switch out of longer-dated paper for a partly-paid issue which will leave them with unspent cash at the year end. Foreign investors have focused on short-dated issues in the hope of interest rate cuts. The unusually low spreads over continental markets may also limit demand. The market, though, brushed aside low cover ratios in both the June and September auctions. It may well be prepared to do so again. Reduced issuance prospects for next year, the chance of more rate cuts and low inflation all provide fundamental support.</p>

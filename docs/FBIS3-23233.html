			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report] </F>   [Text] Informed Palestinian sources have said the Tunis-  headquartered PLO leadership has issued stringent orders to its  armed cadres in the occupied territories to collect their  weapons and store them with reliable persons, and not to use  them in any fashion whatsoever.    The instructions were issued after the PLO leadership  received reports that some armed Fatah cadres were planning  massive reprisals in retaliation against the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre.    Sources close to the Hamas Movement have said the  Palestinian  leadership hopes Hamas will not carry out any military  operations at present, and that it will persist with the civil  disobedience campaign, contending that military operations at  present could undermine political gains.    The sources said Hamas halfheartedly responded to this  request, but said it cannot restrain its cadres inside the  occupied territories due to the monstrosity of the [Hebron]  massacre.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Caution on broadcast quotas European Commission officials responsible for European policy on culture and the broadcasting industry yesterday distanced themselves from comments this week that quotas designed to protect the European film and television industry could soon become a thing of the past. Advisers to Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, commissioner responsible for the audiovisual industry, are irritated that Mr Reinhard Buscher, a member of the industry cabinet, raised the prospect of technological changes in broadcasting making quotas impractical. Mr Pinheiro insists that quotas - which require at least half of all broadcasts shown on any channel to be European - will remain. However, the commission is looking at ways of altering the way the quotas are applied to reflect the development of specialised channels, such as a Disney channel, where the current quota rules are completely impractical. One possibility under consideration is to stipulate that broadcasters in Europe invest a certain amount of their profits in the European industry.</p>

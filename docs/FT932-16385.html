			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Continental/Pirelli Pirelli has come out of its Continental adventure rather better than it deserved. It will not be paid for its Continental shares until December, so the time value of money means the effective price is less than the DM250 it claims. But it has still obtained a hefty premium over yesterday's DM204 Continental closing price. That and the devaluation of the lira will produce a L140bn capital gain this year, although that is also not quite what it seems. The gain only arises because Pirelli wrote the holding down to a book value below DM200 a share. Since it originally paid over DM300, it has lost money overall. More baffling is the willingness of German institutions to buy Pirelli out at such an exorbitant price. The triumphalism of the finance minister of Lower Saxony suggests political pressures for a German solution were paramount. Nord/LB will finance its part of the rescue by issuing a bond convertible into Continental shares. But Continental paid no dividend for 1991, which raises questions about how it will cover the 6 per cent interest cost. Much of the deal remains obscure, in stark contrast to the more open corporate culture heralded by Daimler-Benz's New York listing. Pirelli's effort to grab control of Continental provided Germany with an incentive to introduce full shareholder democracy with the parallel safeguard of a takeover code. It is a pity that Deutsche Bank, which should have the best interests of the country's financial system at heart, orchestrated such an old-fashioned solution.</p>

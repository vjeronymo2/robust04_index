According to eyewitnesses, a television cameraman, while  filming Caldera's departure, approached a horse of the Honor  Guard escorting the presidential car, spooking the animal and  prompting it to rear.    According to sources close to the president, the president's  chauffeur was forced to brake abruptly to avoid hitting the  horse. In the mishap, Caldera received a blow so sharp that it  broke his pen into three pieces.    The president, who complained about pain in his ribs, will  be  examined by doctors at the Miraflores Palace, seat of the  Venezuelan Government.</p>

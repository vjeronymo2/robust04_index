			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Marketing gilts THE UNDERLYING message of the latest Bank of England survey of the gilt market is the same as that implied by the news that the Bank may allow gilts to be 'stripped'. It is that selling Pounds 50bn of gilts this year is going to be hard work. So the Bank and the Treasury, like modern marketing managers, are segmenting the market for UK government securities and devising versions to appeal to each constituency. Last year, overseas investors were wooed by making all the new stocks free of tax for them. Impulse buyers were offered 2.30 am opportunities to buy tap stocks, in the rallies that followed Mr Major's victory in the election and defeat in the ERM. Now, institutional investors may be offered synthetic zero-coupon gilts, if securities houses get approval to 'strip' the flow of interest payments from gilts. One potential difficulty - the settlement delays that accompanied the surge in retail investors' demand late last year - has been turned into a marketing advantage. The Bank leaned on gilt-edged market-makers to sort out the problem - a contrast with the much more protracted equity settlement problems at the time of Big Bang. Other innovations doubtless lie ahead, among them perhaps a recognition that when it comes to financing the deficit, the banks' money is a good as anyone else's. There are two ways, however, in which the Bank cannot afford to admit that the customer is always right. The survey repeats the Bank's opposition to regular, scheduled gilt auctions, presumably because of the inevitable crises of confidence if the authorities are tied to a rigid timetable. And the retail customer cannot be offered indefinitely the sure-fire capital gain provided by anticipated interest rate cuts. As last year demonstrates, this ensures eager demand. But, alas, with base rates already down, the scope for further cuts is limited. One figure in the Bank's report highlights the problems ahead. The degree to which gilts offered at auctions were covered by demand last year ranged from twice to 1 1/4 times, rather lower than in the year before. As that downward trend illustrates, there is more to financing the deficit than a thorough study of a marketing textbook.</p>

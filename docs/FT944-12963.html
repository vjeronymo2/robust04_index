			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family (The Pensions Scandal): Mugged by salesmen Mike Sutoris, a former teacher who now works in local government, got a multiple mugging from personal pension salesmen. The National Union of Teachers (NUT) has issued a High Court writ against the life companies involved. The teachers' scheme is one of the best in the country in terms of guaranteed benefits and annual pension increases. For those who move within the public sector and local government, it is possible to transfer the full value of benefits. Yet, Sutoris was advised in November 1987 to leave and start a retirement annuity contract  - the forerunner to personal pensions  - which took effect from early 1988. Later that year, he was advised to transfer his seven years' benefits out of the teachers' scheme to a personal plan. 'No mention was made of the guaranteed indexed pension I was giving up and the investment risks associated with personal pensions,' he said. 'I didn't realise I would lose out on the transfer  - if I had known, I would not have gone ahead.' On the salesman's advice, he opted out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), and his rebates of National Insurance contributions were channelled into a separate personal plan. Later, he was sold three more personal pensions to increase his regular premium policy in line with his salary increases. The NUT has a heavy caseload of similar cases. Debbie Smith, who works in the legal department at the union's headquarters, said: 'We have up to 100 complex cases like Mike's and our 10 regional offices have a similar case-load. Over 50 different life offices are involved.' Time is running short for some victims but the NUT has taken steps to protect these members. Smith explained: 'Where one of our members was sold a personal pension in 1988, we have issued High Court writs to protect them against the six-year breach of contract time limit.' Several other unions, including the GMB, the miners and the nurses, are co-ordinating cases. If you have not yet done anything about your transfer, ask your union if it will help.</p>

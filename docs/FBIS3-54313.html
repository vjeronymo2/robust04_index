			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ishaq al-Farhan, secretary general </F> of the Islamic Action Front in Jordan, by Salim Badawi; place  and date not given; from the "The Event" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Farhan] In fact, our opposition to Israel is an  opposition in principle. This is because we view Israel as a  mob of invaders who came from various parts of the world to  occupy a land that is not theirs and a homeland that is not  theirs. It has been the homeland of Arabs and Muslims for 14  centuries. The Jews who existed in Palestine at the beginning  of this century were a minority of no more than 5 percent. They  have lived peacefully with the Arabs and Muslims for 14  centuries. In principle, we are not against Judaism as a  religion nor against the Jews as a race. We are against a  country being occupied by foreigners. Those invaders are new  colonialists who were supported by Britain at the beginning of  the century and by the United States in the middle of the  century. Thus, the Zionist plan converged with the Western  colonialist plan to colonize Palestine. Therefore, in  principle, those are rejected people in our homeland.    [Badawi] So you are against any peaceful settlement in the  region?    [Al-Farhan] It is not like that. We are constant advocates  of peace, but not when our territory is occupied by force.  Therefore, the real solution to the Palestine question is to  allow the Jews who lived with us for 14 centuries to stay and to  evacuate to their own countries the Jews who came as invaders  from overseas and from over 70 countries in the world.  Indigenous Jews and their children and the Christians and  Muslims of Palestine would remain. The deported Palestinians,  who are over 4 million--not only the 400 deportees who returned  last year--should return to their country. Afterward, in a  democratic way, if the West is really democratic, the  Palestinians--Muslims, Christians, and Jews--should be left to  determine their future so that they would have equal  opportunities and would rule themselves by themselves.    [Badawi] Mr. Ishaq al-Farhan, in light of the results of the  Jordanian elections on the domestic level and in light of the  recent Geneva summit on the foreign level, do you not feel that  your opposing stand is being isolated? How do you expect your  activities to be affected?    [Al-Farhan] In fact, true democracy has room for both  supporters and opponents. We are a political party operating  under the Jordanian Political Parties Law and under the  Jordanian Charter and Constitution, which adopt democracy and  democratization which allow everybody to express their views no  matter how different they may be. We are neither permanent  rejectionists nor permanent supporters of the policy of any  government. Our opposition or support depends on stands  themselves. With respect to the Palestine question, we have our  known stand, which is widely respected. At the same time, we do  not resort to violence to impose our stands. Hence, we believe  that we are being logical with ourselves, and that others must  be logical with us. We do not have a problem here in Jordan  with the regime in terms of agreement or disagreement. This is  because we view matters in a practical and realistic manner. At  the same time, we act according to our constant and deep-rooted  policy. As for the regional or Western circles that want to  plot against us, we hope that they will understand the democracy  which they advocate, and leave us alone to resolve our problems  by ourselves.    [Badawi] So, what is the strategy of your future opposition.  In other words, what are you wagering on in the future to  reverse the current peaceful, negotiatory trend?    [Al-Farhan] We believe that as long as an inch of  Palestinian  territory is under occupation, the Palestinian resistance inside  the Palestinian territory will continue until the occupation is  removed from the Islamic Arab territories, headed by Jerusalem.  We believe that irrespective of the nature of the self-rule  that the Palestinians will attain, they will avoid any civil  wars or domestic disputes, especially if they adopt democracy  and shura among themselves so that they would act in harmony  with themselves and set a starting point for the building of  their future state, which would be supported by the neighboring  Arab countries, especially Jordan. We are wagering on the  assumption that proceeding from their colonialist and  expansionist logic, the Jews will try to impose their economic  and political hegemony on the region. Thus, they will be hated  in the region. After they failed to impose their military  hegemony, they will not be able to achieve their political,  economic, educational, and cultural objectives of a greater  Israel in the region. We are also wagering on the balances of  power. We have recently seen how the Russian power crumbled and  how Russia became a thing of the past. Also, we believe that  American and European public opinion will show more  understanding of our issue, especially if we hold fast and  explain this issue and continue to explain it for the next  decade. Then, the world military, political, and ideological  balances of power may change in our interest.</p>

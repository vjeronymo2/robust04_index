			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Threshold for registration set at Pounds 45,000 - VAT changes Customs and Excise yesterday announced a package of measures it described as a contribution to the government's deregulation policy and an aid to small businesses. In a statement, the excise said: 'The turnover threshold above which traders are required to register for VAT will rise from Pounds 37,600 to Pounds 45,000 from midnight, allowing up to 75,000 businesses to opt out of VAT if they wish.' Insolvent businesses will be helped to survive by relaxing the rules on VAT set-off, putting VAT debt on a similar footing to debt owed to other creditors. The minimum repayment supplement paid to traders when VAT refunds are unduly delayed by Customs and Excise will rise from Pounds 30 to Pounds 50 and the department will be allowed less time to investigate claims before becoming liable to repayment supplement. Businesses leasing cars to private taxi and self-drive hire firms and driving schools will be able to reclaim the VAT on cars purchased. This brings the VAT treatment of leased cars into line with that for cars purchased outright for private taxi firms etc. This is a business facilitation measure which is being introduced at the request of the leasing trade. The administrative arrangements for Gaming Machine Licence Duty will be restructured. Operators will be able to choose licence periods which suit their operational needs starting on a day of their choice rather than being tied to annual, half yearly, or quarterly periods. The law on excise will be modernised. The department's powers for making duty assessments will be modified, minor offences will be decriminalised and replaced by fixed civil penalties, and the department will have the option to treat fraudulent evasion as a civil matter. The jurisdiction of VAT tribunals will be extended to excise matters to hear traders' appeals against duty assessments and civil penalties. The jurisdiction of VAT tribunals will also be extended to provide a right of appeal for traders on customs matters. Compliance Cost Assessments are available for all the Customs deregulatory measures.

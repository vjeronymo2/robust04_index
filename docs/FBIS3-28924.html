In a meeting with  the leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties,  Hosokawa said, "Japan considers the best plan is through  dialogue, no matter what the situation is."    In Washington over the weekend, however, the prime minister  told reporters that Japan will take all possible measures to the  extent of Japanese law if the United Nations Security Council  proposes sanctions against Pyongyang.    Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social  Democratic Party, told reporters Monday that imposing sanctions  against North Korea would be counterproductive.    Kubo proposed that a resolution be sought through the  friendly connections between the North Korean Workers' Party and  the Chinese Communist Party. He stressed further that there is  no way of knowing what kind of ill effects sanctions would have  on both North Korea and Japan.    "Even though negotiations for establishing diplomatic  relations between Japan and North Korea have broken down,  efforts to improve relations would open the path" to resolving  the nuclear issue, Kubo said.</p>

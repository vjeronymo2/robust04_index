			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Property: Grandeur returns - Cadogan's Place Under the Grosvenor estate's settlement with Westminster council, No 7 Upper Brook Street was the first TOP building in Mayfair to be converted back to the grand town house it once was. Now, it has come back to the market for Pounds 1.395m for a 62-year lease (from Egerton: 071-493 0676). Also on the Grosvenor estate are the conversions to flats at 130 Park Lane. Originally, this was made up of two of the bow-fronted houses that gave the Lane a special flavour - and good views over Hyde Park - before the big hotels and apartment blocks arrived. Five flats are for sale at prices from Pounds 2m to Pounds 4.5m for 74-year leases (from Wetherell: 071-493 6935; and De Groot Collis: 071-235 8090). Some of the Mayfair buildings that will convert to residences remain offices while the sitting tenants negotiate terms, wait for their appeals against conversion to be heard, or for their leases to run out. But an unusual variation on offices going back to residences is Flat K at 3/4 Balfour Place; its lease allows it to be used as either an office or a residence. Egerton is seeking Pounds 345,000 for a 46-year lease. The present owners and their predecessors have used it as a residence. Another large freeholder in Mayfair is the BP Pension Fund, which also has made an agreement about TOPs with Westminster council. The fund owns 30 acres, mostly on the west side of Berkeley Square, which were bought from the Berkeley Estate in 1967. Later, it acquired properties around Bruton Street, east of the square. In its redevelopment at 33 and 35 Hill Street and 27-30 Hays Mews, two flats and some mews units are still available at prices from Pounds 320,000. The agent is Debenham Tewson Residential (071-408 1161). South of the Thames, a new four-storey office block in Furmage Street SW18 awaits planning permission to make 16 flats. The developers envisage it will take three months from receiving permission to partition the units and put in the plumbing. Inquiries to the Battersea office of Winkworth (071-228 9265), which also has just agreed the sale of an office made into a house in Lavender Walk SW11. On the market at Pounds 105,000, it went for Pounds 95,000. to a first-time buyer from the City. Its special feature is a vast reception room, 44 ft x 15.5 ft. Tuesday sees the publication of a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on Offices into Flats. It will discuss further the feasibility of converting and re-generating inner city areas.</p>

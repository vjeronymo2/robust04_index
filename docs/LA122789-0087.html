			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> CITY'S PAST COMES ALIVE AT MUSEUM  </P> <P> When Evelyn Ojeda posed with her Tustin Union High School basketball team 58  years ago, she never dreamed that one day the photograph would hang in a  museum.  </P> <P> The 1931 photograph is on display at the Tustin Area Historical Museum, where  Ojeda works as a volunteer. The school, incidentally, was demolished more than  20 years ago.  </P> <P> The museum features not only early photos, but also artifacts and other items  that allow visitors to glimpse early life in Tustin.  </P> <P> On display are tools and furniture from the city's early agricultural days,  fossils, a Spanish saddle and branding iron from the county's rancho period,  and Indian artifacts.  </P> <P> A 100-year-old time clock used at a local fruit company still rings when  punched. A peanut-roasting machine that once stood in a pool hall is now used  as a donation box for the museum, where admission is free but gifts are  accepted.  </P> <P> Some days are busier than others. During the city's annual chili cook-off last  year, 350 visitors toured the 1,627-square-foot museum, Ojeda said. Other days  only a few people show up.  </P> <P> Tim Fruehe and Robert Guevara wandered through the museum recently after  driving by it many times on their lunch break from a Santa Ana company.  </P> <P> "We love looking at the old houses in the area and were curious to see the old  photos and stuff," said Fruehe, an artist from Fullerton.  </P> <P> "It's pretty interesting," Guevara said. "They should really advertise it so  people know about it."  </P> <P> The museum was founded in 1976 as an outgrowth of the U.S. Bicentennial  celebration, said Carol Jordan, one of the founders. Originally housed in the  city's old police building, it moved in 1979 to its present home in the Knights  of Pythias building, at El Camino Real and Main Street.  </P> <P> One of the museum's featured items is the city's first fire truck, a converted  1912 Buick with wooden-spoked wheels and a hand-cranked siren. Sam Tustin, the  son of city founder Columbus Tustin, donated the Buick to the Chamber of  Commerce. It was used by the city's volunteers to battle blazes from about 1922  to 1936, and later was used in parades.  </P> <P> Even older firefighting equipment is on display. A chemical tank on wooden  wheels was pushed to fires by firemen or towed by a car. When the tank was  inverted, chemicals spilled into the water and a reaction created the pressure  needed to force the water through a hose.  </P> <P> Pictures show the city's early residents and their homes. When incorporated in  1927, the town had 900 residents.  </P> <P> A photo of Tustin in the 1950s depicts a square mile of houses and shops  surrounded by orange groves.  </P> <P> The museum, which is supported by book sales, rental assistance from the city  and dues from Tustin Area Historical Society members as well as donations, is  open from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays and 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. the  first Saturday of each month. Group tours are given by appointment. SHANNON  SANDS  </P></p>

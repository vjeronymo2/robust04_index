			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television If you thought such traditional English characteristics as irony, fairness, a vague but nagging sense of decency and (for better or worse) a love of animals were vanishing, Short Stories: Pet Patients (8pm, Channel 4) should reassure you of their survival. I am unsure whether the Barleycorn family are real or intended as a pilot for a future sitcom. Their south London council flat is a haven for dogs, cats, rodents, reptiles and two pigs. This is deliberate. They like it. They love it. So do the devoted workers of the local Blue Cross animal hospital. It throws up as much drama, comedy, tear-jerking and social issues as Casualty. Maurice Melzac's film is quirky, original, sharp-eyed and unsentimental about its dramatis personae, however many legs they have. How different from the callous inhabitants of Chicago who flush unwanted pets down the loo. Alligator (11.35pm, BBC1) makes an entertaining pendant to the above; a 1980 feature film with a third-league cast but something of a cult for post-closing time viewing.</p>

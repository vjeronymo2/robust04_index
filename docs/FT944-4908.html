			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / International Company News: Tokyo exchange acts to stem the foreign exodus - Reforms aim at emerging economy companies The Tokyo Stock Exchange is set to make the first serious response by Japanese authorities to the haemorrhage of international financial business from Tokyo. Later this month the TSE will announce sweeping changes to its notoriously prohibitive rules that prevent many foreign companies from listing. The aim is to revitalise the virtually moribund foreign companies' section of the exchange. But the reforms will also mark a shift in strategy by the exchange in its development of Tokyo's role as a capital market. It will target companies from the emerging economies, rather those from Europe and the US which have been deserting the exchange. The exchange's foreign section has been the most startling casualty of the dearth of equity trading on the stock market in the past few years. In the 1980s, as listings on international exchanges became fashionable for companies wanting to be seen as 'global', big companies flocked to Tokyo to gain direct access to the world's fastest growing pool of capital. The total number of foreign companies listed on the TSE mushroomed from a handful in the early 1980s to 127 by 1990. That influx was reflected in the busy trade that the shares attracted - on average more than 800,000 changed hands daily in 1989 at the peak of Japan's financial boom. However, since then a Tokyo stock exchange listing has lost its lustre. In the past year names like Eastman Kodak, Scott Paper and British Gas have left the exchange and by next summer the total of listed foreign companies is expected to be below 90. Most fugitives have cited the lack of activity in their shares. Trading volume has fallen from an average of about 2m shares a day in 1989, to fewer than 180,000 so far this year. Most days many listed companies report no trades at all. With no immediate prospects of a recovery in the Japanese equity market, the costs of maintaining a listing - up to Y10m (Dollars 100,000) per year - no longer match the supposed benefits. But instead of trying to win back the departing big-name foreigners, the TSE's efforts will be concentrated on attracting new companies to replace them. Although the exchange will not admit it publicly, it is clear that it believes the future for its international section lies in constructing a financial workshop producing capital for companies from emerging economies, and not in providing a boutique for the largest names in global business. There is growing scepticism in financial circles about the advantages for a large international corporation in having its shares listed on a foreign stock exchange. 'Why should they?' says a senior executive at a foreign bank in Tokyo. 'There is absolutely no need for a large European or American company to be listed anywhere other than in London or New York. If a Japanese investor wants to buy British Gas shares, he can do so directly by trading in London.' In an increasingly global market, facilitated by off-hours trading, the much-vaunted advantages of a listing in Tokyo are marginal. However, for new companies in Asia the advantages of a foreign listing are much more obvious. Double-digit growth rates in Asia are spawning thousands of businesses seeking access to capital. Their own national stock markets, although a good starting point, lack the international profile of one of the large exchanges. What has most alarmed Japanese authorities in the last year is that many of these Asian businesses - including large newly-privatised Chinese entities and south-east Asian manufacturers - have chosen Hong Kong or New York. The main reason is that most of them are excluded by Tokyo's listing requirements - which include a ruling that requires companies to have assets of at least Y200bn, and profits no lower than Y20bn for three years. The rule changes to be approved this month will remove most of those barriers. The TSE's aim is to become Asia's main stock market. 'These reforms can pave the way for at least 200 east Asian companies to join the exchange in the next few years,' said Mr Mitsuhide Yamaguchi, president of the TSE, last month. There are doubts whether the strategy will work. International brokers in Tokyo point out that company decisions about where to list are made mainly on the type of investor it wants to attract - and they may not necessarily favour Japan. But the TSE's moves are widely welcomed. 'Any measures that improve access to Japan's financial markets in this more difficult trading environment are to be loudly applauded,' says Mr Peter Fenichel, president of BZW Securities in Tokyo. The proof of the new openness will be in the number of Asian companies that now turn to Tokyo. But that is not entirely within the TSE's control. The bulk of the regulations that have stifled business come from the ministry of finance - a tax on equity-trading is perhaps the most prohibitive. Unless the ministry decides to make further efforts to liberalise the market, the success of the TSE's reforms will be limited.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          TOKYO STOCK EXCHANGE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Year   Foreign companies   Shares         Value   Average daily   Value          listed on TSE     traded        (Y000)      volume      (Y000)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991        125         150,958,075   520,571,522    613,651   2,116,144 1992        119          86,239,391   157,011,436    349,147     635,674 1993        110          59,561,651   103,517,369    886,571     420,802 1994*        97          36,747,983    63,622,732    178,388     308,841  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * To October  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Tokyo Stock Exchange  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

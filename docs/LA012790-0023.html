			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBERT'S PERFORMANCE NOT WHAT NHL NEEDED  </P> <P> It was nice to see network TV finally recognize the NHL by televising the  All-Star game. However, if the purpose was to help expand awareness of this  sport to the American public, NBC made one drastic mistake. By having Marv  Albert do the play-by-play, more potential fans were probably scared away due  to his ineptness.  </P> <P> MICHAEL I. CORNFIELD, Brea  </P></p>

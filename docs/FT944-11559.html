			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Forte makes Pounds 175m placing - Proceeds will help fund the acquisition of Meridien hotels Forte yesterday announced a Pounds 175m share placing to help pay for its acquisition of Meridien hotels, the international chain which is 57 per cent owned by Air France. Forte said the placing by UBS, at 227p a share, was completed by 11am yesterday, with shares purchased by both existing and new shareholders. The placing price of the 78m new shares represented a 4 per cent discount on Thursday's closing price of 236 1/2 p. The shares closed down 3p yesterday at 233 1/2 p. Forte said the formal acquisition of Meridien was expected to take place by next Thursday. The group said that acceptances had reached 90 per cent and should rise further by next week. Air France announced in September that it preferred Forte's bid for Meridien to that of Accor, the French hotel group. The acquisition of Meridien's 54 hotels was a significant victory for Forte, doubling its international portfolio of first class establishments. Before completing the deal, Forte had to wait for the approval of France's Commission de Privatisation, which has now been given. The complicated nature of the completion process means that Forte will probably end up paying less for Meridien than the FFr1.9bn (Pounds 220m) originally envisaged. Forte will have to pay only 80 per cent of the FFr1.08bn due to Air France on completion next week. The remainder will be paid early next year, but is conditional on how many hotel management contracts Meridien retains and on detailed structural surveys of the hotels. The minority Meridien shareholders have been offered a choice. They can either receive payment on the same basis as Air France or they can receive final payment next week. If they opt for the latter they will receive slightly less than if they wait for the final instalment next year. The Pounds 175m raised by yesterday's placing represents the amount that Forte believes will be payable next week. The final payment to be made early next year would be funded from borrowings or hotel disposals, Forte said. When its victory over Accor was announced, Forte said it had three options in funding the Meridien purchase. The first was to use existing borrowing facilities. The second was to arrange bridging finance until Forte sold its 25 per cent stakes in Gardner Merchant, the contract catering group, and Alpha Airports, the airline catering company. The third was an equity raising exercise. Forte said yesterday that the first had been rejected because it would have resulted in an increase in gearing. The second was excluded because Forte wished to retain flexibility over when it disposed of its stakes in the two companies. Forte said it decided on a placing rather than a rights issue because of the relatively small size of the equity offering and because a rights issue would have required a more substantial discount.</p>

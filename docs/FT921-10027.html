			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share losses increase in light selling ANOTHER negative trading session in UK equities yesterday rounded off a week of persistent gloom for share prices. London extended its losses in late trading in the wake of poor employment figures from the US, although the Dow Average was still four points up when the UK markets closed for the weekend. Government bonds lost about  3/8 of a point in nervous trading, while the international blue chip equities were unsettled by weakness in the US dollar. Uncertainty over the outlook for Wall Street, where the Dow turned down after London closed, continued to overhang confidence in the UK market. The domestic scene also remained confused as the latest UK public opinion polls indicated that the Conservative and Labour parties are still close together in the public ratings. The big institutions stayed out of the equity market, and a relatively high total of Seaq-recorded bargains indicated some parcel-passing by the marketmaking firms, which were busy yesterday picking up the pieces at the end of a somewhat unsuccessful two week equity trading account. Seaq volume advanced to 596.2m shares from Thursday's 546.2m. But Thursday's value total of retail business remained unimpressive at Pounds 830m. Equities opened slightly easier as the overnight Seaq ticker disclosed further equity sales, and an attempt to steady behind the stock index futures failed to hold. Share prices were soon slipping away, with the brewery sector upset by weakness in Bass on news overnight that it has filed a lawsuit in the US regarding its Dollars 2.23bn purchase of the Holiday Inn chain. Although there was little sign of institutional selling, traders sensed that the sellers were not far away. The poor US jobs data, seen as a sign that the US economy is weaker than believed, depressed share prices in London, although the pressure was eased by hopes that the news might spark another cut in US interest rates. At the close, the FT-SE Index was 17.1 down at 2,517.2, virtually the low of the day. The Index has fallen by 2 per cent (54 points) this week, giving back almost all the gain achieved in the previous week. At last night's close, the Footsie showed a gain of under seven points over the two week account. Although London money market rates were easier yesterday, the stock market's hopes for an early cut in base rates remained suppressed. Among the interest rate-orientated stocks, retailers and building construction groups remained out of favour. After falling away sharply, customer, or retail, business in equities has revived strongly and is now well above daily averages for last year.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has revised paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1)(ii) of the final rule, which apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to situations where any shear pin is missing or has migrated, and any shear pin retainer or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shear pin retainer attaching part is missing. In such cases, an FAA-approved repair is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to be installed; the FAA has determined that these approved repairs will be such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no further inspections for installation of parts will be necessary once the approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair is installed. The FAA has revised these paragraphs of the final rule to reflect this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the FAA has added new paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(1)(iii), which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that, in situations where the shear pin retainers or shear pin retainer attaching parts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are missing or loose, and the shear pin has not migrated, operators may accomplish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repair in accordance with procedures specified as ``Condition II'' in McDonnell Douglas Alert  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service Bulletin A54&hyph;31, Revision 1, dated June 3, 1993. Subsequent to this repair, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further inspections for installation of parts are required. These paragraphs have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added in order to provide operators with an additional repair procedure that may be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lieu of obtaining prior FAA-approval of repairs (which was the only option provided for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the proposal).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These same commenters contend that the 15-day compliance time for the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection required by proposed paragraph (b) is not warranted for certain airplanes. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters point out that a tightness check was accomplished on airplanes in Groups V  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and VI (as specified in the referenced McDonnell Douglas service bulletin) prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery; therefore, an initial inspection for installation of the subject parts should not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for these airplanes. The commenters request that, for these airplanes, only a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``re-verification'' for tightness be required within 18 months. Additionally, the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point out that an initial visual inspection for installation of parts was accomplished on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes in Group III and IV prior to delivery; therefore, the compliance time for initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection for installation of parts required by this proposed rule should be extended. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggest extending the initial compliance time to 60 days, since this is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time recommended by the manufacturer in the referenced service bulletin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA concurs in part with the commenter's requests. The FAA acknowledges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it is appropriate to revise paragraph (b) of the final rule to differentiate between the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the various groups of airplanes specified in the referenced service bulletin:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for airplanes in Groups III and IV, the FAA does not concur with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter's request to extend the initial compliance time for the inspection for installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of parts on these airplanes. While these airplanes may have been inspected prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery, and while the manufacturer's revised service bulletin recommends a repetitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection interval of 60 days, the FAA points out that the inspection procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described in that service bulletin have not been mandated previously. Since the revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service bulletin was released over a year ago, there is no way to guarantee that affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes have been repetitively inspected prior to the issuance of this final rule. In light of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this, the FAA considers a compliance time of 15 days necessary in order to ensure that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplishment of what may be the first repetitive inspection for some airplanes is carried  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out in a timely manner. However, the FAA has revised the compliance terms of paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) to provide a ``grace period'' for operators of airplanes that may have been visually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (re-)inspected recently. The final rule now reflects a compliance time for the initial visual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inspection as ``within 15 days after the effective date of the AD, or prior to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accumulation of 60 days since the last visual inspection, whichever occurs later.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for airplanes in Groups V and VI, the FAA concurs that these airplanes need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not be subject to the initial inspection for installation of parts as required by paragraph (b),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as long as repetitive verifications for tightness are conducted. Therefore, the FAA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised paragraph (b) by adding a new paragraph (b)(2), which addresses these airplanes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and allows them the option of either repetitively inspecting for installation of parts (as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally proposed), or conducting a verification for tightness within 18 months after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last verification was performed. If operators of these airplanes elect to perform the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification for tightness, it must be repeated every 18 months until the terminating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification is accomplished in accordance with paragraph (d) of the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These same commenters request that proposed paragraph (c) be revised to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that accomplishment of the verification for tightness of the shear pin retainer attaching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parts terminates the requirement for the repetitive visual inspections for installation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these same parts required by paragraph (a) and (b). The FAA concurs and has revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c) of the final rule accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters also request that proposed paragraph (d) be revised to extend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the compliance time for accomplishment of the terminating modification from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 3 years to 5 years. The commenters consider this modification to be only an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``improvement change,'' and operators should be allowed to install it during a convenient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and regularly scheduled maintenance period in order to avoid special scheduling of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes and additional associated costs. The FAA does not concur. In developing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance time for the terminating action, the FAA considered not only the safety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implications, but the manufacturer's recommendations, the availability of required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification parts, and the practical aspects of an orderly modification of the fleet. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of all of these items, the FAA determined that 3 years is an appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interval that will coincide with regularly scheduled maintenance periods (``C'' checks) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the majority of the affected operators. However, under the provisions of paragraph (f) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the compliance time if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

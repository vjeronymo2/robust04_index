			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Petric: "Tuta and Djapic Are Threatening"] </F>   [Text] The people around Tuta Naletilic have taken the law  into their own hands. They demonstrated on Djapic what they have  been doing for a long time throughout Siroki Brijeg--violence.  They are collecting taxes from businessmen, dealing in drugs and  weapons, and stealing and reselling automobiles.    Spokesman Ante Djapic and the rest of the leadership of the  Croatian Rights Party [HSP], who were beaten up before the  beginning of the HSP forum in Siroki Brijeg, according to  witnesses' statements, still fared well. Specifically, just when  the forum was supposed to start in a Siroki Brijeg hotel, from  among about 100 curious people who had come to that party's  meeting, which was expected to be like any other, a group of  about 20 young men came out of the audience and assaulted the  HSP members, almost beating them to death with tables, chairs,  hammers, and sticks. When the uproar and the brawl began most of  those present, seeing what was going on, simply fled from the  hotel and did not appear in the city again throughout the entire  evening.    Nor did they appear even on later evenings after that event  in the cafes and restaurants of Siroki Brijeg, which were  otherwise open until late at night (after midnight) because of  the pleasant weather; instead, patrons slowly begin to disperse  as early as twilight. At 2200 the patrons can already be counted  on one's fingers, and half an hour later there is no longer  anyone either in the cafes or on the streets. Fear has seized  Siroki Brijeg, but if you ask someone what really happened -- a  lot of people see it happen -- you will get silence. The  situation is reminiscent of the atmosphere that prevailed in  Sicily before the Italian Government decided to settle accounts  openly with the Mafia.  <H5>  It Started With Kraljevic </H5>   The event in the Siroki Brijeg hotel also has its  prehistory,  however. It was drawn out for a long time in the media, but it  started with the arrival of Djapic in Herzegovina after the  murder of Blazo Kraljevic, a general in the HOS [Croatian  Defense Forces], and another eight members of his escort. At  that time it was officially announced that someone from  Kraljevic's escort had been the first to open fire against  special forces at a checkpoint in Krusevo, close to Mostar, and  then all nine HOS members and one of the HVO [Croatian Defense  Council] special forces members died in the shooting. In the  media, and several times in the Assembly, Djapic publicly  (without names, admittedly) called upon the legal system of  Herceg-Bosna, but also Croatia, to bring those who had committed  the murder to justice.    Furthermore, he constantly linked the murder of HSP leader  Ante Paradzik (killed at a similar checkpoint in Sesvete) and  the murder of Blazo Kraljevic and the eight HOS members, also  saying that someone "powerful" in the Croatian Defense Ministry  was behind it all. He threatened several times that he would  publish the names of those who had committed the murder in  Krusevo near Mostar. Since that threat mainly applied to Tuta  Naletilic and the members of his battalion, Tuta, upon Djapic's  arrival in Herzegovina, responded by threatening him not to  appear in Siroki Brijeg, according to Djapic.    Djapic did not pay attention, and his two forums in Grude  and  Tomislavgrad were relatively well-attended (Djapic's HSP does  not enjoy a high reputation in Herzegovina, he believes) and  peaceful, with only tense speakers, which is also usual for  other parties. Djapic and his escort also appeared at the Siroki  Brijeg hotel. Tuta apparently kept his promise, and so in just a  few minutes his people, rushing out of the audience, created  scenes that revolted those who witnessed them. They say that it  was like detective movies. About 20 thugs simply began to beat  the people sitting at the table with everything at hand (and the  clubs that they brought with them), hitting all parts of their  bodies, heads, legs, and backs. Those who fell immediately,  bloodied, received a few more blows, and the rest screamed and  called for help. No one came to their assistance, however,  because it is known in Siroki Brijeg that anyone who opposes  Tuta's group is risking his life.  <H5>  Minister Also Beaten Up </H5>   On the morning of the next day, in front of the same hotel,  Herceg-Bosna defense minister Vlado Soljic, himself a resident  of Siroki Brijeg, was also beaten up. Some people say that he  was struck quite accidentally, because he was passing close to  the uproar, which had continued since the previous evening. This  was all followed by a communique from the Herceg-Bosna Defense  Ministry's Political Administration, which turned things around:  Djapic and his companions were accused of wanting to start new  conflicts between Croats and Muslims and prevent implementation  of the Washington agreement. The kind of communique involved is  sufficiently indicated by the fact that not a single Muslim has  ever lived in Siroki Brijeg, either before this war or after  World War II, so it is quite unclear how Djapic could have done  anything like that.    It is clear, however, to both Herceg-Bosna Defense Minister  Soljic and the Political Administration and to the residents of  Herzegovina, especially the residents of Siroki Brijeg, what is  going on. The group that has gathered around an individual  identified as a criminal by German authorities (Tuta Naletilic)  has taken justice and the law into its own hands. It was not  only the one that carried out the order to execute Blazo  Kraljevic and his escort; the group also recently started a war  between the Siroki Brijeg and Ljubuska municipalities by  kidnapping from the police a soldier who had previously killed a  member of Tuta's group in a mutual clash, destroying the  Ljubuska, Citluk, and Mostar prison in the process, and, after  torturing him in ways that are not appropriate to describe, blew  him up with dynamite.    Now they have demonstrated with Djapic what they have been  doing for a long time now around Siroki Brijeg and other  Herzegovina municipalities where they dare to go--violence. They  collect taxes from private entrepreneurs, deal in drugs and  weapons, and steal cars, change the documentation, and resell  them. Everything good that this unit did in defending Croatian  territory from the aggressor has been canceled out by these  outbreaks of violence and lawlessness in Siroki Brijeg.  <H5>  Shame Because of Crime </H5>   General Roso himself also faced elimination several times.  His life is guarded by his battalion; otherwise the  assassination attempts, such as the ones that occured when he  decided that, with the new HVO structure, private armies would  be destroyed, would be repeated. Roso disbanded Tuta's unit, but  its remnants are still active--Djapic is right about  that--probably under the protection of some "more powerful"  individual in Zagreb.    The story of Herzegovina lawlessness ends here, and the  shame  of people born in western Herzegovina because of what has  happened begins. Until now it had never happened before, even in  remote history, that Herzegovinians have been ashamed precisely  because of such events and because of the authorities that are  either tolerating or are impotent to eliminate those groups. The  team that, by tolerating crime and gangs of thieves like that,  has turned Herzegovina into a primitive province and has reduced  people who previously earned an honest living to poverty or  turned them to smuggling and fraud, is responsible for  everything that is happening.    As far as Djapic is concerned, his visit to Herzegovina is  perhaps one more attempt at political provocation, which the HSP  has been fostering so carefully since the beginning of the war  in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, from the creation of  parallel armies and violent terrorist incursions into the  building on Starcevic Square in Zagreb to accusations to the  international public that the Croatian authorities are allegedly  threatening human rights. In that context the visit to  Herzegovina also served Djapic for one more attack against the  Croatian leadership. On the other hand, it is good that it  happened to a political figure, because it will arouse the media  and possibly force people from Herzegovina to put an end to  those who, by encouraging lawlessness, are persistently  weakening the defense of Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is as  if the same adviser simultaneously sent Djapic to Herzegovina  and ordered Tuta's "ex-cons."</p>

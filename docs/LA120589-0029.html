			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> RETELLING AN OLD STORY IN 'JOURNEY TO AMERICA'  </P> <P> "When your grandfather came over on the boat. . . ." So the story began about  our immigrant relatives, and in the back of our young minds, we had to wonder  if it was all true. Memories color, exaggerate and romanticize the past, which  is why we need history. Award-winning documentary film maker Charles Guggenheim  appears to have been so taken by his own family's immigrant story, as well as  the need to visualize history, that he has made a small career out of the  subject.  </P> <P> First was "The Making of Liberty," for PBS, about the creation of the Statue of  Liberty, the symbol of immigrant hope. Now, he has assembled and edited what  must have been endless miles of archival footage into "Journey to America," for  PBS' "The American Experience" (tonight at 10, Channel 28). The romance is  gone; all that is left is cold, hard history.  </P> <P> The reasons for making the journey to America were far more complex than simply  an escape from poverty. With a minimum of voice-over narration and a maximum of  voice-over by the immigrants themselves (well over a dozen were interviewed),  Guggenheim shows that sheer adventure and freedom of religious belief drove  people here as much as the desire to make a buck. Still, the images of grinding  degradation on the plains of Eastern Europe, contrasting with the splendor of  the first view of the Manhattan skyline, speak volumes about America's real and  projected identity as the land "where the streets are paved with gold."  </P> <P> Underlying everything in the film is a drama that has now fairly much played  itself out in American life -- class struggle. The poor immigrant rode like a  sardine in the ship's steerage section. If he wasn't identified as unacceptable  for political or health reasons, he made it through the vast Ellis Island  processing facility -- likely with a new Americanized name given him by a  customs official.  </P> <P> Then, if he was lucky, he landed a job in the New York ghettos, or the huge  Chicago slaughterhouses, or the mines of Appalachia or the Far West, where his  son worked alongside him. It was in these conditions that a radicalized  socialism took root in America, but this is a chapter of history Guggenheim  omits.  </P> <P> Not omitted is the fact that seven-day work weeks, 10 people to a single  apartment and general discrimination against the new immigrants dissolved their  own ethnic and nationalist differences, despite the urge to re-create the old  country in the new cities. They became Americanized. Today's popular fears of  Third World immigration look, in light of Guggenheim's film, like a sad repeat  of an old story.  </P></p>

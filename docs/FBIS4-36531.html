			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "A Step on a Long Road"] </F>   [Text] The results of the tripartite  Jordanian-U.S.-Israeli committee in Washington -- with regard to  the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- are considered a step on a long  road. This step could lead to achieving tangible progress in  the peace process if the Israeli intentions are honest and if  the Israeli leaders give momentum to the requirements of this  process.    If these results can be seen as a turning point in a  negotiating track that has lagged behind for several months,  this will be a beginning surrounded by all kinds of dangers. At  the front of these dangers is Israel's possible return to its  traditional course known for its evasion of requirements,  maneuvering over texts and words, and attempting to gain time.  We still remember well those Israeli methods.    In light of all this, we must not be overoptimistic or  propagate peace scenarios and bilateral or regional cooperation  plans before everything becomes clear. That is, we must not be  so before Israel rids itself of the mentality that it is the  dominating force, and before it agrees on restoring all  legitimate and recognized rights.    Therefore, we view the results of the tripartite meetings  and  the results they produced -- in terms of the agreement on a  detailed agenda for the Jordanian-Israeli talks -- as a first  step on a long way and the beginning for all possibilities,  including positive possibilities. This will be achieved if  Israel's intentions are honest and if the spirit of  reconciliation and peace triumphs over the spirit of hegemony  and military and ethical superiority.</p>

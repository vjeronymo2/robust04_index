			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'ROAD RAIDERS': DERIVATIVE LOOK AT WAR AS FUN  </P> <P> Never mind this "MASH" and "Tour of Duty" and "China Beach" malarkey. Remember  when war was fun?  </P> <P> No? Well, the two-hour made-for-TV movie/series pilot "The Road Raiders," a  World War II action-comedy (tonight at 8 on Channels 2 and 8), will do its  horn-tootinest best to remind you of the days when men were men, gals were  compliant and the Japanese were to be greeted with lead, not real-estate bills  of sale. Forget all that war-is-hell revisionism. "Road Raiders" brings back  the happy-go-lucky fantasy days of yore when war was all about raising hell.  </P> <P> Indeed, it seems like a creaky artifact from 15 or 20 years ago, back when  Hollywood was busily churning out nostalgic product about the "good" wars to  take our minds off the not-so-great one. The only updated element marking "Road  Raiders" as distinctly a product of the 1980s is the strangely familiar modern  costume worn by hero Bruce Boxleitner -- a white jacket over a white T-shirt,  along with a 6 o'clock shadow. Well, it was shot in Florida.  </P> <P> Florida is doubling here for the Philippines, where Boxleitner -- as Capt.  Rhodes, an irreverent ex-officer on the run after being unjustly accused of  being a traitor -- is trying to cajole his way out of that no-man's-land during  the Japanese invasion. Impersonating the recently deceased officer who was  trying to haul him in, he accidentally finds himself in command of a ragtag  bunch of military "oddballs, castoffs and misfits" -- who will, inevitably, end  up effectively saving the allied forces.  </P> <P> The chief perpetrator here is executive producer Glen A. Larson, who also came  up with the derivative story, co-wrote the derivative teleplay and even  co-wrote the derivative theme music, which sounds like a bad dream John  Williams would try to shake off. Richard Lang directed in the most perfunctory  fashion. Our suggestion: A fall season in the brig for the whole lot of them.  CHRIS WILLMAN  </P></p>

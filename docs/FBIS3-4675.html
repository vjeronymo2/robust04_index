			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hisahiko Okazaki, former ambassador to Thailand, </F> from the "Seiron" column: "Pessimistic Prospects for Japan-U.S.  Relations" ]    [Text]Economic Prospects Remain Uncertain    I am absolutely unable to remain silent about what is  happening.    The economic framework talks have broken down, and the  United  States is preparing to impose sanctions against Japan. The yen  is also appreciating. While the yen exchange rate is determined  by the economic fundamentals on the long term, the United States  has no intention at all to restrain yen appreciation, and there  are reports that it is even secretly applauding Japan's  predicament as a result of a strong yen.    The Japanese economy, which has just shown feeble signs of  an  upturn at the beginning of 1994, is now faced again with total  uncertainty. The breakdown of the framework talks will surely  bring enormous damage to the national economy and the people's  livelihood.    Who is to blame for what happened? In the first place, was  such a scenario really inevitable? I believe it could have been  avoided.    The framework talks are not a venue for discussing numerical  targets alone. There are three areas of negotiation:  macroeconomic policy (that is, economic stimulation measures),  microeconomic policy (that is, numerical targets for specific  sectors), and Japan-U.S. cooperation in global issues, such as  environment and population.    With regard to global cooperation, although this has only  been reported on in an obscure section of the newspapers, Japan  and the United States were able to reach a satisfactory  agreement.    As to microeconomic policy, there was little possibility of  reaching an agreement. This issue derived from the fact that at  the Miyazawa-Clinton talks in 1993, the two leaders had somehow  hammered out a rhetorical compromise although they really had  different things in mind. Nevertheless, the U.S. argument was  not persuasive under the principle of free trade. Even in the  United States, economic experts were mostly opposed to the U.S.  position. During the bilateral negotiations up to late 1993,  the USTR was the only one taking a tough position, while the  other economic departments in the U.S. Government were even  embarrassed to say such things to Japan. They thought Japan  would never compromise under the circumstances. The  negotiations were going nowhere. However, in January, after the  United States consolidated its position on the negotiations with  Japan, naturally, it adopted a unified tough line. At that  point, even if an agreement could be reached in the  microeconomic field, it would have amounted to nothing more than  Japan sharing the pains with the United States.    Therefore, the only way to save the framework talks was in  the macroeconomic area. In fact, the Japanese and U.S.  negotiators I contacted were saying, "If only Japan can satisfy  the United States in the macroeconomic aspect...." I had  believed all along that Japan would do something in this area.  I am not really an expert in economics, and it was not an area  that I should be meddling in. Moreover, I thought, saying that  economic stimulation measures were necessary in consideration of  relations with the United States might have the wrong effect.  So I refrained from saying anything.  <H5>  Large-Scale Tax Cut Could Have Been the Way Out </H5>   Specifically, at that time, Japan was talking about a tax  cut  of from 5 to 7 trillion yen. Even if this was not increased to  8 trillion yen, 7 trillion yen plus something extra would  certainly have enabled the United States to boast of winning a  major concession from Japan.    If an agreement could be reached in both the macroeconomic  and global aspects, it would have been possible to put off the  microeconomic area for future discussion. Since the U.S.  economy has entered a recovery period, it was fully reasonable  to expect that in six months' time, the United States would be  in a mood of "not taking such a tough stand against Japan."  Furthermore, since even U.S. economists are divided on the  numerical targets, Japan could expect that the momentum for  pursuing these targets would be lost. In addition, Japan would  be given six months' time to actively campaign in such a  direction. To say the least, since there was no hope for  solving the microeconomic issues, it was the only strategy left.    I thought that was what the government would do because that  was the only possible way. In fact, even now, when I ask the  officials involved in the negotiations, they reply that, "Since  it was impossible to agree in microeconomics, there was supposed  to be a solution in macroeconomics." In other words, the proper  strategy was not implemented even though everybody knew about it.    But why? The original plan to implement 6 trillion yen tax  cuts for three years was 100 percent the Finance Ministry's  idea, and there was not a trace of any effort to save Japan-U.S.  relations with a little extra policy measures. This could have  been because the political authorities were not fully aware of  the seriousness of the problem, or because the lack of awareness  on the part of the bureaucrats made them resist any such  measures. The fact is, the United States was dissatisfied  because "this was 1 or 2 trillion yen less than expected."    Nevertheless, the United States decided to see the tax  cut plan as "one step forward." With that, it was at least  possible, despite serious reservations on the part of the United  States, to lay the groundwork for avoiding an open breakdown in  the framework talks. The Social Democratic Party of Japan  eliminated even this possibility. Similarly, the Liberal  Democratic Party could have opted to forget party interests and  political maneuverings for a while and support the government,  but it chose to just laugh at the Hosokawa administration's  failure.  <H5>  A Mistake Not To Be Repeated </H5>   Thus, Japan was forced into a confrontation with the United  States with nobody taking the responsibility. This reminds us  of the Pacific war.    If Japan had obtained the United States' blessing with an  8-trillion-yen tax cut, and rid itself of the fear of yen  appreciation, the mood prevailing in Japan today would have been  entirely different. Under the existing circumstances, we can  expect more corporate bankruptcies and unemployment. Who will  take the political responsibility for the victims of this?    It is hard to say what Japan should do next. It depends on  what the United States will do. Yet, for sure, the prospects  are not bright at all. One lesson we should never forget is  that in the future, if changes in the international situation  again call to question the true worth of the Japan-U.S.  alliance, Japan should never again pass over the chance to  restore the relationship of trust between Japan and the United  States.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRIMINAL, NOT A HUNTER  </P> <P> The Times' article "Police Seek Man Who Killed Doe With a Crossbow" refers to  the sick individual who committed this horrendous crime as a "hunter."  </P> <P> This man does not fit the definition of a hunter, a man or woman who enjoys  nature and all that it has to offer. Ninety-nine percent of hunters respect and  abide by the rules and regulations that govern the sport.  </P> <P> The Times is helping feed the anti-hunting fire, ensuring that the decent men  and women who enjoy this noble sport are stripped of their privilege to do so.  </P> <P> AL SANCHEZ  </P> <P> Palmdale  </P></p>

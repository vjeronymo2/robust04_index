			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BISHOP AMAT DOMINATES MATER DEI IN VICTORY  </P> <P> Bishop Amat High School showed its power in every aspect of the game Friday  night with a 34-18 victory over Mater Dei in an Angelus League game in front of  an estimated 7,000 at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> The Lancers (3-3, 1-1) especially dominated on the ground, with fine  performances from Motu Ili (103 yards and 2 touchdowns in 21 carries), Jess  Holguin (73 yards in 7 carries) and Jason Patterson (49 yards, 6 carries).  </P> <P> And although Mater Dei quarterback Danny O'Neil completed 21 of 32 passes for  316 yards -- 252 in the second half -- it was good enough for just one  touchdown, albeit a doozy, on a 62-yard play to Tino Chavez midway through the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> That play sparked the start of a rally for Mater Dei (3-4 overall, 1-1 in  league play), but Bishop Amat's relentless defense fizzled the Monarchs' hopes.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat took a 14-0 lead in the first quarter by simply outsmarting the  Mater Dei defense.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat quarterback Zack Zertuche hit Jason Green on a 16-yard touchdown  pass, and Ili scored on a one-yard run. Eric White's 27-yard field goal helped  Bishop Amat to a 17-0 lead going into halftime.  </P> <P> Zertuche completed 9 of 14 passes for 118 yards and 2 touchdowns.  </P> <P> Mater Dei finally scored when O'Neil dove one yard in the third quarter. The  Monarchs also scored in the fourth quarter on a one-yard run by Kealii  Clifford.  </P> <P> "This football team (Bishop Amat) is a good, good football team," Mater Dei  Coach Bruce Rollinson said.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't change anything I did tonight. I have to look back at the films.  Basically, we just got hammered by a good football team. We were out of sync  after they got up, 14-0."  </P> <P> Mater Dei had the most difficulty stopping Ili, who continually frustrated the  Monarch defense with spins off tackle for extra yardage. Ili, who went out in  the second quarter with an ankle injury, returned in the third and immediately  scored on a four-yard run.  </P> <P> Bishop Amat receiver Jeremy Smith, who caught five passes for 56 yards, also  seemed to dazzle Mater Dei defenders.  </P> <P> The game was delayed 25 minutes late in the fourth quarter when Bishop Amat  defensive lineman Gerard Smith suffered an apparent head injury. He was taken  to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana by paramedics.  </P></p>

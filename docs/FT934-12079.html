			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bombed out in Belfast once again - rhetoric and political introspection in London. The British government has a two-pronged strategy: use the security forces to combat the IRA and protestant terror gangs, and keep talking to the Irish government and Ulster politicians, but not to terrorists or their apologists, such as Mr Gerry Adams. A desired outcome of the talks, conducted within the framework of the Anglo-Irish agreement, is a comprehensive political settlement, including devolution of administrative authority to a locally-elected assembly in Belfast. Tragically, this strategy is not working. The IRA bomb in the Shankill road and this week's reprisals by 'loyalists' have raised the spectre of a growing civil war in the streets of Belfast. It is dismally clear that the conditions have not yet been found in which the province's main political actors are prepared to make the sacrifices of compromise. In this situation, the British government has limited powers of persuasion, but it is time to re-examine the approach both to security and political negotiation, as well as opening up a third dimension, the use of economic leverage. On the security front, there are no new ideas, but an old one which continues to exert attractions, namely internment without trial of 'known' terrorist leaders. Last time this was tried, as the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, has pointed out, it was counter-productive. Locking up killers keeps them from their grisly work, but others would do some of it for them while the IRA's overseas friends would have a field day. Internment might, however, be a worthwhile weapon of counter-insurgency if deployed at the right moment and in the right political context. It would require that action be taken against terrorists on both sides of the religious divide and would be effective only if the Irish government simultaneously detained IRA activists living within its own boundaries. Such a package would at least show determination by both the British and the Irish governments to co-operate on security. Although unionist leaders applaud the idea of internment for IRA activists, they would probably see double-edged internment as a tilt towards Dublin. It would be for the prime minister to convince them that such a move could be an effective accompaniment to a decisive political step, involving the transfer of substantial powers of government from Westminster to Belfast. The message could be pressed home by making it clear that, without such political progress, London will not tolerate the continued massive drain of public funds into Ulster at a time of acute budgetary constraints. The idea of Mr Major getting tougher on these matters may seem fanciful when he depends upon the Ulstermen to bolster a shaky Commons majority of 17. If the prime minister cannot rise above this political constraint, he will see no end to Ulster's sea of troubles.</p>

			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa offers to link-up with Austrian LUFTHANSA has offered fellow carrier Austrian Airlines a co-operation deal which, if concluded, would be a blow to plans by three other airlines for a European mega-carrier, Reuter reports from Frankfurt. Lufthansa yesterday confirmed a report in a Viennese newspaper that it made an offer for a link-up to Austria's state-owned carrier. 'We have held talks in recent weeks and have asked them to make a decision by the end of the month,' said Mr Josef Grendel, a Lufthansa spokesman. On Saturday, the daily Der Standard said Lufthansa presented Austrian with a detailed proposal that could lure it away from the Alcazar plan being negotiated with Dutch carrier KLM, Swissair and Scandinavia's SAS. In the Alcazar project, which envisages one single big airline by 1997, Austrian would play only a minor role, since it would only get a 10 per cent equity stake in the venture while the others would have 30 per cent each. Mr Grendel declined to discuss details of the German proposal, saying Der Standard's report was on the whole correct. He stressed the offer should be seen in the context of Lufthansa's Europe-wide co-operation projects aimed at ensuring a more efficient use of routes and of jet capacity. 'We want to tie partners to us' through co-operation deals so as to distribute capacity in a more economically sensible way, Mr Grendel said. Der Standard had quoted an unnamed supervisory board member at Austrian Airlines as saying the Lufthansa proposal would bring the carrier significant savings.</p>

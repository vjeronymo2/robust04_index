			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] President Suleyman Demirel has left for Ukraine,  the first leg of his official tour to Ukraine and Moldova.    In a statement at Ankara Esenboga Airport before his  departure, Demirel said that this will be the first visit to  Ukraine and Moldova by a Turkish president since the two  countries gained independence. He pointed out that Turkey was  one of the first countries to recognize and to establish  diplomatic relations with Ukraine and Moldova.    [Begin Demirel recording] Turkey attaches great importance  to the strengthening of the independence of these two countries  -- which gained their independence and took their rightful  places in the world -- and to the success of their political and  economic reforms. In particular, Turkey is trying to share its  experience in the transition to a free market economy to the  benefit of these friendly countries. In line with this aim, I  would like to announce that the Turkish Development and  Cooperation Agency will open an office in Moldova during my  visit.    Turkey considers friendly Ukraine one of the most important  countries in our region. [end recording]    Demirel pointed out that the approval documents for the  friendship and cooperation agreement signed by President  Kravchuk in Ankara in 1992 will be exchanged during his visit to  Ukraine. He added that agreements on sea and highway  transportation and on tourism will be signed, as well as a  protocol on the Ceyhan-Kirikkale-Samsun oil pipeline project  that will carry Middle Eastern oil to the Black Sea and Ukraine  over Turkey.    [Begin Demirel recording] As you know, Crimean Turks live in  Ukraine and Gagauz Turks in Moldova. These Turkish communities  make up very important bridges of friendship between Ukraine and  Moldova and Turkey. We attach great importance to the happiness  of these Turks in the countries, to their living as free  citizens whose equal rights are guaranteed and who can uphold  their ethnic and social identities, and to the establishment and  development of mutual understanding and strong cooperation  between them and the local and central authorities. Our Crimean  Turkish brothers in Ukraine were expelled from their lands and  massacred in 1944 during the Stalin era. The 50th anniversary  of this shameful incident of humanity was marked on 18 May with  sorrow and contempt. The Crimean Turks are still trying to  return to their historical homeland, the Crimea. Despite the  help of the Ukrainian Government and its desire to make this  return easy, the Crimean Turks are faced with serious problems  in their return to Crimea. Turkey will try to be of as much  help as it can to alleviate these problems. [end recording]    Demirel said that in Moldova, a series of documents will be  signed that will constitute the contractual basis of the  relations between the two countries. He explained that the  agreements to be signed will cover friendship and cooperation,  ground and air transportation, culture, judicial cooperation,  and the struggle against organized crime.    Demirel announced that the Chief Consulate in Kishinev in  Moldova has been raised to the level of an embassy. He said  that he will inaugurate the new embassy building during his  visit.    The president pointed out that in Moldova he will meet with  the leaders of the Gagauz Turks and tour the areas in which they  live. He added that he will lay the cornerstone of the brick  and tile factory the Turkish private sector is building for  close to $1 million in the Gagauz region.    Demirel was seen off by Turkish Grand National Assembly  speaker Husamettin Cindoruk. Acting Prime Minister Necmettin  Cevheri, Chief of the General Staff General Dogan Gures, certain  ministers, and officials were present at the ceremony. Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin and Transportation Minister Mehmet  Kostepen are accompanying Demirel on the visits.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Survey of Kuwait (9): What the saboteurs missed - Mina Abdullah refinery, torched by the Iraqis, recovered quickly Kuwaiti oil officials are likely to draw particular satisfaction from the imminent commissioning of the new central control room at the Mina Abdullah refinery, one of three such facilities grouped along the southern Kuwaiti coast. Three years ago the departing Iraqis, frustrated at having failed to master the intricate electronic systems at the heart of the refinery, triggered a massive explosion in the multi-million dollar control centre. It destroyed the facility, but they overlooked several smaller satellite centres which controlled specific areas of the complex. It was an error that allowed the refinery gradually to recover much of its capacity without the use of a central control complex, although at the cost of some efficiency. Earlier this month Kuwaiti workers and foreign contractors were busy making the final preparations to transfer full control of the refinery to the new centre. Its completion marks an important milestone in the rehabilitation of Kuwait's refining industry, the pre-war showpiece of the downstream sector. Before the war the three refineries - Mina Abdullah, Mina al-Ahmadi and Shuaiba - formed one of the most advanced refining centres in the world. They were the centrepiece of Kuwait's strategy to extract as much value as possible from its oil reserves by exporting refined products as well as crude oil. The damage inflicted by the Iraqis was intended to 'cripple or delay as long as possible their use,' according to Mr Sami Fahed al-Rushaid, head of corporate planning at Kuwait National Petroleum Corporation, the state-owned company which oversees domestic refining and marketing. But although the Iraqis intended to destroy as much as possible, their actions were erratic. Shuaiba, for example, was damaged so badly that some of its units may not be rehabilitated. Mina al-Ahmadi was also extensively damaged, but it was the first to be brought back on line. None of Mina Abdullah processing units were hit, although there was extensive damage to the shipping facilities and the fire water system in addition to the control room. The refineries also suffered damage from Allied bombing aimed at the pipes through which the Iraqis released crude oil into the Gulf. KNOC estimates suggest that KD120m has been spent in capital costs to repair the total damage, although final figures have yet to be calculated. There was also significant indirect damage as a result of the plants being idle during the Iraqi occupation. The cost of overhauling corroded processing units and other facilities, for example, is estimated at KD20-30m, according to the KNOC. Officials say the rehabilitation has proceeded relatively smoothly. There have been some delays, Mr Rushaid says, but the longest has been just five months. The loss of many Palestinian workers and other expatriates is, however, being felt. Absenteeism rates in some refineries are high, and there has been a marked reduction in the enthusiasm that workers displayed in the immediate post-war period. The current restoration drive will only bring Kuwait's throughput capacity up to 645,000 barrels a day, well short of its pre-war level of 776,000 b/d. But KNOC's long-term goal is to expand the capacity of the three domestic refineries to 800,000-900,000 b/d, irrespective of possible new investments in overseas refineries. It is also assessing how to react to the growing demand for cleaner, less polluting fuels such as unleaded petrol and low sulphur diesel. 'That will probably mean revamps and changes to existing units rather than any short-term increase in capacity,' says Mr Rushaid. Speculation that the refineries might be included in any privatisation programme are premature, say officials. The three facilities were built as separate units, but they have been steadily integrated, making the sale of a single unit difficult. Foreign participation in new downstream projects is more welcome, however. Last year the Petrochemical Industries Company, another state organisation, signed a memorandum of understanding with Union Carbide of the US to build a large ethylene plant alongside the refineries. Mr Hani Hussain, chairman of PIC, sees the project as a model for future foreign involvement in the domestic downstream sector. Union Carbide and PIC will each have a 45 per cent share, with 10 per cent reserved for local private investors. Mr Hussain stresses that the decision to opt for foreign participation was based on strictly commercial grounds, with Union Carbide providing state-of-the-art technology and marketing expertise, while Kuwait supplies low cost feedstocks and infrastructure. 'Politics was not the driving force,' he says, although the arrangement 'may meet political objectives' of having a bigger foreign business presence to enhance the country's long-term security.</p>

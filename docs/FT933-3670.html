			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Tokyo to unveil fresh emergency package THE NEW Japanese government is expected on Thursday to unveil an emergency economic stimulation package worth up to Y5,000bn (Pounds 30.7bn), officials said over the weekend. This will be the second such package this year after a Y13,200bn public spending plan adopted by the former LDP government last April. It marks the depth of concern in the one-month-old coalition at the unexpected length of the economic slowdown, highlighted last Friday with the publication of the Bank of Japan's latest survey on business confidence. Manufacturing industry was at its gloomiest for 18 years, since the aftermath of the first oil price shock, and there was no immediate sign of an upturn, said the survey. The new stimulus package will include cash for improvements to Japan's heavily loaded infrastructure, a Y2,000bn increase in public housing loans, Y1,000bn of aid to small business, and Y1,000bn spending on social projects such as urban improvements for the elderly, according to Japanese press reports. This will be funded by a supplementary budget, to be presented to parliament in November, officials were quoted as saying. The package will also include details of the government's drive to curb business regulations and to pass on the benefits of the yen's strength to consumers in the form of lower prices. Details will be studied closely by financial markets, eager to see how the government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa plans to fight off recession. It will also be watched by the US government, which is keen to see evidence that Tokyo is working hard to stimulate import demand as the latest round of talks on Japan's trade surplus gets under way.</p>

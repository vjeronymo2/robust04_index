			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Monktonhall miners face pit takeover ultimatum THE MINERS who operate the Monktonhall colliery in Scotland are likely to be told by their advisers in the next few days that the only hope of saving their jobs is to accept the takeover of their consortium by RJB Mining, the quoted mining company. The 187 miners, who have each invested Pounds 10,000 in Monktonhall Mineworkers, will be offered Pounds 1,000 for their shares. Those who lose their jobs will be offered an extra Pounds 3,000. RJB is understood to have signed a memorandum of intent to buy Monktonhall Mineworkers, which leases the pit from British Coal. The deal would involve a settlement by the consortium with its creditors, owed more than Pounds 3m. Monktonhall Mineworkers took over the deep mine from British Coal in June 1992 and began producing coal in January. But a combination of initial underfunding and management errors led to heavy operating losses, despite the fact that the company won contracts from ScottishPower and British Coal. Quayle Munro, the Edinburgh merchant bank hired by Lothian regional council to help solve the company's financial problems, calculated that a capital injection of Pounds 3m was needed to make the mine viable by opening a new face. RJB, which was quoted on the Stock Exchange earlier this year, is believed to have been underwriting the wage bill of the company since the memorandum of intent was signed early last month. It is unwilling to comment. Monktonhall Mineworkers is believed to have debt to secured creditors of Pounds 1.8m. Preferred creditors are thought to be owed about Pounds 800,000, and unsecured creditors a similar amount. Few saleable assets are believed to be available to pay them. The details of the offer from RJB are likely to be put to the miners who own the company in the next few days. No other offers have been received and it is thought that if RJB's offer were refused the mining operation would close and the mine revert to British Coal. The initial reaction of the miners has been mixed. The Department of Trade and Industry is believed to be having talks with RJB about grants for the expanded mining operation which would create jobs. Lothian regional council is also prepared to offer finance. At the end of August, Monktonhall Mineworkers had to state publicly that it would not accept any offer of finance from the Libyan government, with which it had been holding talks. That followed publicly expressed criticism of the Libyan connection by Quayle Munro and opposition from Scottish politicians.</p>

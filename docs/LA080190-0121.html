Hanley had little trouble telling visiting Hungarian businessmen all  about credit unions during their recent four-country tour.  </P> <P> Hanley, president of the Orange County Teachers Federal Credit Union in Santa  Ana, was born in Budapest and spoke in his native tongue as he told Hungarians  about Western-style credit union services, operations and management.  </P> <P> Hanley stayed with the group for three days of their nine-day visit, sponsored  by the World Council of Credit Unions in Madison, Wis. The World Council  represents credit unions in 80 countries.  </P> <P> With the Communists ousted from the seat of power, Hungarians are reforming  their economic system, and one of the financial institutions they might want to  copy from the West is the credit union.  </P></p>

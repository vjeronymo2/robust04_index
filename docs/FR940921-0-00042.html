			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under section 217 of the Clean Air Act, EPA may establish fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to recover all reasonable costs incurred for activities associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the Motor Vehicle and Engine Compliance Program (MVECP). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MVECP includes all compliance and enforcement activities performed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by EPA which are associated with certification, fuel economy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selective Enforcement Auditing (SEA), and in-use compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities. In July of 1992 EPA established these fees, to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective with the 1993 model year. <FOOTCITE>14</FOOTCITE>  These fees, as stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees rule, cover all direct and indirect costs incurred by EPA for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MVECP, and automatically apply to gaseous-fueled vehicles and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines now that the MVECP applies to such vehicles and engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the fees are based on the costs incurred by EPA, and since  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> today's regulations are basically an extension of the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MVECP, the fees currently in effect for other vehicles apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicles, without modification. No regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes are needed and none are being made. The applicable fee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be paid, for each engine family, before the Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Division can begin a review of the application for certification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 57 FR 30044, July 7, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of interested parties commented on EPA's November 5,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 NPRM. The comments include written submittals to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking docket and those presented at the December 3, 1992  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing, which was held in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has fully considered these comments in developing today's final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section describes the major issues of the rulemaking, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflected in the public comments. The discussion of each issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opens with a brief description of what was proposed followed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of the significant comments and EPA's analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. The reader is referred to the Summary and Analysis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments document for the complete details of EPA's analysis. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document is available in the rulemaking docket. (For information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on access to the docket, see the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Addresses <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' section above.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Timing of Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As was stated in the NPRM, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that the proposed standards are not technology-forcing,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that they could be met largely through currently available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology. Thus, the only leadtime requirement for meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards would be that of actually going through the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification process itself, including the required durability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showing. The Agency, therefore, proposed that the new vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission standards be effective with the 1994 model year, and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the aftermarket conversions take effect on January 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the Agency proposed that manufacturers have the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option of complying with these standards prior to the effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> date in order to participate in any applicable emissions averaging,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trading and banking programs, as well as the CAFE program in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case of natural gas-fueled light-duty vehicles and light-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trucks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In general, the comments received in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to the issue of leadtime supported EPA's assessment that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these standards are not technology-forcing in the sense that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fundamentally new technology must be developed. However, a number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of commenters raised concerns that, although the basic technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to meet these standards has been demonstrated at low  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mileage, the durability of this technology in many cases remains to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be proven. Additionally, one commenter pointed out that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several mandated requirements taking effect in the next few years  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for new vehicles, including Tier 1 and cold CO standards, on-board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnostics, and revised evaporative procedures, and that mandating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gaseous-fueled vehicle certification with little leadtime may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seriously impair the introduction of these vehicles into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace. Most commenters suggested that, given the need for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology refinement and durability work, these requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not take effect until the 1996 or 1997 model year. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the heavy-duty engine manufacturers asserted that, under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 202(a)(3)(C) of the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide four years leadtime in the case of any new emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. In most cases commenters stated that, regardless of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what effective date EPA finalizes, they support the option of being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to certify prior to the effective date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

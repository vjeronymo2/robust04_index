			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PALOS VERDES 'DREAM HOUSE'  </P> <P> I was appalled upon reading the article (Page One, Dec. 15.) regarding the  Aughinbaughs' Palos Verdes home. Apparently the homeowners' association has  given itself the authority as lord and master over all the residents.  </P> <P> They have put the Aughinbaughs through hell -- and for what? The association  doesn't want to gaze upon something that might not be pleasing to their eyes;  they want their community to be perfect (who cares if the people in these homes  have lost all compassion and love for their fellow man). These people would  rather have a bare, razed lot than have to spend one more horrible day watching  that beautiful (nearly completed) home be finished.  </P> <P> The court in this case has one question to ask itself: What is best for the  neighborhood? Allowing the completion of a home in which the Aughinbaughs have  spent more than a million dollars, not to mention the hard work and love  they've put into it over the years. The home will be a handsome addition to the  area, adding beauty and thereby raising surrounding home values. The ugly  alternative, tearing it down leaving a bare piece of dirt, seems somehow  unholy, and definitely criminal.  </P> <P> DONNA J. ATHENS  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

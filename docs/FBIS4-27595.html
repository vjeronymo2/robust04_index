			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok is now increasing  dialogue activities apparently aimed at expanding his sphere of  influence. Since his inauguration, many have thought he would  place more priority on "cabinet harmony" than on action,  comparing him with his predecessor Yi Hoe-chang, who actively  sought his share of the job as the second man in the  administration.    Yi is now making "quiet waves." He is meeting as many people  as possible. As part of this, he met low-ranking government  officials over lunch about a week ago. And yesterday, he held a  meeting to discuss ways to restore social dialogue in the wake  of shocking murder of a mother and father by their son.    About a week ago, a millionaire Oriental medicine  distributor  and his wife were found stabbed and burnt to death at their home  in southern Seoul. And to public shock, police announced  Thursday that the murderer was their 23-year-old son.    In a government effort to find the out causes of the social  malady represented by the malicious and cold-blooded, Prime  Minister Yi Yong-tok held a meeting to discuss ways to restore  social health. At the meeting, Prime Minister Yi stressed the  need for preventive measures for the mental health of the  younger generation, reminding the participants of the White  House Conference on Youth and Education held 30 years ago in the  United States.    "There are lots of causes making our youths mentally ill.  There are the hell-like college entrance examination, human  relations ridden by morbid egoism, moral cynicism, and unlimited  competition," said the former pedagogue.    He analyzed that the murder was to be expected in a  situation  where deviation and pathological symptoms have already reached a  dangerous point. "We must not hesitate any more. Efforts to  heal the illness, however hard they may be, or even if they are  nearly impossible, should be initiated right now," Yi  emphasized. He called for the participants to pursue free  discussion so that plans of what they should do and where they  should begin to solve "the shocking problem" would emerge.    "I think the solutions which will be found in the process of  this meeting will require efforts of individuals, family, school  and society, and especially the share of the efforts taken by  the government will be much larger," Yi said.</p>

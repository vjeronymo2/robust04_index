			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> WINDS DELAY LAUNCH OF DELTA 2 ROCKET  </P> <P> The Air Force delayed the maiden launch of its new Delta 2 rocket at the last  minute and rescheduled blastoff for Tuesday because of unexpected high-altitude  winds, officials said. The 128-foot, three-stage rocket, carrying a $65-million  advanced navigation satellite, had been scheduled to be launched during the  afternoon from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station adjacent to NASA's Kennedy  Space Center in Florida. But with the countdown in a planned 10-minute hold at  the T-minus 4-minute mark, Air Force mission managers decided to postpone the  flight for 48 hours. An Air Force spokeswoman said winds between 14,000 feet  and 18,000 feet were from the northwest and that the rocket's guidance computer  was expecting more southwesterly winds. Such winds could have "adverse  aerodynamic effects," she said.  </P></p>

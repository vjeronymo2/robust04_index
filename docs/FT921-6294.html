			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Europe's workers like their jobs but not their pay BRITISH workers like their bosses but complain about their pay. Swiss workers are virtual workaholics while the Spanish are the least enthusiastic workforce in Europe. All in all workers in northern Europe enjoy their jobs more than those in the south, although things have improved in Italy in the past year according to a survey of workers in eight European countries. Across Europe, workers think their pay is too low, and no one tells them what is going on. They think their management is poor but company loyalty and job satisfaction are high. The Swiss score top for enthusiasm in 10 of the 12 categories. Workers in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium are also more positive about most aspects of work than those in Italy and Spain. More than 80 per cent of Swiss believe their jobs are worthwhile, though they are less satisfied with their pay than the Dutch (53 per cent against 59) and less secure about their jobs than the Italians (68 against 70). Satisfaction is also high in Germany, although workers there have become significantly less enthusiastic over the past 12 months, complaining about lack of consultation, training and benefits. More than half of Dutch workers believe they are well paid and their only gripes are about training and job security. The Confederation of Dutch Industry, which speaks for 80 per cent of employers, said the explanation might be more mercenary than cultural. 'It is so easy for Dutch workers to stay at home because of our generous sick pay and disability benefits.' It said a sixth of the Dutch workforce was currently in receipt of benefit. Spanish workers are the least enthusiastic. Two-thirds believe they are poorly paid. They complain about their management, training and conditions, but not about their immediate bosses. The Italians are nearly as dissatisfied as the Spanish overall, and feel only slightly better organised. They believe their working practices are the least efficient in Europe, though attitudes have improved over the last 12 months. British workers like their immediate bosses, colleagues and conditions but complain about pay, job satisfaction and training, and their company loyalty rating (67 per cent) is the lowest of the eight countries. Mr Peter Morgan, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'I do agree that our training leaves a lot to be desired. That means workers will be lower skilled, less well organised and less motivated.' International Survey Research interviewed 250,000 workers for the survey, part of a rolling programme of research for a group of large companies.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Systematic Approach for Comprehensive Status Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> During the past 15 months, NMFS has received nine petitions requesting ESA protection for various population segments of all seven species of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Oncorhynchus <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  found in North America. NMFS has determined that all of these petitions, including those for the 10 Puget Sound populations covered by this document, present substantial scientific information indicating that listings may be warranted. However, there are also indications that declines in abundance (and local extinctions) of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout have occurred over broad geographic areas (e.g., Nehlsen  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1991). Furthermore, experience gained from Pacific salmon status reviews conducted by NMFS during the past 3 years has made it clear that determining the geographic boundaries and biological status of distinct population segments generally requires assessing populations and habitats occurring outside the range covered by specific petitions. For this reason, NMFS has initiated comprehensive, coastwide status reviews for two species_steelhead (58 FR 29390, May 20, 1993; 59 FR 27527, May 27, 1994) and coho salmon (58 FR 57770, October 27, 1993) in order to more accurately and efficiently determine the geographic boundaries and status of distinct population segments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS believes it is now prudent to initiate comprehensive status reviews for the remaining species of Pacific salmon and anadromous trout in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and California. These comprehensive reviews will allow NMFS to conduct a more thorough assessment of the ecological and genetic diversity of west coast salmon populations, and to identify the geographic extent and biological status of populations representing substantial components of the overall diversity of the biological species. This systematic evaluation will allow NMFS to accomplish the major goal of the ESA_to conserve the diversity of these species and the ecosystems they inhabit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Timeline To Complete Comprehensive Status Reviews  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> NMFS proposes to complete comprehensive species status reviews and publish its determination whether or not to list the species according to the following schedule:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs56 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Proposed completion date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> Coho Salmon  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> October 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Steelhead  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> February 16, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pink Salmon  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> June 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chum Salmon  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> July 15, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sockeye Salmon  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> September 1, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chinook Salmon  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> December 15, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sea-run Cutthroat Trout  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> April 1, 1996.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for NMFS to concentrate efforts towards completion of comprehensive status reviews by the above dates, 1-year findings for the individual petitoned stocks, due in March, April, and May, 1995, may be delayed. However, NMFS will complete status reviews for the species identified in the above petitions as soon as possible and will thereafter promptly propose listings for any species that are found to warrant protection under the ESA. While findings on petitioned Puget Sound stocks could be delayed, NMFS believes that the comprehensive approach will provide a more thorough and accurate assessment of the status and risks to anadromous salmonids throughout their ranges in California, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

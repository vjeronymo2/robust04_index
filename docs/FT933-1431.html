			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Coverage and a card for all: The main promises in the package THE CENTRAL promise of the Clinton health plan is coverage for everyone from the cradle to the grave. All US citizens and legal residents would receive a health security card, the size of a credit card, guaranteeing a defined package of benefits as extensive as most plans offered by big US companies today. Guaranteed coverage: Nobody could be refused coverage because of an existing health condition or the illness of a dependent. Insurance companies would have to apply 'community rating' so that everybody would pay the same premium regardless of age or state of health. Benefits would include preventive care, doctor visits, hospital care, prescription drugs, emergency services, mental health care, treatment for drug and alcohol abuse, expanded home care for long-term patients, eyesight and hearing treatment, and dental care for children. Coverage would start in some states in 1995 and be fully phased in by the end of 1997. Health alliances: Each state would create one or more regional health alliances, which would function as purchasing co-operatives, bargaining with insurers to obtain the best rates on health plans. Most people would be enrolled in these alliances through their employers, as would self-employed individuals, part-time workers and the unemployed. Companies with more than 5,000 employees would be free to opt out, but would be taxed for this. Alliances would offer members a menu of different health plans, including at least one plan with traditional fees for service coverage. Health plans: Alliances would conduct an 'open season' once a year (just as the US government does today for federal employees), in which members could choose to switch health plans. A typical menu of plans would include a high-cost option like many current insurance plans. That is, customers could choose their doctor but would pay any cost above what is called a deductible - for individuals Dollars 200 (Pounds 132) a year, for families Dollars 400 - plus a separately calculated 20 per cent, called a co-payment, of virtually all charges. The lowest-cost option would probably involve enrolment in a health maintenance organisation (HMO), with no annual deductible and just a Dollars 100 fee for each visit to the doctor. However, the customer would have to pay 40 per cent of the cost of any visit to a doctor outside the HMO. A middle-cost option might have higher monthly premiums but lower co-payments if the customer were to choose a doctor outside the HMO. Who pays?: Employers would be compelled to pay at least 80 per cent of the average premium charged by the health alliance, so the amount paid by each individual would depend on whether they chose a cheaper or more expensive plan. The amount any employer would have to pay would be capped at 7.9 per cent of the payroll, with additional discounts on a sliding scale for businesses with fewer than 50 employees so as to reduce their contribution to a level between 3.5 and 7.9 per cent. If employers offer more than the standard package, this will progressively become a taxable benefit. The jobless would continue to pay the 20 per cent employee share, but employed and unemployed would receive a discount if their incomes were less than 150 per cent of the poverty level. Self-employed people would be able to deduct 100 per cent of their premiums from their taxable income. Cost controls: The health alliances are expected to bring market forces to bear on the health insurance market, and administrative savings are expected from simplified paperwork. However, the plan also includes an enforceable cap in the rate of growth of health insurance premiums. These are expected, by the end of the decade, to be held to the rate of inflation. Financing: The plan needs to finance both the expansion of coverage to the estimated 37m people with no health insurance and the increased benefits such as prescription drugs and home care - in all, new spending projected at Dollars 45bn in 1996 and rising to Dollars 83bn in 2000. Most projected savings come from controlling the growth of the Medicare and Medicaid programmes, two existing federal health plans covering the elderly and the poor. The plan forecasts savings rising from Dollars 14bn in 1996 to Dollars 86bn in 2000. An extra 75 cents to Dollars 1 tax on a packet of cigarettes, and a tax on big companies that opt out of regional health alliances, would together raise Dollars 15bn to Dollars 16bn a year. The programme is forecast to cost the federal government a net Dollars 14bn in 1996-1997, but to save it Dollars 86bn in the next three years.</p>

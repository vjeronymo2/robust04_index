In his letter General  Roso states that Muslim forces launched a heavy attack today on  the free territory of Zepce, using mortars and howitzers. One  HVO soldier was killed and three wounded in these attacks.    In his letter General Roso says that Muslim forces organized  and staged an HVO attack on their positions on the eastern side  of Mostar. They had in advance positioned TV cameramen who were  supposed to film this artillery action, thus gaining a certain  political as well as military advantage. General Roso demands  that UNPROFOR take measures on the ground in order to thwart  similar action.</p>

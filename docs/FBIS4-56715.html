			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mireya Moscoso de Gruber, Democratic </F> Alliance presidential candidate, by journalist Barbara Bloise in  Panama City; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Text] [Bloise] ...figures the Electoral Tribunal [TE] has  revealed so far and what you have been saying in various  statements?    [Gruber] Yes. We are comparing the figures we continue to  receive with the figures the TE is giving on television. We see  we have more or less the same figures, but we still lack many  figures, above all from the countryside. We only have figures  from the cities, which is what has been shown.    [Bloise] What guarantees do the women, above all, have in  your government if you win the presidency?    [Gruber] Look, as a woman I believe women should be granted  greater participation, so women would have equal participation  with the men in my government. I do not want to imply that men  would not participate, but we would.... [changes thought] We  will certainly try to make sure that women have a major role in  my government. They will.    [Bloise] The Arnulfist Party has always stood out as a  nationalist party that is deeply rooted among the people. What  will be your position concerning a renegotiation of the military  bases?    [Gruber] We have said my government will hold a referendum  and the Panamanian people will decide whether the military bases  will remain beyond 1999. If they decide yes, then we will ask  the United States to renegotiate these bases -- provided the  United States also wants this.    [Bloise] Under what conditions would these negotiations be  carried out?    [Gruber] We would first have to talk with the Americans.  That is what I can tell you.    [Bloise] What will be your government's position regarding  the foreign debt?    [Gruber] We know we have a commitment, and the debt must be  paid. My government will not say it will not pay. We have this  commitment, and we will fulfill this commitment, too.    [Bloise] How will you feel concerning results.... [changes  thought] What will be your position concerning the results of  today's elections?    [Gruber] How can I feel? We know the results will be known,  perhaps in the early morning hours, and we also know the results  will be in our favor. Therefore, we will feel happy, and we  feel happy about the support the Panamanian people have given  us. We have a commitment to the Panamanian people, so we will  wait for the results. It is only a matter of a few hours.  Thank you. [Crowd chants "Mireya!"]</p>

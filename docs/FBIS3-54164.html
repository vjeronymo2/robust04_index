			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Text] Yasir 'Arafat, chairman of the PLO's Executive  Committee, arrived in Saudi Arabia last night for the first time  since the oil war. PLO relations with Riyadh and with the other  members of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] deteriorated as a  result of the PLO's support for Iraq's attack on Kuwait and its  occupation of Kuwait; and this has had a detrimental impact on  the PLO.    The GCC member states stopped their financial assistance to  the PLO because of its stance in the oil war. Some 600,000  Palestinians living in the Persian Gulf shaykhdoms were placed  under severe pressure and about half of them had to return to  Jordan. The voluntary tax, based on an agreement among the  countries in the Arab League and levied on the Palestinians and  deposited in the PLO's bank account, has been blocked. PLO  officials allege that all these problems have led to a financial  crisis for the PLO. Six months ago the PLO started warning of a  financial crisis and stopped paying benefits to the families of  Palestinian martyrs and the salaries of part of its military  forces in Lebanon.    According to a PLO-Saudi Arabian agreement, during his visit  to Riyadh 'Arafat will meet Saudi King Fahd. This meeting will  probably be the prologue to an improvement in Saudi-PLO  relations. Since 'Arafat approached Israel and the United States  four months ago with the signing of the Gaza-Jericho accord, PLO  relations with GCC members have started to improve gradually and  PLO embassies have been set up in all the GCC member states  except Kuwait.    'Arafat's current trip to Riyadh will probably pave the way  for similar visits to other GCC member states.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (7): Hedge against stock swings - Equity products IF YOU peek into the portfolio of an equity fund manager nowadays, the chances are that you might not find any shares. Instead, there could be a whole load of bonds in the portfolio. Before you sue the fund manager for misrepresentation, there is a good reason for what appears to be a contradictory state of affairs. The fund manager will be using the income from the bonds to buy equity derivative products which should enable his fund to achieve higher returns than other similar funds in the market place. Equity derivatives have become an integral part of a fund manager's life as the fund management industry becomes increasingly competitive. 'Fund managers are doing everything possible to get the best performance,' says the head of equity derivatives at a leading Japanese bank in London. In addition, the use of equity derivatives is now spreading to all areas of finance as a higher priority is given to managing risk as effectively as possible. Users of equity derivatives can be divided into three main categories: insurance companies and investment fund companies which want to launch new products to sell to their retail clients; pension funds which want to have an exposure to a certain equity market without having to go out and buy shares in that market; corporate treasurers who want tools to manage or hedge different exposures on their balance sheets. Most equity derivative products, which are traded over the counter (OTC) or on futures and options exchanges, can be tailored to each client's specific needs. 'Essentially, we use equity derivative products to solve any problems which our client might have,' says one derivatives trader. Some traders say that the drawback of these individual structured deals is that they are not liquid and are difficult to get out of once you are in. However, others say that these deals are essentially made up of a series of building blocks which can be unwound at any time. As a result of the customised nature of the market, most of the innovations in equity derivatives products are born in the over-the-counter market which can cater for individual needs. However, the exchanges are quick to catch on to any new products. Although products traded on the exchanges tend to be more standardised than those in the OTC market, they are attractive to investors who are not allowed to buy products which are not listed. One important advantage of buying a listed product is that the exchange acts as a central clearing house which helps to reduce a market participant's credit exposure. By contrast, participants in the OTC market may well trade directly with a counterparty which has an inferior credit rating. However, an increasing number of entities with triple-A ratings are starting to provide derivative products in the OTC markets which should help to reduce this credit risk concern. There has been an enormous growth in volume in equity derivatives products and investors can now have an exposure to all the leading stock markets in the world without having to actually buy shares in those markets. The next target will be emerging stock markets in Latin America and Asia as soon as they are deemed to have sufficient liquidity to support a derivatives market. Mexico, Hong Kong and Singapore are likely to be the first to take this step. The types of products on offer are also becoming increasingly exotic and investors can now hedge themselves against virtually every movement in a stock market. 'There are few limits left to what we can offer investors as long as they pay to take the risk and the reward,' says a derivatives trader at a UK securities house. Retail investors are also creeping into what is still a largely institutional domain since equity derivatives are being used to structure OTC products which guarantee a specific return. These 'guaranteed return' products are heavily marketed to retail investors who have seen their income from cash deposits dwindle over the past year as a result of the substantial drop in interest rates. These kinds of products, which rely heavily on derivatives for their ability to outperform the underlying equity market, are widespread in the United States but are relatively new in Europe. In the UK, the wider use of derivatives has been held up by legislative and fiscal difficulties. However, now that these issues have been clarified there has been a tremendous increase in OTC products which are sold to retail investors. Liffe, London's financial futures and options exchange, is relying on retail investors as part of its ambitious plan to stimulate new interest in equity options. In the US and in the Netherlands, it is the retail investor, and not the institutional client, who is responsible for about 70 per cent of trading volume in these instruments. In the UK, the situation is the reverse, with private investors estimated to contribute less than 20 per cent of total equity and index option volume. Liffe has therefore taken steps to make equity options more accessible to the public. Prices of individual equity options are now available on the BBC's teletext facility, Ceefax. Retail investors were also given priority when Liffe conducted a review of individual equity options. The exchange dropped four existing options and introduced eight new ones, leaving 70 equity options which better reflect the composition of retail and institutional portfolio holdings. Liffe does not expect investors, large and small, to change their habits overnight, but aims to double trading volume of equity options within two years. Currently, just over 1m contracts are traded each quarter. Trading in equity options reached a high of 3.1m contracts in the second quarter of 1987, just before the global stock market crash which occurred that October. While a volume-based target is probably the most widely perceived measure of success, Liffe believes that other goals are equally important. These range from a substantial increase in the use of equity options by institutional and private clients, to increased liquidity in individual equity options.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Poultry research cuts attacked UK government funding of research into poultry disease has been cut so sharply that the industry would be unable to cope with unexpected outbreaks, according to a report by the House of Commons agriculture committee. The report on the UK poultry industry, published yesterday, cited evidence from the Institute of Animal Health that its poultry research funding from the agriculture ministry had dropped from Pounds 1.2m in 1988 to Pounds 600,000. 'The UK's poultry disease research base now lacks the strategic comprehensiveness to respond to unforeseen disease problems affecting the industry,' said the report. 'We find this a deplorable state of affairs and recommend that the government take steps to restore funding to a level adequate to finance such a strategic capability.' In its first report since inquiring into the fallout of controversy over salmonella in eggs in 1989, the committee said it was concerned that evidence on suspected causes of salmonella food poisoning remained 'patchy and incomplete'. 'We recommend that urgent attention be given to ways of co-ordinating and improving the reporting system so that causes of infection can be identified in a higher proportion of cases.' The source is established in less than 50 per cent of reported outbreaks, it said. The committee also said poultry producers had suffered substantial losses from disease in the past few years because vaccines being used in other European Union countries were not available in the UK because of to licensing delays and costs. It recommended that the government cut the cost to pharmaceutical companies of licensing vaccines to levels prevailing elsewhere in the EU, where governments subsidise the licensing process.</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Wheeling out old stagers and upstagers - Campaigning in the run up to next week's Monmouth by-election Upstaging the chancellor of the exchequer is no mean feat for any politician. Mr Roger Evans, the Tory candidate in the Monmouth by-election, managed it easily at his Wednesday morning press conference this week. Mr Evans' unabashed defence of freedom to choose private health and education, and his description of socialism as 'founded on robbery' and 'immoral', are colourfully reminiscent of the conviction politics of the early 1980s. They do not sit so well with a Tory party infused with Mr John Major's call for a 'classless society.' His style is articulate and uncompromising, rather than re-assuring. His doorstep canvassing is of the brisk: 'Can-I-count-on-your-support? Splendid-pleased-to-have-met-you' variety. Mr Evans' task is defending the 9,500 Tory majority with which the late Sir John Stradling Thomas held the largely rural seat on the Welsh border in 1987. The vote this coming Thursday is critical for all three main parties. A Tory by-election victory would be the first for more than two years, while for the Liberal Democrats, success would offer the ideal springboard in the run up to the election. The minimum for Labour seems to be coming ahead of the Liberal Democrats, to halt their momentum. In a general election, despite strong Labour areas in towns such as Chepstow and Abergavenny, Monmouth might well not have been one of the prime target seats. The campaign has been dominated by the health service, with Labour making mileage from claims that two local hospitals are under pressure to go along the path to self-governing status - 'opting out'. Like the word 'local' for the Liberal Democrats, 'opt out' has now become the sine qua non for Labour campaigning. The theme for yesterday's press conference was transport, but both Mr Huw Edwards, the Labour candidate, and Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary, referred to the NHS in their prepared statements. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, due in the constituency today, will also emphasise the issue. Despite Labour's efforts, the NHS does not - so far - seem likely to be the sole determinant of the Monmouth result. Unlike recent by-election upsets in safe Tory seats of Eastbourne and Ribble Valley, there is no equivalent to Mrs Thatcher's premiership or the poll tax as the issue to focus anger against the government. As a result, though there are traditional Tory supporters expressing worries about hospital wards closing and the lack of housing for young people in many of the constituency's beautiful villages, they often conclude that they will still vote Tory rather than not. The recession and the difficulties facing farmers have, however, produced some disaffected Tories. The rare sight of Labour posters, as well as Liberal Democrat signs in some of the fields is evidence of how far the farming community feels it has been pushed. The fear for the opposition candidates is that they will cancel each other out, and split the anti-Tory vote. Mr Edwards, a Brighton polytechnic lecturer, has seemed more confident talking to the voters than to the media. Twice, in press conferences earlier this week, the silence before his answer grew embarrassing, though that may owe less to his being heavily 'minded' by party officials, than to the fact that this is his first election. Mrs Frances David, the Liberal Democrat candidate, seems happiest concentrating on specific, local issues such as Welsh water prices and the police station in Monmouth. With all the three main parties believing that there is still everything to play for, scores of political heavyweights and hundreds of workers will be flooding into the constituency over the weekend. Labour's latest estimate is that Mr Edwards is some 5 or 6 per cent behind the Tories, while the Liberal Democrats are stuck on their 20 per cent share of the vote in last week's local elections in the area. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, in the constituency hoping to light the blue touch paper for a third-party surge, said the contest was 'open' but did not assert that Mrs David was the challenger to Mr Evans. This side of the weekend the Tory majority looks shaky but not doomed. The next few days' campaigning will be decisive. The principal candidates are: Mrs David (LibDem), Mr Edwards (L), Mr Evans (C), Mr M Witherden (Green/Plaid Cymru).</p>

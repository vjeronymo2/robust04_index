			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> UTAH;  </P> <P> CAMPFIRE NEGLECT BLAMED FOR BLAZE  </P> <P> An abandoned campfire sparked a ferocious wind-whipped wildfire in Utah's  Wasatch County that has killed two firefighters, gutted 18 homes and blackened  3,000 acres, investigators said.  </P> <P> No suspects have been identified, but authorities said anyone responsible could  be forced to pay the entire cost of suppressing the fire. Slightly cooler  temperatures, with highs from 80 to 85 degrees, and reduced winds have helped  firefighters gain the upper hand. Officials said they were optimistic they  would control the fire later today.  </P></p>

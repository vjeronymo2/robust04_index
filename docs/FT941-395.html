			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / 'Crazy' rules on aid and trade denounced by top industrialists Three leading British industrialists yesterday accused the government of undermining their companies' bids for contracts in developing countries by introducing 'crazy' aid and trade rules in the aftermath of the Pergau dam affair. Sir Robin Biggam, BICC chairman; Mr John Lippitt, a GEC director; and Mr Allan Gormly, chief executive of Trafalgar House, said British aid and trade provision regulations made it extremely difficult to compete against European rivals. They claim the government's use of the annual Pounds 100m aid and trade provision budget had been restricted by new rules limiting the number of countries and contracts for which funds could be used. This budget channels UK development aid intended for the purchase of British goods. 'Our government's policy is totally wrong,' Mr Lippitt told the Commons foreign affairs committee. 'It's crazy.' He claimed that restrictive aid and trade rules were the main reason GEC did not win two contracts to help build Chinese underground systems worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The government came under fierce attack after Pounds 234m from the provision's budget was granted to the Malaysian government in 1991 towards construction of the Pergau dam. After the Pergau deal, the Overseas Development Administration decided funds could only be given to countries with a per capita income under Dollars 700, a figure that would now exclude Malaysia. It compares with a peak of Dollars 2,465 suggested by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. The ODA also set a limit of Pounds 46m on the amount of government money that could go to any single project receiving aid and trade provision funds. However, Sir Robin, whose company is the parent of Balfour Beatty which is contributing to the Pergau project, said his company could not take full advantage of the aid and trade provision scheme. 'We will be denied the use of ATP in any country above those limits of per capita income,' he said. 'We will simply not be able to compete.' Mr Gormly said such funding was essential for companies wanting to set up long-term business contacts in a region. Mr Lippitt cited examples of how the Bonn government had helped German companies gain lucrative contracts in China. In the case of a contract for the Shanghai metro system, the British government offered the Chinese 31 per cent of the costs of the project in aid and trade provision grant. But Bonn offered 51 per cent. He said GEC was again beaten in bidding for the Guangzhou metro, with the UK offering 35 per cent of grant costs in aid and trade provision compared with Germany's 68 per cent.</p>

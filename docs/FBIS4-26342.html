			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ma Chenguang: "War Intensifies on Book Piracy"] </F>   [Text] Police forces across the country have been cracking  down on the sale of illegally-published and pornographic books  following the issuance of a circular from China's main  publication agency.    The directive from the Press and Publication Administration  (PPA) requires its regional branches to cooperate with local  Public Security organs in starting a comprehensive search for  pirated books and pornographic materials.    China's publishing industry is a combination of State-owned  printing houses, of which there are about 300, and over 60,000  privately-run or collectively-run printing workshops and book  dealers. The PPA says that the private sector of the industry  is the main target of scrutiny.    Unlike large-sized publishers which have licenses to print  books, many small printing houses often break regulations in  order to make quick profits, said Huang Xiaoxin from the PPA's  distribution department.    They often illegally print best-sellers, reference works and  indecent materials.    The PPA estimates that out of the country's 100,000 new  publications each year, some 1,500 titles are pirated.    The nationwide battle against illegal and indecent  publications has been particularly successful in Hunan and  Guangdong provinces and Beijing where printing houses and  backroom printing shops have been closed down and main offenders  arrested, Huang said.    According to PPA investigations, Hunan has over 4,000 small  printing shops. In Changsha, the provincial capital, one shop  was discovered to have been distributing pornographic books.  The Guoxiao Book Shop had sold over 100,000 sexually offensive  books to other shops in 27 provinces and municipalities.    So far, 13 of the prime culprits have been arrested by  police  in connection with the Guoxiao case alone, Huang said.    Also in Hunan, a county printing house was closed down for  illegally printing 250,000 copies of the Xinhua Dictionary, the  most popular dictionary among students.    When police raided the premises some 50,000 illegal copies  were confiscated.    All those arrested for piracy in Hunan are awaiting trial,  Huang said.    Meanwhile, police in Jiangsu Province have apprehended a  35-year-old book merchant for pirating over a period of several  years.    Lu Ping, from Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, was  found to have made profits of 3 million yuan ($345,000) from his  illegal business.    Lu is now awaiting trial. If found guilty he could face the  death penalty, Huang added.    In Guangdong Province, investigators have discovered piracy  involving a novel, "Zeng Guofan," which is about the famous Qing  Dynasty (1644-1911) general who put down the Heavenly Kingdom  uprisings.    Huang said that he expected more printing house closures and  arrests as the crackdown gained momentum.</p>

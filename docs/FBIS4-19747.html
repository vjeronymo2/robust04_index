			<p>BFN     [Text] Portuguese Foreign Affairs Minister Jose Manuel  Durao Barroso has said that new requests have been made for  Portugal's help in solidifying the Mozambican peace process.  After meeting Afonso Dhlakama, Mozambique National Resistance  [Renamo] leader, in Lisbon, the Portuguese foreign affairs  minister described as legitimate, international supplementary  support for Renamo so it can become a political party.    In turn, Dhlakama insisted that, irrespective of the outcome  of elections, the winning party should share power with other  parties represented in Parliament.</p>

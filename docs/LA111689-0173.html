			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: AMTRAK REJECTS BOOST IN L.A.-SAN DIEGO RUN  </P> <P> Top Amtrak officials said Wednesday that they cannot afford to add trains on  the Los Angeles-San Diego rail corridor, the nation's second-busiest passenger  route, or replace aging signal equipment.  </P> <P> In a Washington meeting, Amtrak officials said they might not have enough money  this year to cover existing service, much less the expense of adding trains or  making system improvements.  </P> <P> The news was a setback for the Los Angeles-San Diego Rail Corridor Agency,  formed by the state and Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. The agency  had hoped to persuade Amtrak to begin work on an estimated $15 million in  signal improvements and to provide additional train service along the busy  route.  </P></p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (9): Veteran capitalist - Profile of Henryk Winkler Of Katowice - Anthony Robinson criss-crosses small-town Poland and finds the spirit of enterprise still very much alive and well IN THIS country of instant entrepreneurs Henryk Winkler is a veteran. Like his father, who was deprived of his property and sentenced to 18 years' jail in 1957 as a capitalist parasite, he has always been a private businessman. He started with a small fish-curing business in 1970. But the past two years open encouragement of free enterprise have given him a free rein to do what he does best - which is to create wealth. First, he developed his fish-curing business and built it into a wholesale operation which turned over Dollars 19m last year. Then, in co-operation with his Hamburg-based brother, he paid Dollars 1.5m at an auction for a state-owned bakery 15km outside Katowice, the capital of heavily industrialised Upper Silesia. Like so many of the plants built with foreign loans during the regime of Mr Edward Gierek in the 1970s, it was used only at a fraction of its potential capacity. Even now, after heavy investment in German and Italian machines to produce and package chocolate biscuits, swiss rolls, potato chips and other luxury food items, including coffee, the bakery still uses only one third of its production potential. Two years ago, such products were virtually unobtainable in Poland's cheerless and empty shops. Since then the market has been flooded with luxury imports - more than Dollars 4bn was spent on consumer goods out of the total Dollars 14bn spent on imports last year. Winkler is one of a growing number of consumer companies which have been quick to spot a profitable opportunity in substituting for imports by producing similar high quality goods from a lower cost Polish base. But pioneering the return of private enterprise has not been easy. Four months after raising the equivalent of Dollars 1.5m from Polish banks to finance the purchase of his bakery a combination of high domestic inflation and soaring interest rates doubled the zloty cost of the investment. Mr Winkler then switched to foreign funding. But in the meantime the zloty fell 47 per cent against the dollar. The currency factor, when added to the 12 per cent nominal interest rate on the loan, translated into a total 59 per cent annual servicing charge. Poland's cheap labour costs are also often more apparent than real. 'I know the unemployment problem around here and when I bought the bakery I took on the people as well. But that means I employ 230 people where a Swedish competitor using the same equipment would employ only 30,' he says with a shrug. Even so, Mr Winkler reckons that his potato chips are 50 per cent cheaper than those of imports and costs will come down further when he manages to triple output with only minor new investment and the same labour force. Meanwhile, he complains: 'I have to spend more time worrying about changes in tariffs, duties and interest rates than developing production'. Last March, for example, when he imported a German food machine, he had to pay an import duty of DM225,000. 'Since then the government has abolished duties on these machines so my competitors are able to buy them more cheaply. I wish they would make up their minds.' Since buying the factory he has also seen his property tax payments rise from 80m zlotys to 450m zlotys as the cash-strapped local authority zeroed in on the prosperous-looking new venture. 'I don't mind. I can see how desperately they need the money. But my satisfaction is in producing. Ijust want the government to let me get on with the job and not throw obstacles in the way.'</p>

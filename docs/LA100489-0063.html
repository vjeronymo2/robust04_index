			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES SAY THEY WOULD PASS ON KEITH HERNANDEZ  </P> <P> There's one flaw in first baseman Keith Hernandez's plan to join the Padres.  </P> <P> The Padres don't want Hernandez, who was informed Tuesday by the New York Mets  that he would not be returning to them.  </P> <P> Perhaps a year ago, the Padres would have welcomed Hernandez with open arms.  But not now. Not after acquiring first baseman Jack Clark last October.  </P> <P> "I just don't see where he'd fit in on our club," said Tony Siegle, Padre vice  president of personnel. "It's not like we have a DH (designated hitter) in our  league. He'd be as asset to some club, but not ours.  </P> <P> "We've got Clark, and he'll be around for at least another year. So picking up  Hernandez just wouldn't make sense at this point."  </P> <P> Hernandez, who had told friends he'd like to play for the Padres even before  the Mets told him they would not offer him a new contract, hit only .233 with  four homers and 19 RBIs while battling injuries all season.  </P> <P> Clark, who has one more year on his contract that will pay him $2 million in  1990, hit .242 with 26 homers and 94 RBIs.  </P> <P> "You can talk about his strikeouts, his slow start, or whatever you want, but  Jack Clark's a real leader, " Padre Manager Jack McKeon said. "He helped me out  tremendously over the season, and he'll be a big part of our team in 1990."  </P></p>

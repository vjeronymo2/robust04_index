			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (26): The sceptics have been won over - UK exports promotion / A look at the work of the UK's 'export ambassadors' recruited from industry to share their knowledge and expertise of overseas markets and to provide independent advice to exporters Enthusiasm is often infectious - and in the case of the UK's Department of Trade and Industry's Export Promoter Initiative, it is also producing profitable results. Exporters are traditionally sceptical about government plans to boost trade, but they are slowly being won over by the initiative. There have been over 8,000 contacts between promoters and companies since the scheme got under way 18 months ago and, although success is quantitatively difficult to measure, the gap between Whitehall, business and industry has narrowed palpably. The link has been forged by 101 'export ambassadors' recruited from industry to share their experience, knowledge and expertise of overseas markets and to provide independent, impartial advice. Seconded for two years from the ranks of the UK's top companies, the promoters present an 'exporter friendly' and personal front to the administrative and desk operations of export promotion. Mixing metaphors, the promoters' aim 'is to be a 'bridge' . . . going out to bat for business in the market.' 'I see myself as a marketing arm,' says Mr David Allen who has an accumulated 37 years of experience in the Middle East and Africa. On secondment from Glaxo Holdings with 16 years experience as sales director in the region, he was previously with Roche Products for 21 years. Mr Allen enthuses about the scheme, the diversity of his work and the opportunities for British business in the Middle East. He recently spent a day discussing the prospects of selling second-hand machine tools to Yemen and the supply of Costwold stone for a mosque under construction in Oman. 'I thoroughly enjoy my work,' he says. 'When you are in a particular sector, you can become in danger of knowing more and more about less and less. Now I have a broad brush.' Beds are a favourite topic: he has been actively involved in a project to franchise the manufacture of branded beds in Bahrain, a venture which illustrates the difficulting of measuring 'results' in terms of numerical targets - 'there's a limited time to achieve so much,' he says, noting that large or complicated projects and ventures require months of preparatory work before fruition. The value of personal contact cannot be over-stated, he notes, adding that this is particularly important in the Middle East where social meetings and informal discussions are an integral part of the business environment. This view is echoed by Mr James Lawday, whose promotion patch covers Egypt, Lebanon and Syria - familiar turf from his 15 years in the Middle East for John Laing International before his secondment to the promoter programme. He has dealt with over 400 companies since joining the initiative 18 months ago and has been encouraging British companies to increase their efforts in Egypt, Syria and Lebanon. UK companies have been slow off the mark in getting into Lebanon, he says, although there are considerable opportunities in the reconstruction of the devastated country. notably in contracting, installation and procurement. In Syria, Mr Lawday notes there has been a considerable change in the business climate - 'the country is much more warm and welcoming to business than previously,' he says. 'There are many more opportunities for the private sector as the government has been encouraging private money to return to the country.' He has focused on medium to smaller businesses and covered an array of sectors. This is exactly what the scheme was set up to do on the practical level, dove-tailing with the DTI desk operations and information service in the UK. Mr Justin Davies at the DTI Egypt desk in London co-ordinates with Mr Lawday, regional offices and commercial sections of British embassies abroad to provide exporters with every aspect of assistance. The DTI country desks handle direct calls by new exporters and rarely refers them back to regional offices which can also be a first point of contact for companies seeking new markets. The country desk provides information on a country and helps with agency and distribution agreements, background information on a country's economy, as well as advice on the possible pitfalls. Mr Davies describes the system as providing one point of contact for exporters to tap into a wealth of contacts, information and assistance, noting that this more pro-active approach and specific targeting has given exporters clearer steers for their marketing efforts. The DTI initiative covers the UK's top 80 markets which account for over 90 per cent of exports. Mr Ray Mingay, the director general of export promotion at the DTI, says the Exporter Initiative will be extended by rolling forward the programme and requesting companies to extend or renew their commitments to seconding staff. The DTI will continue to meet operating and travel costs of the promoters from its budget. The prospect of extending the scheme seemed a less-than-remote possibility in the early days. Mr Mingay laughs when he recalls the initial scepticism over whether the initiative would get any, let alone enough, export promoters to join the scheme. Describing the scheme as an 'investment,' he says the points of contact for business also include seminars, meetings and informal workshops.

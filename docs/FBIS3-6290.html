Ministry officials said the United States has not given an  explanation for the postponement, but said their stance is  probably in response to Japan's refusal to expand "beyond  rights" for U.S. airlines that would allow them to extend their  routes beyond Japan to third countries.    The Japanese Government expressed its regrets over the U.S.  move through the Japanese Embassy in Washington, ministry  officials said.    The government protested that it is a breach of promise by  the U.S. side to defer approval of the rights which are based on  a 1989 bilateral interim agreement, the officials said.    JAL officials said the company will operate chartered  flights  for the Sendai-Honolulu route to avoid confusion among  passengers.    The once-a-week flights were scheduled to start from  Thursday, and reservations until June had reached 75 to 85  percent, they said.    An aviation official of the Miyagi Prefectural Government  said he was bewildered by the sudden postponement. "It comes as  a shock since we are hoping to increase our international routes  in the future," he said.    At the beginning of this year, JAL decided to initiate  flights on the route and applied for approval with the U.S.  Transport Department on February 10.    Japanese officials said the U.S. probably postponed its  approval in light of opposition from U.S. airlines, United  Airlines and Federal Express, which have met with Japanese  resistance in securing expansion of "beyond rights."    The Hawaiian authorities are in favor of the new route.    The U.S. apparently wants to make approval of the Sendai-  Honolulu route an issue to be taken up in bilateral aviation  talks, the officials said.    The aviation negotiations have been stalled due to such  factors as Japan's refusal to expand "beyond rights," and a  timetable for the next round of talks has yet to be set.    They said there is only a slim chance of the U.S. granting  approval of the Sendai-Honolulu route in the near future.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: One friend for Norman Lamont MR NORMAN Lamont has at least one friend among the 800 to 900 Tory activists gathered in Harrogate. As political gossip was traded on the fringes of the Conservative central council a London representative vigorously asserted that the chancellor should remain in his post until 1995, and then become foreign secretary. It was not a popular stance. 'It wouldn't matter if he could walk on water now,' was how another south-east Tory summed up the mood that sees the early departure of Mr Lamont as the starting point for the expected summer reshuffle. There was less unity about his successor. The well-trailed names of Mr Michael Portillo, Mr John MacGregor, Sir Norman Fowler and Mr Kenneth Clarke were mentioned. A lone voice even suggested that Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, could be chancellor. Central council meetings tend to comprise people hardened by years of service to the party, so it is no surprise that they routinely deny standing ovations to speeches that would get the annual party conference on its feet. Even so, the atmosphere in the Royal Hall, as ministers chorused the need to get on with ratifying Maastricht, was subdued. The representatives are not rampantly Euro-sceptic - indeed, some of them say British businesses would suffer if the UK does not ratify - but many expressed the feeling that Maastricht is irrelevant and has distracted the government from what really matters - economic recovery. So while they applauded, as Tories always applaud, the call for MPs to show some loyalty to the party and those who worked so hard to get them elected, there was little sign that unless they are pushed, the grassroots are threatening to deselect persistent rebels as the party's managers have been hinting. 'The Wintertons are adored in Cheshire,' said one representative - albeit not from Cheshire - of two of the most incorrigible Tory MPs.</p>

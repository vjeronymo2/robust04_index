			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / United ends its Glasgow service United Airlines is to withdraw its daily service between Glasgow and Washington DC at the end of November, only 18 months after it was launched. It is the third airline in three months to announce the withdrawal or curtailment of transatlantic flights from Scotland. United said it was losing money on the route and wanted to redeploy its aircraft in more profitable markets. It said it had achieved high peak-season load factors, but yields were low because of the shortage of passengers paying premium fares. It sells fewer than two business class seats a day in Scotland and five in the US. The departure of United Airlines will leave only British Airways flying all through the year from Glasgow to the US. Later this month Northwest Airlines will cease its daily Glasgow-Boston service after 14 years, and American Airlines is to operate its daily Glasgow-Chicago service in the summer only, ending its all-year service on November 2. The airlines' decisions are a serious blow to long-running efforts by BAA, which runs Glasgow airport, and the development body Scottish Enterprise to attract transatlantic services to Glasgow. It was felt direct flights would benefit Scottish consumers and make it easier to attract US companies to open plants in Scotland. United said too many Scots preferred to fly to the US via London or Continental airports. Mr David Coltman, vice-president for transatlantic services, added: 'Scottish business travellers are very cost-conscious. They will put up with restrictions such as staying over a weekend in order to get a lower fare.' Manchester airport is also seeing a reduction in long-haul services this winter, with BA ending flights to Los Angeles and American Airlines making its New York service summer only. South African Airlines is ceasing to fly from Manchester to Johannesburg.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Annual fee income rankings - growth rates sharply down THEY CRITICISE it, they disdain it, they publicly dismiss it. But privately all the accountancy firms eagerly await the release of the annual fee income rankings, keen as they are to see their own position and to crunch the numbers of their competitors. This year more than any in recent memory, the data warrant close attention for the picture they paint of the impact of recession. Gloomy trends emerge from the numbers and changes in staff and partner employment, revenues from clients, and the other limited information reluctantly handed out by the firms. The Financial Times' table of the largest 25 firms reveals a year of enormous change, with growth rates sharply down from the late 1980s, some figures in absolute decline, and several changes in the rankings of the different firms. Four of the top 25 accounting practices reported an absolute decline in fee income this year, and only four managed to achieve the double-digit growth which was typical even last year. Most have struggled to keep up with inflation. Between them, the firms closed at least 18 branch offices around the country over the past year, and cut more than 3,400 professional jobs, and nearly 100 partners. These figures disguise larger numbers of job losses, which have been off-set by other people who have been hired. One of the biggest surprises is Coopers &amp; Lybrand. It remains the largest firm by fee income, but fell to Pounds 577m. The firm dropped Deloitte from the end of its name at the start of the month, but the legacy of its merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in 1990 lives on in the figures. The firm readjusted the Pounds 588m it quoted last year down to Pounds 580m, arguing that it over-estimated the income it would receive from the Deloitte's side of the business. That still means it has declined by 0.52 per cent. The largest drop came from Chantrey Vellacott, in which the fee income fell by 4.55 per cent. BDO Binder Hamlyn also fell sharply, down by 4.43 per cent, while Neville Russell declined by 1.18 per cent. Seven of the top 20 firms changed position in the FT's league table, compared with their ratings last year. BDO Binder Hamlyn, and Grant Thornton  -the two firms just below the 'big six' - have switched places. So have Stoy Hayward with Moores Rowland; and Neville Russell with Moore Stephens. MacIntyre Hudson, which refused to provide any information this year, has dropped off the list entirely. It has almost certainly seen a substantial drop in fee income after its City of London practice de-merged last year. Two exceptions to the generally gloomy trend are Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross. Andersen grew by 23 per cent, a large proportion of which can be attributed to the highly successful consulting division. But the firm also boasts the best growth rates for both the accounting and insolvency divisions among the large firms. Touche Ross also bucked the trend with fee growth of 15.72 per cent. That includes substantial contributions from referral work from its international partnership - which includes former Deloitte practices - along with European consulting and the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. Among the smaller firms, Levy Gee also performed extremely well, with growth up by 10.71 per cent. That reflects the firm's particular strength in insolvency, which contributed 40 per cent of income this year. As always, the figures come with substantial provisos. It is difficult to analyse the break-down within the four quoted divisions - accountancy, audit, tax and insolvency - because work is often distributed differently between the categories by different firms. Not all the year-ends correspond, and some are estimates to help make comparisons rather than the year-ends used by the firms. None of the figures are audited. At least two firms adopt the questionable practice of including their associate firms around the country. Others have made adjustments to previous years' data, and several have added in contributions from offices in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which were excluded in the past. 'I really think it is high time that outsiders were allowed to come in and inspect the books of the firms,' says Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing partner of Robson Rhodes, who pours scorn on their reliability. Other partners, especially those in firms with falling growth rates, argue that profitability is far more important than income. But unless they provide this information, they must expect speculation about their financial health to continue.</p>

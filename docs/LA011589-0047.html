			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS' PAY  </P> <P> In his letter published Jan. 1 in The Times, ("Blaming the Los Angeles School  Board for the Labor Woes of Teachers is Unfair") Leonard M. Britton,  superintendent of schools for Los Angeles, portrays Los Angeles teachers'  salaries as comparing favorably to those of teachers in Dade County, Fla.,  where he previously was superintendent. Unfortunately, he neglected to mention  the much greater cost of living in Los Angeles. Houses, for example, are much  more expensive in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Perhaps Britton hasn't come face to face with this economic dilemma as his  $141,000 salary quite likely has shielded him from it.  </P> <P> DONALD ZOELLNER  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P> <P> The writer is a former Los Angeles teacher.  </P></p>

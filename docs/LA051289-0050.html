			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> The Ashmolean, Britain's oldest museum, has put out an urgent appeal for $5.3  million to make up for cuts in government grants. The museum's director says  funds are needed to offset an annual deficit of $158,650 and avoid closing  galleries, cutting staff and charging admission. Entrance has been free since  the museum opened in 1683. The museum is a department of Oxford University and  has collections of antiquities, paintings and armor.

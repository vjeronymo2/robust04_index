			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Kenya has taken the prudent, safe step Sir, Your editorial 'Kenya's crisis' (March 24) fails to see the abyss into which Kenya is going into as a result of the latest reforms which were unaccompanied by the necessary and promised balance of payments support. The only prudent, practical and safe step was the reverse one taken which, contrary to your belief, was motivated by the national interests of Kenya. I believe the western governments and institutions endorsed the results of the Kenyan general elections in December 1992 in principle because they represented the will of the people, not because they foresaw a puppet. There should therefore be no bitterness against the person of the president, as is apparent in your editorial, or a suggestion for an externally supervised general election. Developing countries, with or without reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund, have for many years been struggling with the deteriorating terms of trade, inflation, unemployment, poverty and unfavourable exchange rates. IMF reforms are therefore not the cure-all prescriptions they are made to appear. Kenya went the extra mile while the other side baulked on its part of the agreement. No attempt should therefore be made to shift the blame from where it is due. M Ngali, Acting High Commissioner, Kenya High Commission, 45 Portland Place, London, W1N 4AS</p>

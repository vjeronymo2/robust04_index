He added that it is a priority to  hold a high-level meeting to coordinate joint actions. [Begin  recording]    Mulino: If the U.S. Government confirms it, we  will hold a meeting at the highest level in Panama during the  first week of July. I will preside over this meeting, and it is  to be attended by very important U.S. State and Justice  Department, perhaps even U.S. Treasury, officials to discuss all  the drug trafficking and money laundering problems.    As you will recall, on 13 April I sent a letter to U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher telling him that, instead  of talking and arguing whether we have cooperated or not, I  invited him to a high-level meeting in Panama to discuss this  topic. The invitation has been accepted and, hopefully, will be  held during the first week of July. [end recording]</p>

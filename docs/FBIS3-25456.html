			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Government news release issued in Bangui on 17 February; </F> read by Foreign Ministry spokesman Pierre-Benjamin Ngregaye]    [Text] To our great surprise, we learned on the radio that  the Central African Republic [CAR] allegedly allows weapons  belonging to the Sudanese Government's Army to cross its  territory, weapons that are said to be used to fight the Sudan  People's Liberation Army, SPLA. On 8 December 1993, the CAR  Government received a Sudanese Government delegation that had  come to request the CAR's help in resolving the Sudanese  problem. Sympathetic to this laudable request, the CAR  Government told the Sudanese delegation that the CAR  Government's priority was, first of all, to resolve the Chadian  problem in the southern part of this sister country.  Furthermore, the government reaffirmed its desire to make its  modest contribution -- in consultation with other African  countries -- to helping the brotherly Sudanese people settle  their tragedy.    The CAR Government, which was democratically elected at the  ballot box, favors dialogue and consultation. It has refused,  now refuses, and will always refuse to allow that its territory  be used to destabilize any brotherly neighboring country.  Therefore, faithful to its democratic tradition, the CAR  Government will unreservedly help protect the Sudanese refugees  currently living on its territory and also those from southern  Chad. At the moment, the CAR is proud to be hosting peace  negotiations between delegations from the Chadian Government and  its armed opponents operating in the southern part of Chad. The  CAR would also be proud to be available when the time comes to  help the Sudanese brothers achieve reconciliation.    Issued in Bangui on 17 February 1994    Signed: Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Charge of Relations  With French-Speaking Countries    [The same cast later notes that "Professor Simon  Bedaya-Ngaro, minister of foreign affairs in charge of relations  with French- speaking countries, this morning received His  Excellency al-Tijani Salih Fadayl, Sudan's ambassador to the  CAR. Their discussions centered on ways and means of  strengthening bilateral bonds of friendship and cooperation."]</p>

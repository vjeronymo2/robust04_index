			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Italy's Amato bows to verdict of referendums MR Giuliano Amato yesterday bowed out as leader of Italy's 51st post-war government, telling parliament the results of Sunday's referendums had brought an end to his 10-month-old four-party coalition. In a short but forceful speech the 54-year-old Socialist premier said only a new government could legitimately cope with the overwhelming vote for change registered in the eight referendums. Mr Amato is not expected to hand in his formal resignation until either today when parliament stages a one-day debate on the nature of a future government or until such a government is formed. President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has let it be known he would like to be in a position to invite a candidate to form a new government by the weekend. Mr Amato was heard mostly in sombre silence as he listed the country's problems in coming to terms with a political transition that risked a serious vacuum of power. He went out of his way to hold an olive branch to the former communist, Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). He said they had to be given the benefit of the doubt for having the courage to adopt a new political identity having left behind their communism. This appeared to be a major attempt to convince both Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, to support the next government, and to force the Christian Democrats to drop their opposition to the PDS. Mr Amato did not offer any justification of his time in office. Instead he urged the next government to maintain his policies of fiscal austerity, privatisation and focusing Italy towards its European vocation. He gave no hint as to whether he was prepared to continue as premier, but the tone of his speech suggested he was willing if asked. The onus of the choice would lie with parliament, reminding deputies if all those discredited by association with corruption scandals were now excluded, few groupings would be left. The end of the Amato government, composed of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals, came on a day when events dramatically underlined the collapse of the traditional parties. Mr Salvo Ando, the Socialist defence minister, was notified he was under investigation for alleged vote buying involving Mafia elements in his native Catania. He was the seventh member of Mr Amato's government to have been caught up in a corruption scandal. At the same time Mr Claudio Martelli, the former Socialist justice minister, received his third warning that he was under investigation for alleged corruption. This warning related to an alleged kickback of L400m (Pounds 165,500) on a power station contract at Brindisi for which his secretary, Mr Sergio Restilli, was also arrested. The day also saw Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician and seven times prime minister, appear for the third time before a Senate commission to argue against having his immunity waived for alleged Mafia associations. Meanwhile, Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, was questioned by a Belgian magistrate investigating alleged irregularities in the sale of Augusta helicopters to the Belgian armed forces.</p>

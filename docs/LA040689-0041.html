			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Award-winning Irish writer Christopher Nolan, who cannot walk, talk or control  his twitching limbs, has confirmed reports that his life story may be filmed by  producer Steven Spielberg. The 22-year-old author, called Ireland's new James  Joyce, hammered out his autobiography "Under the Eye of the Clock" with a  "unicorn" stick strapped to his forehead. Nolan's mother cupped his chin in her  hands as he reached laboriously for each letter on a specially adapted  typewriter. Last year, his book won Britain's literary prize, the $35,400  Whitbread Award, and was adapted into a play for the Dublin Theater Festival,  telling the story of how Nolan nearly died at birth from asphyxiation.

Meri has sharply criticized  B. Yeltsin's New Year address, in which the Russian president  advocated that the interests of the 25 million Russian citizens  living in the republics of the former Soviet Union be better  protected. In an interview with AP, Meri claimed in particular  that: "The words and tone used by Yeltsin could be evidence of  how weak democratic forces in Russia are. So Russia has chosen  the path of utilizing the aggressive policy typical of the  former USSR."</p>

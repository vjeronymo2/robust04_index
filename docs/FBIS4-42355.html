			<p>BFN     [Text] The ruling coalition is not only divided in the  Senate; it is also being lacerated by a fresh duel between  Umberto Bossi and Silvio Berlusconi. The outcome of this  personal battle is far from certain. Rocco Tolfa reports:    [Tolfa] Allies and antagonists, Bossi and Berlusconi are  united in the government, but Bossi and Berlusconi are also the  eternal duellists. Their relationship has always been stormy  and now it is becoming increasingly bitter in the run-up to the  European elections.    Umberto Bossi says that Berlusconi is the restorer of the  old  regime and the leader of an opportunist political movement which  Bossi compares to an empty box. Bossi has also fired a warning  shot at Berlusconi: We will not defend the government at all  costs.    Berlusconi is losing patience and says that those who  believe  in what Bossi says don't know anything. However, he refuses to  be more critical because he says that he does not want to create  tensions in his government and because he is convinced that  Bossi's outbursts will lose the Northern League votes.    The prime minister then passes a pitiless comment:  Gianfranco Fini is an ally on whim one can depend.</p>

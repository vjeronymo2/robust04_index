The Application for Refund was based on purchases of petroleum products the applicant used in its jet airliners. The DOE determined that the applicant had waived its right to receive money from the Crude Oil Subpart V Special Refund Proceeding. Accordingly, the Application for Refund was denied.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Koppers Company, Inc., et al., 9/1/94 RC272&hyph;241, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning Applications for Refund submitted in the Subpart V crude oil refund proceeding by Koppers Company, Inc. and eight of its subsidiaries. All nine of these Applications were previously granted. All of the applicants, however, were subsequently found to have been affiliated with Kaiser Sand &amp; Gravel (Kaiser) on August 7, 1986. Kaiser had filed in the Surface Transporters Stripper Well proceeding, and in doing so, Kaiser had executed a waiver and release waiving its rights and the rights of all its affiliates on August 7, 1986, to receive a crude oil overcharge refund. Accordingly, this Decision rescinded the original refunds granted to the nine applicants. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Inter City Texaco, 8/30/94 RR321&hyph;139 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The DOE issued a Decision and Order granting a Motion for Resconsideration filed on behalf of Inter City Texaco in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding. The DOE had previously rescinded a refund granted erroneously to Inter City (Case Nos. RF321&hyph;16561 and RF321&hyph;19481). Inter City had been granted a refund based on a schedule of purchases provided by Texaco, but the OHA later discovered that Inter City was supplied indirectly for the entire price control period. Inter City then filed a motion for reconsideration estimating its gallonage based on contemporaneous records referring to gallonage purchases from its supplier, Kenny Larson Oil. We therefore found that Inter City satisfied all the requirements necessary to obtain a refund in the Texaco proceeding and accordingly, Inter City's Motion for Reconsideration was granted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=3 --> Texaco Inc./Kenny Larson Oil Company, 8/29/94 RF321&hyph;20034 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Kenneth Larson filed an Application for Refund on behalf of Kenny Larson Oil Company (Larson) requesting a refund based on purchases of Texaco petroleum products. The DOE approved the application but, because Larson was in default in its obligations pursuant to a consent order, determined that the refund should be used to fund the firm's escrow account. Accordingly, the DOE issued a Decision and Order granting the Application and ordering that the refund amount be transferred from the Texaco Inc. escrow account to the Kenny Larson Oil Company escrow account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

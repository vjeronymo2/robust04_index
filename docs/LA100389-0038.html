			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> VOTERS FILL VACANT ASSEMBLY SEAT TODAY  </P> <P> Ending a race that has drawn national attention as a referendum on abortion,  voters in San Diego and Riverside counties will go to the polls today in a  special election to select a new state Assembly member in the 76th District.  </P> <P> After a four-month campaign marked by increasing acrimony in its final days,  voters will choose among four candidates -- two of them write-ins -- to fill  the vacancy created by the death last June of Assemblyman Bill Bradley  (R-Escondido).  </P> <P> Republican Tricia Hunter, a Bonita nurse who finished first in August's  eight-candidate primary, and Democrat Jeannine Correia, a teacher of the  retarded from Poway, head the field, which also includes two Republican  write-in candidates -- Poway businessman Dick Lyles and Lakeside accountant  Kirby Bowser.  </P> <P> Voters unsure of where to vote or those who experience other Election Day  problems may contact the Registrar of Voters office at 565-5800 for assistance.  The 76th District stretches from the South Bay to northeastern San Diego County  and into the desert communities of Riverside County.  </P> <P> During the primary, the 76th District contest generated intensive news coverage  as one of the first tests of the political fallout from last summer's U.S.  Supreme Court decision giving the states new powers to regulate abortions. Of  the six Republicans in the primary, only Hunter was pro-choice on the volatile  abortion issue -- a distinction that helped her draw backing from groups that  typically support Democrats.  </P> <P> The significance of the abortion issue has been diminished somewhat in the  runoff by the fact that Democrat Correia is, like Hunter, pro-choice. However,  the write-in candidacy of Lyles, who strongly opposes abortion, has kept the  issue alive as a potentially pivotal factor in the outcome.  </P> <P> In a race in which the unusual has been the norm, it perhaps is not surprising  that the results of today's race might not be known until Wednesday because of  the write-in ballots, particularly those cast for Lyles, who finished a close  second in the primary behind Hunter.  </P> <P> Election officials do not plan to count and verify most of the write-in ballots  cast at the polls today until Wednesday, though they will calculate the number  of write-ins cast. Therefore, if the number of write-in ballots is greater than  the number of votes cast for either Hunter or Correia, the election's outcome  will be uncertain until Wednesday.  </P></p>

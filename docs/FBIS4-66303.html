			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jiao Gang (3542 6921): "Proposals for New </F> Nonstaple Food Production Bases in Yunnan"]    [Text] Rural productive forces in Yunnan have grown by  leaps and bounds in th 14 years since reform began and the open  policy went under way, basically solving the problem of hunger.  However, the steady increase in urban population and the rising  level of consumption among urban and rural households as well as  changes in the mix of consumption have sharply boosted demand  for meat, eggs, milk, fruits, and vegetables. The encroachment  upon suburban land by ever-expanding cities, township and town  enterprises, and assorted development zones has also severely  weakened the ability of the outskirts to supply cities and  industrial and mining areas with agricultural byproducts. The  gap between the supply and demand of nonstaple food has widened.  How to narrow this gap promptly and effectively has become a  most urgent issue in social economic life in Yunnan.    The most fundamental way to ease the shortage of meat, eggs,  milk, fruits, vegetables, and other nonstaple food is to develop  a host of nonstaple food production bases with a steady supply  capability. This is the new demand of high-quality, high-yield,  and high-efficiency agriculture as well as an objective  requirement of deepening rural reform in Yunnan and preventing a  decline or instability in nonstaple food production in the  outskirts of cities. The construction of nonstaple food bases is  a piece of systems engineering that requires huge investments,  is slow to take effect, and involves all sorts of factors,  social, economic, and natural. Where should the bases be built?  On what scale? What should they produce? What role should they  play? What model should they follow? Where would the required  funds and technology come from? How? These strategic questions  pertaining to the construction of nonstaple food bases should  all be answered based on the requirements of objective economic  principles. The answers should have instructional significance  and can be used as guiding principles on a macro level.    Considering the reality in Yunnan's development, we should  build nonstaple food production bases along the rivers, along  railroads, and along the border, selecting from among those  areas designated by the state as key development zones, regional  urban centers, and border trade development areas. [passages  omitted]    Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases    1) The model for the construction of nonstaple food  production bases should be based on the specific conditions in  Yunnan and chart a path with local Yunnan characteristics. The  construction of production bases should be integrated with the  development of a high-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency  agriculture in the outskirts. It should revolve around the  modern suburban non-staple food production bases and be oriented  toward the market. It should make use of science and technology  and lead the peasants, special households, and Class 1 villages  in creating a nonstaple food production base model that  integrates agriculture closely with science, industry, and  commerce (trade) and melds production, supply, and marketing  into one. This development model has a dual function. On the one  hand, it is open to the inluence of the urban economy, producing  agricultural byproducts and supplying the cities with such  byproducts. On the other hand, it serves peasants in the  outskirts by organizing their production of nonstaple food and  sharing their risk.    2) The Distribution of Nonstaple Food Production Bases:  Basic  Ideas    [Passage omitted] The concentric circle with the city at the  center has indeed been the pattern of distribution of  agricultural production bases both in China and elsewhere since  ancient times. This gives the distribution of agricultural  production the following characteristics. First, the  agricultural population fans out from the city, losing in  density the further you go from the center. Second, per capita  farmland increases the further you go from the center. Third,  the standard of agricultural production drops the further one  moves from the center. Fourth, the degree of agricultural  commercialization and the level of technology drop off. Fifth,  an increasing percentage of the agricultural output is  transported elsewhere to be sold. Sixth, the further from the  center, the less polluted agricultural byproducts are.    Besides taking into account a variety of social, economic,  and natural factors, we must also consider moving the point of  lowest costs and site the bases at different levels based on the  concentric circle pattern.    a) Bases for the production of meat, milk, and eggs as  commodities in the outskirts. Expand, improve, and upgrade the  existing pig bases at Fumin, Yiliang, and Jinning and the Fumin  poultry and egg bases, turning them soon into pork, egg, and  milk production bases in the outskirts that both are  comprehensive and have their own respective focuses. In the wake  of the development of the Kunming urban region and that of the  Lanping lead and zinc mine, we should build three suburban meat,  milk, and egg production bases one after another in the Eighth  Five-Year Plan and the early part of the Ninth Five-Year Plan in  order to satisfy the demand of Kunming, Dali, and the industrial  and mining areas as well as the special needs of tourists. By  the year 2000, the combined meat output of meat, milk, and egg  production bases in the outskirts should be 99,000 tons, up 66.4  percent from the level in 1990, for an average annual growth  rate of 5.2 percent. Total annual milk output is projected to be  66,000 tons, for an average annual growth rate of 6.8 percent.  Combined annual egg output will be 17,000 tons, for an average  annual growth rate of 4.3 percent.    B. Pork production bases in the outer suburbs and outside  the  cities. Further consolidate and improve the existing 17  commercial pork producing base-counties. Then we should build  on that achievement by gradually adjusting the distribution of  the bases, shifting the focus to the southwestern and southern  parts of the province and forming a cluster of bases to supply  major cities including Kunming, Gejiu, and Qujing, and key  opened tourist areas like Dali, Dehong, and Xishuangbanna with  fresh products in the main, while putting equal emphasis on the  production and supply of ham, juanti, and other specialty items.  In addition, six pig bases including Simao, Jinghong, Binchuan,  and Midu should be built in stages to serve the border ports and  tourist areas. By the year 2000 base counties should have a  total of 4,623,000 pigs in stock and produce 403,000 tons of  pork, boosting the slaughter rate from 70 to 77 percent.    C. Beef production bases. Go all out to develop beef bases  and beef, milk, and leather processing. This is where a  breakthrough can be achieved to rationalize the structure of  Yunnan's animal husbandry industry and create an export-oriented  grain-conserving animal husbandry industry. Commercial beef  bases should be concentrated in southern and central Yunnan,  home to large numbers of Hui people. Special pains should be  taken to develop beef bases in southwestern and southern Yunnan.  After the five beef bases of Xindian, Nanjian, Weishan,  Guangnan, and Funing are upgraded, 11 other bases should be  built, including Eshan, Shizhong, Changning, Tengchong,  Zhenxiong, and Zhaotong. They should orient themselves to  Kunming and the neighboring areas and concentrate on the  production of high-quality fresh beef, before gradually  branching out into the processing business and developing  specialty items for the domestic and overseas markets. By the  year 2000, base counties should have 1,885,000 cattle on hand,  up from the 1,626,000 in 1990, and slaughter 204,000 cattle, up  from 63,000 in 1990. The annual beef output will also rise to  9,500 tons by the year 2000, up from 2,800 tons.    D. Mutton bases. Mutton from Yunnan goats is quite popular  in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and various Southeast Asian nations. The  pace of building mutton bases should be accelerated. By the year  2000, besides consolidating and improving the three bases of  Shuangbai, Dayao, and Luquan, three other new bases --Chuxiong,  Lengling, and Jingdong -- should be built gradually so that  bases in central Yunnan produce black mutton while bases in  Longling produce yellow mutton. Improve quality, better  processing, and increase exports. By the year 2000, the bases  should have 1,174,000 sheep on hand and slaughter 195,000  animals annually, yielding 3,11 tons of mutton.    E. Dairy products base. Continue to build up the Eryuan cow  milk base and Lunan milch goat base . Improve processing,  packaging, and storage technologies. Work hard to increase the  output of such specialty items as ruyan and milk biscuits, which  are highly popular among consumers. Build Huaping and Jianchuan  dairy bases. Open up a dairy products market in the industrial  and mining areas centered on Pangang. By the year 2000, Eryuan  and Huaping shall have a total of 36,000 milk cows on hand,  producing 54,000 tons of milk and turning out enough cheese to  meet the demand of the Kunming and Dali tourist areas. In  addition, they shall gradually increase the output of a coherent  series of dairy products and diligently cultivate the consumer  markets in southwestern Yunnan and the neighboring countries.  Between them Lunan and Jianchuan shall have 139,000 milk goats  on hand, producing 3,800 tons of milk. Lunan County shall  produce 550 tons of milk biscuits each year, its primary markets  being Kunming and the Shilin tourist area.    F. Commercial poultry and egg bases. To make sure the needs  of such key industrial and mining areas as Gejiu and Manwan are  met, commercial poultry and egg bases will be built over time  during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. By the year 2000 annual fresh  egg output shall reach 838 tons and poultry, 1,435 tons.    G. Distribution of vegetable bases. There are four basic  considerations behind the distribution of vegetable bases.  First, consolidate and improve the old bases outside Kunming,  Dongchuan, Dali, Chixiong, and Yuxi, creating specialized  production bases of an appropriate scale which concentrate on  upscale niche vegetables and other out-of-season vegetables.  Second, in the short haul outer suburbs and mid-range suburbs  should specialize in vegetables with a mass demand. Third,  places in the periphery of Kunming like Tonghai, Yuanjiang,  Yuanmou, and Binchuan should set up a number of export-oriented  vegetable production and processing bases, focusing on early  winter vegetables. Fourth, build vegetable bases along the  rivers, along railroads, and along the border, in other words,  namely the main paths of growth in the province in the future.    a) Develop new specialized commercial vegetable production  bases with a combined area of 70,000 mu at such points as  Baoshan, Tengchong, Luxi, Lanping, Yunlong, Yun County, Jinggu,  and Simao in the Lancang valley. The average yield per mu shall  be 2,000 kilograms. Required investment: 28 million yuan.    b) Build new bases in Yuanjiang, Tonghai, and Dongchuan with  a combined area of 5,000 mu to develop improved vegetable  varieties. They shall supply 2,400 tons of improved vegetable  varieties each year and 1 ton of hybrid seeds. Required  investment: 6 million yuan.    c) It will require an investment of 6 million yuan to  improve  and consolidate 30,000 mu of newly opened vegetable growing  areas near the central cities in central and eastern Yunnan  along the Nanning-Kunming Railroad and Kunming-Hekou Railroad.    H. The distribution of fruit production bases. In the future  fruit production bases should be clustered around the key  regions--central cities, key development zones--and be built in  stages.    Stage 1 (1993-1995): 1.5 million mu under fruit cultivation  (including 600,000 mu under joint commodity production). Of the  total output of 450,000 tons, commercial output accounts for  150,000 tons, or 12 kilograms per capita.    Stage 2 (1996-2000). Between 2 million and 2.2 million mu  are  under fruit cultivation (including 1 million mu under joint  commodity production). Of the total output of 800,000 tons,  commercial output makes up 400,000 tons, or 21 kilograms per  capita, which would place Yunnan near the national average.    Build a million mu of high-quality high-yield orchards by  the  year 2000 through the distribution of different varieties in  different stages and at different levels. Create a mango belt,  the largest in the nation, based on Yuanjiang and Xinping in the  upper and middle reaches of Hong He; a banana belt, based on  Hekou, Hong He, and Yuanyang in the lower reaches of Hong He; an  apple belt, based on Ningliang, Lijiang, and Zhaotong in  northwestern and northeastern Yunnan; an orange and tangerine  belt, based on Huaning, Jianshui, Luxi, and Shiping in  Nanpanjiang; and a high-quality pear and peach belt, based on  Kunming, Chuxiong, and Dali. This will put an end to the  fragmentation that characterizes fruit growing in Yunnan and  allows large quantities of marketable fruit to make their way  from the valleys to the market. Right now the people of Yunnan,  blessed as they are with ample natural resources, eat Shandong  apples, Hebei pears, and sweet oranges from Guangdong. The  build-up of fruit production bases should change that situation  fundamentally.    a) Special aquatic breeding bases. We should be realistic  enough to see that as an inland province, Yunnan has limited  potential in the aquatic industry. Its future here lies in  intelligent distribution and in concentrating on the development  of a number of high-value and sophisticated special, unique or  rare aquatic products, thus offsetting its quantitative weakness  with high-quality, well-priced, and unusual products and  creating a new look in aquatic production. Bases for the  production of soft-shelled turtle, lobster, river crab,  California perch, rainbow trout, and bullfrog may be built in  places like Kunming, Xishuangbanna, Hekou, Yuanyang, and Dehong.  These bases should operate on a substantial scale and orient  themselves to such markets as those in Kunming, key port cities,  and other provinces.    3. Strategy for the Construction of Nonstaple Food  Production  Bases    1) Adopt new thinking. Right now vegetable production and  sales are booming. We should take advantage of this momentum  and, making the best use of the situation, promptly adjust our  guiding principle by adopting unequivocally a new philosophy for  the development of the vegetable industry. Raise the standing of  vegetables in the urban and rural economies, particularly the  latter. Remove vegetable growing from diversified operations and  turn it into an independent industry in its own right on a par  with grain growing, animal husbandry, and township and town  enterprises. That will increase to four the number of major  players in the rural economy in many counties and municipalities  in the outskirts of cities: enterprises, grain, animal  husbandry, and vegetables. Localities with the necessary  wherewithal may go into the timber industry, fruit growing, and  fish breeding, diversifying their economies in the course of  time.    2) Strengthen the market mechanism. For one thing, we must  organize the production and sales of vegetables, fruit, aquatic  products, and other nonstaple food based on what the market  wants, adhering firmly to the direction of upgrading. Guided by  the new work philosophy, the departments concerned must provide  peasants who grow vegetables and fruit with accurate information  and comprehensive coordinated services in technological matters,  transportation, and storage. This is essential to building a  base-county. Secondly, an effort should be made to ensure  success in superstructure construction by setting up a host of  new high-standard large-scale special markets and wholesale  markets. In the course of time there should be a nonstaple food  market system that is intelligently distributed, well-equipped,  easily accessible, and scientifically managed. We should work to  make it more and more appealing and influential. Thirdly, we  should go all out to open up the markets in other cities and  then move into Southeast Asia, securing for ourselves a foothold  in the international market.    3) Sources of funding for base construction. Nonstaple food  base construction is characterized by the large amount of  investment required over a long period of time. Accordingly what  is needed is a sound investment policy with diversified funding  sources. Some of the inputs should come from the state, some  from the producers, and some from the consumers as well. The  enthusiasm of the state, localities, local peasants, and all  social quarters for base construction should be fully tapped.  Initially, money for base construction may come from these  possible source: a) Appropriations by the local government; b)  appropriations by the central treasury; c) bank loans; d)  fund-raising by peasants; e) idle funds in all social quarters  in the city; f) foreign funds. At the moment, the state and  local governments are the main financiers of the construction of  non-staple food bases. However, this uniform pattern of funding  does nothing to accelerate the building of new bases. Of the  funding sources mentioned above, the most ignored hitherto are  e) and f). As the open policy is broadened, foreign capital has  also become an important source of funds to build nonstaple food  bases in key areas. In addition, expanding lateral economic  cooperation between different sectors and regions in funding,  technology, qualified personnel, and commodities that is  mutually beneficial and that is complementary is also an  effective way to solve problem relating to funds, technology,  and qualified personnel that may occur in base development.    4) Adopt a business and management model that integrates  agriculture with trade and industry. Traditionally the  agricultural sector was solely concerned with production; no  external environment and basic conditions for participating in  processing and circulation existed. Even as they overhaul their  thinking, therefore, base-counties must work extra hard to  integrate agriculture with industry and trade and branch out  into non-staple food processing and circulation. Leading bodies  at all levels should encourage and support their subordinate  units in operations linking production and marketing. The  primary processing, multiple processing, and other forms of  sophisticated processing of nonstaple food allied to the raw  materials products of a base should be tackled energetically, as  should the development of foreign-exchange-earning and  export-oriented agriculture and processing. The leading  departments should also guide the entry of these units into the  circulation arena, add value to nonstaple food without  interruption, and increase the incomes of peasants and herdsmen.  For a province like Yunnan with its underdeveloped commodity  economy these issues assume additional urgency and importance.    5) Step up the macro-regulation and control of bases. The  construction of nonstaple food bases is critical to upgrading  Yunnan's food industry and satisfying the market demand in the  1990's. After we have planned their distribution intelligently,  conducted scientific verification, and incorporated them into  national economic construction in stages, we should step up  close leadership in earnest and strengthen macro regulation and  control. First, project management should be adopted for every  kind of nonstaple food base. A project should be approved only  after rigorous examination. Project management methods should  also be worked out. Input and output should be strictly linked.  Inspection should be tightened and evaluation methods should be  formulated. After a project is completed, it should be inspected  before acceptance. Group contracting should be adopted for  comprehensive development projects, bringing together the  leaders, technical cadres, and the masses. Inputs like  policies, technology, funds, and materials should be coordinated  and services rendered in a coherent manner. Responsibility  contracts should be signed at each level and scientific and  technical contracting should be adopted, thus linking wages and  bonuses to how well or how poorly a job is done,  responsibilities to rights and profits. Scientific and technical  contracting should be used to widen income differences; S&amp;T  personnel with outstanding contributions should be heavily  rewarded. Where a project is poorly executed or funds have been  wasted, the leaders and other individuals involved should be  held liable. [passage omitted]</p>

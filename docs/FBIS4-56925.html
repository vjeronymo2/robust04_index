			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Perez Balladares and National Consensus"] </F>   [Text] The civic example of absolute harmony demonstrated  by the Panamanian people last Sunday, the unusually positive  position assumed by the national government of Guillermo Endara  Galimany, and the clean elections sponsored by the Supreme  Electoral Tribunal make it compelling for the new president of  the Republic, Ernesto Perez Balladares, who was elected on that  date, to strive for a national consensus, as an historic  response to the popular referendum mentioned above. The  Panamanians' selecting him to head the destiny of the nation for  the next five years demonstrates unequivocally their great  confidence in his levelheadedness and intelligence and his  ability to carry out such a complex task, much desired by the  citizens. Last Sunday's events and the entire electoral  process, in which not a single incident occurred to mar or  create a lack of confidence in the pureness of the elections,  demands of the winning candidate -- in this case Perez  Balladares -- a supremely lofty attitude, above all resentments  or wounds that might have resulted from the civic confrontation  that just ended. Now, only the official proclamation by the  National Electoral Board is pending.    We understand perfectly well the traditional political and  moral commitments acquired in the Panamanian elections. We know  about the political positions that are distributed among the  parties and alliances that offer their support for the victory  of a person who at a given moment reaches the presidency. We  believe that it is an act of justice to govern with friends and  with political supporters. Perez Balladares, however, who  unofficially is Panama's president- elect in view of the results  of last Sunday's elections, has thus taken on one of the most  significant commitments in the country. He has ceased to be an  alliance candidate and has become -- as he himself promised --  the president of all Panamanians. The emotion of victory must  not blind those who were favored by the electors. Having lost  must not become a reason for bitterness on the part of those who  did not obtain the people's support. The new president must  face significant challenges. First, he must face a wealthy  opposition, which can only be neutralized through a national  consensus that will offer participation in the administrative  handling of state affairs to the best men. This situation must  be understood by his own party members. It must be recognized  that the organization demonstrated by the Democratic  Revolutionary Party in last Sunday's elections shows it has  capable men who could also form part of a government team,  seeking to achieve the purposes outlined in the program  announced so many times by the new president.    He pledged to the Panamanian people that he would govern  without hate or rancor. The bitter taste of the political  confrontations must be buried in the past. The experience of  revenge, which diverted the current government and which totally  disrupted efforts at national reconciliation, must serve as a  lesson to the new president. There is a given fact. To strive  for this national consensus requires the consent of both  political groups that were opponents in the bid to secure the  support of the people, as well as those distinguished citizens  whose participation will be sought. Thus far, the composition of  the Legislative Assembly, which must begin holding sessions on 1  September, is not known. It is important that the president, no  matter who or what party is involved, have the necessary  capability to achieve harmony and respect their autonomy. This  is the only way to promote and achieve the social reality of the  programs that must be carried out by the Executive Branch.  Perez Balladares must also realize the other challenge placed  in his hands by the Panamanian people: implementation of the  most important stages of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties. The  people are aware that nobody would be better suited than a  student of General Omar Torrijos to implement a contractual  agreement that emerges from the very heart of the country.    There will be many other challenges that can only be  implemented through national consensus. The nation needs a  president who will be of all Panamanians, who will assume a  genuine leadership, and who will be aware of the historic moment  that he must cope with. We always have had trust in Perez  Balladares' promises. Those who got on yesterday's horse to  spur it and break it did not succeed. With his good sense, his  levelheadedness, and above all, his absolute certainty that he  was acting in the best manner, he was able to secure the support  of the Panamanian people in the purest elections in our history.  The country's political circumstances are different now. Our  democracy has been strengthened. We dare say that the virtual  president, Perez Balladares, will not let the Panamanian people  down and that his fundamental objectives will be to respect  liberty, free enterprise, workers' achievements, and democracy.  For this, he will have to count on the support of all citizens,  regardless of their color, social or economic position, or party  persuasion.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Architecture: Mausoleum mountain - Colin Amery discusses whether the Getty Center makes sense It looks like the ruins of the Potala Palace in Tibet. The huge bulk of its soaring solid walls rising out of the rocky hill-top dominates the view from the San Diego freeway. This is Los Angeles, and what looks like a giant film-set for a major historical movie turns out to be the still-unfinished Getty Center. What is slowly growing beneath the cranes is a college of culture - a series of buildings around courtyards where the most arcane aspects of the visual and decorative arts will be studied. When he won the competition to design the centre in 1984, Richard Meier, a New York architect, described it as 'the architectural commission of the century'. Many people in the art world and in Los Angeles are now wondering whether it will ever be completed. Today, the estimated final construction cost is not far short of Dollars 750m. The plans show some 1.6m sq ft of buildings, a figure which was quadrupled during the long planning period. Why has it taken so long, and why did the Getty Trust decide to build what is a new university with a museum in it? It looks as though 10 years of wearying debate between the academic factions at the Getty have been the major reason for the slow progress of the project. The choice of site - 600 acres of hilly terrain in Brentwood, in West Los Angeles - has necessitated massive excavation and also complex negotiations with the neighbours, who are concerned about the arrival of a cultural Disneyland on their doorstep. The choice of a famous architect with a defined philosophy has inevitably prolonged the exercise. Richard Meier was a predictable choice when you look at the composition of the competition jury. He was famous in the 1980s for his museums in Germany, and for the High museum in Atlanta, Georgia. His white metal-clad cubist houses brought a disciplined and cruel symmetry to the minimal homes of the super-rich. His work is abstract, and he uses only the history of a brief period of modernism as his palette. There was such a predictability about his white buildings in the 1970s and '80s that he became known as the 'Frigidaire architect', and many doubts have been expressed about his suitability for the Getty. The magnificent site demands the opposite of a clinical approach, so the question has to be asked: does a random scattering of cubist elements, some clad in stone, some in white metal, significantly enrich the Los Angeles landscape? The symbolism of these hermetic blocks on top of a mountain does not suggest that the Getty is particularly concerned about making fine art an accessible part of life. Conservationists, acquisitive curators and academics are a bad combination when it comes to museums. Inevitably, they feel proprietorial about their collections, and are often unable to make their researches more relevant than a secret shared among a few competitive colleagues. The idea for a campus of six main buildings, each one dedicated to different aspects of art preservation and education, was to bring together a college of experts on one site to ensure harmonious dialogue and a stimulating atmosphere for research. The Getty is being built at a time when the great information explosion and advances in computer technology have made it completely unnecessary to have all your scholars and books and collections in one place. Building a home for some of the most important and most expensive works of art in the world on top of a mountain in a city regularly threatened by earthquakes is risky. Great sums of money have been spent to try and ensure that the centre can withstand major shocks. There has also been vast expenditure on landscaping and tree-planting to satisfy the neighbours' demands for an almost invisible building. Three years into the construction programme the only completed buildings are the vast underground garage and a tram station for the funicular that will give visitors a ride around the site. It is important to remember that the Getty has huge grant-making and educational programmes which have a more useful and less visible impact on the world than this monumental project. But it is the work of Richard Meier that will leave the greatest impression. There is considerable unhappiness about the removal of so many great works of art from around the world to this mountain-top mausoleum. The scale of the museum's wealth means that however carefully it buys, it will be seen as predatory and reactionary in its desire to own so much for itself. The fact that the British government decided not to let the sculpture of the Three Graces go to the Getty is a small signal that the days of its domination in the art market may be over, at least for now.</p>

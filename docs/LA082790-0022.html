			<p><P> August 27, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> COLOMBIA;  </P> <P> DRUG LORDS TARGET EUROPE, REPORT SAYS  </P> <P> Colombian drug cartels and the Mafia are building a cocaine empire in Western  European countries, which have replaced the United States as the biggest market  for the drug, Bogota's El Tiempo newspaper reported, citing a joint study by  the international police organization Interpol and the Colombian intelligence  police. The Bogota offices of both Interpol and the intelligence police were  closed Sunday, and no one could be reached for comment. The European market  will continue to grow because of the Italian Mafia's intention to preserve its  distribution monopoly and the Colombian cartels' desire to capture part of the  market, according to the study.  </P></p>

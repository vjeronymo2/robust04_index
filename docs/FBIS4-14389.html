			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 28 Apr (MENA)--The Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators today resumed their talks on the implementation of  the Gaza-Jericho agreement.    Palestinian sources said that the security and legal  committees stemming from the negotiations are now formulating  the points agreed on during the talks held in the past few days  and trying to resolve issues that have not yet been resolved.    The sources added that the negotiators are waiting for the  outcome of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat's talks with  Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and also the outcome of Presidents  'Arafat and Husni Mubarak's talks, which will have direct  bearing on overcoming the disputed points between the  Palestinians and Israelis.    The sources expect the two sides to reach an agreement next  week on implementing the Gaza-Jericho agreement in preparation  for the signing of the agreement by Palestinian President  'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin under President  Husni Mubarak's auspices.</p>

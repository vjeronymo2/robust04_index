			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] His majesty the king and Her Majesty Queen Nur  returned home this afternoon following a trip which included  visits to the United Kingdom, the United States, Croatia, and  Austria. [passage omitted]    His majesty told the "News at Ten" that his talks with  American leaders were characterized with openness and frankness.    [Begin recording] [Husayn] I believe it was a very  successful one and it came at a good time. It gave me the  opportunity to meet not only with the President but with all the  top officials there. It was characterized by openness and  frankness, and I think a genuine desire, I note, to see our  relations develop and grow and to give meaning to the word  partnership in terms of the efforts of all to achieve a just and  comprehensive peace in this region.    [Correspondent Maha al-Sha'ir] During your many meetings in  Washington, you reiterated Jordan's commitment to a  comprehensive peace settlement. Do you feel that there are  pressures on Jordan to go ahead individually to sign a peace  agreement?    [Husayn] I think I have suggested more than once that in the  past,there were suggestions that Jordan should ratify a peace  treaty then begin to negotiate the terms of the peace treaty.  This has not been accepted by us, and it is not the right  approach, in my view, at all. So, right now, I believe, we are  engaged in discussing the items on the agenda, which are part of  the process leading to the establishment of a final  comprehensive peace between us.    [Al-Sha'ir] Your majesty, do you want to say anything about  Na'ib al-Ma'ayitah's assassination in Beirut?    [Husayn] I am more than angered and more than saddened by  this kind of vicious crime. We have paid dearly in blood in the  past for our principles, our ideals, and our fight for life.  And I do not think that there are any in this world who can  intimidate this country. It is not an individual or a group of  people that may fall. And that is normal, all of us are going  to die some time, sooner or later. And it is all in God's  hands. But nobody can murder a nation, and I think here we have  a nation that stands proud and will continue to stand proud, and  will never be intimidated by cowards and cowardly acts.

			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Asean compromises on trade group THE Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean) has reached a messy, last-minute compromise on the future of a controversial Malaysian plan to establish an east Asian trade group excluding the US and Australia, writes Victor Mallet from Singapore. Asean's six foreign ministers agreed that the proposed East Asia Economic Caucus (Eaec) would be within the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation (Apec) forum - the broader organisation which does include the US, Australia and Japan - but would also be able to meet outside the context of the Apec. A dispute over the relative merits of the Eaec and Apec has soured relations between Malaysia and Indonesia, and between Asean and the US. Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysian prime minister, has argued that the Apec will be dominated by the US, and he differed from his Asean colleagues by bluntly refusing to attend an Apec summit planned by President Bill Clinton in November. The US has opposed the Eaec, and persuaded Japan and South Korea not to join, on the grounds that it could become a protectionist trading bloc. Japan, which has said that it cannot make a decision on the EAEC until Asean has reached a consensus, will now face pressure from Malaysia to join the caucus. The Asean compromise, however, is a confused one, since it suggests both that the Eaec will have an independent existence, guided by Asean economic ministers (the Malaysian position), and that the Eaec will simply be a caucus within Apec (the Indonesian position). Mr Gareth Evans, Australian foreign minister, welcomed the Asean compromise in that it 'recognises the primacy of the Apec'.</p>

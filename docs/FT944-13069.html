			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Labour MP unhappy with auditing of Conservative Party's Accounts Mr Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP, has complained to the Institute of Chartered Accountants about the auditing of the Conservative party's accounts, Jim Kelly writes. Mr Mitchell has written to Mr Andrew Colquhoun, institute president, alleging that the audit by Coopers &amp; Lybrand for the 1993-94 accounts is deficient. He says the absence of information about the source of donations amounting to Pounds 9.4m undermines the ability of the accounts to provide a 'true and fair view'. Mr Paul Judge, director-general of Conservative Central Office, said Coopers &amp; Lybrand is one of the most reputable firms in the world. Coopers &amp; Lybrand said it could not comment on the case of a client.</p>

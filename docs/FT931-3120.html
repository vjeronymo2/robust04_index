			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Unpaid tax at Pounds 900m in 1991 THE INLAND Revenue wrote off nearly Pounds 900m in unpaid taxes in 1991  - an increase of 55 per cent over the previous year, David Owen writes. The disclosure, covering the latest year for which figures are available, came in a written Commons answer from Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury. The sum written off in 1990 totalled nearly Pounds 569m, he indicated in reply to Mr Archie Kirkwood, the Liberal Democrat MP for Roxburgh and Berwickshire. In a separate answer, Mr Dorrell disclosed the findings of an independent survey suggesting that one in three employed taxpayers were dissatisfied with the service received from the Inland Revenue. A survey conducted by Research International, a market research group in June 1992 found that only 65 per cent of employed and self-employed taxpayers were satisfied. Mr Dorrell said the Inland Revenue planned to survey other taxpaying groups to establish their present satisfaction levels and service preferences, and to repeat the surveys at 'appropriate intervals'.</p>

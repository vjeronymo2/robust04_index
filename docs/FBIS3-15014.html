			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address to Supreme Council session by Head of State Eduard </F> Shevardnadze in Tbilisi; broadcast in progress -- live]    [Excerpts] ... regulations which are of vital importance  for Georgia. Batoni [Georgian polite form of address for males]  Givi Lominadze started to enumerate them but then stopped.  Kanbatoni [Georgian polite form of address of females] Manana  mentioned the second clause. Please, listen carefully to my  reiteration. I will remind you once again. Clause three:  territorial integrity and the refusal to act in order to divide  other country's territory is of vital importance. Refusal to  use force against a member-state's political independence.  Resolving the argument by peaceful means so that international  peace and justice are not endangered. One more important  regulation -- the supremacy of international law in inter-state  relations, non-interference in each other's internal and foreign  affairs. I would like to stress this phrase, as it was  mentioned here that the CIS gives Russia free rein to interfere  in the affairs of others. What may happen in actual fact is  another matter, and maybe we have grounds for suspicion, but I  am merely telling you what regulations and realities we are  about to join and what we recognize and what we decline.    Guaranteeing human rights and basic freedoms in every aspect  irrespective of race, ethnic origin, language, religion, and so  on. This phrase may give rise to a certain doubt but it is the  standard recognized by the whole world. [passage omitted]    The possibility of breaching the agreement which we are  joining is another issue and in principle, probably, it is  difficult to rule it out, but it is better if we joined this  agreement, this document together with other countries with  which we have many things in common, rather than stay out of it.  [passage omitted]    Let me remind you of something. Of course, it is not a  normal situation -- and I am speaking quite sincerely -- when a  head of state takes such a decision without asking Parliament  and the people. Some may say that I acted irresponsibly, while  others may say that I usurped my authority. I would like to  remind you in a couple of words when and why I took that  decision. And I would appreciate your understanding. [passage  omitted]    After the disaster and tragedy unfolded in Abkhazia and we  lost Abkhazia and -- please, pay special attention to this and  your understanding will be appreciated -- after Kobalia's units  came to the approaches of Kutaisi and Tskhaltubo was almost  captured and after civil war became inevitable, a civil war had  already begun in Georgia. Let me remind you that I believed  that we were almost doomed to a large-scale bloodbath. [passage  omitted]    It was during those tragic days that I visited Moscow and  asked them to protect the railways and our ports. You remember  very well the days when they seized and sacked Poti and  Samtredia. All links to Tbilisi and elsewhere were cut off.  And the stock of flour and bread in Tbilisi was only enough for  three or four days. It is hard to imagine a more difficult  situation.    Therefore, at my request, the presidents of Armenia and  Azerbaijan were invited to Moscow, together with me. The four  [including Yeltsin] met there and came to the conclusion that a  great tragedy might happen not only to Georgia but also the  Transcaucasus.    An agreement in principle was reached to protect the  arteries  somehow. It was agreed that we would decide the rest ourselves.    It was indeed so dramatic and tragic personally for me and  probably many of you as well in those days that I must have  spoken 10 times with the Black Sea Admiral Baltin. I told him  that if he thought my presence necessary I would fly to  Sevastopol and meet the personnel. I told him that he had to  help the [Georgian] authorities to regain Poti somehow,  otherwise hunger and disaster would be inevitable or,  alternatively, we had another option of giving up as the  dialogue was impossible both with Gamsakhurdia supporters and  the leader of the movement. I do not want to mar his name now.  We were left with no other option and then I profusely thanked  the man [Baltin] who took responsibility on his shoulders and  sent several warships to Poti. It was then that the capital and  the country were practically saved, if it can be called saving.  Georgia has not yet been saved but the prerequisites for it to  have been created.    In those days and under such conditions and taking into  consideration all that had preceded it, I made this decision [to  join the CIS]. Please, do not forget either that [changes  thought]... there are witnesses, Baluashvili, deputy prosecutor  general, must be present here. Witnesses have been  interrogated. Chechen, Cossack, Abkhaz and mercenaries of other  nationalities armed to the teeth entered Zugdidi. I personally  visited those houses in Senaki and Khobi where they would spend  the night, where people got shot. Let us go and ask the native  population of that region. These are facts, it is a reality.  Therefore, I may be tried, it may happen. I may be sentenced  to death through shooting or hanging, but when one is sure that  there is no other solution and that this solution may save the  people and the country, then I think that one must not shirk the  responsibility and I did not do so. You are free to condemn my  behavior. Then I made a decision that Georgia had to join the  CIS. [passage omitted]    Valeriy Kvaratskhelia voiced an interesting point. He said  one sentence to which we did not pay appropriate attention. He  asked if entry into the CIS means a certain limiting of those  forces in Russia about which Yeltsin spoke in Tbilisi. Will it  mean that they will be limited? Yeltsin said that there were  forces in Russia, starting from Alaska and as far as the  Ukraine, if I remember correctly, who are considering and  dreaming of reinstating the empire. [passage omitted]    If certain forces in Russia come to power, they must know  that there is another force, that there is the CIS. Russia then  will have to leave the CIS. I repeat, it is not a guarantor but  one of the factors.    He [Yeltsin] uttered several significant phrases which have  to be reckoned with as well. We have mentioned one of these  issues several times before. He put it like this: Russia  remains responsible for the disruption of talks on the Abkhaz  issue. It was a difficult thing to bring oneself to saying  this, it was not easy. In principle, I agree with Tedo  Paatashvili who said that whoever may be the leader of Russia,  Georgia must try to maintain normal relations with Russia. It  is a reality. History and God require so. Many things have to  be taken into consideration in relations with a great country.  [passage omitted]    What affect will it have on the visit to the United States  if  parliament ratifies this document today? I am grateful to those  deputies who expressed their alarm that it may hinder us in  achieving a certain success. I have a slightly different  principle. I have always had different principles. We must  pursue honest politics. I am not going to use the ratification  of this document as, so to say, a trump card in a dialogue with  the U.S. administration. We have different kind of relations  with the United States. A lot has been said here that there are  no activists in the West who view Georgia's joining the CIS as a  positive event. It is not true. It is a well-known fact in the  United States of America and other western countries that  Georgia had no other option. What path could we follow? We  must use this factor, we have a possibility for it, use the CIS  and simultaneously cooperate with everybody. We have relevant  guarantees that nobody is going to limit us in doing so, and  nobody could. [passage omitted]    I would like to clarify something. Why did we not send two  divisions to Sukhumi? It is a question of principle. We had  the possibility to do so then. Not only because Gia  [Karkarashvili] and Irakli [Batiashvili] said they would resign.  No. I still believed; to be more accurate, I did not believe  that we would betray each other in the battle for Sukhumi. I  did not believe it. There were 8,000 men at the approaches to  Sukhumi with equipment and every means. Some 4,000 more men  were approaching from Ochamchire and were nearly at the  approaches to Gulripshi rayon. Disaster happened. We betrayed  each other and in principle, I could not imagine that betrayal  of such degree and on such scale would be possible, but I do not  want you to imagine that I am alleviating another country's  blame for this. I believed and trusted that all of us were  united then, both the former president's supporters, Kobalia,  and others. I believed it and could not imagine that we could  betray each other so. Therefore, I am stressing this fact for  the sake of establishing the truth.    The rest must be thought out well. As Zurab Zhvania has  said, what will happen if we do not join the CIS? It will be a  long discussion. Let us look thoroughly at our present  conditions and our future conditions. Therefore, the people,  the nation, the country, and the state which are under these  circumstances do not have the right to refuse even the slightest  chance which is being given to us by nature and God in order to  save ourselves. Please, listen with understanding to those  arguments which I mentioned in my brief letter given to you and  my speech. Thank you.</p>

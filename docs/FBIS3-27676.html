			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Zhang Junsheng and Zhu Yucheng Stress That the </F> White Paper Misleads Public Opinion"]    [Text] Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong  Kong Branch, criticized the British side for unilaterally  publishing the British-compiled White Paper on Representative  Government in Hong Kong without Sino-British consultations and  said this deceives the community and misleads public opinion.  He said that the Chinese side will surely make a necessary  response.    After attending a private activity yesterday (24 February),  Zhang Junsheng said that the Sino-British talks on arrangements  for the 1994-95 elections have been thoroughly ruined by the  British side and the fact that the British side takes this  action now moves it farther and farther away from the road of  Sino-British cooperation.    As for cooperation between China and Britain in other areas  such as livelihood-related questions and the airport issue,  which Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten hopes for, Zhang Junsheng  said: The foundation of Sino-British cooperation has been torn  down by the British side. If the British side imagines that  nothing has happened, it is, I am afraid, deceiving itself and  others.    Zhu Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA Hong Kong Branch,  said that the British side has violated the principle of  confidentiality regarding the Sino-British talks by unilaterally  publishing the contents of the talks without mutual  consultations, and that the so- called White Paper published by  the British side does not fully reflect the talks.    Before the opening of the large carnival "Joy at Kennedy at  the End of the Spring Festival" in the western Hong Kong branch  of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong in  Western District last night (24 February), Zhu Yucheng made a  response to the British side's publication of the White Paper on  Representative Government in Hong Kong.    He said: What the British has published is precisely what it  has admitted it to be; that is, it is not all the contents of  the talks, but only part of the contents adapted and compiled by  the British side. The contents are not all facts. The Chinese  side will surely make a response.    He said: The Chinese side stated before that it was all  right to publish all the contents of the talks and that the  Chinese side would agree to the end on this question. The  Chinese side will respond to the British side's impractical  actions which are misleading public opinion.    Zhu Yucheng said: The British side notified XINHUA only  yesterday morning that it would unilaterally publish the  contents of the talks. It was very late.    He criticized the British side's termination of the talks in  the 17th round while saying repeatedly that the door to the  talks was still open. He said that this served to deceive the  public and mislead public opinion.    As for the British argument that it did not consult the  Chinese side before publishing the contents of the talks because  it wanted to avoid wasting time, Zhu Yucheng said it was  unrealistic. He maintained that there would have been time if  the two sides had wanted to carry out talks.</p>

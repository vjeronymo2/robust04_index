This was stated by a spokesman of Hezb-e  Eslami [Islamic Party of Afghanistan], while talking to Radio  Pakistan's representative in Peshawar this morning. He urged  President Rabbani to accept cease-fire offer of 45-group of  mojahedin commanders to pave the way for a dialogue to end the  fighting in Afghanistan.    Reports from Afghanistan say Kabul was relatively calm this  morning barring a few minor skirmishes.</p>

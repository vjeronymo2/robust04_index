			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Am I wasting my money? AT THE AGE of 35, I have settled in Britain and, being self-employed, have begun paying NI Class 2 and Class 4 contributions. Because, at my age, insufficient working years remain to qualify for a full state pension, my contributions seem to be expended without benefit. Can any of the obligatory NI contributions be redirected into my personal pension plan? Alternatively, should I consider paying voluntary Class 3 contributions to secure some benefit? If you are paying Class 2 and Class 4 contributions as a self-employed person, you cannot at the same time pay voluntary Class 3 contributions in order to enhance your social security pension. Neither (as you suggest) can you divert any of your Class 2 or 4 contributions (which you have to consider as a tax) into a personal pension plan. If you want to provide yourself with a reasonable retirement pension, then you are strongly advised to pay contributions to a personal pension plan in addition to your compulsory contributions to state social security. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

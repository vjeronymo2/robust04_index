			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Arts: Domingo's noble savage - Opera In the Bonn Opera programme for Antonio Carlos Gomes's Il Guarany (The Guarani), there is a photograph of Mario del Monaco, bronzed and naked except for a loin-cloth, taken in 1949 when he sang the title role in Rio de Janeiro. Del Monaco's enthusiasm for this four-act opera-ballo was such that his son vowed to make it more widely known. Now intendant in Bonn, Gian-Carlo del Monaco has realised his boyhood dream. He persuaded Placido Domingo to learn the part his father had sung, brought in Sony to record it, and has helped illuminate a neglected corner of 19th century repertoire. The first Brazilian composer to achieve international fame, Gomes (1836-96) won a government scholarship to study in Milan. Il Guarany had a triumphant premiere at La Scala in 1870 and performances followed in Rio, London and New York. As the descendant of a Guarani Indian, Gomes was naturally drawn to Jose de Alancar's love story of 16th century colonial Brazil. The chief characters are Peri, a Guarani Indian, and Cecilia, daughter of a Portuguese nobleman. Their love flourishes despite the prejudice of her father, the treachery of her Spanish admirer Gonzales and a running conflict with the cannibal Aymore Indians. In a utopian ending, Peri and Cecilia alone survive to found a lineage which will reconcile Indians and colonial incomers. Since the 1930s Il Guarany has enjoyed the status of a Brazilian national opera - but apart from the setting, there is nothing Brazilian about it. With a long ballet (heavily cut in Bonn), static choral tableaux and an Italian libretto, it mixes grand operatic style with the melodic verve of early Verdi. Gomes gives the same Italianate colouring to the natives as he does to the Europeans, and is unable to hide a patchwork quality. The work's appeal lies in its exotic jungle location and the opportunities it provides for beautiful singing. The idea of inviting Werner Herzog to stage the German premiere had a superficial logic - his film Fitzcarraldo is also set in the Amazonian jungle. However, Herzog has yet to reveal himself as a natural theatre man. His production, designed by Maurizio Balo and Franz Blumauer, unfolded within a cavernous frame of rampant undergrowth, and updated the setting to the early 19th century. The action was static, the choreography lamentable. On the positive side, a complicated plot came over clearly, and the singers held centre-stage. As Peri, Domingo joins a distinguished line of interpreters including Gigli. And this was vintage Domingo, singing in the language and style that suit him best. Unrecognisable behind Indian feathered head-dress and facial markings, his noble savage was thoroughly believable. The part taps his lyrical and heroic strengths, and found him in full, fluent voice. Gomes hands all the display arias to the soprano, sung here with clean and gracious aplomb by Veronica Villaroel. Carlos Alvarez's Gonzales was a lyric baritone of unmistakable class. Chorus and comprimarios were good, but the orchestral playing under John Neschling was dull. I enjoyed Il Guarany. Within the limits of its style, it has charm and vitality. And thanks to Domingo, the Bonn performances had the atmosphere of a real operatic occasion. Last Domingo performance tonight</p>

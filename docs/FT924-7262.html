			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (16): Getting your money's worth overseas - Stewart Dalby shops around for the best deals in changing cash LORD JENKINS of Hillhead, the former president of the European Commission, undertook an exercise in money-changing in Europe. He estimated that if a traveller left Britain with Pounds 100 in banknotes, visited all 12 EC capitals and changed currencies 11 times (Luxembourg does not have its own currency) the sum would have dwindled to Pounds 28.50 by the time it was changed back into sterling. The losses would have been incurred solely on commission fees and took no account of exchange rate movements. He admitted that seasoned business travellers would not behave in this way. 'I deliberately kept the amounts small to make a point. If you are shifting large amounts of money around you would not be hit so hard.' But his exercise emphasises the first rules of travel: change money as seldom as possible and change large amounts. The fewer the transactions, the less the handling fees. That said, what is the most efficient way for the business traveller to carry cash? Mr Ian Spight, the director of financial services for Thomas Cook, says: 'There is not one single cheapest way of travelling. Certainly there is no way of going abroad at nil net cost.' For business travellers, Mr Spight feels it depends on the destination. 'Broadly speaking, I would recommend business travellers to take currency and make extensive use of chargecards.' However, he advises the individual business person to look at local conditions. 'Germany, for example, one would expect to be a cashless society. But, in fact, charge cards are not as extensively used there as elsewhere.' He also stresses the importance of using local currency for the smaller bills. One way an inexperienced traveller incurs losses is arriving at airports with only traveller's cheques, which have to be changed for taxi fares or tips. It can be expensive to change large denominations at airports. Changing traveller's cheques at hotels can be even more costly. The business traveller has to make a calculation based on a number of factors including cost, convenience and security. For travel to eastern Europe, Mr Spight recommends D-Marks or dollars in small bills and suggests that charge cards be used for larger bills. In the former Soviet Union, the best currency to use is dollars. For most of western Europe, the local currency is best. In the Far East, dollars will prove useful except in Japan where the yen is obviously the best currency. In the Middle East, Africa and Latin America, it depends on the country but dollars are generally a safe bet. Do not come home with too much of the local currency because it might prove difficult to find a bank willing to exchange it. It pays to shop around, particularly at times of currency turmoil. Exchange rates can differ from bank to bank and so can charges. Thomas Cook has a commission rate of 2 per cent for banknotes. Most of the clearing banks and building societies have similar charges. But these can vary depending on the amounts changed. Some banks also charge a handling fee. American Express offices in the City of London charge a straight Pounds 2 fee for currency banknotes rather than a percentage of the amount changed. However, for some currencies its rates of exchange are not as competitive as the clearing banks. Restaurants and hotels in eastern Europe now accept most charge cards. In the countries of the former Soviet Union charge cards are accepted in the large hotels used by visitors. If a charge card is used to draw money from a bank there is usually a 1.5 per cent handling fee. When paying by charge card abroad, the costs to the traveller are losses on foreign exchange. Charge and credit cards and local currency are the best method of settling accounts in terms of convenience, but they present problems in security. For example, travellers who visit the countries of the former Soviet Union report that crime is now a serious problem. Muggings and other thefts from foreign visitors are a particular problem in Moscow. There are a number of other methods of funding travel. Banks can transfer money to banks abroad at a fee but this could prove expensive. It can also be inconvenient because it means visiting a particular bank during business hours. Another method is to use Eurocheques. These are used extensively in shop, restaurants and hotels throughout western Europe. They are a method of drawing on one's own bank account while abroad. They are safe, but can also be expensive. At Lloyds Bank, for example, it is necessary to buy a Eurocheque card. This costs Pounds 9 but lasts two years. Thereafter there is a 30p charge for each cheque plus commission of 1.6 per cent. The cheapest way of travelling safely is to take traveller's cheques. 'Providing they take currency traveller's cheques, that is franc traveller's cheques for France, and so on, then it can work out cheaply. Sterling traveller's cheques are cheaper to buy, but then there is the possibility of exchange losses and handling charges at the other end,' Mr Spight says. American Express and Thomas Cook traveller's cheques are widely accepted but it pays to shop around. American Express in London charge one per cent commission when selling dollar traveller's cheques. Providing the cheques are cashed in an American Express office there is no further charge. Thomas Cook charges two per cent for foreign currency traveller's cheques and one per cent for sterling. The problem with sterling is that banks abroad charge a handling fee and there can also be exchange losses.</p>

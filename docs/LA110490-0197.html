			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TRAILER PARK TENANTS FILE LAWSUIT ALLEGING POOR LIVING CONDITIONS;  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE: COMPLAINT CHARGES THAT THE IMPERIAL TRAILER PARK HAS VIOLATED  NUMEROUS CITY AND STATE HEALTH CODES. TENANTS ASK FOR IMPROVEMENTS.  </P> <P> Outside the Imperial Trailer Park in Hawthorne stands a rusty sign with missing  letters.  </P> <P> Inside the park, exposed electrical wires lie entangled between trailers. In  some places, the ground is damp -- a condition tenants attribute to a constant  overflow of the septic system -- and an odor of sewage pervades the park.  </P> <P> Contending that they have put up with these and other substandard conditions  for years, residents of the park have filed a civil lawsuit against the park's  owners, asking that improvements be made and punitive damages assessed.  </P> <P> The 32-page complaint, filed in Torrance Superior Court in September, charges  that Sam and Vera Menlo and the Menlo Trust and Century Quality Management,  which is owned by the Menlos, have violated many city and state health codes  and have neglected their duties as landlords to make the park a livable and  safe environment.  </P> <P> Reached by phone, Sam Menlo said he was not aware of the lawsuit and declined  to comment.  </P> <P> However, the park's resident manager, Harriet Vernon, said she calls repair  workers whenever tenants report problems, and she placed the blame for some of  the park's deficiencies on the residents themselves.  </P> <P> Vernon, who has managed the park for seven years, said tenants sometimes  "destroy the property" by attempting their own repairs and that they sometimes  cause power failures because they "don't have the proper facilities in their  trailers."  </P> <P> But tenants say problems at the park are not their fault. The suit alleges  numerous health and safety problems, including repeated power failures, septic  tank overflows, flooding in the laundry room, poor lighting, unsafe electrical  wiring, leaking gas lines and inadequate trash removal.  </P> <P> Twenty-five of the families who live in the park's 81 units are plaintiffs in  the suit.  </P> <P> In interviews, tenants said they hope the lawsuit will bring improvements.  </P> <P> "I just want whatever is fair, whatever is right," said Bruce Montgomery, 34, a  gardener who has lived at the park for five years and pays $305 a month. "I  stay here 'cause the rent is cheap."  </P> <P> Residents, who say they don't make enough money to move elsewhere, say they are  also angry because they have been told their rents will be increased by an  average of $20 beginning this month.  </P> <P> "The money you pay is not worth it at all," said Joseph Goff, 53, whose monthly  rent is $410. "I would never think of raising a family here. Never. The owners  have never done anything to improve the trailer park and make it a better  place."  </P> <P> The Menlos acquired the park at 3670 W. Imperial Highway in 1984, according to  the suit, and residents say conditions in the park have been declining  steadily.  </P> <P> In May, Southern California Edison completely cut off the park's electrical  power at the request of a city inspector who cited the park for health code  violations. Some of the power was restored five days later. But it was not  until two weeks later that electrical power was completely restored, and many  residents say they had to rely on candles, kerosene lamps and flashlights in  the interim.  </P> <P> Maria Colclasure, a park resident for four years, contacted KCBS-TV, which  aired a story about the blackout. Sam Menlo later sent a contractor to fix the  electrical problems, Colclasure said, but tenants held a meeting and decided to  file the suit because other problems still had not been addressed.  </P> <P> Don Knechtel, director of Hawthorne's Department of Building and Safety, said  the trailer park has had electrical problems periodically over the years.  Knechtel, who requested May's power cutoff, said that when he inspected the  park, he also noticed other health code violations.  </P> <P> He said the violations included placing too many trailer units in the park,  limiting the amount of space between trailers; exposed electrical wires lying  on the ground, posing hazards to any child playing nearby, and overflowing  sewage from a septic system, resulting in odorous and unhealthy conditions.  </P> <P> According to the suit, Sam Menlo, whose assets include nursing homes, apartment  buildings and hospitals, has a history of similar complaints against him in  other business operations. In 1979, Menlo was cited for more than 2,000 health  code violations at several Los Angeles nursing homes.  </P> <P> Knechtel, who said the park had not been previously cited for any violations,  forwarded his findings last month to the state Department of Housing and  Community Development for further inspection.  </P> <P> Kathie Parrish, a spokeswoman for the department, said the state's inspector  found 301 violations at the park, 190 of which were charged to the park's  owners. "The tenants themselves are responsible for 111 violations," Parrish  said. Some of those, she said, resulted from residents' attempts to make  repairs.  </P> <P> Both the park and the residents have until the end of this month to correct  their violations, she said.  </P> <P> Gina Cobb, a four-year resident of the park, was cited for three violations:  not having a specific type of electrical connection, clutter under her trailer  and a burned electrical power box.  </P> <P> Cobb said the power box short-circuited when Menlo's repair workers attempted  to restore electricity during an outage. "It's embarrassing to think they would  come to cite us for things that are beyond our control," Cobb said. "It's  adding insult to injury."  </P> <P> Cobb said many of the cited tenants are upset and they plan to have a meeting  to discuss these violations.  </P> <P> Joseph Sparks, who was cited for having combustible material in cardboard boxes  and for having overgrown weeds around his trailer, said he thinks his citations  were justified. However, he said he intends to correct the violations by the  end of the month and that they have no bearing on the suit.  </P></p>

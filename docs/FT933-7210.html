			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Howard Hodgson to buy stake in Hoskins Brewery MR HOWARD Hodgson, the entrepreneur who created the UK's biggest quoted funeral services company, is returning to the London stock market via the purchase of a large shareholding in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based brewing, pubs and hotels group. The move by Mr Hodgson, which is expected to be announced today, follows the collapse of a proposed deal between Hoskins and Smithland Estates, a private company run by Mr Adam Page, former chairman of Midsummer Leisure. This would have involved the injection of Smithland's Fatty Arbuckle theme bars into Hoskins in return for a 41 per cent stake. Hoskins broke off talks with Smithland just over a week ago. The Hoskins board has been facing a campaign by dissident shareholders, led by Mr Richard Holman, who are seeking to oust Mr Barrie Hoar as chairman and Mr Robert Hoar as a director. Mr Barrie Hoar has said that he and his brother 'would resign when the company's future is secure.' Hoskins Brewery shares last changed hands at 56p on the Unlisted Securities Market, valuing the group at Pounds 3.22m, before being suspended at the company's request on May 27. It is thought that Mr Hodgson will buy a large block of shares in Hoskins from the Hoar brothers, who founded the company and own almost 30 per cent of the shares. A number of new non-executive directors are expected to join the Hoskins board after the shares change hands. Mr Hodgson is then expected to embark on an expansion programme via acquisitions. Mr Hodgson built up the largest quoted funeral services company in the UK, PFG Hodgson Kenyon International, during the 1970s and 1980s, transforming his family business - which he bought for Pounds 14,000 - into a Pounds 100m company, via a series of mergers and acquisitions. He brought Hodgson Holdings to the Unlisted Securities Market in 1986. The company obtained a full Stock Exchange listing in 1989, merging with Kenyon Securities the same year to form PHKI. In 1987 he was voted USM Entrepreneur of the Year. His departure from the group in January 1991, following a profits warning triggered, according to the company, by high gearing costs and a lower than forecast UK mortality rate, was said to have been by mutual agreement and to enable Mr Hodgson to pursue other interests outside the funeral services industry.</p>

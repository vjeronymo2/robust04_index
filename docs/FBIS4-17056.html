			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 19, BNS -- The basic principles of  Lithuania's participation in NATO's Partnership for Peace  program are ready, said Deputy Foreign Minister Albinas Januska,  who also heads a group preparing Lithuania's presentation  document for the program.    At a press conference Tuesday [19 April], Januska said the  Defense Ministry and the Armed Forces Staff are expected to  present their final suggestions in the near future, and the  document will then be submitted to NATO for consideration.    In his words, NATO experts are satisfied with Lithuania's  document as a basis for developing cooperation with the  alliance, including participation in peacekeeping missions.    "The document for participation in Partnership for Peace is  our preparation for expanding NATO toward the East," Januska  said. He noted that NATO experts suggested not to hasten the  preparation of the presentation document, in order to make it as  constructive as possible.    The deputy minister said the State Defense Council's  decision  to hand over border control to the Interior Ministry is  reflected in the presentation document.    Januska was unable to estimate the approximate cost of  Lithuania's participation in the program, but he expressed hope  that NATO members will help to implement the program. According  to the partnership Framework Document, which was signed by  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas in Brussels January 27,  each country will fund its own participation in partnership  activities, although assistance through bilateral agreements  with NATO members is also possible. Januska noted that Denmark  and Great Britain have greatly contributed to the creation of a  Baltic peacekeeping battalion.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Clarke would tax spending rather than income MR Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday gave a clear hint that any tax increases in the Budget would be on spending rather than incomes. He was aiming for a recovery that would be 'sustained over the rest of the decade and beyond' and which would be 'driven by investment and exports not consumption, by the private sector not the state'. A tax structure 'which favours enterprise, entrepreneurship and thrift' played an important role in achieving that goal. Taxation should not prevent business from earning a satisfactory rate of return. 'And when we tax consumers, we should target their spending, rather than their savings or incomes,' Mr Clarke told the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. 'That means relying, wherever possible, on indirect rather than direct taxation.' Treasury officials stressed that the chancellor would not be making his Budget decisions on taxation until early November. But Mr Clarke made a conscious decision yesterday to insert a passage about tax policy in his IMF speech confirming his long-held preference for indirect taxes such as value added tax. He stressed in his speech that taxation and public spending policies had an important role in influencing saving and investment. Mr Clarke wanted to increase both saving and investment in the UK over the medium term. While 'working with the grain of industry and commerce', this meant: Keeping inflation in its tight 1 to 4 per cent target range. Reducing public borrowing over the medium term to underpin recent falls in long-term interest rates. Ensuring that public-sector pay is 'under the firmest possible control to leave maximum scope for expenditure on productive capital projects and essential public services'. Gearing up the government's own investment spending through the greater use of private finance. The chancellor said that Britain, because of its labour market reforms of the 1980s, was better placed than many countries in Europe to translate a sustained recovery in output into new jobs and falling dole queues. He said labour markets everywhere must be allowed to adapt and be more flexible if employment were to be increased in the industrial world as a whole. Governments had a key role to play in improving the flexibility of labour markets. They could concentrate resources on raising standards of education and training and provide help for people looking for jobs. 'But the greatest contribution governments can make is to refrain from well-meant but harmful forms of labour market regulation,' Mr Clarke said.

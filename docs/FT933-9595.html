			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Man and machine in harmony: Fiat is pinning its hopes on a model launch and a showcase 'integrated' factory For three years Fiat Auto has been living for tomorrow. Beset by the woes of the present - a plunging market share and crumbling profitability - Fiat has been forced to break with the traditions of auto industry secrecy to trumpet abroad its future product plans long before their launch dates. From 1992 to 1999 Fiat Auto, the car and light commercial vehicles subsidiary of Italy's leading industrial group, is planning to spend L40,000bn (Dollars 25bn) mainly on capital investment and research and development. Between 1992 and 1996 it is promising the launch of 18 models. It has been darkest just before the dawn. Last year Fiat's automotive operations plunged into an operating loss of L544bn after a three-year slide from an operating profit of L2,362bn in 1989. Its share of the Italian market, once an impregnable domestic fortress, has tumbled in only four years from 60 per cent to a historic low last year of 44 per cent. In 1988 and 1989 it was proudly challenging the Volkswagen group for leadership in west Europe, as both carmakers hovered at about 15 per cent of the new car market. But burdened by a humdrum product range and under severe attack from foreign rivals at home, Fiat's fortunes have waned. By last year its share of the west European new car market had shrunk to only 11.9 per cent, while Volkswagen had surged to 17.5 per cent. The Fiat group, which includes Alfa Romeo and Lancia as well as Ferrari, Innocenti and Maserati, fell back to fourth place last year as it was overtaken by both General Motors (Opel/Vauxhall) of the US and PSA Peugeot/Citroen of France. It has lost further ground in the first half of this year. Virtually all of Europe's leading carmakers have been forced on to short-time working this year in the face of a precipitous drop in demand - new car sales fell by 17 per cent in the first six months - but Fiat was already forced to start cutting production in late 1990. It cut 259,000 vehicles from 1991 output, 230,000 last year and 173,000 in the first six months of this year alone. However, it insists that the steep decline in west European car sales and the resulting fierce financial squeeze is not yet forcing it to rein in its capital and research and development spending - as at its arch-rival, Volkswagen. Now, finally, Fiat is poised for the counter-attack. At the end of this month it will unveil in Turin its Punto small car range, the model that will eventually replace the current Uno and will become the most important single model in the Fiat range. The Punto alone will account for more than 40 per cent of the group's total European sales. The development of the Punto represents much more than just a new car for Fiat, however, to take on rivals such as the Ford Fiesta, the Opel Corsa, the Renault Clio and the Nissan Micra. In the dusty plains of the mezzogiorno in the deep south of Italy, Fiat is also transforming the way that it builds cars with the construction of Europe's most modern car plant. The factory at Melfi, which will begin trial output of the Punto in September and volume production in January, is the showcase demonstration for Fiat's new theology of the 'integrated factory', which it has begun to test out selectively at its existing plants in the past 18 months. Melfi has all the advantages of a greenfield site, a clean drawing board and a new workforce free of the legacy of old industrial practices. The average age of the Melfi workforce is 26 compared with 46 at existing Fiat plants. It promises a substantial leap in productivity to match the best Japanese levels, and will revolutionise the way that Fiat deals with its component suppliers. Melfi is supposed to move car manufacturing into a new era beyond the much-vaunted lean production of the Japanese carmakers. There is no office building. All technical staff are being moved into the plant beside the stamping, welding, paint and final assembly lines. Work teams are being enlarged to include their own engineering and maintenance specialists in a new form of factory organisation. Melfi also represents a stark change of tack by the Italian carmaker from its foray into the extremes of automation at its Cassino plant in the mid-1980s, where it took the robotisation of final assembly to levels never dared by any other carmaker. The Cassino automation experiment was a demonstration of strength by Fiat to the trade unions - after years of industrial strife - that robots could take over many assembly functions from workers. The robots have danced at Cassino, but the extreme automation has never yielded the planned-for productivity benefits. At Melfi the accent has changed. 'Cassino was focused on 'hard' issues, Melfi is about 'soft' issues,' says Paolo Cantarella, Fiat Auto chief executive. 'The integration of man and machine is different at Melfi. It is about how to organise activities, to involve people, to train them and keep them motivated to the job, rather than how to put the wheel on the car. We know how to do that.' The development of the Punto and the Melfi plant mark, too, another watershed for Fiat in development and engineering. For the first time it has developed a new car with a multi-functional 'platform team', drawing its own specialists from different functions within Fiat, ranging from design and product engineering to manufacturing engineering, purchasing, finance and marketing. Fiat claims that it has reduced the development time of the Punto to 36 months, thus cutting at least a year from its previous development programmes. The stylish and urbane Cantarella, chief executive of Fiat Auto since 1991, chose himself to be a member of the Punto project team. 'This was the first time we have developed a car in this way, and it was important to eliminate operational problems from the start. I was very involved in problem-solving, and it was vital to shorten the decision-making process. This car is most important for our balance sheet. And I am a car guy.' With little to boast about in the present, Cantarella prefers not to dwell on the group's financial performance. Instead, he takes important visitors on a tour of the Fiat styling studios, enthusiastically removing the dust covers from the cars that are supposed to restore some of the glitter to Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo. Carmakers are normally allergic to revealing future products before they are ready for launch, but Cantarella is eager to show how the future will take shape. He reveals the large new Alfa Romeo saloon to replace the 164 probably in 1996, and already for the end of next year a new Alfa Romeo coupe and convertible. At the Fiat safety centre in Turin, where crash tests are performed on more than 300 cars a year, he readily points out the wrecked prototypes of a new Fiat Tipo for 1995 and the replacement Alfa Romeo 33 for 1994. Cantarella has been concerned at the lack of glamour of current products, but he is aiming to change the group's image by introducing a number of small-volume niche products to add excitement to the main volume models, mainly coupes and convertibles. To assemble the niche cars he is turning to the independent Turin design houses and 'carrozzieri' or body builders. The dearth of new product is finally ending, but it will still take another two years before Fiat can start reaping the full benefits as production volumes are raised. 'Fiat is a pretty efficient producer,' insists one of its leading component suppliers. 'Its problem is not its cost-base but its model range. If it had the models, it would be quite a force. If the Punto is successful it could change its fortunes dramatically.' For Fiat the moment of truth is dawning.</p>

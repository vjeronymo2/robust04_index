			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Government seeks to recoup Pool Re claims THE GOVERNMENT aims to recoup any claims it meets as reinsurer of last resort to Pool Re, the reinsurance company set up by UK insurers to cover against the risk of terrorist attack. Pool Re will pay a premium for the reinsurance cover, with the premium structure designed with the aim of 'avoiding any net cost to the government over a period of years', according to the text of the bill before parliament. It is expected that Pool Re will be authorised to trade as an insurer next week. It was created after the decision by UK insurers to exclude terrorism cover from commercial insurance policies from January 1 1993. It is likely that claims stemming from the Bishopsgate bomb last month will exhaust premiums collected by the pool's managers to date, leaving the government with much of the bill, estimated at Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m. As a result of the losses Pool Re is likely to review its premium structure over the next few weeks, leaving many insurance buyers, especially in areas judged vulnerable to terrorist attack, with potentially heavy increases.</p>

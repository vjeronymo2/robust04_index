			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / 112 jobs lost as Du Pont announces plant closure Du Pont, the US-owned chemicals and energy company, announced a plant closure yesterday with the loss of 112 jobs, and the sale of another smaller unit. The plant is one it bought from ICI in an international asset-swap deal last July. The company said its decision to close the compounding plant at Billingham, Cleveland, which makes nylon-based plastics, was due to the tough economic environment which had severely affected prices and made it necessary to reduce excess capacity so as to remain competitive. Mr John Newbold, Teesside district secretary of the TGWU general union which represents most of the workers who lost their jobs, attacked both Du Pont and ICI and said he felt a sense of betrayal over the closure. He said there was a developing trend in the European chemicals industry in which assets were concentrated on a few large producers, who then shut plants to reduce overcapacity. The 112 job losses are the second tranche announced by Du Pont in plants acquired when it took over ICI's European-based nylon business in return for its own US acrylics business, plus about Pounds 235m. Three months after the deal was clinched in mid-1993 Du Pont announced it was shedding 1,100 of the 5,300 ICI employees taken on under the transfer. All but 150 of the 1,100 jobs lost were in the UK. Du Pont also announced the sale of the Verton nylon long fibre compound business yesterday, also at Billingham, to LNP Plastics Nederland BV, a Dutch-based subsidiary of Kawasaki Steel Corporation. A condition of the deal, which has yet to be concluded, is that the plant and its 26 employees must be relocated off ICI's Billingham site. Du Pont said it hoped the plant would move elsewhere in Teesside. Du Pont is retaining its three other compounding plants in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany.</p>

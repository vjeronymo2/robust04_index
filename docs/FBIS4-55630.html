			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, May 13 (MTI) -- "Having the country's  interests at heart, I sincerely hope those who won a majority at  the first round of elections have the strength to keep their  promises and carry out their programme," Prime Minister Peter  Boross told an election rally in Szombathely (W Hungary) on  Friday. He said governing had been difficult so far and would  continue to be so in the future.    Boross described the present cabinet as kamikaze, due to the  lack of adequate means for full accomplishment of its tasks.  The government is now busy creating conditions for a smooth  transfer of affairs, he said.    Analysing the country's situation, the prime minister cited  the consolidation of democratic institutions and the basic  change in property relations as solid reserves for the future.    Regarding first-round election results, he said his party,  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], acknowledges the potential  Free Democrat-Socialist alliance. It is ready to assume the  role of opposition, but, as he said, the number of seats they  have in parliament will be of significance. Accordingly, he  called upon national forces to coordinate their efforts, and  electors to vote for candidates of the MDF, the Christian  Democratic People's Party and the Independent Smallholders Party  in the second round on May 29.</p>

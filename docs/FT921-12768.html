			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Japanese money supply growth at record low JAPAN'S money supply growth in December fell to a record low of 2 per cent compared to a year earlier, the Bank of Japan said yesterday. The low rate reflects sluggish demand for loans from companies which are cutting expenditure and investment in response to the cooling of the economy and commercial banks' reluctance to lend to hard-pressed sectors such as property groups. On a month-on-month basis, money supply fell 5.4 per cent, the first decline since February last year. The figures are likely to increase pressure on the Bank of Japan for a further cuts in interest rates. 'Looking at the figures, the Bank of Japan itself is probably feeling the need for lower interest rates as well,' said Mr Yuji Shimanaka, economist at Sanwa Research Institute, the research arm of Sanwa Bank. Yesterday's preliminary figures cap off a year in which money supply growth declined steadily because of the squeeze on borrowing applied by the Bank of Japan for two years to mid-1991. A cut in lending by commercial banks in line with capital asset ratio guidelines of the Bank of International Settlements also contributed to the fall in liquidity. The central bank implemented its tight monetary policy in 1989, to eliminate the speculation 'bubble' in the real estate and stock markets caused by the loose credit policy in the late 1980s. While the Bank of Japan finally responded to calls from the government and corporations to ease credit by cutting the official discount rate three times in late 1991, money growth has failed to pick up. Money supply for 1991 grew by a record low 3.6 per cent from the previous year, down sharply from an 11.7 per cent rise in 1990. A Bank of Japan official attributed the fall in monetary growth to a decline in corporate demand for funds and the shift in banks' lending stance 'from quantity to quality'. However, some analysts see a need for substantial growth in money supply for economic growth acceptable for the government. Effects of the half-point cut in the official discount rate at the end of last year, to 4.5 per cent, are likely to take longer to appear than expected, as potential borrowers await a further decline in lending rates and funds from commercial bank deposits shift out to postal savings. 'The Bank of Japan will need to lower rates aggressively to achieve targeted economic growth,' said Mr Robert Feldman of Salomon Brothers, the US broker. He said a seasonally adjusted annual rate of over 15 per cent was necessary to support real GNP growth of over 3 per cent for the year. Editorial comment, Page 14</p>

			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RULING THAT PIER MUST BE REBUILT TO BE  APPEALED  </P> <P> The Redondo Beach City Council has voted to appeal a recent Los Angeles  Superior Court ruling that the city must rebuild its landmark pier.  </P> <P> The horseshoe-shaped pier, a promenade of shops and restaurants, was devastated  by a fire and two storms in 1988.  </P> <P> Officials estimate it will cost up to $4.6 million to rebuild the structure.  </P> <P> The council also voted to place an advisory question on the June ballot, asking  voters whether the city should reconstruct the pier even if it is not legally  obligated to do so.  </P> <P> Albert Grossman, an attorney for Pier Properties Ltd., the pier's major lease  holder, said that if the city appeals the Jan. 24 ruling, he would seek damages  against the city for failure to act promptly in rebuilding the pier.  </P></p>

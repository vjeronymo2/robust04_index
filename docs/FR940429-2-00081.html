			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth's job qualifications also screened out Mr. Sherrard because of an increased risk of injury. The evidence as to Mr. Sherrard does not support refusing him employment because all it states it that he should avoid heavy lifting, T. at 984, and it does not establish a probability of substantial harm or predict if any injury will occur. I therefore conclude that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by refusing to hire Mr. Sherrard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E. Robert Etnire.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ALJ made no finding regarding whether Complainant Etnire was handicapped, but it is clear that Commonwealth regarded him as handicapped because he was foreclosed generally from positions involving manual labor from the time of his initial application for employment, April 29, 1980, until he was hired by Commonwealth on June 29, 1981.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forrisi,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 794 F.2d at 935. Etnire's application for employment discloses that he worked in mechanical maintenance, the same position for which he applied at Commonwealth, from 1970 to 1979, at which time the plant where he was working closed. PX 2. I find that he was therefore qualified to work in mechanical maintenance at Commonwealth and, because his application was rejected due to degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, OFCCP has made a prima facie case of handicap discrimination as to Mr. Etnire. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ALJ stated that, at best, the evidence shows a mistaken but good faith belief that Mr. Etnire was not qualified for employment in 1980. R.D. and O at 17. Good faith, however, is not a defense, as the Act is directed particularly at unintentional conduct.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nathanson,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 926 F.2d at 1384. In addition, the contractor has the obligation to ``gather all relevant information regarding the applicant's work history and medical history and independently assess both the probability and severity of potential injury.''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> PPG Industries.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> slip op. at 17 quoting  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mantolete  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Bolger,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 767 F.2d at 1423. Accordingly, I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 by failing to hire Complainant Etnire in 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> F. William Zellers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth contends that Complainant Zellers is not handicapped because he did not regard himself as handicapped and because his spondylolisthesis did not substantially limit any major life activities, particularly in view of his continued self-employment in the construction business. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  Comm. Resp. at 63&hyph;64. Where, as here, an employer regards an individual as being foreclosed generally from heavy manual labor positions, that individual is considered handicapped.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forrisi,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 794 F.2d at 935.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> E.E. Black,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 497 F. Supp. at 1097&hyph;1102;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Texas Industries,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> slip op. at 8. The record in this case establishes that Mr. Zellers worked in the supervision and maintenance of construction equipment from 1953 until the time of his application with Commonwealth, P&hyph;2, and that this was considered heavy labor. T. at 627. Mr. Zellers was therefore, contrary to the ALJ's conclusion, R.D. and O. at 16, qualified to work in electrical or mechanical maintenance at Commonwealth, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Texas Industries,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> slip op at 14, and, inasmuch as his application was rejected because of his spondylolisthesis, OFCCP has established a prima facie case as to Mr. Zellers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Commonwealth contends that OFCCP cannot seek relief on behalf of Zellers because OFCCP determined that his complaint was not timely and that determination became final when Zellers did not seek further agency review pursuant to 41 CFR 60&hyph;741.26 (g)(1). Comm. Resp. at 63. I need not address this argument because, for the reasons discussed above, once a complaint is received OFCCP has jurisdiction to seek individual relief for all violations discovered in its investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with some of the other complainants, Commonwealth's job qualifications screened out Zellers based on an increased risk of injury. The evidence does not justify refusing him employment because all it states is that he is at a higher risk for disabling back pains, T. at 440, but does not show a probability of substantial harm or predict if an injury will ever occur. An orthopedist reported that Mr. Zellers had ``asymptomatic spondylolisthesis [with] no evidence of a herniated disc or spinal stenosis. Considering his previous work history and lack of any previous symptoms [there was] no reason to limit [his] function.'' p. 21. I find that Commonwealth violated Section 503 when it refused to hire Complaint Zellers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> G. Thomas Marshall.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ALJ concluded that Complainant Marshall was not a handicapped individual because his hernia was temporary and correctable. R.D. and O. at 16. For the reasons discussed in &para;A above, I reject this conclusion and find that Mr. Marshall was handicapped because Commonwealth regarded him as being foreclosed generally from employment with them.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forrisi,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 794 F.2d at 935. Mr. Marshall's employment application disclosed that he worked as chief electrician for two years prior to applying at Commonwealth. PX 2. I therefore find that he was qualified to work at Commonwealth in an electrical maintenance position. Because Mr. Marshall was denied employment until he had surgery, I conclude that OFCCP has made a prima facie case as to him. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commonwealth notes that Mr. Marshall's hernia was discovered on July 18, 1980, and that between then and September 1980, Mr. Marshall saw Dr. Schell, had the surgery and visited Commonwealth to seek reinstatement of his application. Comm. Resp. at 52. From this, Commonwealth argues that ``it is obvious that Dr. Schell thought Mr. Marshall needed survery immediately'' and it was therefore entitled to exclude Mr. Marshall because the risk of future injury was imminent.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

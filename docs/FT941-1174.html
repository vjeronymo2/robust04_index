			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / Howard backs new body to review criminal cases Government proposals for a new independent body to take over investigating alleged miscarriages of justice from the Home Office were presented yesterday by Mr Michael Howard, home secretary. The Criminal Cases Review Authority was recommended by last year's report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. It would act as a body of last resort after normal avenues of appeal had been exhausted, and would have the power to refer cases back to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office reviews about 700 cases a year, with the home secretary referring about 10 to the of Appeal. Between October 1988 and March 1993 the government paid Pounds 3.4m in compensation and ex gratia payments to 70 people who had been wrongfully convicted. Mr Howard, launching a discussion document, said that Home Office thinking differed from the recommendations of the Royal Commission in two respects. The government proposes that the authority should have the power to refer cases to the courts on grounds of sentence as well as conviction. The government also wants the authority to take on responsibility for investigating wrongful convictions in cases at magistrates' courts. At the moment, once appeal procedures have been exhausted in summary cases, errors can be corrected only by exercise of the royal prerogative. Mr Howard said he hoped to introduce legislation as soon as possible but could not guarantee space in the parliamentary programme next year. Asked why he had delayed nine months before issuing a discussion paper based almost exactly on the recommendations of the Royal Commission, Mr Howard said it was important not to rush matters which involved such 'major constitutional change'.</p>

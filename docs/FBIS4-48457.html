			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the SA Communication Service on the </F> SAPA PR Wire Service]    [Text] In his first address since becoming minister, Dr.  Ngubane on Wednesday (18 May) addressed the staff of the Human  Sciences Research Council in Pretoria. The minister was  accompanied by the deputy minister of arts, culture, science and  technology, Mrs. Winnie Mandela.    Dr. Ngubane invited all agencies in the field of science and  technology to provide him with their views on how their work may  best be directed at urgent socio-economic challenges. He added  that appropriate research and development (R &amp; D) will have  to  become one of our weapons in the fight against poverty and  inequality.    Dr. Ngubane gave a few pointers on how he saw issues of  policy:    South Africa as a developing society, should ideally spend  more    than the current roughly one per cent of GDP on research and    development    The state should shoulder a substantial part of this    expenditure, but also encourage the private sector to become    increasingly involved.    South Africa's base of scientists will have to be broadened,    especially at the historically black universities and  technikons    Affirmative action in the research field should not take the    form of symbolic appointments. It must be based on  empowerment    through training and human resource development.    Dr. Ngubane acknowledged that there are no easy answers.  Therefore he could be expected to move cautiously after having  studied each issue in all its ramifications.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Croatian dinar together with the German mark has  today remained a means of payment in Herceg-Bosna. The kuna and  the [smaller denomination] lipa have not yet arrived in the  markets and shops. However, the withdrawal of the Croatian  dinar from circulation has started at the financial transactions  bureau. All those with accounts with the bureau are paying  their last deposits in Croatian dinars and are drawing cash in  kunas. This is why it is so busy at the bureau's main Mostar  branch.    While citizens are curiously comparing the new currency note  with that of the German mark, and some even with the old kuna,  it has to be said that from tomorrow they will be able to change  dinars for kunas in business banks. The exchange will be  possible until 5 June and the Croatian dinar will finally be  withdrawn from circulation on 30 June, according to the  Herceg-Bosna government's decision. Also according to the  government's decision, the German mark and the U.S. dollar will  be official means of payment, together with the kuna.</p>

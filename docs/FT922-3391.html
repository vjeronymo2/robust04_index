			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Technology: New recipes for cleanliness - The food industry is discovering ways to ensure its equipment stays spick and span Take a beer from your fridge on a sticky day this summer and the chances are that condensation will quickly form on the bottle. It is an effect that may be harmless in the home but causes serious problems for the brewers. At the Stella Artois brewery in Leuven, the Belgian equivalent of Burton-on-Trent, they know all about condensation. Stella's light beers have to be stored at low temperatures for several weeks before bottling, and condensation quickly forms on storage vessels, pipework and cold wall surfaces when ambient air - particularly on humid summer days - infiltrates the buildings. Condensation, combined with high humidity, provides ideal conditions for mould and bacteria to grow, and frequent cleaning simply introduces more water that exacerbates the problem. In 1978 Stella sought a solution through installing dehumidifiers, but these weren't up to the job, and also used a process that caused corrosion. Now the Belgian brewer believes it has the problem licked with powerful dehumidifiers that recirculate the air after passing it through a desiccant rotor. The equipment, made by Swedish-owned Munters, removes excess moisture from the air and prevents condensation. 'There are several similar situations in the UK, but also a need to make companies aware of the possible solutions,' says Tim O'Brien, UK managing director of Munters. 'Across the whole of the food industry, they are only just starting to pick this up.' Hygiene is a sensitive issue in the food and drink industry. Few producers want to talk about a persistent problem or potential hazard until it is ironed out. Perfection is not attainable, as recent Salmonella and Listeria incidents have shown, but technology is making further improvements possible. Health scares have forced food producers and their suppliers, whether of equipment or raw materials, to accept - sometimes reluctantly - that hygiene is higher up the public agenda for food than it has been in the industry's own priorities, where over the past 20 years issues such as productivity and efficiency have held sway. For food and drink equipment suppliers, this creates both an opportunity to develop new techniques where solving a hygiene problem is the major issue, but also a challenge to redesign equipment that, in hygiene terms, is now past its sell-by date. Solving hygiene problems has long been important for the food industry, although primarily as a means to an end - greater productivity. More recently, equipment suppliers and customers have realised that combinations of mechanical equipment, control systems and packaging technologies can be used to create a marketing opportunity through overcoming a hygiene obstacle. Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, has developed a New Zealand chilled lamb business to replace chilled English lamb in the winter when eating quality becomes too variable. Apart from careful selection of the carcasses, the business relies crucially on computerised systems to control temperatures on the 35-40 day voyage from New Zealand, says Martin van Zwanenberg, M&amp;S divisional director for foods. However, it is the production processes between shipping of the raw materials and delivery of the finished product to the shops where hygiene is most important. But the challenges are less understandable to the layman and often more difficult for the industry to solve. As food manufacturing equipment has become bigger and more complex, the processes used are increasingly akin to those of a chemical plant and less like a scaled-up version of a kitchen. The combination of nutrients, water and heat in a continuous production process creates a 'fertile atmosphere' for bacteria, according to Terry Tamplin, marketing manager at APV Baker. Over the past 20 years, in response to customers' needs to keep expensive capital equipment running longer, UK-based APV and the other big equipment suppliers such as Sweden's Alfa-Laval have installed clean-in-place (CIP) systems. Now, few large food producers would even look at equipment that cannot be cleaned in place, or where parts that do have to be removed for cleaning cannot be re-assembled quickly. In this environment, hygiene problems occur when even high-pressure CIP fails to work, often because of poor hygienic design of equipment. The 1990 Richmond Report on the Microbiological Safety of Food quoted cases where poor design had caused food poisoning incidents. Even the fastidious M&amp;S was hit by a Salmonella outbreak on vol-au-vents 10 years ago when chicken built up in a processing machine that incorporated CIP. Incidents like that are prompting a big co-operative effort by customers and equipment suppliers to emphasise design for cleaning - without losing out on efficiency and productivity. Nooks and crannies where food can collect are being designed out, says Tamplin, and stainless steel used increasingly for ease of cleaning. Valves  -notoriously difficult to clean, says van Zwanenberg - are being used only when absolutely necessary. Increasingly, equipment is being totally redesigned, principally for hygiene reasons. At Hoyer, Alfa-Laval's ice-cream equipment subsidiary, the latest Straightline extrusion machine is designed with sloping surfaces, no overlaps where ice cream can collect, and a freezing tunnel built like a stainless steel tank with invisible welds. The extruders have to be removed for cleaning but can be reassembled quickly, says John Weaver, marketing manager. 'The aim is to make it as easy as possible, so that the operators don't cut corners.'</p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Declarations of interest The latest CBI figures suggesting the manufacturing recovery is faltering may not be as worrying as they seem. It is understandable that orders and output have flattened now that the initial benefits of sterling's devaluation, interest rate cuts and stock replenishment have run their course. Growth is still likely to prove more robust this year than most forecast at its outset. Still, fears that the downturn in mainland Europe would take the spring out of the step of UK manufacturers have proved well founded. That suggests there is room for further interest rate cuts, and there seems little in the inflation outlook to prevent it, as the CBI was quick to point out. Growth in unit costs has all but ground to a halt while output prices continue to fall. Domestic markets have remained highly competitive, maintaining the squeeze on margins. But then, inflationary pressures are not proving as subdued outside the manufacturing sector. Yet it is doubtful whether a cut in UK interest rates and a lower pound would do much to improve manufacturing prospects. Given the problem largely lies in mainland Europe, further cuts from the Bundesbank would surely be more efficacious. It therefore seems ever more likely that the Chancellor will plump for the do-little option in the November Budget. A shaving of interest rates and modest tax rises would appear to represent the line of least resistance - uncomfortable though this stance may be for such a habitual political bruiser.</p>

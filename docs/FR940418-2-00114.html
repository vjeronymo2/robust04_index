DPR&hyph;31 and DPR&hyph;41 issued to Florida Power and Light Company (the licensee), for operation of the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Units 3 and 4, (Turkey Point or the facility) located in Dade County, Florida. The proposed amendments would extend the operating license (OL) terms for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 from April 27, 2007 to July 19, 2012 and to April 10, 2013, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Identification of Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The currently-licensed term for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 is 40 years commencing with the issuance of the construction permits (April 27, 1967). The operating licenses expire on April 27, 2007. Accounting for the time that was required for plant construction, this represents an effective operating license term of approximately 34 years for each unit. By application dated February 25, 1992, the licensee requested recapture of the construction period in the 40-year OL term, thus extending the operating license terms for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 to July 19, 2012 and April 10, 2013, respectively. The granting of the proposed license amendments would allow the licensee to operate Turkey Point Units 3 and 4 for an addition 5.25 years and 6 years, respectively, beyond the current expiration dates. Additional information in support of the request is provided by the licensee's letters of June 22 and July 13, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Environmental Assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has reviewed the potential environmental impact of the proposed change and issued ``Environmental Assessment and Finding of No Significant Impact by the Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation Related to the Change in Expiration Dates of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;31 and DPR&hyph;41, Florida Power and Light Company, Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Units 3 and 4, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;250 and 50&hyph;251'' dated April 7, 1994. This review considered both the radiological and non-radiological impacts of extended operation compared with those projected in the Turkey Point Final Environmental Statement (FES) dated July 1972. This review evaluated the historical annual collective dose at the facility, dose reduction measures implemented by the licensee, and more recent Commission policy contained in a memorandum from the Executive Director for Operations to the Commission dated August 19, 1982.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Radiological Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The staff considered potential radiological impacts on the general public residing in the vicinity of the facility and workers at the plant due to normal radiological releases, potential accidents, the uranium fuel cycle, and the transportation of fuel and waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1990 U.S. Government Census population update shows that the nearest population centers to Turkey Point, all to the west and north beyond a 5-mile radius from the facility, are lower than the population projections in the FES. The FES conservatively estimated a population of 170,000 in the year 1986 within the 10-mile emergency planning zone (EPZ) compared to the U.S. Government Census population update of 105,679 for the year 1990 and projected population of 144,638 for the year 2013. The exclusion area and nearest population center, and local land usage, are not changed. The site will continue to meet the requirements of 10 CFR part 100. Station radiological effluents to unrestricted areas during normal operation have been well within Commission regulations relating to as-low-as-reasonably-achievable (ALARA) limits, and are indicative of future releases. As a result of low radiological exposure from plant releases during normal operation, low public risk from accidents, and conservative population estimates within the EPZ, the environmental impact findings in the FES are not affected. With regard to station personnel, the licensee complies with Commission guidance and requirements for keeping radiation exposures ALARA for occupational exposures. The licensee will continue to comply with these requirements during the additional years of facility operation and apply advanced technology when available and appropriate. Accordingly, radiological impacts on individuals, both onsite and offsite, are not significantly changed from those previously estimated in the FES and its conclusions remain valid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The net annualized environmental effects associated with the uranium fuel cycle, which form the basis for Table S&hyph;3, ``Table of Uranium Fuel Cycle Environmental Data'' of 10 CFR 51.51, remain essentially unchanged from those addressed in the FES. The environmental impacts attributable to the transportation of spent fuel and waste from the Turkey Point site with respect to the normal conditions of transport and possible incidents in transport would continue to be as set forth in Summary Table S&hyph;4, ``Environmental Impact of Transportation of Fuel and Waste to and from One Light Water-Cooled Nuclear Power Reactor'' of 10 CFR part 51.52. The combined storage capacity of the two spent fuel pools is 2808 fuel cells and, based upon the licensee's current projections, this capacity will accommodate spent fuel discharges throughout the recaptured operating period for Turkey Point Units 3 and 4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

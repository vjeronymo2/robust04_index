			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Arts: More money for the arts The London Arts Board yesterday announced good news for more than 140, mainly small, arts organisations in the capital - collectively they are going to receive grant increases of more than 20 per cent for 1992-93. However, this is likely to be the last good news many of them get for some time - two other sources of funding, their local authorities and the London Boroughs Grants Scheme, seem set to cut subsidies. The LAB presented a professional front under its new management of Clive Priestley, chairman, and director Tim Mason. This time next year they could well be the funding agency for more, and larger, arts organisations, like the big four London based orchestras, the Royal Court Theatre, the Whitechapel Gallery, etc, doubling its budget to over Pounds 20m. So it is anxious to be reassuring in its policy. Big gainers yesterday were the Almeida in Islington which received a 60 per cent uplift to Pounds 398,000, and the Orange Tree in Richmond, which gets 45 per cent more at Pounds 133,226. In dance, both The Place and Chisenhale were given 26 per cent more while the Battersea Arts Centre gains 40.3 per cent. An unusual initiative was the award of substantially more money to Circus Space which is developing human physical skills to make good the absence of animals in contemporary circus.</p>

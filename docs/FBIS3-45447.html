Information from the Tianjin Municipal Committee of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation reveals that in 1993 alone, the  municipality approved the establishment of 3,538 foreign-funded  projects, involving an agreed use of 2.256 billion U.S. dollars,  both figures representing big increases compared with  corresponding figures of the previous year.    According to local officials, more than half of the  foreign-funded projects approved for establishment are located  in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, the  bonded area of Tianjin Port, and the Tianjin Industrial  Development Zone of New Technology. A total of 1.18 billion  U.S. dollars of the promised foreign investment went for the  service trade.    To draw more overseas investors, local governments at  various  levels of the municipality worked hard in the past year to  provide quality services, simplified approval procedures, and  sponsored investment promotion events of various kinds, said the  officials.    Thirteen well-known international consortia and  transnational  companies decided to invest money and expand their businesses in  this north China port city last year, and 30 other international  consortia and transnational firms continue to send personnel to  investigate the actual situation of Tianjin in preparation for  future investment, the officials disclosed.    So far, 1,100 foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin have  begun official operation or have started economic activities.  Last year, operational foreign-funded firms were reported to  have completed 14 billion yuan in output value, making up 27.8  percent of the municipality's total, and created 3.11 billion  yuan in profits and taxes.</p>

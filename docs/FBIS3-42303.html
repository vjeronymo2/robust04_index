Official sources told LANKAPUVATH that according to latest  intelligence reports, Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has  retreated to his 14 jungle base hideout in Weli Oya in the  northern Mullaittivu District to avoid any contact with the  public of Jaffna, particularly academicians and religious  leaders who are bringing increasing pressure to bear on  Prabhakaran to stop this wanton campaign of terrorism in which  as many as 12,000 Sinhala, Muslim and Tamil civilians have been  brutally slain by the LTTE.    In fact, the intelligence reports revealed that Prabhakaran  was in Mullaittivu at the time the team of Catholic clergy led  by archbishop of Colombo Most Rev. (Dr.) Nicholas Marcus  Fernando visited Jaffna and were able to hold talks only with  Anton Balasingham whose credibility rating is very low as he is  used by Prabhakaran as a mouthpiece for spreading disinformation.    Meanwhile, a senior citizen of Jaffna, a professional, told  LANKAPUVATH that the average man in Jaffna was not one bit  interested in LTTE's battle cry of Eelam. All they wanted was  an end to 10 years of suffering and to live in peace and harmony  with their Sinhala and Muslim brethren.    The people of Jaffna cannot be fooled by the LTTE anymore,  he  said. He claimed that the multipurpose cooperatives in Jaffna  to which the food and other essentials were shipped regularly by  the Sri Lankan Government, were run by the LTTE who plundered 30  percent of the essential supplies for use of the terrorist  organisation. A further 30 percent of supplies from Colombo  were used to feed 225,000 refugees.    The senior citizen said that people were now fed up with  LTTE  repression and described Prabhakaran's rule as a fascist  dictatorship where people had no freedom of expression or  movement. Anyone wanting to leave the peninsula even for a few  days, had to provide another person as surety and Rs. [rupees]  10,000 for an exit permit plus Rs. 500 to cross the Jaffna  Lagoon from Sangupiddy to Kilali.    He said that any family wanting to leave the peninsula had  to  sign all their property and hand over the ownership to the LTTE  and to pay Rs. 25,000 each for a permanent exit permit. Even  then one member of the family was required to remain in Jaffna  so that the LTTE will have a hold on the family wherever the  others are and continue to extort money from them on the threat  that the remaining members of the family would be executed if  the Tiger demands are not met.    He said that all this was ample proof that the LTTE was in  no  way interested in the welfare of the Tamils, but a plain and  simple brutal terrorist organisation whose leaders were using  slogans such as Eelam to deceive the Tamils and feather their  own nests.</p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: Shirts through the mail I suppose there are some chaps who still saunter down Jermyn Street when in search of a shirt, who like to spend a little time deliberating between a Bengal stripe and a fine check. For them Jermyn Street still has lots to offer but for the rest of us, buying shirts seems to consist of either a quick sortie to a chain-store or a flick through the pages of a mail-order catalogue. New on the mail-order scene is Cavenagh Fine Shirts. Cavenagh used to sell its shirts by taking its wares round City offices. These days, with the tightening of security following the bomb-scares, it has become harder to sell in this way and so Pamela and Duncan Cavenagh, who learned classic shirting at Dunhill (a pedigree place to imbibe sartorial wisdom), decided to move into the brochure business. The catalogue is heavy on what it calls 'classics' - whether this be the shirt itself or the colour (it is very fond of 'classic' white). In other words, what it offers is a perfectly good City shirt at good prices. There are stripes and plains, two-fold poplins, herringbones and Oxfords. All the 'classic' colours are there: white, blue, pink and a range of stripes. There is a big selection at Pounds 25 (plain-coloured poplins, Bengal stripes, bankers' stripes, directors stripes, Oxfords, both classic and button-down, and weekend checks) while horizon blue poplins, bold stripes, end-on-ends, herringbones, windowpane and graph checks and chambrays are all Pounds 28. The prices are marginally lower than Marks &amp; Spencer where a superfine cotton City shirt sells at Pounds 29, though a standard Marks &amp; Spencer white cotton shirt is Pounds 20. The catalogue also offers casual shirts, plain leather belts, cotton boxer shirts, pure silk ties and silver cufflinks. The wing-collared evening dress shirts look particularly good value at Pounds 38. There is a Cavenagh shop at 659, Fulham Road, London SW6 5PY but the mail order brochure can be ordered by ringing 071-610-3004.</p>

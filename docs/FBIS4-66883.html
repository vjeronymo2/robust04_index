			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev April 20 TASS -- Ukrainian Vice-Premier Valeri  Shmarov said at multilateral consultations in the Ukrainian  Foreign Ministry on Tuesday that several projects and programms  on liquidating nuclear weapons and conversion are of top  priority for Ukraine.    They were offered for consideration to several Western  countries which expressed a desire to give aid to Ukraine in  this sphere.    The main attention was given to projects concerning the  conversion of munitions factories, their reorientation on the  output of civil products, solution of social problems,  construction of housing for retiring servicemen and their  retraining to learn civil professions and trades.    Asked by journalists to comment on this important event,  Shmarov said: ``It is very pleasant that many states as well as  influential international organisations responded to our  problems of liquidating nuclear weapons.    This is a great political support for us. As for real  economic aid, we hope for receiving what they can give.''</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] The prohibition on investment in the mainland by  building, engineering consulting, and leasing traders has been  lifted conditionally. The Ministry of Economic Affairs  yesterday held the first meeting of the special task force on  examining applications for investment in the mainland. The  meeting approved for the first time indirect investment in the  mainland by building, engineering consulting, and leasing  traders. In addition, the meeting also, in principle, gave a  green signal to indirect investment in the mainland by passenger  transportation traders. Due to incomplete application data  submitted by the traders for examination at the meeting, the  ministry will hold its official approval to the passenger  transportation trade until the next meeting of the special task  force.    In accordance with the principles for examining investment  and technology cooperation projects in the mainland, promulgated  on 31 December last year, the ministry convened the first  meeting of the supra-ministerial special task force yesterday.  At the meeting, representatives from various ministries  examined 18 projects on investment in the mainland. As the  Construction and Planning Administration under the Interior  Ministry insisted that examination for applications from  building and construction traders must be separated, Li  Shu-chiu, executive vice minister of economic affairs who  chaired the meeting, said: Building traders may invest in the  mainland conditionally; however, the prohibition shall continue  to be enforced on construction traders planning to invest mainly  in development and marketing projects in the mainland.</p>

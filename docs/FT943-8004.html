			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / International Company News: Sales surge in mobiles is Ericsson powerhouse A surge in sales of mobile telephone equipment powered a 78 per cent rise in first-half pre-tax profits at Ericsson and led the Swedish telecommunications group to strike a confident note about prospects for 1994 as a whole. The increase in profits to SKr2.29bn (Dollars 290m) was better than expected and stemmed from a 33 per cent rise in sales to SKr36.5bn and tight cost control. Higher volumes rather than currency movements lay behind the strong sales figures, Ericsson stressed. Both the performance and a forecast from Mr Lars Ramqvist, chief executive, that full-year profits would be 'significantly better' than last year's SKr3.1bn heartened the stock market. The group's B shares rose 3.7 per cent to SKr418. The group's powerhouse is its radio communications division which has achieved spectacular growth in sales and orders thanks to Ericsson's world-leading position in mobile telephone equipment. Radio communications sales were up 60 per cent to SKr17.1bn in the first half, well ahead of the public communications division where sales advanced a more modest 15 per cent to SKr11.5bn. Sales of mobile telephone systems and terminals were up 80 per cent. The group, which has traditionally had higher research and development costs than many of its rivals, stressed that costs relative to sales had declined 'despite continued heavy investments in technical development'. A 19 per cent rise in the group's order book to SKr40.3bn showed it continuing to make inroads into many of its most important markets, including China, Sweden, the US, the UK and Italy. Although there was a slight slowing in the pace of new orders between the first and second quarters, the decline was less than some analysts had feared.</p>

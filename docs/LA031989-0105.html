			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PLANTATION COUNTY SOON TO GET FIRST TASTE OF 'INSTANT SUBURBIA'  </P> <P> This is a county named for a city that does not exist.  </P> <P> In fact, this county along the James River also has no town, no bank, no video  store or movie theater, no pharmacy, no liquor store, no newspaper, no shopping  center, no fast food restaurant, no 7-Eleven, no library, no jail, no motel, no  red light and no Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> Nor has there been a homicide here since 1983.  </P> <P> In this county only 30 miles from Richmond but seemingly lost in time, there  are also no apartments, townhouses or suburban subdivisions.  </P> <P> What Charles City County, organized in 1634 and named for Charles I of England,  does have in its 201 mostly forested square miles are 7,000 people, 80% of them  nonwhite, and a row of riverfront plantations inhabited largely by descendants  of the early white planters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Subdivision on Way  </P> <P> And, if things go as planned, the county's first full-scale subdivision will  soon sprout along historic Route 5, the scenic John Tyler Memorial Highway that  courses down the peninsula toward Williamsburg and Jamestown.  </P> <P> Now, 58 houses on lots averaging 1 1/2 acres may not sound like much to most  city dwellers, but to many of the riverfront people here -- a Who's Who of  Southern aristocracy -- it's the worst thing to happen since the Union Army  invaded in 1862.  </P> <P> "What scares us is growing . . . out of control," said Lisa Ruffin Harrison,  mistress of her family's Evelynton Plantation, whose Confederate ancestor,  Edmund Ruffin, fired the first shot at Ft. Sumter.  </P> <P> The Burkeshire subdivision, she said, "looks very urban in nature on a rural  road," despite the developer's promise to hide the houses behind a buffer of  trees. "Your view west will be nothing but a sea of houses," she said.  </P> <P> Harrison and others say they're all for more housing in the county --  elsewhere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sees Nothing Good  </P> <P> "Instant suburbia" is how Frederick S. Fisher, owner of Westover Plantation,  described the subdivision. Other property owners call it a "high-density  subdivision" that "offers nothing good for the county."  </P> <P> But if the landed gentry feels vulnerable to a pincer movement from the  expanding areas of Williamsburg to the east and Richmond to the west, most of  the residents here either are apathetic about the new houses or want more.  </P> <P> "Our kids graduate high school, they go straight to Richmond or Williamsburg  for an apartment because nobody will sell them any land," said Darlene Smith, a  dispatcher in the sheriff's office.  </P> <P> Houses and land are passed down through the generations, and many younger  people go elsewhere not only to live but also to work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Commute  </P> <P> About 80% of the work force commutes to jobs outside the county.  </P> <P> "Charles City County would make 'The Color Purple' look pink," or mild by  comparison, said Barbara Lewis, who left Charles City to attend Norfolk State  College in 1967 and now lives in Alexandria, Va. "There was absolutely zero  opportunity as far as jobs."  </P> <P> Even today, the county's largest employer is the school system, with 184 on its  payroll. The largest private company, which makes cabinets, employs 100; the  county government, 79. The plantations employ an estimated 50 people full time  as guides, groundskeepers and gift shop workers.  </P> <P> "It's a whole different world here," said David L. Kleppinger, director of the  county's Department of Economic Development and a native of New Jersey.  </P> <P> "You can go back almost 300 years, there's not been too much change  physically," said Richard Bowman, the first black person to head the county  Board of Supervisors and a man who has traced his roots here to 1786. The  subdivision, he noted with some detachment, "has caused some concern among the  landed gentry who've so long occupied that sacred area."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Home of Two Presidents  </P> <P> Traditionally agrarian, Charles City County dates its first plantation,  Shirley, back to 1613. The first Thanksgiving was celebrated in 1619 at  Berkeley Plantation. The county boasts two presidents, William Henry Harrison  and John Tyler, one signer of the Declaration of Independence and three  governors.  </P> <P> After the Civil War, blacks held some elected positions in the county until a  state convention in 1901 imposed a poll tax, effectively disenfranchising  nonwhites.  </P> <P> Eventually, the first black supervisor was elected, in 1947, but it wasn't  until 1972 that blacks gained a majority on the three-member county board. With  Bowman's retirement in 1987, the board reverted to a white majority.  </P> <P> School integration also came late to the county, with the consolidation in 1969  of separate white, black and Indian schools. With the white gentry and a few  middle-class blacks sending their children to private schools outside the  county, public school enrollment has been declining in recent years, to a  current low of 1,125, and the school buildings have deteriorated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Revenue From Landfill  </P> <P> To build new schools, county officials cut a deal recently with a Pittsburgh  company to operate a regional landfill in Charles City in return for revenue of  $2.5 million a year. In November, residents voted by a 6-to-1 ratio to float a  $10-million school bond issue, to be repaid with landfill revenue.  </P> <P> Good schools, officials say, are the key to attracting the kind of industry and  jobs that will make residents of new subdivisions such as Burkeshire more than  commuters and Charles City more than a bedroom community.  </P> <P> Despite the long list of things their county lacks, residents are choosy about  change. They overwhelmingly opposed a new state prison here. They also objected  to a federally subsidized 40-unit apartment building proposed for a site near  the courthouse, in use since 1730.  </P> <P> On the other hand, they voted in liquor by the drink, a change sought by two  young men, one a Ruffin, for their new Indian Fields Tavern, one of only two  restaurants in the county.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Finance Repairs  </P> <P> Four bed-and-breakfast establishments, including two in plantation houses, are  other recent indicators of a county slowly yielding to change. In at least one  case, it was also a way for George and Ridgely Copland, owners of North Bend,  to finance repairs on the ancestral home.  </P> <P> "We're right rural, but that's gonna change," said George Copland, a farmer who  is the great-great-grandson of Edmund Ruffin and the great-great-grandnephew of  William Henry Harrison.  </P> <P> "Gosh, I'd like to have a bank in the county; that would make my life more  convenient," said Lisa Harrison, Copland's cousin. "Also a dry cleaners and a  Laundromat. I recognize there is (also) a desperate need for adequate housing  in the county. But these (Burkeshire homes) are too expensive (for most  residents) and will just bring in people who need a lot of services the county  can't provide."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developer Defends Project  </P> <P> Richmond developer Mitchell Kambis said his Colonial-style houses, priced from  about $80,000 to $150,000, are aimed at local residents ready to move up,  newcomers who may commute and workers ready to retire. He notes that current  zoning allows higher density development than he proposes, and that Burkeshire,  with a single entrance on Route 5, will maintain the scenic and historic  character of the area.  </P> <P> The landowners don't agree.  </P> <P> "Read my lips: I have strong reservations," said Helle Carter, whose husband,  Hill, is the senior county supervisor and a member of the Planning Commission.  Hill Carter, the ninth generation of his family to live at Shirley Plantation,  opposed Burkeshire when it came before the Planning Commission but said he may  support it when it comes before the supervisors in a few months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favors Moratorium  </P> <P> Carter also said he is inclined to support a moratorium on subdivisions while  an overdue county comprehensive plan is completed. But Burkeshire, with some  modifications, may be built in any case, he said.  </P> <P> "We have young folks in the county who need inexpensive housing. We want to  take care of them, but we can be choosy and not just please developers," he  said. "The county can't stay the way it is. It's got to progress, but. . . . "  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Joint news conference by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa </F> and South Korean President Kim Yong-sam with foreign and  domestic correspondents at the State Guesthouse in Tokyo; Kim  speaks in Korean with passage-by-passage translation into  Japanese -- live]    [Text] [Unidentified Japanese official] Now, both the  prime minister and president will field questions from reporters.    [Nishijima, YOMIURI SHIMBUN] I would like to ask the  president: Mr. President, you will soon leave Japan for China.  What are you going to discuss with Chinese leaders in connection  with the issue of North Korea's nuclear development? What did  you and Prime Minister Hosokawa discuss in connection with this  issue at the second round of summit talks? And, would you  explain what was agreed and affirmed between you and the prime  minister on issues other than that of North Korea's nuclear  development?    [Kim] The issue of North Korea's nuclear development was  high on the agenda of the summit talks, and the prime minister  and I devoted much time to discussing the issue. As for the  issue of North Korea's nuclear development, I believe that the  ball is now in North Korea's court. Prime Minister Hosokawa and  I agreed North Korea should not be isolated in the international  community, and it should not become an orphan of the  international community. The issue of North Korea's nuclear  development is the most important issue that could directly  affect peace in Northeast Asia, especially on the Korean  peninsula. Therefore, I, and the prime minister, agreed that  South Korea, Japan, the United States, and China should make  utmost efforts to solve the issue through discussion. I will  leave for China today. Regarding your question about China's  attitude toward the issue, I do not think it is expedient to  predict what attitude China will take prior to my visit to that  country. What is clear, however, is that China takes a resolute  position opposing North Korea's development of nuclear weapons.  I think you are aware of that.    [Cho Chung-min, MBC] I would like to ask Prime Minister  Hosokawa: Mr. Prime Minister, at the summit talks on 24 March  you said that if the UN Security Council decides to slap  sanctions on North Korea, Japan will make a responsible response  to the sanctions within the limits of the Japanese Constitution.  Mr. Prime Minister, would you specifically explain what  responsible response means? And, did you and the president  discuss South Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership, and  Japan's bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council  at the summit talks?    [Hosokawa] I would like to answer your first question. You  asked me to confirm whether, at the summit talks, I said Japan  will make a responsible response to sanctions against North  Korea within the limits of the Japanese Constitution if the UN  Security Council decides to impose them. At the present stage,  the UN Security Council has not discussed imposing sanctions on  North Korea and therefore, I would like to refrain from  answering your question. In any case, I think it is very  important that countries in the international community unite to  indicate their solid attitude toward North Korea. At the same  time, it is also important to leave open the door for dialogue  with North Korea. President Kim and I confirmed that point.  You asked about Japan's bid for permanent membership, and South  Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership on the UN Security  Council. Japan's bid was not on the agenda of the summit talks,  but President Kim asked Japan to examine positively South  Korea's bid for nonpermanent membership.    [Unidentified official] The scheduled time is up and I would  like to conclude this news conference.</p>

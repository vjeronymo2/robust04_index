			<p>921212 FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: 'Average', but democratic Sir, Mr Bijan-Daniel Kherzri, commenting on the Swiss rejection of the European Economic Area (Letters, December 9), states: 'It raises the question whether Swiss direct democracy is practical at a time when long-term structural decisions have to be taken which simply surpass the comprehensive capabilities of the average masses.' As a Swiss and a member of the 'average masses', I would like to quote Winston Churchill, who said: 'Democracy is the worst form of government  - except for all those other forms which have been tried from time to time.' Hence I do prefer the current system whatever the outcome] Siegfried R Peyer, representative, Guyerzeller Bank, 9 Queen's Road C, Hong Kong</p>

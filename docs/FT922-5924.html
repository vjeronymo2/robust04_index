			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Casket surges to over Pounds 2m TWO YEARS of restructuring at Casket, the bicycle and clothing supplier, came to an end yesterday with a surge in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds 212,000 to Pounds 2.06m, on sales ahead only 2 per cent to Pounds 71.9m. The share price - which has risen from 19p at the beginning of April - was shaved by profit-taking to fall  1/2 p to 31p. Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the group was now looking for a third business to 'turnround' in a similar fashion. Any acquisition was likely to be done for paper, he added. Casket, which struggled to placate shareholders unhappy with deepening losses in 1990, had sold seven loss-making businesses and closed three since the new management team arrived. The group took an Pounds 886,000 extraordinary charge in the year to March 31 for the closure of Cleancut Clothiers, its trouser business. 'We are now well placed to take advantage of our much stronger financial and trading positions,' Mr Smith said. Net debt had been cut from Pounds 7.95m to Pounds 5.6m, with gearing of 46 per cent. Interest cover was 2.25 times, Mr Smith said. During the year, Casket increased its share of the UK cycle market to more than 20 per cent with the purchase and revival of Falcon Cycles. . It had been losing Pounds 1m a year when purchased in January. The cycle division overall increased sales from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 30.7m  -of which Pounds 2.4m came from Falcon - and operating profits by 38 per cent to Pounds 2.4m. Casket increased exports by 70 per cent in the last year - representing some 10 per cent of turnover - with strong demand from continental Europe for its brands, which also include Townsend and British Eagle. The clothing division held operating profits at Pounds 1.3m, on turnover up 15 per cent at Pounds 39.5m. The dividend is raised to 0.5p (0.2p) - with a final of 0.35p - and is 3.8 times covered by earnings of 1.9p (0.4p).</p>

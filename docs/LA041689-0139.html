			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SYRIA-CHRISTIAN SHELLING DUELS KILL LEGISLATOR  </P> <P> A 72-year-old Christian legislator died Saturday when a rocket hit his  apartment building during shelling duels between Syrian and Christian gunners,  police said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a Lebanese navy gunboat ferried 14 badly wounded Christians to a  French naval vessel anchored off Beirut as a French humanitarian aid mission  got under way.  </P> <P> A police spokesman said the legislator, Louis abu Sharaf, was killed when a  rocket landed near his apartment on the third floor of an eight-story building  in Christian East Beirut.  </P> <P> Abu Sharaf was the first legislator to die in a shelling attack in Lebanon's  15-year-old civil war. A member of the Christian Falangist Party, he had  represented Christian Kesrouan province since 1960.  </P> <P> His death raised to 23 the number of deputies who have died since the last  parliamentary elections in 1972.  </P> <P> The war between Christians and Muslims has prevented parliamentary elections  since then, and Abu Sharif's death reduced the number of deputies in the  99-seat house to 75.  </P> <P> Police said intermittent shelling duels intensified before sundown as gunners  from both sides blasted Beirut and its surroundings, killing four people and  wounding 31.  </P> <P> An Italian tanker with a cargo of diesel oil, the Cochinella, was hit by a  shell eight miles off Beirut on Saturday, an Italian Embassy official said.  </P> <P> The French naval ship La Rance dropped anchor 10 miles off the Christian port  of Juniyah, where France's minister for humanitarian aid, Bernard Kouchner, is  supervising a mercy mission for both Christians and Muslims.  </P></p>

According to him, Kazannik is engaged in routine  work; he holds conferences on pressing problems every day; under  his initiative his office is working on ways to improve its  performance. The plans of Russia's prosecutor general "extend  far into the future," Zvyagintsev stressed in an interview with  INTERFAX.    According to news media allegations, the man who is likely  to  replace Kazannik is Aleksey Ilyushenko, chief of the control  department in the office of Russia's president. Members of his  department have said that "these reports are nothing but  unconfirmed rumors." Ilyushenko himself is currently on  vacation.</p>

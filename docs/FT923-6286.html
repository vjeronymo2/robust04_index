			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Weak dollar and bonds upset equity investors Wall Street US STOCK markets yesterday added to last Friday's sharp losses as further declines in bond prices and the dollar continued to upset equity investors, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 25.93 at 3,228.17, not far off its low for the session. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 4.13 to 410.72, while the American SE composite lost 3.41 to 380.90 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 8.31 to 555.39. Declines on the New York SE outpaced rises by 1,500 to 391, but turnover was fairly light at 165.7m shares. In spite of further intervention by the Federal Reserve, the dollar fell yesterday to DM1.40, its lowest-ever level against the D-Mark. The weak dollar has undermined bond markets, where the yield on the 30-year bond has inched back up towards 7.5 per cent, because investors believe that the lower US currency reduces the chances for another interest rate reduction by the Federal Reserve. The same concerns have troubled equity investors, who have reacted negatively to the rise in bond yields, which they fear could hinder the economy's ability to stage a solid recovery from the recession. Stock market sentiment was also damaged by news that Salomon Brothers, the big securities house, had reduced the stock portion of its asset allocation model because of political uncertainty and the weak dollar. Insurance companies were lower in the wake of Hurricane Andrew's assault on South Florida. Investors sold in anticipation of big insurance payouts because of the hurricane damage, leaving Cigna down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 51, Travelers Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 20 5/8 , Aetna Dollars 1 cheaper at Dollars 39 and Geico Dollars  3/8 off at Dollars 57 1/8 . LSI Logic slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 1/4 after announcing plans to take a restructuring charge of Dollars 95 to Dollars 100m in the third quarter, which would result in a loss of more than Dollars 100m, or Dollars 2 a share. Daxor, traded on the American SE, plunged Dollars 2 to Dollars 6 5/8 on news that Ressimo was no longer interested in buying the company, which operates a blood and human sperm bank. On the Nasdaq market, the big computer and biotech stocks were lower, with Apple off Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 43 1/4 and Amgen Dollars 2 1/8 weaker at Dollars 62 1/4 . Northeast Bancorp rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 8 5/8 on rumours that the company was up for sale. Chase Manhattan, Fleet Financial, Bank of Boston and First Fidelity were all touted as possible buyers. Canada TORONTO stocks shrugged off an historic agreement that could end years of wrangling over the Canadian constitution with the lack of enthusiasm typical of Monday. The market instead focused on the slumping US dollar to end moderately lower. The TSE 300 index shed 9.5 to 3,380.8 and declines led advances by 303 to 204 after volume of 23.7m shares. Bank shares continued to see profit-taking, following National Bank of Canada's disappointing third-quarter earnings announced late last Thursday. The other leading banks begin reporting their earnings for the period today.</p>

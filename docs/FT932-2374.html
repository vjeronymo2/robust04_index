			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / German waste recycling is hit by success GERMANY'S much-vaunted waste recycling system is collapsing under the weight of its own success, collecting four times more plastic garbage than it can recycle, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Duales System Deutschland (DSD), set up by German companies to collect and recycle household waste, said it urgently needed DM500m (Dollars 300m) just to keep going this year. Mr Wolfram Bruck, the company chairman, warned yesterday that DSD could not ensure the recycling of the garbage it was collecting and called for a complete rethink of the system. Rhineland-Palatinate withdrew from the scheme this week, complaining that it was 'collapsing under 8,000 tonnes of plastic garbage with nowhere to put it'. DSD was set up by industry two years ago after the introduction of an environmental law which forces manufacturers to take back and recycle packaging products. While DSD has been successful in dealing with paper, glass and aluminium, for which facilities already exist, it is failing to find adequate outlets for plastics, which is costly and difficult to process. By law, DSD was supposed to collect only 100,000 tonnes of plastics a year until 1995, but the scheme has worked so well, it has found itself with four times as much this amount. With landfills in Germany full to the brink, DSD has now painted itself into a corner until new recycling facilities are built. Investments are under way, most notably by RWE, the large utilities company, but DSD says this is not enough. DSD is also criticising its own members for cheating on membership fees. These fees allow member companies to put a green dot on their products, which are then collected by DSD, sorted out and given to recycling companies. DSD has widely portrayed the green dot, which figures on 80 per cent of consumer packaging in Germany, as a friendly pro-environment measure. But the system's public image is now under strain as mountains of unrecycled plastic garbage increasingly appear on German television. Moreover, the company has been repeatedly attacked by green organisations for exporting abroad the rubbish it cannot recycle. More than half of the 400,000 tonnes of plastic collected by DSD in 1992 ended up in foreign landfills, especially in developing countries.</p>

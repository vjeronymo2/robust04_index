			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Alkis Malidhis] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias described his  talks with high-ranking U.S. officials in the framework of the  dialogue between the European Union [EU] and United States as  positive. Papoulias returned today to Athens and detailed the  U.S. Government's position regarding the Skopje issue.    [Begin Papoulias recording] The United States is more  interested in the normalization of relations between Greece and  Skopje than in upgrading diplomatic relations between itself and  Skopje. I think that we should move in this direction.  Therefore, the normalization of Greek-Skopjean relations will  depend on the acceptance of the conditions we set by [Macedonian  President] Kiro Gligorov so that we can proceed with a dialogue  on the name issue. The Greek position on the issue is known. In  the meantime, we should try to create a better climate in the  relations between the two countries. [end recording]    Papoulias also referred to yesterday's statement by UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali in New York that the UN  hopes for a meeting between Greek and Skopjean experts.    [Begin Papoulias recording] I have no information on what  Butrus-Ghali said. [end recording]    Regarding his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, the Greek foreign minister also said that the U.S.  Government holds positions on the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina  that will be developed in the coming weeks. He added that both  the EU and the United States insist on the promotion of a peace  plan and reject military interventions.    [In the same newscast, Athens Elliniki Radhiofonia Radio  Network carries the following dispatch by correspondent Nikolaos  Meletis on Foreign Minister Papoulias' remarks before his  departure from Washington: "During a friendly talk with Greek  correspondents, Foreign Minister Papoulias also said that  Gligorov appears tough, encouraged by diplomatic recognitions,  and seeks to gain something more. Papoulias said that Gligorov  does not realize that the most important thing is to establish  good relations with Greece, which is the only regional country  that guarantees the borders and future of his country."    [In a recorded statement Papoulias commented "I do not  understand why he does not proceed with something which, as they  say, he had agreed to during talks with Former Greek Prime  Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis.    ["The foreign minister stressed that negotiations on the  name  will be difficult, as our country insists on the historically  justified position not to accept a name that contains the term  Macedonia or its derivatives.    ["Referring to the Cyprus issue, Foreign Minister Papoulias  stressed that the confidence-building measures do not touch the  substance of the issue. He also expressed his concern over the  possibility that Turkish Cypriot Leader Rauf Denktas will use  the confidence-building measures to prolong a fruitless dialogue.    ["Commenting on the U.S. State Department's human rights  report, the foreign minister stressed that this report does not  have anything to add or take away and that it is repetition.  The report contains information that the Americans have, and  one can agree or disagree with them, the minister said.  Papoulias concluded by expressing concern about the credibility  of the sources used to formulate the report."]</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / G7 backs dollars 24bn aid for Russia: Yeltsin in surprise offer to swap natural resources for debt relief THE WORLD'S leading industrialised countries yesterday welcomed Russia as a partner of the west and pledged their support for President Boris Yeltsin's economic reforms and political leadership. Their backing came on the last day of the summit in Munich of the leaders of the Group of Seven nations, where Mr Yeltsin sprang a surprise offer to swap Russian natural resources for relief on the country's debt. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, stressed that Mr Yeltsin was in Munich to meet the G7 as a 'partner' and not as a 'poor relation'. During their meeting with Mr Yeltsin, the G7 countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - offered 'help for self-help', endorsing a Dollars 24bn (Pounds 12.6bn) package of financial assistance that will be provided in stages through the International Monetary Fund, the industrialised countries and through debt rescheduling. in relation to the scale of Russia's economic crisis, Mr Yeltsin voiced satisfaction at the results of his first wary encounter with G7 summitry. 'I certainly didn't expect any more than that and I didn't want any less,' he said. Both Mr Yeltsin and the western leaders stressed that the reform process in Russia was fraught with danger and risk. 'We are paying a very, very high price for the transition from totalitarianism and communism to the civilised world,' Mr Yeltsin said. Mr Kohl urged western companies, banks and investors to become involved in Russia. In return, Mr Yeltsin called on western governments to open their markets to Russian goods and services such as space launches and to provide insurance against political risks for private investment in Russia. Following the recent agreement between Russia and the IMF, Mr Yeltsin said he expected 'a powerful flow' of private investment into Russia. Mr Yeltsin, who had earlier demanded far-reaching debt rescheduling, said he was satisfied with an assurance that G7 countries would support rescheduling through the Paris Club of western creditor countries. His offer to swap Russian mineral rights, land, industry interests and energy resources for debt write-offs was disclosed by the Italian premier Mr Giuliano Amato at a briefing for Italian journalists. Mr Brian Mulroney, the Canadian prime minister, said the proposal was a 'bolt from the blue'. Mr Yeltsin could, however, face opposition to his proposal at home, where energy is in short supply and prices are soaring. Both Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin said the purpose of the phased financial aid package was to make the economic reforms lasting. The Russian president said that when his term of office came to an end, he 'trusted reform would have become irreversible in all its areas'. Mr Yeltsin met the G7 leaders after they had ended their own economic summit conference, in which they made clear that help for Russia and other former Soviet republics would 'be comprehensive' but tailored to the progress of reform and 'internationally responsible behaviour'. This would include more reductions in military spending and a determined effort to achieve creditworthiness. The summit agreed on a plan to make safe Soviet-built nuclear power stations but failed to agree on a Dollars 700m fund for the venture. It also achieved no breakthrough on the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, although the G7 leaders said that freer trade would be vital for integrating the former Soviet Union into the world economy.

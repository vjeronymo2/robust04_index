			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Low confidence leaves Haden MacLellan down at Pounds 1.8m HADEN MacLellan Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday highlighted low customer confidence in capital projects, as it reported a decline in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 1.8m in the six months to June 30. The board is holding the interim dividend at 1p, covered by earnings down at 1.3p (1.5p). Mr Harold Cottam, chairman, said: 'Buyers have felt less confident about investing in capital projects and, as some of our products are of a capital nature, order opportunities have been restricted.' He said confidence in the UK and the US was increasing, but that economic recovery was slow. The recession continued in continental Europe. The depressed profits were struck on turnover up at Pounds 152.7m (Pounds 141.9m) as margins suffered under competitive pressure but volume improved. All divisions traded profitably. Operating profits in manufacturing and distribution fell to Pounds 1.5m (Pounds 2.2m) hit by continuing uncertainty in the UK economy, the company said. In process engineering and services, operating profits were maintained at Pounds 1.1m, disguising a drop to Pounds 600,000 (Pounds 3.5m) in Europe and the Australia and profits of Pounds 500,000, against losses of Pounds 2.4m, in the US. Mr Cottam said: 'Our attention to the growing south east Asia market has been rewarded with substantial new business, although this has not matched the downturn in our traditional markets.' There were property operating profits of Pounds 200,000, against losses of Pounds 300,000. Mr Cottam said the next property revaluation was due at December 31. 'It is not possible to predict what impact this may have although it is possible in the current climate that it may give rise to some reduction in carrying values.' The net interest charge was maintained at Pounds 300,000 on 'modest' borrowings. At the end of the period there was net cash of Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.2m).</p>

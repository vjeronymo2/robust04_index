			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / BBC moves to reverse decline in audience share THE BBC admitted yesterday that its performance in popular drama was disappointing and said action was being taken to deal with the ratings problem. Mr Charles Denton, head of drama, said there was no shame in admitting that the BBC had not done as well as expected in popular drama. Speaking at the unveiling of management restructuring at BBC Television, he said action was being taken and the results would be seen by the autumn. His comments came on the day when ratings from Barb, the official audience measurement organisation, showed that in the week to June 27 the BBC1 share of the audience fell to 28.9 per cent, the lowest since 1985. The low ratings could be a quirk. BBC2, which had extensive coverage of the Wimbledon championships, had a healthy 15.1 per cent of the audience. The May average for BBC1 was 32 per cent compared with 40 per cent for ITV. A sustained decline in the ratings on such a scale could be embarrassing while the BBC is pressing the government for the renewal of its charter with continued licence fee funding. The BBC changes announced yesterday included a separation of the functions of programme commissioning and scheduling and the launching of a charter for independent producers. Mr John Birt, BBC director-general, said the charter would 'ensure that the BBC is in a position to broadcast the best possible programmes from whatever source - BBC or independent, anywhere in the UK.' There will be new group heads for drama, entertainment, factual programmes, children's programmes and sport and events. Mr Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Group, yesterday renewed his plea for more FM frequencies for commercial radio in evidence to the Commons national heritage committee. Mr Branson said a new FM national channel could be carved out of FM frequencies not fully used by the BBC. If 1,600 people in the Caterham area were given satellite dishes, enough FM capacity would be freed for new channels to reach 7.5m people in the London area.</p>

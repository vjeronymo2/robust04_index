			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Rail should pay as well Sir, Your objective leader ('Privatisation plus for BR', May 19) is flawed by your suggestion that road users should be charged 'social costs', or make the use of railway tracks free. It is difficult to obtain the true facts, but Malcolm Rifkind, former transport secretary, said on TV that road users pay in taxes twice the expenditure on roads. Presumably this does not include Vat, at least on cars, servicing and spares. Other authorities have put road taxes at over four times spending on roads. The view seems to be that road taxes are a form of general taxation (third after income tax and VAT) and do not relate to road expenditure. But all vehicles, not least freight, pay very heavily for use of the roads. Rail pays little or no tax and if the use of the track is to be free (a charge on the taxpayer) then rail should pay comparable taxes to road.

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Tourists urged to quit Gambia The British Foreign Office yesterday called in tour operators yesterday and advised them to bring more than 2,000 holidaymakers home from Gambia because of a deterioration in the political situation. However, Gambia Experience, one of the largest operators to the country, said it would allow its customers to decide whether or not they wanted to continue their holidays. The Foreign Office said it had been monitoring the situation in Gambia since a coup, in which Lt Yahya Jammet seized power from Sir Dawda Jawara, and there had been a steady deterioration. It said the political situation was uncertain and could deteriorate quickly. The advisory notice follows an attempted counter coup against on November 11 which Lieutenant Jammet blamed on former finance minister Mr Bakary Dabo.</p>

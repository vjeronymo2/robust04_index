For purposes of premium penalties, section 4071 penalties, and standard termination deadlines, this notice is applicable with respect to plans whose administrators' or sponsors' principal place of business, or for which the office of a service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining information necessary to meet the applicable deadlines, is located in a designated disaster area. For purposes of filing requests for reconsideration or appeals, this notice is applicable to any aggrieved person who is residing in, or whose principal place of business is within, a designated disaster area, or with respect to whom the office of the service provider, bank, insurance company, or other person maintaining the information necessary to file the request for reconsideration or appeal is within such an area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Premiums <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The PBGC will waive the late payment penalty charge with respect to any premium payment required to be made on or after January 15, 1994, and before March 15, 1994, if the payment is made by March 15, 1994.

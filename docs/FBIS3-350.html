France "requested us to send observers and the Nigerian  Armed Forces decided to send them at the weekend", defence  spokesman General Fred Chijuka told AFP.    The military authorities expect a report from the Nigerian  observer team sent to witness to military manoeuvres, he added.  Nigeria, he said, must have been requested to send observers to  clear any lingering doubts about the aim of the military  exercise, especially since France has been accused by Abuja of  allying with Yaounde over a current border dispute between  Nigeria and Cameroon.    The tension between the two countries generated as a result  of a dispute over the ownership of Bakassi peninsula has abated  and Nigerian military authorities believe that the military  manoeuvres might have been planned before now, said Chijuka.  [passage omitted]    The fact that the military manoeuvres were to start at this  moment of conflict between Yaounde and Abuja might be a  "coincidence", he said. Sunday, press reports here quoted  Nigerian officials as being suspicious of the military exercise,  describing it as "a show of might" at the moment of crisis.  "When they return, our people should be able to tell us" the  exact situation of things, Chijuka said.    In another development, the military administrator of one of  the states bordering the disputed territory has said Nigeria was  making plans to solve refugee problems that may crop up as a  result of the conflict. The military administrator of Akwa Ibom  state, Colonel Yakubu Bako, said that necessary logistics have  been put in place in the state to tackle refugee problem, the  official NAN reported late Sunday. "We are expecting that  problem, we have worked out the logistics and submitted it to  the Nigeria federal government", Bako told journalists.    Although the state was not having refugee problems at the  moment, Bako said he has initiated moves to hold talks with his  colleagues in Abia and Cross River, two states neighbouring on  Akwa Ibom over the matter. The independent CONCORD newspaper  reported Sunday that an average of 300 displaced Nigerians  fleeing Cameroon arrive daily in Ikang, a border village in  Cross River State. The newspaper report has not been officially  confirmed.</p>

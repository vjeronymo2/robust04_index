			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Death of Norway's Mideast peacemaker: Obituary Mr Johan Joergen Holst, Norway's foreign minister, has died in his sleep at a recuperation centre outside Oslo after suffering two strokes. He was central to the contacts between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organisation which produced the peace handshake last September in Washington between Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israel's prime minister, and Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman. Mr Holst was always one for overworking and the burden of too little sleep and years of prodigious academic output on strategic issues took its toll. Apart from his political career, he was head for many years of the Norwegian Institute for International Affairs. Born in 1937, Mr Holst was among a number of Norwegian politicians, part of a tradition going back may years, to have an apparently disproportionate influence on international affairs. When he took over as foreign minister last April from Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, who left to become the United Nations peace envoy to former Yugoslavia, the secret Middle East peace talks had already been under way for several months. But they were still at a fragile early stage, lacking as yet the participation of Israeli government officials. Mr Holst later said he 'took over the baton' in a relay. It was a baton he carried with enthusiasm and tenacity to the finishing line four months later when he presided over the initialling of the declaration of principles at a secret ceremony in Oslo in the early hours of August 20. Mr Holst's role in the negotiations was probably most important at those times when the talks were most in danger of collapse. In mid-July, a crisis blew up at a session in Halvosbole, with the two leading PLO and Israeli negotiators exchanging insults, and one threatening to pull out. Both sides went home, leaving the negotiations apparently at an impasse. After the Halvosbole row, Mr Holst spent long hours in Tunis with Mr Arafat discussing the shape of the proposals so far drafted. With other Norwegian mediators, they spread out maps of Israel and the occupied territories, and pored over them while they debated key issues of dispute. Mr Holst later said the meetings convinced him that Mr Arafat was not only fully committed to achieving a settlement, but was personally in charge of the PLO negotiating effort and fully briefed on all its aspects. In letters, telephone calls and face-to-face meetings, Mr Holst conveyed this conviction to Mr Shimon Peres, the Israeli foreign minister, and the talks resumed. At the same time Mr Holst sought assurances from the Israeli side that Mr Rabin was as committed as Mr Arafat. In an interview later, Mr Holst said there was underlying the negotiations a fundamental problem which he set about overcoming: the lack of essential mutual confidence between the Israeli and PLO leaderships over their respective commitment to the talks, and their ability to make a deal and then to make it stick. Mr Holst was also at the centre of the final negotiating session which sealed the agreement. It took place not in Oslo but in Stockholm, where Mr Holst was summoned at short notice on August 17 by Mr Peres, who was on a visit. An unfairness of his passing was the extent to which he looked after himself physically. To ski with him was to watch with frustration his skilled disappearance over the horizon. At other times, his passion for stamp collecting more than once niggled his wife, Ms Marianne Heiberg - who was central also to PLO-Israeli contacts. He was a fluent Russian speaker. He had four children from a previous marriage and one from his present one. His diplomatic skills, as a dedicated pro-Nato (he was tipped to succeed Mr Manfred Worner as its chief) and Atlanticist advocate, outstripped his local political instincts, although he was an assiduous worker for the Labour party. Regarding him as aloof, the Norwegian press attacked him when he was defence minister. The strongest tributes came yesterday from Palestinians and Israelis alike. Mr Rabin said: 'The state of Israel will remember Johan Joergen Holst as the person who succeeded in bringing the distant together, in overcoming the enmity of generations and in laying foundations for peace.' Mr Arafat said: 'We lost with his early departure one of the sincerest friends of our Palestinian people.' The PLO leader added: 'With this, he has registered his name and his country's name in the pages of the world's peace.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Two Molotov cocktails were thrown last night at a  bus close to the village of Biddiya on the Trans-Samaria  highway. No one was hurt and there was no damage. South of  Hebron, another firebomb was tossed at a bus. Again, no one was  hurt.    A Qol Yisra'el reporter says throughout the day there were  disturbances in the Hebron, Jericho, and Tulkarm areas.  Soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse stone  throwers.    The center of Hebron was open yesterday to commerce and  trade.</p>

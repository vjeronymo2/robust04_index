			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Creditors reject debt demand by Argentina ARGENTINA'S creditor banks have rejected demands by Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, for a 40 per cent cut in the country's Dollars 31bn (Pounds 17.1bn) commercial bank debt under the Brady debt reduction plan. They offered instead a 30 per cent reduction and insisted on a Dollars 1bn cash payment to reduce more than Dollars 8bn in interest arrears. Mr Cavallo had offered no cash payment. The banks also demanded higher interest rates and shorter maturities on discount bonds Argentina will issue to replace debt certificates. Besides wanting to make as few concessions as possible, bankers want to avoid precedents which Brazil, the developing world's largest debtor, would exploit. Mr Cavallo said last month when debt talks began that he wanted an agreement as quickly as possible. However, he has been criticised for not demanding greater concessions and for weakening his bargaining position by aiming for a rapid settlement. He hopes that operation of the Brady plan - named after Mr Nicholas Brady, US treasury secretary - will increase capital flows to finance a deteriorating balance of payments.</p>

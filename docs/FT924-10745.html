			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Letter: Facts not emotions Sir, You quote Ms Colette Flesch, the head of the information directorate, as wishing to bring about an emotional link with the Community and the positive things it has brought about ('Brussels tries to plug an information gap', October 26). This demonstrates where the Commission's information programme is going wrong. It is unequivocal facts about the Commission's aspirations and activities that should be communicated, not emotions of the Berlaymont residents. Earlier this year, I had the unrewarding experience of acting as media relations adviser to President Delors' cabinet office in promoting their association with the Winter Olympics. The officials' preoccupations turned out to be: a) avoiding firm statements about the Ecu10m being invested in this 'corporate sponsorship' of winter and summer Olympics; b) ensuring that all material was issued in either three or nine languages, approval for which had to be sanctioned by a Brussels Committee. The result was that 'news' issued was bland and out of date by the time it was approved for release. If President Delors is serious about closing the information gap, he should ensure that the decision chain for releasing material is short, effective and responsive to the external market.

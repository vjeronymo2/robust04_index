			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / People: Jacomb and Norrington retire from Barclays The first effect of the arrival of Martin Taylor as chief executive of Barclays emerged yesterday when the bank disclosed that Sir Martin Jacomb, below left, one of its two deputy chairmen, and Humphrey Norrington, below right, one of its two vice chairmen, are retiring from its board. The retirements are both linked to Taylor's arrival from January to take over the chief executive role from Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman. The bank need no longer maintain such an intricate structure of responsibility on its board to counterbalance Buxton's dual roles. Jacomb, who is 63 and a member of several other boards, stayed on as deputy chairman for a year at Buxton's request, despite passing its retirement age of 62. With Taylor's arrival Jacomb has taken the chance to leave Barclays, which he joined in July 1985, from the year end. A signal of intentions emerged this week when Jacomb was named as chairman designate of Delta, an electrical engineering company. He already chairs the British Council and Postel Investment Management. His most vital role at Barclays was as the first chairman of its BZW investment banking arm. Norrington's early retirement at the age of 57 follows his handing over senior responsibility for the bank's risk management this year to Sir Peter Middleton, its remaining deputy chairman. He has kept a role in risk management, as well as overseeing personnel and property management. The bank said that Norrington, who joined Barclays in 1960 and became a vice chairman in March 1991 after being executive director in charge of overseas operations, had decided to retire from December 3. Norrington's executive responsibilities will pass to Taylor; his departure will leave Alastair Robinson, head of its banking division, as sole vice chairman. Taylor will take responsibility for the group credit policy unit, which oversees the bank's lending. The changes leave Sir Peter Middleton as chairman of the group credit policy committee; Taylor will join this committee.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Tsekhmistrenko report: "Russia and NATO Bomb </F> Strikes in Bosnia. The Slap in the Face From Partners May Cost  the `Partnership' Plenty"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] The events in Bosnia may  seriously affect the future of Russian-NATO relations within the  "Partnership for Peace" program. Although officials at the  Russian Foreign Ministry have assured your KOMMERSANT-DAILY  correspondent that Russia's signing of the "Partnership for  Peace" will take place on the date agreed earlier, neither can  one rule out a different option. Since the events in  Yugoslavia, to all appearances, are becoming yet again a factor  in Russia's domestic political struggle, there is a high degree  of probability that the Kremlin may opt to postpone the signing.  Otherwise it risks turning into too comfortable a target for  the opposition, which is always ready to raise an outcry over  "the sellout of Russia's national interests." It is not a  coincidence that even the voice of the most steadfast proponent  of "Partnership for Peace" -- Andrey Kozyrev -- has acquired new  undertones. After talks with Javier Solana, chief of the  Spanish Foreign Ministry, Kozyrev stated that Russia -- as a  great military and nuclear power -- lays claim to a special role  within the "Partnership." All the more so because, the minister  said, Moscow is inclined to see the NATO initiative as just one  of a number of programs, not the most important one at that, in  the process of creating a single Europe.</p>

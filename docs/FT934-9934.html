			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (5): Times are getting tough for exporters - The economy is highly sensitive to recession in Europe THE experience of a small cork company in northern Portugal is a telling example of how times are getting tough for Portuguese exporters. Just to land a contract with a UK importer the company was obliged to pay a good-will fee of Pounds 100,000. 'That kind of sweetener will take a long time for a small firm to recover,' says a Lisbon-based foreign consultant. 'It's a clear indication of the length companies are being forced to just to keep in business.' Portugal is a small, open economy based on imports and exports that is highly sensitive to recession in Europe. 'The European Community is experiencing its worst recession since it was established,' says Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, minister for finance. 'The recovery is proving so sluggish that it is bound to produce extreme anxiety and insecurity.' But recession is not the only thorn in the side of Portuguese exporters. For the past three years the Social Democrat government has maintained a policy of a strong escudo. This, combined with inflation considerably higher than the European average, has significantly pushed up export prices, hitting the export sector hard and sending up a cry of protest from industry. 'The strong escudo stance is the key flaw in the government's economic policy,' according to Mr Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialist Party. But both the finance minister and Mr Miguel Beleza, the governor of the Bank of Portugal, the central bank, defend the policy as key to the health and recovery of the economy. Portugal placed the escudo in the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) of the European monetary system in 1992 and from the beginning of this year lifted capital controls, making the currency fully convertible for the first time in more than a century. The escudo has suffered speculative pressures, which have cost it dearly in terms of foreign exchange. But since the realignment of the ERM bands in August this year the currency has remained reasonably stable without the need for massive central bank intervention. 'We are going to hold firmly to the course of a strong escudo,' says Mr Braga de Macedo. 'It is absolutely essential for us to achieve convergence with our European partners and to participate in economic and monetary union (Emu) with the first group of countries.' 'A consequence of the strong escudo policy is that Portugal is not able to have an independent interest rate policy,' points out Mr Beleza. The high interest rates needed to keep the escudo strong are another point of friction with many sectors of industry - in particular, the difference between prime rates, now at about 14 per cent, and the much higher rates that the small- and medium-sized companies that form the backbone of Portuguese industry have to pay. A key inflationary pressure that could help bring down interest rates is the level of wage rises. The government is seeking a social pact for 1994 that would hold public administrative sector wage rises to zero and other sectors to 4 per cent. Tax credit incentives have been offered to companies as part of the deal as well as an 8 per cent easing of income tax bands that officials claim will increase average family income by 1 per cent. But negotiations between trade unions, the government and employers appear deadlocked over an extra half a percentage point that the unions are insisting on. Mr Braga de Macedo believes that achieving the government's terms in a national wage pact would mean the difference between gross domestic product growing 1 per cent or 2 per cent in 1994. Others feel that a formal deal would help but is not essential. 'Most companies are going through a delicate time in terms of liquidity and profits,' says Mr Miguel Namorado Rosa, chief economist with Banco Comercial Portugues. 'This means they will not be in a position to give significant wage rises.' Another inflationary pressure is the budget deficit. After the embarrassment of a massive overrun in 1993, the government hopes to bring the deficit back towards convergence with the rest of the Community in 1994 with a deficit of 6.9 per cent of GDP compared with 8 per cent this year. The key to this appears to be improving inefficient tax collection and clamping down on widespread evasion.</p>

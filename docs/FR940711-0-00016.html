			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statutory and Regulatory Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Almond Marketing Order is promulgated pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 (``Act''). Congress enacted this statute in 1937, a time of economic upheaval for many farmers, in order to stabilize market conditions and ameliorate shortages and surpluses. Congress believed that ``establish[ing] and maintain[ing]'' such orderly marketing conditions would be in the public interest, ultimately benefitting both farmers and consumers.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. 602 (declarations of policy).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The principal means by which Congress sought to effectuate these goals is the promulgation of marketing orders under 7 U.S.C. &sect;608c. Marketing orders are regulations issued by the Secretary of Agriculture, after notice and hearing, and after a finding by the Secretary that the order's terms ``will tend to effectuate the declared policy of [the Act].''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. &sect;608c(4). Most orders do not become effective until it is approved by two-thirds or more of the affected producers voting in a referendum.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;608c (8) and (9). Conversely, a vote of a simple majority of the affected producers can terminate an order.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. &sect;608c(16)(B). Although producers vote on the marketing order, the order imposes direct regulatory obligations only on the activities of ``handlers'' or processors of agricultural commodities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  7 U.S.C. 608c(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 608c(6)(I) of the Act provides for the ``establishment of production research, marketing research and development projects designed to assist, improve, or promote the marketing, distribution, and consumption or efficient production of any such commodity or product, the expense of such projects to be paid from funds collected pursuant to the marketing order.'' Section 608c(6)(I) also provides ``[t]hat with respect to orders applicable to almonds *&blank;*&blank;* such projects may provide for any form of marketing promotion including paid advertising and with respect to almonds *&blank;*&blank;* may provide for crediting the pro rata expense assessment obligations of a handler with all or any portion of his direct expenditures for such marketing promotion including paid advertising as may be authorized by the order *&blank;*&blank;*''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the Secretary has promulgated a marketing order regulating the handlers of almonds grown in California. The Order is administered by the Almond Board of California (``Board''), which is composed of industry representatives, whose function it is to administer the Order and to recommend amendments to the Order. The duties of the Board also include acting as intermediary between the Secretary and industry members; investigating and collecting data on growing, shipping, and marketing conditions with respect to almonds; furnishing pertinent information to the Secretary; and keeping record of its acts and transactions. Funds to cover the Board's expenses are generated by levying assessments on each handler, in proportion to the kernel weight of almonds received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background of the California Almond Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The California Almond Marketing Order has been in effect since 1950. It provides a means for growers and handlers to work together to address various problems which affect the marketing of California almonds, including varying weather conditions which can lead to annual swings in production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One way in which the Almond Marketing Order has helped to address problems affecting the industry is by establishing salable and reserve percentages for all almonds received by handlers during a given crop year. The establishment of reserve percentages has allowed the Department to regulate the supply of almonds marketed and avoid dramatic price drops during years of excess production. In years when the anticipated annual crop is large, a reserve percentage may be established and handlers withhold a percentage of the almonds received from growers from the market. Conversely, in years when the annual crop proves to be small, reserve almonds are released for sale. In addition, small quantities of reserve almonds are sometimes used to develop new products or are disposed of in secondary markets such as oil or livestock feed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

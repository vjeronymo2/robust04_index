			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Pakistan business chambers 'to strike' Pakistan's largest organisation of trade associations and business chambers last night threatened to strike from Sunday if the government did not withdraw its plan to widen an existing net of a VAT-style general sales tax. The government said it was extending GST to include up to 277 items in last week's budget. Businesses are opposing the measure on the grounds it would fuel corruption by giving extra powers to government inspectors to clamp down on various factories unless they were paid an illegal 'gratification'. 'This budget will ruin the economy. It's no good,' said Mr SM Muneer, chairman of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry, which represents 120 associations and 30 business chambers, after the first round of discussions with government ministers and officials. 'They (businesses) want to pay more taxes but not the GST because it will only give birth to corruption,' Mr Muneer added. Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, commerce minister, said some of the objections from businesses were being considered by officials for possible changes, but the government would not consider any of the demands 'under pressure'. Such confrontation between the government and business leaders is not unique in the days after the budget. In previous years businesses have resisted various budgetary measures, eventually forcing governments to back off or partly tone down some of their proposals. However, it was not clear last night if the two sides could reach a compromise without one of them backing off on an important issue.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: Campari just passes Pounds 1m mark CAMPARI International, the sporting leisure wear group, saw its pre-tax profits drop to Pounds 1.11m in 1992, compared with Pounds 5.27m in the previous 13 months. A final dividend of 8.75p maintains the total at 12p, although earnings per share slumped from 39.24p to 0.79p. The group wrote down stock worth Pounds 2m and in future plans to write down stock by 25 per cent per season. It was hit by the devaluation of sterling. Analysts said the write down was a response to the trend for retailers to operate just-in-time-stocking systems as well as the drop in inflation. One said: 'There was a time when companies could simply carry stock over, and perhaps even get away with selling it at a higher price the following year. 'With retailers turning to demand-driven, just-in-time stocking systems and inflation more stable, that just isn't on any more,' he said. Mr Kit Maunsell, chief executive at Campari, said: 'We are taking a different view of the spread at which we sell stock.' Turnover rose to Pounds 54.2m (Pounds 53.7m). However, 71 per cent of sales were made overseas, and in terms of local currencies turnover was about 4 per cent below 1991. The net interest charge dropped to Pounds 205,000 (Pounds 424,000). The company had Pounds 4m cash, but a Pounds 1m overdraft on a UK subsidiary.</p>

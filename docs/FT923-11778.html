			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cheers for the producers - Cider is breaking away from its rustic image. Now it is aimed at everyone BRITAIN'S cider industry has kept its sparkle through a recession in which brewers and distillers have encountered their toughest trading conditions for decades. Bulmer, the UK's leading cider maker with a 45 per cent market share, last week reported a 19 per cent increase in 1991 profits. Dealing begins today in shares of Taunton Cider, its main rival, with most analysts forecasting steadily improving profits despite the less-than-expected splash of its flotation. Since 1988, cider production has risen nearly 25 per cent. It has poured out of the niche position it once occupied to become one of the most buoyant sectors of the UK drinks market. While beer consumption declined 3.6 per cent last year, cider volumes rose 3.1 per cent to a record 76.8m gallons, worth Pounds 600m in retail sales. The single most important factor driving this progress is marketing. Cider sales grew strongly in the late 1970s and early 1980s when it became widely available on draught in the country's pubs. This distribution-led growth came to an abrupt end in 1984 when the government increased the rate of excise duty by 47 per cent. The first general response of the industry to declining sales was to reduce advertising. Between 1983 and 1985, cider advertising was cut by a third. The result was further falls in volume and the growth of own-label ciders. Recovery began with a marked switch in advertising strategies and the development of products targeted on specific groups. For years, most cider advertising focused on traditional rustic images, and virtually the only product differentiation was between sweet and dry cider. In 1988, Bulmer increased its marketing expenditure by 70 per cent to Pounds 10m and launched a series of campaigns to revitalise its mainstream brands, Strongbow and Woodpecker, by giving them a more contemporary lifestyle image. Taunton started to push for growth through the development of new products. The successful introduction of Diamond White, a packaged premium cider, was followed by Diamond Blush, aimed at women. Red Rock, 'a different kind of cider' was produced to compete with mainstream lagers. It was less gassy than normal cider and was quirkily promoted. Taunton's most recent brand, Brody, is aimed at drinkers of premium lagers. Gaymers Group (then Showerings) introduced Copperhead, a draught cider, with advertising that gave it an urban image. It also launched K, a strong premium brand, to compete with bottled lagers. Merrydown, in contrast, continued to concentrate on the traditional premium sector it had created with advertising that concentrated on quality. Each new move stimulated the industry to further efforts. Taunton responded to Bulmer's increased advertising by intensifying the promotion of its best-selling Dry Blackthorn. The company claimed last year to have accounted for 57 per cent of the industry's total advertising, well ahead of its 33 per cent market share. Bulmer brought in new products, such as Scrumpy Jack, to compete with Taunton's new premium products; and it mounted a drive to secure greater distribution in free trade pubs. Advertising expenditure by the cider makers last year exceeded that of the brewers on a pounds per gallon basis. As a result, the industry has made 'major advances in destroying the image that it primarily caters to scrumpy swilling bumpkins', says Jean-Marc Garzon, analyst at Panmure Gordon. Recent market research by Bulmer confirms the change in consumer perceptions of cider. It is seen as a more 'natural' drink than beer, more up-to-date than bitter or stout. Consumers rate mainstream cider brands above rival lagers on quality; premium ciders compare with premium lagers in the fashions stakes. Cider's rapid growth in the last three or four years has been helped by hot summers, but the survey suggests it no longer depends heavily on favourable weather. It has benefited from lower excise duties than beer and the recent defeat of European Community proposals to link the tax on cider to that on wine was greeted with relief by the industry. 'But the moves towards a more brand dominated structure have made cider less price sensitive,' says Jonathan Goble, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Premium cider brands now sell at around twice the price of standard products and form the most dynamic sector of the market. Some scepticism remains about the durability of fashion brands; and the declining numbers of young drinkers may have its impact. However, the industry's performance during the past difficult year has brought optimism. 'Cider is very much in tune with contemporary interest and needs; it appeals to both men and women across all age groups,' says John Rudgard, Bulmer's chief executive. 'If we continue to invest in the imaginative marketing of both mainstream and new brands, there is an opportunity to make another substantial leap forward. Cider has the credentials to become the drink of the 1990s.'</p>

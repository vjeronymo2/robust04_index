			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Walesa tells how to handle Zhirinovsky: Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski hear how the west should react to Russia's vote winner The people of Poland were shocked three years ago when a quarter of them voted for an obscure Polish-Canadian called Stan Tyminski in the elections which brought Lech Walesa to the presidential palace. Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky won a similar share in last week's Russian elections. But when Poles voted again three months ago Stan Tyminski and his 'Party X' won less than 5 per cent of votes and thus failed to gain any representation in the new parliament. Is Mr Zhirinovsky destined for a similar descent into obscurity? According to President Walesa what happened in Russia was no surprise. 'I have said a thousand times that events in the post-communist world follow a different logic than to those in the west.' Economic deprivation makes the electorate vulnerable to the sort of populist 'solutions' offered by people like Mr Tyminski and Mr Zhirinovsky. 'This is a phase which the post-communist countries go through,' Mr Walesa said. 'It does not lead to a return to communism, but it does open the way for the return to power of the 'activists' I mentioned earlier, people who will do everything necessary, including turning their party cards from red to green, in order to regain power.' So does this mean that the market reformers should slow their pace? Mr Walesa thinks not. 'In Poland's case, Leszek Balcerowicz (the architect of Poland's shock therapy reforms) did a good job. A man like him is needed in every post-communist country. But I said from the start that men like Balcerowicz need a twin, a whole group of people, who come after him, to pick up the pieces.' Poles are acutely aware of the differences between their country, with its Catholic faith and traditional western orientation, and Russia with its imperial past, weak democratic traditions, huge size and ethnic complexity. They recognise differences between the unknown, rootless Tyminski and the better educated, better known and more deeply rooted Zhirinovsky with his gut feel for the depth of Russian self-pity and resentment. But, having been the pioneers of economic shock therapy only four years ago, Poles empathise with the struggling citizens of Russia and other former Soviet states. Polish economists in particular are aware that the really painful stage of structural reform, involving mass redundancies and soaring unemployment, has hardly even begun in Russia or in neighbouring Ukraine. Asked how the west should react to the snapshot of Russia presented by the election results, President Walesa returned to his view that the west had failed to work out a constructive policy towards the former communist world and remained hobbled by attitudes formed during the cold war. Like his counterparts throughout central Europe and the Baltic states, Mr Walesa argues that the former Soviet-controlled states of the region are best equipped to become a channel of western support for continuing reform in Russia. But he adds that the former Soviet satellite countries will only be able to play such a role if they are securely integrated into hitherto exclusively western structures like the European Union and Nato. 'In the old days when Europe was divided into hostile blocs it made sense not to admit poorer, less-developed states who would perhaps weaken the overall strength of the western bloc. But now that the Warsaw Pact has disappeared this argument no longer applies and we should be admitted into the European house even though we are poorer cousins,' he said. 'The top priority now is to stop Russia falling prey to anarchy and the most effective way would be to channel assistance through countries like Poland. We not only have recent experience of market reforms but also open borders with the eastern countries. We offer the best and cheapest way of reducing the security risks in this region and help strengthen Russia's reformers.' This view is shared by many other leaders in the region who fear being left in limbo between east and west. After the Russian elections their views will not be so easy to ignore when Nato leaders meet in Brussels for their summit early in the New Year with Mr Zhirinovsky's wilder threats of re-incorporating Finland, the Baltic states and Poland still ringing in their ears.</p>

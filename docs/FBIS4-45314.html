			<p>Traffickers   <F P=102>   94WD0377A Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 3 May 94 p 14 </F> <F P=103> 94WD0377A </F> <F P=104>  Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pranab Basu: "Central Aid for Drug Courts"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, May 2--The Union government will soon  launch a centrally-sponsored scheme under which the state  governments will be extended 50 per cent of the cost of setting  up special courts to deal with drug traffickers under the  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.    These courts were mandated by the United Nations convention  on drugs about six years ago. Barring West Bengal and  Maharashtra--no other states had set up these courts.    Recently, the Gujarat government under the late Chimanbhai  Patel had openly opposed the idea of special courts at the  meeting of the Western Zonal Council of which the Union home  minister, Mr S.B. Chavan, is the chairman. This is despite the  fact that Gujarat has the longest international border with  Pakistan and also a long coastline.    The centrally-sponsored scheme has been taken up following  requests from many countries that cases of their nationals who  are in Indian prisons due to drug-related cases be cleared as  soon as possible, according to reliable sources. The delay in  clearing these cases also creates human rights problems, the  Union home ministry is believed to have noted.    (Some countries under the European Economic Community are  believed to have requested the Indian government that their  nationals in Indian prisons be allowed treatment by private  physicians to be selected by their embassies.)    According to official sources, the maximum number of  imprisoned foreigners are in Maharashtra where the number of  pending drug-related cases is a staggering 15,564. The state had  set up 17 special courts but only seven are in operation due to  financial constraints.    Meanwhile, drug traffickers, terrorists and other smugglers  have started turning to the western region following the sealing  of the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan and Punjab and "stringent  vigil on the Jammu front," according to home ministry sources.    In fact, at the last Western Zonal Council meeting, Mr  Chavan  is believed to have told the then Gujarat chief minister, Mr  Patel, that these elements had started turning to the border in  Gujarat as the borders in Punjab and Rajasthan were being  strictly sealed.    "The number of pending cases did not give any idea of the  magnitude of the problem... It was common knowledge that in  Bombay and other cities these drugs are easily available in the  markets, schools, colleges and hostels.... This matter should  not be treated in a routine manner," Mr Chavan is learnt to have  observed, adding that so far only the peddlers were being  arrested but the big offenders were left scot-free.</p>

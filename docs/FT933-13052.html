			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / McGowan rises to the bait of the big float For a man who was looking forward to spending his time fishing, it appears to be an odd appointment. Mr Brian McGowan's chairmanship of the House of Fraser Stores may be non-executive, but as he conceded yesterday, his rod may have to stay at home for longer than he originally planned. The idea of working on a flotation, which he regards as 'meat and drink', was too enticing to turn down after the disappointment of not pulling off any big deal at Williams Holdings for several years. Mr McGowan does not officially step down as chief executive from the industrial conglomerate until the end of the year, although he has passed on most of his duties to his successor Mr Roger Carr. Mr McGowan says he is aware, however, that accepting the chair of the House of Fraser Stores was not without its risks. While the HoF is to be kept a separate autonomous business there is always the possibility that Mr McGowan's image could be tainted by working for the Fayed brothers. The takeover of the House of Fraser by the Egyptian brothers was one of the most controversial in UK corporate history. They were able to mount their bid when Lonrho, the international conglomerate, sold its 29.9 per cent stake in the HoF to the Fayeds for Pounds 138.3m in 1984. Mr Tiny Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive, believed initially he could work with the Fayeds. He had sold them the HoF stake because Lonrho had been twarted in its hostile bid for Harrods and its parent House of Fraser in 1981 when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled it to be against the public interest. Subsequently, Mr Rowland fell out with Fayeds, left the HoF board and Lonrho bought a new 6 per cent holding in HoF. In March 1985 the Fayeds bid about Pounds 600m for HoF and Lonrho sold its HoF shares in the market, which were bought by the Fayeds. Mr Norman Tebbit, the then Secretary of State for Trade, dropped the 1981 bar on the Lonrho bid - three days after the Fayeds gained control. He decided not to refer the deal to Monopolies and Mergers Commission. But the brothers were publicly censured, first by the Department of Trade and Industry and then last year by the Takeover Panel. The panel said statements made by the Fayeds during the takeover about their business interests and income-generating capacity may have created a misleading impression of their ability to finance the takeover. The takeover has been the focus of a long-running legal battle between the Fayeds and Mr Rowland, who has ferociously pursued a campaign against the brothers. Lonrho still has pending an action against the Fayeds claiming damages. Mr Mohammed Fayed and Mr Ali Fayed, his brother, dismissed the panel conclusions as 'a minor matter' based on the critical report by Department of Trade inspectors. But Mr McGowan accepts that it was more unwelcome publicity which contributed to the poor image of the brothers, which he believes in the main to be unfair. 'When I was first approached by Warburg (advisers to the stores group) to become chairman of the House of Fraser, I had, like most people, a number of preconceived, ill-informed ideas of the Fayeds, most of which turned out to be wrong.' He now describes them as 'absolutely charming'. But as far as Mr McGowan is concerned, the history of the Fayeds is irrelevant to the impending flotation of the stores which he says are being kept completely independent from the brothers. The Fayeds will have no representatives on the board and 'no influence whatsoever'. If they try to exert any influence over the business Mr McGowan says he will resign. However, after getting to know the Fayeds, Mr McGowan is confident that they will not change their mind over the planned flotation or try to influence his running of the company. He nevertheless admits: 'One cannot deny that there is in some quarters a credibility problem. That is one of the reasons for the long period between the announcement and the flotation.' He says he was delighted to find out that the Fayeds invested Pounds 100m in the stores over the past five years and has satisfied himself that there is 'no black hole'. House of Fraser has given itself until late spring or summer next year to put its message across, by which time trading figures for 1993 will be available. An adviser to the Fayeds said: 'The two brothers know that they cannot try and change the terms of Mr McGowan's contract in any way. Mr McGowan does not have to give any notice if he decides to resign. The brothers know that if Mr McGowan were to resign and take up fishing again it would be enormously harmful.'  -------------------------------------------------- HOUSE OF FRASER (excluding Harrods)  -------------------------------------------------- Year-           Sales     Operating    Pre-tax end                          profit     profit Jan 31        (Pds m)       (Pds m)    (Pds m)  -------------------------------------------------- 1991              698          46.6       30.5 1992              668          21.6       18.4 1993              695          36.8       32.8  --------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The savings provision of section 193 of the amended Act provides, among other things, that regulations and guidance promulgated or issued by the Administrator prior to enactment of the 1990 Amendments are to remain in effect according to their terms except to the extent that they are inconsistent with any provision of the amended Act. Section 188(f) of the amended Act provides EPA with the discretionary authority to waive a specific date of attainment for a PM&hyph;10 nonattainment area where it is determined that nonanthropogenic sources contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area, and to waive certain nonattainment area SIP requirements where the Administrator determines that anthropogenic sources of PM&hyph;10 do not contribute significantly to the violation of the standard in the area. These provisions take as a fundamental premise that areas experiencing violations of the NAAQS due to nonanthropogenic sources are to be designated as nonattainment. If areas were permitted to avoid being designated as nonattainment because their violations are caused in whole or part by uncontrollable natural events, then this statutory provision would have to be read as having no legal effect or significance. However, this would violate canons of statutory construction, which direct that statutory language not be treated as mere surplusage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, although appendix K appears to be preserved in part by section 193, the provision permitting the treatment of ``uncontrollable events caused by natural sources'' as exceptional events, and therefore excludable from nonattainment decisions, is inconsistent with the provisions of section 188(f) and should therefore be regarded as no longer having legal effect. Similarly, any EPA guidance permitting such exclusion of these events is inconsistent with the amended Act. For this reason, exceedances which are attributable to uncontrollable nonanthropogenic events may not be discounted or deweighted in any manner, but must be fully considered in determining whether violations of the NAAQS have occurred and whether designation as nonattainment is warranted. Future determinations relevant to exceptional events should therefore focus on the remaining type of exceptional event identified under section 2.4 of 40 CFR part 50, appendix K, namely whether the events_anthropogenic or nonanthropogenic_are likely to recur at the same location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

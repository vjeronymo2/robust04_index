			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Airliner flight tape 'missing' South Korea said at the weekend that the flight data recorder tape of the Korean airliner downed by a Soviet missile in 1983 was missing from the aircraft's 'black box' President Boris Yeltsin delivered in Seoul two weeks ago, writes John Burton. The tape would help explain why the airliner strayed off course over Sakhalin island before being shot down, killing all 269 people abroad. South Korea's ambassador to Moscow is expected to seek an explanation for the tape's absence.</p>

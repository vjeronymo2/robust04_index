			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Michel Rocard, former prime minister and </F> Socialist Party secretary general, under the "Opinion" rubric:  "France's Image Questioned: `Spineless Diplomacy Hurts France's  Image'"]    [Text] Sarajevo, Taiwan, Bern; what is the connection  between these three distant places? Answer: A policy which is  a disgrace to France. Let us review the facts.    Sarajevo. General Cot, like all his predecessors, denounces  the absurd conditions imposed on the troops he commands and  whose dedication is nothing short of admirable. He has barely  finished speaking when we -- government included -- unanimously  proclaim our approval and our hope that his urgent warning will  precipitate the Security Council meeting which will make the  required decisions. What happens instead? Not only is the  general prematurely discharged by the United Nations, but we  hear that the government, which lauded him so last week, has  agreed to the disciplinary measure this week! France keeps its  mouth shut.  <H5>  Government Decisions </H5>   Taiwan. A communique written in Beijing and endorsed in  Paris tells us that France purely and simply aligns itself on  mainland China's position and foregoes the relationship it had  begun to establish with Taiwan.    Forgotten, the Tiananmen massacre; forgotten, the human  rights violations; forgotten, the fact that all other countries  have managed to establish balanced relations both with Beijing  and Taipei.    The question would simply be to let it be known that under  no  circumstances would France condone any attempt from China to  forcibly regain control of Taiwan, and that it is therefore  committed to fulfilling the island's military needs. But China  demands that France -- and only France -- give it its undivided  attention. And France complies.    Bern. Two Iranians facing murder charges in Geneva have  sought refuge in France. Switzerland asks that they be  extradited. The French Government quietly flies them off to  Tehran. No explanation given. Not a word to the opposition,  even though it was ready to listen to the language of national  interest.    Not a word to Switzerland, even though it was ready to  listen  to the voice of reason. But instead, a shady deal: "Free our  executioners, and there will be no bombing in your country."  Such a deal -- which is what France's friends are suspecting  may have taken place -- is not only shameful, it is also  ineffective. A deal with terrorists is always a fool's deal.    I do hope that this is not what happened in this case, but  the government has done everything it could to give substance to  this accusation, which foreign newspapers do not hesitate to  relay. France spreads dismay.    In all three cases, the decisions were made exclusively by  the government. In all three cases, we made quite a poor show  of ourselves with the whole world watching. Spineless diplomacy  hurts France's image. And to think that we owe it all to  self-styled spiritual heirs of De Gaulle...!</p>

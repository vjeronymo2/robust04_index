			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Earnings dive 74% at Bear Stearns Bear Stearns followed other big Wall Street firms yesterday with a large drop in quarterly earnings, blamed on sharply lower trading and investment banking revenues. The securities firm said net income in its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on June 30, fell to Dollars 32.4m from Dollars 124.8m a year ago, a drop of 74 per cent. Revenues, net of interest expense, fell 37 per cent over the 12 months, to Dollars 429.9m. The weak final quarter, however, was not enough to stop the firm posting record profits of Dollars 387m, against Dollars 362.4m, for its fiscal year, and a record pre-tax return on equity of 38.7 per cent. The record results were achieved because earnings were so strong in the first two quarters. The problems encountered by Bear Stearns in the latest quarter have afflicted the entire US securities industry. Demand from companies for underwriting services, and from investors for broking services, fell precipitously this year in the wake of sharply higher US interest rates. The rise in rates has also created a turbulent environment for trading in financial markets, and many firms' trading profits have fallen as a result. Bear Stearns, like many others, has been especially hard-hit by turmoil in the mortgage-backed securities markets. Its biggest decline in the latest quarter was in its principal transactions business - where the firm trades its own money - which recorded a 66 per cent drop in revenues to Dollars 127.7m. Investment banking revenues fell 31 per cent to Dollars 94m, but revenues from commissions, boosted by increased clearance, futures and institutional activity, climbed slightly to Dollars 124.3m.</p>

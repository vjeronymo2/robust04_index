			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW U.S. STATUTE BANS PAROLE;  </P> <P> PROSECUTORS SET TO THROW AWAY KEY ON SEX CRIMINAL  </P> <P> Five times Warren James Bland has been released from prison. Fives times he has  been rearrested for terrorizing women and children in a series of sexual  assaults in Southern California.  </P> <P> He last walked out of prison three years ago, but was soon back behind bars,  charged with the torture-murder of a 7-year-old South Pasadena girl and held as  a prime suspect in the slayings of a 14-year-old Placentia girl and an  81-year-old San Diego woman.  </P> <P> Now, after crimes that have spanned the last three decades, the government is  saying "enough."  </P> <P> The 53-year-old Bland was convicted this spring under the Armed Career Criminal  Act, a relatively new federal statute that targets incorrigible offenders and  removes them from society. Next month, if prosecutors are successful, Bland  will become the first person in California and the fourth nationwide to receive  the federal government's harshest punishment under the act.  </P> <P> The government is asking that Bland spend the rest of his life in prison, with  no chance of parole.  </P> <P> "He's got gray hair," said Assistant U.S. Atty. Larry Burns in San Diego,  describing the Jekyll-and-Hyde demeanor of Bland, who adapts well to prison  life but repeatedly has attacked women and children. "He's got a Cherub-like  face. He wears glasses. He looks like somebody's grandfather or uncle. He  doesn't look menacing at all. He looks like any other John Doe you'd pass on  the street."  </P> <P> Bland has spent 23 of the last 28 years in prison. During those few years out,  he has repeatedly been unable to resist the urge to hurt others.  </P> <P> "I think he belongs in prison," said Jack Osborn of Placentia, whose only  daughter was murdered at the age of 14 in a case in which Bland was a prime  suspect, but never formally charged.  </P> <P> Bland declined a request to be interviewed inside the Metropolitan Correctional  Center here.  </P> <P> His attorney, Judy Clarke, also declined to discuss the case. In legal papers  filed with the court, she contended that the case is "selective and vindictive  prosecution."  </P> <P> "It is inconceivable that Mr. Bland is the first such individual in the  Southern District of California whose prior record meets the elements for a  prosecution under the Armed Career Criminal statute," she said in the court  papers.  </P> <P> Under the act, adopted by Congress in 1986, a defendant faces from 15 years to  life in prison, with the maximum sentence including the proviso that "such  person shall not be eligible for parole."  </P> <P> The aim of the law is to remove from society those hard-core, repeat offenders  who spend a lifetime committing crimes and reap the benefits of a judicial  system that opens the door again and again.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Criminals Described  </P> <P> In testimony before a House subcommittee on crime, Assistant Atty. Gen. Stephen  Trott described the kind of people the law was designed to put away.  </P> <P> "These are people who have demonstrated by virtue of their definition that  locking them up and letting them go doesn't do any good," Trott said. "They go  on again, you lock them up, you let them go, it doesn't do any good, they are  back for a third time.  </P> <P> "At that juncture, we should say, 'That's it, time out, it is all over. We as  responsible people will never give you the opportunity to do this again.' "  </P> <P> Burns, the federal prosecutor who is requesting the sentence for Bland, cited  the three other cases in the country that have drawn the harshest penalty of  life sentence with no parole. He said none of the other cases involved such a  high degree of violence.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Others Convicted  </P> <P> Another 300 defendants convicted under the statute have received more than  4,500 years in prison.  </P> <P> But Burns contends that the past cases appear relatively minor when placed next  to Bland's criminal record.  </P> <P> "By any measure," he said, "Warren Bland is a worse criminal."  </P> <P> Bland grew up in Culver City, the second of two children of a maintenance man  and a cleaning woman. He would have completed high school but dropped out weeks  before graduation.  </P> <P> He once told a probation officer that his father, Carl O'Dell Bland, beat him  "excessively as a youngster," and then was closer to him as a teen-ager and  young adult.  </P> <P> About his mother, Hava K. Bland, and his string of problems with the law, Bland  told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge:  </P> <P> "It was nothing more than really rebellion and against what I call a mother  image. I was a very confused young man, very aggressive, and I had no pattern  of life whatsoever to really base myself on."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tossed Out of Marines  </P> <P> Bland grew to manhood, six feet and 190 pounds with blond hair and blue eyes.  He joined the Marine Corps, but was tossed out for bad conduct after going  AWOL. He worked as a painter and a machinist. He married three times, his last  wife leaving him to move to Las Vegas.  </P> <P> He first answered for doing harm to others in 1958 when he was convicted of  felony assault in Los Angeles for stabbing a man in the stomach. The man was  drunk and talking to Bland's wife, and Bland took offense.  </P> <P> He was given no prison time, and instead was granted five years' probation, a  break that for Bland would keep repeating itself in the years to come.  </P> <P> "I don't think the interest of justice, or society's interest, would be served  by sending you to jail on this case," Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge  Leroy Dawson told the defendant. "So you have a chance to stay out of jail."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sent to State Hospital  </P> <P> That chance was short-lived. In 1960, he was convicted of rape and kidnaping in  a series of sexual assaults on women in Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Bland was sent to a state hospital, where he was examined and psychoanalyzed  and deemed a "sexual psychopath." The hospital warned that if Bland "was  released to society, he would be assaultive and/or homicidal toward women."  </P> <P> But Bland assured a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge in 1966 that if  released, "I don't feel I would have any further trouble." A 1967 probation  report recommended he be given another chance, "in view of the defendant's  complete change and attitude toward his problem."  </P> <P> After seven years of treatment, he was back on the streets of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Series of Attacks  </P> <P> Less than a year later, another series of sexual attacks occurred. A  schoolteacher was raped at knifepoint. A 31-year-old woman was awakened when a  man's gloved hand reached through her bedroom window and covered her mouth. She  was dragged out the window, into the back yard and was raped.  </P> <P> Bland was once again before the bar of justice for the two crimes. He was  convicted of rape, kidnaping and burglary. At his sentencing, a probation  report was filed that said: "The defendant is clearly a dangerous individual  who warrants segregation from society for the longest time that is possible  under existing laws."  </P> <P> He served seven years. He was paroled. And he struck again.  </P> <P> The victim was an 11-year-old girl and her mother, who were accosted while  walking down the street of a Los Angeles suburb. Both were molested; the girl  was tortured.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Served Three Years  </P> <P> Bland pleaded guilty to kidnaping and assault with intent to commit rape. He  was sentenced to an indeterminate term in state prison. He served three years,  then was paroled back into the community.  </P> <P> The crimes continued, and Bland was back in jail within eight months, this time  convicted of sexually assaulting an 11-year-old Torrance boy. The boy had been  tortured with wire, clothespins, pliers and vice grips. Bland pleaded guilty  and was sentenced to nine years.  </P> <P> A 1981 California Department of Corrections summary on Bland noted his problems  while free, as opposed to his congenial attitude while in prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Locked in Mortal Combat'  </P> <P> "While in free society, Bland is always locked in mortal combat with his id,  and the id invariably emerges victorious," the summary said. "While  incarcerated, he no longer has to contend and he leaves the supervision of the  id to others."  </P> <P> Bland accumulated good-time and work-time credits in prison, which reduced the  length of the sentence. After serving less than five of the nine years, he was  paroled in January, 1986. And now the crimes in which he would be implicated  got worse than ever.  </P> <P> Phoebe Ho, 7, of South Pasadena disappeared while walking to school in  December, 1986. Her body was later found in a Riverside County ditch. Wendy  Osborn, 14, of Placentia in Orange County was found dead in the Chino Hills in  February, 1987. Both girls had been sexually assaulted and apparently tortured  with pliers or some other kind of clamp.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential Suspect  </P> <P> Bland's probation officer, John Blum, listed Bland as a potential suspect  because he "has an extensive sex-crimes background, which includes the  molestation of children."  </P> <P> A statewide manhunt was organized. Bland was found in San Diego, using an alias  of James Sterling and working at a McDonald's restaurant in Pacific Beach. He  was cornered by a San Diego police officer and was shot in the buttocks when he  attempted to flee.  </P> <P> Prosecutors in Riverside say they will seek the death penalty if Bland is  convicted of Phoebe Ho's murder. Police in San Diego, meanwhile, consider him  the prime suspect in the murder of 81-year-old Ruth M. Ost, found nude and  strangled with her hands bound. However, no charges have been filed in that or  the Osborn case.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Extra Insurance'  </P> <P> Even if Bland gets life with no parole in San Diego, Brian McCarville, a deputy  Riverside County prosecutor, said he will still try Bland on the Phoebe Ho  murder.  </P> <P> "It's an extra insurance policy to keep him in prison," McCarville said.  </P> <P> Burns, the federal prosecutor in San Diego, won an indictment against Bland  under the Armed Career Criminal Act. That was last September, when it became  obvious that the Riverside County case was moving slowly and that Bland might  not be tried for years for the Phoebe Ho murder.  </P> <P> A federal jury in San Diego last March weighed the evidence of whether Bland  was indeed a career criminal. Burns said the jury deliberated 30 minutes and  found Bland guilty.  </P> <P> On Thursday, U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence Irving scheduled Aug. 9 as the day  to announce whether the prison door will slam for good on Bland.  </P> <P> In his sentencing memorandum asking the judge to order Bland to prison for the  rest of his life, Burns noted that the U.S. Probation Department concurred in  that recommendation. The prosecutor wrote that "Bland has been like a plague on  our free society for too long."  </P></p>

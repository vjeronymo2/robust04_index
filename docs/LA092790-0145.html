			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> THIELEMANS BEGUILES CATALINA CROWD  </P> <P> Jean (Toots) Thielemans, the veteran virtuoso from Belgium who opened Tuesday  at Catalina Bar and Grill in Hollywood, is a man of several talents, as  guitarist, whistler, composer and harmonica player.  </P> <P> They have given him an entree into many areas, from commercials (Old Spice) to  records with Quincy Jones, and even pop dates with Paul Simon; but a small jazz  group remains his preferred setting.  </P> <P> As the man who brought to the chromatic harmonica the same acceptance in jazz  that Larry Adler had earned for it in classical music, Thielemans improvises on  it with such clarity of vision, such dexterity and tonal beauty, that one  reacts to the message without ever being concerned about the modesty of the  medium.  </P> <P> Playing pop and jazz standards -- "I Can't Get Started," "Days of Wine and  Roses," Thad Jones' "Three and One" -- he interspersed his set with sentimental  comments about his days with Benny Goodman, George Shearing and, most notably,  Jaco Pastorius, to whose "Three Views of a Secret" he brought a warmly personal  touch.  </P> <P> He expressed justifiable pride in his sidemen. They are the sensitive,  harmonically imaginative pianists Michel Herr -- a fellow Brussels native, who  played his own award-winning composition "Labyrinthe" -- and the Italian  bassist Riccardo Del Fra, whom he turned loose on a deeply moving treatment of  "I'm A Fool to Want You."  </P> <P> For a finale, as always, Thielemans switched to guitar and offered his  whistling-and-guitar-unison version of his most famous composition,  "Bluesette." When the audience insisted on more, he introduced a new and  delightful original, "Song for My Lady," then picked up the harmonica to close  with "Ne Me Quitte Pas."  </P> <P> In the world of jazz, Thielemans remains one of a kind, an artist of unique  musical and personal charm. An hour under his spell is a rare and rewarding  experience. He closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

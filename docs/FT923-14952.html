			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Collected thoughts of a financial jackdaw - Diary of a Private Investor / Kevin Goldstein-Jackson on his mania for collecting and profitable. When I was a small boy I used to hunt through my money, looking for a valuable 1933 penny. I even became the school money-lender, giving up lunch so I could lend my five shillings-per-week dinner money to other pupils. Interest was levied at a weekly rate and people were encouraged to pay in copper coins, just in case there was a rare coin among them, although I would also accept foreign coins, postage stamps, toys and anything else I thought I could re-sell at a profit or which I felt was worth saving in the hope that it would appreciate in value. Thus began my fascination for collecting, although (apart from a few postage stamps) I have long since disposed of my schoolboy possessions and I never found a 1933 penny in my change. The attraction of owning a British 1933 penny was that only seven or eight were ever produced and several are in museums. In November 1985, at a coin auction held by Spink and Son in London, I achieved my schoolboy dream and acquired a 1933 penny in extremely fine condition. According to one coin collectors' catalogue (not produced by Spink) which I had looked at prior to the auction, a 1933 penny had sold in 1980 for Pounds 28,750 and a similar coin, but in extremely fine condition, was supposedly worth Pounds 50,000. I was therefore overjoyed at 'only' having to pay Pounds 17,250 for my 1933 penny. But a 10 per cent buyer's premium was added to the price, plus VAT on that premium, bringing the total cost to Pounds 18,975. It still seemed to represent a good investment - but what do you do with a penny coin? A rare coin is easy to flee the country with if there is ever an obnoxious government but, unlike a painting, a coin cannot be hung on a wall and it is not exactly beautiful to look at. If I touched it too much with my bare hands I might accidentally scratch it and thus reduce its value, so it had to be kept in a Perspex container. Then, with an increase in burglaries in our area I thought it was best to keep it in a safety-deposit box at a bank. All this is very boring. I visit my coin about three times a year but the thrill of ownership has rather worn off. I suppose owning a 1933 penny is a bit like climbing Mount Everest - it was an exciting challenge and a thrill to gain the peak, but after that everything else seems a bit disappointing. Fortunately, the coin has increased in value and I am now considering selling it. Another investment whose attractions have rather dimmed is my wife's title of the Lord of the Manor of Westleton Grange, which I bought for her as a surprise Christmas present in 1986. Westleton Grange is in Suffolk and the title was at one time held by the third Duke of Norfolk, whose niece was Anne Boleyn. Over the years, the title passed to various people, including Sir Harbottle Grimston. In 1955, the title was sold for Pounds 350. It was re-sold for Pounds 1,025 in 1966 and I acquired it at auction for Pounds 7,000. There was considerable interest in such titles in 1987-88 when the average price went to Pounds 9,000-Pounds 13,000 but prices for ordinary lordships are now back to 1986 levels. However, one of the attractions of the lordship of Westleton Grange was that it came with a small collection of ancient documents, including the court book of 1689-1777. I suppose if we lived in Suffolk the lordship would retain some of its appeal but my wife is Chinese and would prefer a simpler title. So she is now considering selling it - either at one of the regular auctions which are held for such titles or by private treaty. Over the years, my attitude towards collecting has changed. Unless the object concerned is of sentimental value, or pleasant to look at, then I am prepared to sell it. Sentimental objects include a deceased aunt's medals, including a Royal Victorian Order. Every time I look at it I am reminded of her kindness and how, when I was a young boy, she used to regale me with tales of her work at Windsor Castle. I would never part with my aunt's medals. Nor would I dispose of my own modest collection of white Chinese jade. It is beautiful to look at, and to feel, and the carving is exquisite. Just to hold a delicate carving of a peach - a symbol of long life - is to be filled with a sense of peace and tranquility. That, to me, is worth much more than its increase in value since its purchase. However, insurance means that valuable items have to be held by the bank. Larger items, such as paintings and sculptures, which I collect, cannot be kept in a safe. But I only collect modestly-priced works by living artists and the works I own are all easily identifiable and so would be hard to sell by a thief. And who (apart from my wife who bought it) would want a John Bratby portrait of me? Every year I visit the Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition but in recent years some artists - particularly those accepted for the first time - have been asking rather too much for their work so I have refrained from buying at the exhibition. Instead, I buy the small, green Royal Academy catalogue which lists all the exhibiting artists' addresses. If I like a particular artist's exhibited work I wait until the euphoria of the exhibition has worn off (usually after six months) and write to the artist concerned asking if he/she has any other works for sale. The responses are usually encouraging and it is often a real delight to meet them and to see their studios - and quite often their works can be acquired direct at modest prices. It also cuts out hefty commission payments to commercial dealers, some of whom have been known to charge 40 per cent. Whether anything I have collected will prove to be of tremendous monetary value is probably for a future generation to discover: but for people wanting to make genuinely long-term investments, while gaining pleasures for the eye, collecting works of art has much to recommend it.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CORPORATE EARNINGS  </P> <P> Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.: The nation's largest retailer said its third-quarter  profit fell 30% from a year ago to $179.2 million despite a 5.9% revenue  increase to $13.96 billion. Sears cited sharply lower gains from sales of  property in the Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, reflecting the soft  residential real estate market. Earnings from the Sears Merchandise and Dean  Witter Financial Services groups improved while Allstate Insurance Group's  earnings declined, the Chicago-based company said.  </P></p>

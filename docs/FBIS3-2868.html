Speaking at a seminar on military education, Chief of the  General Staff Adm. Liu Ho-chien noted that Beijing has decided  to increase its defense budget by 20 percent this year to top  U.S.$5.75 billion. He said that any cut in Taiwan's defense  budget would further tip the already disproportionate  cross-Taiwan Strait military balance. The Republic of China  [ROC] military has requested a budget of U.S.$ 9.1 billion plus  an extra U.S.$1.1 billion for the purchase of F-16s and Mirage  2000-5s.    Liu said, however, that he fully understood the government's  desire to seek balanced national development despite the current  financial difficulties.    Liu also warned that the potential military threat from  Mainland China should not be underestimated.    Taiwan can never be too careful, he said, as Beijing has  obtained a large amount of advanced weaponry from the former  Soviet Union and the United States continues to pull its troops  out of the Asian region.    Quoting Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek who said "learn from  your enemies," Liu emphasized the importance of military  education, and said Taiwan should pay more attention to the  development of the military on the mainland.</p>

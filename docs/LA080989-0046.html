			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAVIDIAN TO TAKE OVER EZELL'S INS WESTERN REGION  </P> <P> Ben Davidian, the chairman of the California Agriculture Labor Relations Board  for the last 2 1/2 years, was named Tuesday as the top immigration official in  the West, succeeding the colorful and controversial Harold Ezell.  </P> <P> The 38-year-old Davidian, who admitted having no experience in the politically  sensitive field of immigration, had been the leading choice to become Western  regional commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.  </P> <P> "He does have outstanding credentials," said David Runkel, chief spokesman for  U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh. "We think that he will bring a degree of  professionalism to the office."  </P> <P> Davidian's predecessor, Ezell, had a penchant for making statements that  enraged many Latinos.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, we can grow from the terrible era of 'Rambo' Ezell and make history  with Davidian," said Amin David, the head of Los Amigos de Orange County, a  Latino activist group.  </P> <P> Davidian, who is expected to start work Monday at the INS regional headquarters  in Laguna Niguel, replaces Robert M. Moschorak, a career INS official who was  named last month as a temporary replacement for Ezell after he resigned.  </P> <P> The post is considered a key one since the immigration agency is in the midst  of handling the second phase of the 1986 amnesty law. More than 60% of the 3  million immigrants who applied for legal resident status are in the INS'  Western region, which includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii and the  Pacific island of Guam.  </P> <P> Davidian, a Fresno native whose paternal forebears came from Armenia, faces two  difficult hurdles when he assumes his post.  </P> <P> First, he admits to a lack of experience in the immigration field.  </P> <P> "He basically represents a continuation of Ezell's ignorance and policies since  he has no experience," said East Los Angeles immigration attorney Antonio  Rodriguez.  </P> <P> "It's troubling to say the least," added Vibiana Andrede, a staff attorney with  the National Center for Immigrant Rights in Los Angeles. "We've gone from a hot  dog vendor to a know-nothing."  </P> <P> (Ezell was an executive with the Der Wienerschnitzel Corp. when he was  appointed to the INS Western commissionership in 1983.)  </P> <P> Also, Davidian has been criticized by liberals who say he has dealt unfairly  with farm workers since he was named chairman of the ALRB in 1987.  </P> <P> "He is anti-Latino and definitely pro-grower," said Dolores Huerta, co-founder  and first vice president of the United Farm Workers. "Under his leadership, the  ALRB no longer looks after farm workers."  </P> <P> The panel, created in 1975, considers cases of alleged unfair labor practices  and disputes surrounding farm union-representation elections.  </P> <P> For his part, Davidian, contacted late Tuesday at his office in Sacramento,  said the criticism is not new or fair.  </P> <P> "That's just not so," he said.  </P> <P> He pointed out that similar criticism of inexperience was made of him when he  was named to the labor panel, and he said he has a sound grasp of agricultural  labor issues. He expects to do the same with immigration.  </P> <P> He also denied he was anti-Latino.  </P> <P> "That is such unfounded baloney," he said. "When they have nothing else to  criticize me for, they always fall back to that."  </P> <P> Davidian was scheduled to leave for Washington today for briefings on  immigration policies and procedures before returning to California to assume  his new post.  </P> <P> He has a bachelor's degree from the University of Utah and a law degree from  the Hastings School of Law at UC San Francisco. He practiced law in Sacramento  and San Francisco before heading the ALRB.  </P> <P> Silver reported from Washington. Ramos reported from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Arbitrage dealer defies recession to earn Pounds 9m EYEBROWS may be raised in Downing Street if heads of industry earn more than Pounds 1m. But in the recession-defying City, at least one man has dwarfed these sums. Mr Kaveh Alamouti, a dealer at Tokai Bank's London operation, is believed to have earned Pounds 9m last year, probably making him the highest paid trader in Europe. The sum puts him in the same league as Mr Peter Wood, founder of Royal Bank of Scotland's Direct Line insurance operation, who earned over Pounds 6m in the year to September 1992, and is thought to be on course to earn more than Pounds 10m in the financial year just ended. As head of arbitrage trading, Mr Alamouti looks for opportunities to make money across all financial markets, dealing in complex derivative instruments such as options as well as in bonds and currencies. Arbitrage trading takes particularly strong nerves: as much as Dollars 50m of a bank's own money can be pitted on a single trade. Descriptions of Mr Alamouti among other traders ranged from 'a real poker player' to 'a walking computer'. A former academic, Mr Alamouti was lured away from Salomon Brothers, where he was a top arbitrage trader, in 1990. He joined the US investment bank's research department in New York in 1983 as an analyst, before becoming a trader on Salomon's legendary fixed income arbitrage desk there. Mr Roger Livesey, deputy chairman of Tokai Bank Europe, and Mr Alamouti last night both declined to comment. Arbitrage traders are particularly high earners, even by the generally high standards of the City and Wall Street. Ms Joan Zimmerman, executive vice-president of GZ Stephens, a Wall Street headhunter, said: 'Certain US arbitrage traders have been known to have earned Dollars 23m a year. Their competition in terms of compensation is not just other investment banks but also hedge funds, so to a great extent they are paid on a different scale from other traders on Wall Street.' The bond market rally and currency market volatility of the last two years have proved extremely favourable for skilful arbitrage traders. Tokai's annual report for the year to December 31 1992 shows that a director of Tokai Capital Markets earned Pounds 7.6m and a director of Tokai Bank Europe earned Pounds 1.4m. It is believed that both these figures refer to Mr Alamouti, a director of both companies, but Tokai declined to confirm or deny.</p>

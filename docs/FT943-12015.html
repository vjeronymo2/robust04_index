			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: BCP launches largest Portuguese bid Banco Comercial Portugues yesterday announced a Es132bn (Dollars 781m) public offer for a controlling stake of 40 per cent of Banco Portugues do Atlantico. The purchase would push BCP to first position, from fourth, in the ranking of Portugal's commercial banks. BCP's offer, the biggest take-over bid in Portugal, is the first of what is expected to be a number of important acquisition and merger attempts as the five biggest banks, several of them recently privatised, jostle for market share. BCP's bid, at Es3,000 a share, values BPA, Portugal's largest commercial bank, at Es300bn. The offer is almost 50 per cent higher than BPA's market price and about 16 times forecast 1995 earnings. BPA shares closed at Es2,010 yesterday, down from Es2,022 on Monday. Dealers said the offer was announced too late to make a large impact on prices. BCP shares closed at Es2,231, down from Es2,235 the previous day. Lisbon stock market analysts considered the offer high. BCP officials acknowledged the bank was prepared to pay a premium for winning control of BPA and to improve the group's market position. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP chairman, said the offer was made to expand BCP's market share and increase its potential for cross-selling financial products, because growth based on the bank's existing resources was proving too slow. He said control of BPA would increase BCP's market share to 22 per cent, from about 10 per cent, after the disposal of some companies within the BPA group that would be superfluous to the new group. He said BPA's brand name and marketing strategy would not be altered. BCP, based on results for 1993, is Portugal's fourth largest commercial bank by net assets but it ranks first in terms of own capital. An earlier attempt to expand was frustrated last year when the government turned down BCP's offer to purchase state-owned Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Portugal's sixth ranked commercial bank. BCP's offer has to be approved by the stock exchange commission, the finance ministry and the central bank. If approved, the operation is not expected to be completed before November.</p>

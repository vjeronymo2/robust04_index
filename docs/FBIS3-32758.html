			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on developments related to the Colombian elections  scheduled for 8 May 1994: Liberal Party [PL] presidential  hopeful Humberto de la Calle Lombana has said "now is the time  for social issues." He has visited Popayan, Cauca Department, to  learn firsthand how the country's economic situation is  affecting the lives of poor people. He has said his  administration would focus on eradicating poverty. In  Santander, he has proposed the creation of more mobile counter-  guerrilla battalions, because "they are more effective and cost  less." He has also proposed "exerting pressure on the Prosecutor  General's Office to continue fighting impunity through the  creation of judicial mechanisms." De la Calle has also proposed  a reduction in military operation costs. (Santa Fe de Bogota EL  NUEVO SIGLO in Spanish 31 Jan 94 p 8)    PL presidential hopeful Carlos Lemos was the center of a  polemic yesterday for using inappropriate language when  referring to the manner by which his party is being treated.  His remarks sparked many reactions, but Lemos did not express  regret about using such language; on the contrary, he said he  wanted "to call the attention of other PL members," because he  believes "Liberalism is in decline." He said: "I publicly said  what everybody is commenting in private. The party is in bad  shape, and it is going to lose power if it does not change. It  is sad to see a PL congressman lose his seat every week."  Otherwise, he added if the party does not react, the country  could identify with other candidacies such as Andres Pastrana's  [Conservative Party presidential hopeful]. Meanwhile, PL  President Julio Cesar Turbay has refrained from commenting on  Lemos' remarks, saying he "will take no reprisals." Ernesto  Samper, another PL presidential hopeful, said Lemos' position is  "unfair," and Ernesto Parejo Gonzalez, a PL dissident and  presidential hopeful, said Lemos "has no authority to make those  remarks, because he is a member of the party he criticizes."  (Santa Fe de Bogota EL TIEMPO in Spanish 1 Feb 94 p 6A)    Treasury Overseer Jorge Garcia Hurtado ordered a 30-day  freeze yesterday on 94.549 billion pesos of the national budget  to prevent several congressmen who are seeking reelection from  using funds of the so-called "social investment programs."  Garcia said by freezing these funds he is "guaranteeing the  honesty of the March and May elections, because the use of these  funds to carry out works could influence their outcome."

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> JAPANESE KODO DRUMMERS PERFORM AT ROYCE HALL  </P> <P> Sado Island in the Sea of Japan is not the birthplace of sadomasochism -- but  you begin to wonder when you see the island's most famous export: Kodo, "the  children of the drum."  </P> <P> Playing from the most excruciating positions imaginable -- in a low  squat-stance ("Miyake"), for example, or in a lay-back ("Yatai Bayashi"), so  that each drumbeat requires a sit-up -- this 12-man, communal company aims for  the absolute in force, precision, stamina, teamwork and self-abnegation.  </P> <P> Watching Yoshikazu Fujimoto attack the 800-pound O-daiko high on a platform at  Royce Hall on Tuesday, you saw each rib, every ligament, all his vertebrae  under skin stretched so taut that he might have been a drum himself.  </P> <P> Clearly this was not just a performance, not "merely" drumming, but some sort  of engulfing, metaphysical test. And thus the burst of playful celebration (and  individuality) in the finale seemed like a frat-house party after finals -- or  whatever 20th-Century samurai do after proving themselves worthy.  </P> <P> With its low, steady tattoos rising inexorably to a roaring storm, Maki Ishii's  "Monochrome" again proved Kodo's most intimidating showpiece. Sometimes the  seven players produced a light clatter like distant typewriters from their  small drums. In other passages, their unison playing mixed with the throb of a  gong and pounding assaults on big drums -- or splintered into brilliantly  coordinated irregular rhythms.  </P> <P> Roetsu Tosha's "Chonlima" also offered relentless drum crescendos, along with  motifs passed down a line of four drummers and punctuated by statements from a  single large drum behind them. Like "Monochrome," there were no solos here --  but the fierce, punishing hammer-blow solos in "Miyake" by Eiichi Saito and,  especially, Tatsuro Matsuzaki demonstrated individual mastery far less than a  kind of unsparing selflessness.  </P> <P> Wisely, Kodo has broadened its repertory to embrace idioms far different than  such scorched-earth Japanese specialties. "Yu-Karak" (new to UCLA) adapted  Korean farmers' music -- Samul-Nori turf -- for a relatively relaxed and  spontaneous display led by the highly personable Leonard Mitsutada Eto.  Composed by Eto, the piece featured two drummers playing a simple, one-stick  pattern, two others making complex figures with two sticks and Eto himself  using two sticks and two sides of his drum for maximum virtuosity.  </P> <P> Although Kodo's methodical style in the new "Ryogen-no-hi" robbed Javanese  gamelan playing of its sensuality (no cascades of bells; indeed, very few  overtones), the contemplative flute and samisen interludes by Motohumi  Yamaguchi and Yasukazu Kano showed that the company can excel at something  other than drums and cymbals.  </P> <P> Performances continue through Sunday afternoon and mark the end of Kodo's  10-week "One Earth" tour of the United States.  </P></p>

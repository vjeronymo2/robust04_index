			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> I just opened The Times to Page 2 and saw the flag-burning photograph from  Portland, Ore., where President Bush paid a visit for a political fund raiser  (May 22). I was angry and ashamed to see a young lady holding the flag of our  United States while watching it burn.  </P> <P> No wonder our country is filled with crime and corruption when we allow this to  happen. We are losing the fight for the respect of our wonderful United States  by allowing flag burning.  </P> <P> How can anyone in his right mind, be it a U.S. citizen, alien or a visitor,  look inthe mirror after commiting this despicable act?  </P> <P> Those who deliberately burn, mutilate or walk on our "red, white and blue"  should be punished by law. I commend our government to take action now and stop  this unlawful act.  </P> <P> DORIS B. ELLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

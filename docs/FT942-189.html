			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Sinn Fein to hold special meeting Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, is to hold a special delegate conference - the first of its kind in 23 years - to finalise its response to the Downing Street declaration amid growing optimism that the IRA will announce an extended summer ceasefire. The conference will be held 'within the next few weeks' and the party's formal and definitive response to the Downing Street declaration will follow immediately, the party said. The declaration offers a place at the negotiating table to Sinn Fein if it formally and permanently renounces violence. Last week, the party published the findings of its Peace Commission, which revealed that almost 40 per cent of 280 written and oral submissions believed the party should encourage the IRA to call a unilateral ceasefire. Mr Pat Doherty, the party's vice-president, said at the time that the commission's findings would influence 'how we should proceed in the weeks and months ahead'. The only other occasion when a special Sinn Fein conference has been convened was in 1971 to formalise the split between the provisional and official Sinn Fein, and their respective military wings. The 'officials' subsequently abandoned military action, as well as the Sinn Fein title, and entered mainstream politics as a socialist party. The present Sinn Fein leadership is anxious to avoid any further split and is moving cautiously to avoid confrontation between moderates and hardliners within its ranks. A temporary ceasefire is thus likely to be seen as the best compromise in order to give a positive response without totally accepting the Downing Street declaration. In Sinn Fein's view, a temporary ceasefire would shift the political pressure on to the Loyalist paramilitaries to suspend their military activities. It aims to refocus the political debate on to what it defines as key areas of the conflict. These are that the Irish people as a whole have the right to national self-determination; that the exercise of self-determination is a matter for agreement between the people of Ireland; that the consent and allegiance of unionists are essential ingredients if a lasting peace is to be established; that the unionists cannot have a veto over constitutional change; that the British government must join the persuaders (of the unionists); and that London and Dublin have a responsibility to secure political progress. Several of these points are at odds with the Downing Street declaration.</p>

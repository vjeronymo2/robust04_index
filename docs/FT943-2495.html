			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Social Democrats in Sweden set to win poll Sweden's Social Democratic party was last night set to return to power after defeating Mr Carl Bildt's centre-right coalition in yesterday's general election, according to early results. A computer projection, based on almost 20 per cent of the total votes, predicted a sharp swing to the left, but indicated that the the Social Democrats, led by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, a former prime minister, would fail to win a parliamentary majority. The Social Democrats, who ruled Sweden for most of the past 60 years, were set to win 45.3 per cent of the vote, easily enough to defeat Mr Bildt's three-year-old, four-party coalition government. The reformist coalition was seen to be winning a combined total of 40.8 per cent down from the 46.7 per cent it gained in the 1991 election. Its rightwing ally, the New Democracy party, was also set to fail to win re-election to the parliament. According to the results, Mr Carlsson will have to decide whether to form a minority Social Democratic government or seek a formal coalition with at least one smaller party to gain a majority in the Riksdag. The Left party, a traditional Social Democratic ally, and the Environment party, were set to hold the balance of power with strongly improved results compared to 1991. But Mr Carlsson has indicated he might seek an alliance with the Liberal party, a member of the current government. Mr Bildt's minority coalition won the 1991 election when the Social Democrats slumped to their worst result for decades, winning only 37.7 per cent of the vote. The government promised radical market reforms to revitalise an economy weighed down by extensive welfare provisions. But it was hit by the worst recession since the 1930s which shrank the economy by 5 per cent over three years. The most urgent problem facing the new government is a recession-induced crisis in the public finances. Sweden last year ran a recession-inflated budget deficit equivalent to 13 per cent of gross national product, one of the worst in Europe. The public debt will soon exceed 100 per cent of GNP and is the fastest-rising among members of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development. Uncertainty about the shape of the new government and its policies has led in recent months to a sharp rise in interest rates, undermined the value of the Swedish krona and led reduced growth forecasts for next year. The financial markets were hoping the election would produce a stable government that would quickly adopt tough fiscal policies.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / US banks named in report on Bombay scandal BANKS including Citibank and Bank of America contravened the guidelines of India's central bank by using investment management schemes as deposit substitutes, according to an official report on the Rs35bn (Pounds 630m) Bombay securities scandal published yesterday. The report, from a committee appointed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and headed by Mr R. Janakiraman, tackled subjects including the portfolio management schemes which were marketed by banks particularly to public sector companies with surplus cash. The committee said that while banks offering portfolio management schemes had, in their documentation, broadly conformed to RBI guidelines, the schemes were used as deposit substitutes. Clients believed they would be entitled to higher rates of interest without any risk, for short-term deposits. Under Indian regulations, funds placed with banks under portfolio management schemes have to remain with them for at least a year. However, several banks offered facilities for so-called 'ready-forward' or repurchase transactions. Securities, bonds and units were sold to clients on a ready basis and repurchased after the specified period, assuring the client a guaranteed rate of return with no risk. The committee said that almost 90 per cent of the total investments made out of funds of portfolio management schemes (PMS) were accounted for by three banks: Citibank, accounting for Rs12.98bn, or 55.73 per cent of the investment, Canfina Mutual fund accounting for 19.4 per cent and Syndicate Bank accounting for 14.48 per cent. According to the report, Citibank has argued that there was no violation, since the transactions were through portfolio management scheme funds kept by clients, and RBI restrictions on ready forward transactions did not apply to these funds. The Janakiraman committee said it would further examine the matter, but 'it does illustrate the dangers involved in the use of portfolio management scheme funds to bypass RBI guidelines in general'. Between April 1 last year and May 31 this year Citibank, one of the major participants in the securities market, entered into ready forward transactions for an aggregate value of Rs59.72bn. Bank of America, according to the report, undertook nearly a thousand 'off the books' transactions, totalling Rs69.54bn, offering more than double market rates of interest, for periods of 15 to 60 days. Standard Chartered, the British bank, which has been hit by the financial scandal, operated a scheme called Corporate Cash Deployment Services. Funds received and outstanding under the scheme at March 31 this year were about Rs7bn at its Bombay branch alone. The committee has said the Joint Parliamentary Committee appointed to investigate the scandal would fix responsibility for the malpractices.</p>

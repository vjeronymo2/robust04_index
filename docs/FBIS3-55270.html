			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: By Andrey </F> Pershin, Andrey Petrovsky, and Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed Yuriy  Baturin his national security aide Thursday, the president's  press service reports.    Baturin, 44, Dr.Sc.(Law), a graduate of the Moscow Physic-  Technical Institute, the Moscow Law Institute and the School of  Journalism of Moscow University, has been the president's legal  aide.    The introduction of the new position is in line with the  Constitution, which calls for a strong presidency, the  president's press secretary, Vyacheslav Kostikov, told  Interfax's Vyacheslav Terekhov.    Furthermore, this is a natural continuation of the personnel  policy in the post-Soviet period. Kostikov placed special  emphasis on the fact that national security would be the  responsibility of a civilian.    IF Note: According to a reliable source, Baturin was an  adviser to Georgiy Shakhnazarov, an assistant to ex-USSR  President Mikhail Gorbachev on foreign policy matters. Baturin  was instrumental in drafting Yeltsin's key decisions last summer  and autumn. In the opinion of a number of experts, he took part  in working out in September of 1993 the presidential decree to  dissolve the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies  and schedule new parliamentary elections.    On the threshold of the opening session of a new parliament,  the president has taken a number of decisions concerning his  close aides. On Tuesday, he decreed relieving Sergey Yushenkov,  Mikhail Mityukov, Mikhail Poltoranin, and Ekaterina Lakhova of  their duties because of their future parliamentary work. This  has been reported by the president's information service.    Mityukov has up until now led the Presidential Committee on  Legislative Initiatives. Poltoranin has been in charge of the  Federal Information Center, Yushenkov has been Poltoranin's  first deputy, and Lakhova has been a presidential adviser.    By yet another decree, Yeltsin has dismissed his envoy to  the  Maritime Territory, Butov.    Earlier, he sacked two advisers -- Sergey Stankevich (on  political affairs) and Aleksey Yablokov (on environmental  problems).</p>

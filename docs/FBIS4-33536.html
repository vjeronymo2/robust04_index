			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mario Simas Filho] </F>   [Text] Brazil will head the Inter-American Human Rights  Forum until 1996. This decision was made by representatives of  21 nongovernmental organization (NGO) countries who met in  Brasilia. Between 24 and 29 April, 70 NGO's met in Brasilia to  create the forum that will work in coordination with the OAS.    Among its objectives, the forum will report on and clarify  human rights violations. It will also promote an exchange  between NGO's and the governments of the Americas. The forum  will be directed by a secretariat of seven countries. The  United States, Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cuba, Venezuela, and  Paraguay are the members of the secretariat.    Benedito Domingos Mariano, director of the Santo Dias Human  Rights Center of Sao Paulo, was elected secretary general. He  will organize the structure of the new Inter-American  organization, promoting the creation of branches in each of the  21 countries of the forum. The objective is to follow the model  of Amnesty International.    Oscar Sappiano, the OAS Inter-American Human Rights  Commission president, attended the Brasilia meeting. He  proposed that the forum should join the commission's  consultative council.    This position will give the forum the right to participate  in  investigating human rights violations throughout the continent.    The Inter-American Human Rights Forum will be connected with  the seven-judge, OAS Inter-American Human Rights Court which  passes moral judgment on the governments that violate the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The forum will also help  to prepare the annual human rights record reports submitted by  various governments to the United Nations.</p>

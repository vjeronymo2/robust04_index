			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Austria Gives Overwhelming Yes to </F> EU"]    [Text] With 66.4 percent voting in favor, Sunday's [12  June] European Union [EU] referendum outcome was a clear  expression of support for Austria's admission to the EU. The  81.3-percent election turnout was unexpectedly high.    Austria will belong to the EU as of 1995. The referendum,  which was necessary in view of the "overall change" to the  Constitution that admission would entail, saw 66.4 percent vote  in favor of membership of the EU and only 33.6 percent against.  In absolute terms, there were 3,095,260 votes for and 1,566,799  votes against.    With this green light given by the Austrian population and  the yes given by the European Parliament on 5 May, there are  only mini-hurdles now in the way of membership: The national  parliaments of the "original EU" countries must now give their  blessing to the applicants. However, this will hardly impact on  the 1 January admission date.    Speaking to DIE PRESSE, President Klestil described the  result as a "victory for all Austrian patriots." Now, future  European policy will also have to be conducted on the basis of  consensus. The president did not conceal the fact that he also  respected those who voted no -- "because they went and voted."  In addition, he said: "What I said before the referendum --  namely, that it has nothing to do with politicians or parties,  let alone warnings -- also applies today." Visibly moved, the  politician who has already been described as the "father of EU  admission," Foreign Minister Mock, spoke of an "overwhelming  success." Beaming, he said that "the Austrians have shown that  they are much better than they themselves believe."    At a joint news conference later in the evening, Chancellor  Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Busek both stressed that they are  in any event thinking about continuing with the coalition after  the October elections for "European reasons."    The results in the laender were between 56.4 percent in  favor  in Tyrol and 74.6 percent in favor in Burgenland. The vote in  Vienna was 65.8 percent in favor.    The first exit polls, but also information about trends in  last week's opinion polls, made it possible to conclude that the  content and form of the rhetoric used by opponents also boosted  support for admission. Above all it led to an increase in the  turnout which overwhelmingly benefited the number of "yes" votes.</p>

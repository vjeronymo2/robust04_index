			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PLEAS ENTERED IN SHOOTING  </P> <P> Two former Torrance police officers, fired after the accidental shooting last  year of an unarmed suspect, pleaded not guilty Wednesday in Los Angeles  Municipal Court to charges that they gave false accounts of the incident to  their superiors.  </P> <P> Timothy Pappas, 27, and Mark Holden, 30, are free on $2,500 bail.  </P> <P> Each is charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice and conspiracy to falsely  charge another with a crime. If convicted, they could be sentenced to up to  three years in prison.  </P> <P> Pappas and Holden were fired from the Torrance Police Department after the May  9 shooting of Patrick J. Coyle, 30. Pappas fired a single shot that struck  Coyle in the chin and lodged in the back of his skull, leaving him partially  paralyzed.  </P> <P> Pappas and Holden, who arrived in a second squad car to provide backup, said  Coyle made a sudden movement that provoked the shooting, according to Deputy  Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden. In fact, Coyle was unarmed and did not move  before the shooting, Darden said.  </P> <P> Coyle has sued the city, which has admitted liability in the incident. No  settlement has been reached.  </P></p>

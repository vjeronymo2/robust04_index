			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Excerpt] [Word indistinct] May 5 (MAP) -- Algeria's recent  decision to resume assistance to the `Polisario' [Popular Front  for the Liberation of Saquia El Hamra and Rio de Oro] gang  claiming the independence of the Sahara deals a serious blow to  Maghreban unity and sows the grains of [words indistinct]  instability in the region, wrote Moroccan daily BAYANE AL YAWM.  For the daily of the Party for Progress and Socialism  (PPS/leftist opposition) such a decision is a blatant evidence  that Algeria is undermining the settlement process of the Sahara  issue and the UN efforts as well.    Referring to JEUNE AFRIQUE weekly which reported in its  latest issue that Algeria had recently [resumed] supplying  weapons and spare parts to the `Polisario', the daily noted that  that news was circulated immediately after the statements of the  Algerian ambassador to Madrid and the threat to resort again to  armed struggle against Morocco voiced lately by [Polisario  leader] Mohamed Abdelaziz.

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Back to the futures . . . - Beverly Chandler is positive about a negative Managed futures sound risky, but they can cheaply deliver what almost every investor wants - diversification. This is an industry with an image so negative in Europe that until recently, in many cases, more of its members' time has been spent trying to convert the unconverted than in managing money. But the strongest argument for the inclusion of derivatives - futures, options and warrants - in a portfolio, is that the managed futures sector tends to move in the opposite direction to other assets such as bonds or equities. This has been the subject of long-running debate, but it seemed to be borne out by Credit Lyonnais Rouse's Systemtrend, one of the first-established offshore futures funds, which triumphantly achieved 14 per cent growth during October and November 1987, while stock markets crashed. If investments in managed futures portfolios go up when equities are down, then they have a role to play in the balanced portfolio. The strength of this argument, supported by a move towards probity as the cowboys started to hang up their hats, has started a slow reconciliation of managed futures funds with regulatory authorities across Europe. However, while many in the UK welcomed the creation of two authorised futures unit trusts - the Fof (futures and options fund) and Gfof (geared futures and options fund) in July 1991, many more feel that the restrictions on the funds are too limited for efficient portfolio management. Fofs were met by only two contenders, Legal &amp; General with Tactical Asset Allocation trust and John Govett Unit Trust Managers which has now launched nine Fofs. The Tactical Asset Allocation trust bases its investment decisions on a computer model which indicates which type of asset - equities, gilts or cash  -to invest in and when. Futures are used for investment exposure because, according to Michael Hayden, of L&amp;G, 'Index futures are a cheap, cost-effective means of achieving the model's recommended exposure without the risks associated with the selection of individual shares.' L&amp;G has raised Pounds 10m for its fund since launched on December 30 last year, but the fund is bottom of its sector over six months, to July 1 according to Finstat. This reflects poor performance in the managed futures industry which showed an average loss of 12.9 per cent in the year to May 31, according to the Managed Account Reports futures fund index, the only measure of futures fund performance currently available. This bears out the argument that the performance of derivatives is diametrically opposed to that of equities. The FT A World Index for the same period shows growth of 12.4 per cent. The fund requires only a Pounds 1000 minimum subscription unlike John Govett's funds which are offered to more 'professional' investors with a minimum of Pounds 100,000 subscription. John Govett's funds cover four indices twice. For example, for the UK there is a tracker fund which uses futures to track the FT-SE index, and a bear fund which aims to achieve broadly the opposite of the index. The ninth fund is a cash fund. John Govett has raised Pounds 60m since launch in December from discretionary fund managers and broker bonds. But fund managers' dissatisfaction with the existing regulations is shown by the fact that these two companies have not been joined by others. Industry watchers originally looked to the Prudential for the first launch of a managed futures unit trust in the UK. Under Alan Wren, the Prudential took a high profile, carrying out a series of roadshows explaining the joys of managed derivatives funds. But once the rules were published, there was silence from the Pru. Wren says: 'Little will happen at the Prudential until the SIB changes the rules. We want flexibility of charging structures, single pricing and a clarification of terminology, particularly where the guarantee is concerned.' The guaranteed fund has easily the greatest marketing potential of the managed futures products. Guaranteed funds were first used offshore by E D &amp; F Man International with their range of Mint Funds. Each fund has a fixed lifespan of either five or seven years. The money under management is split into two funds, with the larger amount going into high quality bonds designed to return this part of the fund to 100 per cent of the original value by the fund's termination date. The rest is invested in futures and options. The aim is for the investor to be certain to get his original capital back and to have the return on the derivatives on top. E D &amp; F Man is a big European player, with slightly more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 520m) under management in a range of over 20 offshore managed futures funds. The UK's restrictive legislation has put them off launching funds here. Colin Barrow, managing director of E D &amp; F Man's fund division, said: 'We wish the others the greatest success, but I think that the regulatory regime, with the difficulty of creating a guaranteed fund, does not suit us.' Hugh Dumas, marketing director of Credit Lyonnais Rouse, says: 'Managed futures funds have shown that they are an asset class in their own right with the MAR (managed futures) index beating the equity and bond indices on a straight comparison over eight years. UK investors must be allowed to access managed futures through properly authorised funds.' As an answer to the many complaints, the Securities and Investments Board is planning a conference at the end of November 1992, hoping that industry participants will come along and air their views. It could be a lively event.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Election of LA mayor is wide open LOS ANGELES residents go to the polls today to choose a mayor in a neck-and-neck contest, as two candidates fight for different kinds of votes in the same city. Mr Michael Woo, a 41-year-old councilman and liberal Democrat who is the grandson of Chinese immigrants, aims to become the first Asian-American mayor of a big US city. But he faces a tight race against Mr Richard Riordan, 62, a political newcomer and millionaire businessman who is a conservative Republican. The winner will succeed Mr Tom Bradley, a black liberal, who is retiring after 20 years. Mr Woo has won broad support from the large immigrant community in Los Angeles and, at the weekend, his campaign focused on south central Los Angeles, the site for the riots of last year. In contrast, Mr Riordan appeals to more affluent suburban voters.</p>

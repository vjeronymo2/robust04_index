So the fledgling enterprise is alive. When it was still only  at the planning stage, people were bewildered by the author and  parent of this scheme, Eduard Sagalayev: This popular  television journalist had held too high posts in the past for  him so easily to launch himself into a fairly risky venture.  Nevertheless, in this country it is not the "nocturnal Zephyr"  which floods the airwaves but the Ostankino state television  tower's central control room. This is why the freedom to express  oneself on television is as yet subject to many conditions here.  What is there to say about one private television channel taken  in isolation, which is beating the state television network's  cunning ruses.    At first the founder of the Moscow Independent Broadcasting  Corporation's channel six really did have literally nothing  except a license to broadcast -- good intentions to begin the  unitary television system's destatization. He had neither  premises nor funds, but nevertheless persistent rumors about  each TV 6 staffer having his own Mercedes were doing the rounds  even among experienced television personnel. All the more so  as, after all, billionaire Ted Turner, who is famous for his  whims and a certain weakness for Russia, became TV 6's patron.    The emergence of the channel was, oh, so complicated. For a  whole year representatives of the Moscow Independent  Broadcasting Corporation and Turner Broadcasting  Systems,zmopping their fevered brows, busted a gut to put  together a contract for the joint enterprise: Lawyers in Russia  had never before had to work on such a project. They came to an  agreement after long discussions: Russian news stories would  come together in a sizzling combination with American films on  TV 6.    The idea behind Sagalayev's enterprise could not have made  better sense: a channel standing outside politics and ideology  and enjoying all the advantages of an outsider. "A very  opportune idea," a well-known politician, who today would hardly  be able to hold his audience's attention, would say about this:  The elections proved that the "electorate" no longer excuses  poor delivery.    As far as TV 6 is concerned, politics exists only in its  strictly private manifestation -- in the family setting. Here  it is, however, no less controversial and hazardous than  intrigues at the highest level. Whereas the other five channels  are running discussions on the grave crisis, TV 6 is unabashedly  putting out a Fred Astaire tap dancing routine, the breathy  tones of Tatyana Doronina, the guilty smile of Leonov, and so on  and so forth. Unfortunately, the majority of our cinemas'  posters simply cannot compete with TV 6: "Hollywood's Golden  Film Library," "Cinema TV 6," "Children's Screening," and  starting in the new year "Masterpieces of World Cinema" -- where  else will you see such a wide range of films?    But channel six had to remember about unity of place and  time: The neutral black studio backdrop was no help. The talk  show "Eduard Sagalayev Presents..." first of all introduced the  viewers to an "apolitical" Federov, then afterwards announced a  forthcoming meeting with Sergey Shakhray. It is good that this  rendezvous did not take place: Politicians are not protected by  the wives they appear alongside on TV 6. The very sad  conclusion has inevitably to be drawn: It is impossible to live  in our society and be free from.... It is all right to talk  about anything else, and he has some highly attractive future  proposals.    In January the first editions of the television magazine  program for men and women will go out: To the CNN international  news will be added thematic news broadcasts from this  corporation which are unknown to the Russian viewing public:  "Show Business News," "Traveler's Guide," "A Look into the  Future," and "Style." An unusual gameshow "Your Decision" is in  store for the viewers, which is a series of films, in which the  viewers themselves determine the outcome of the action. The  first sports broadcasts will appear on TV 6 in 1994: TV 6 will  be screening footage of the U.S. open figure skating  championships in January.</p>

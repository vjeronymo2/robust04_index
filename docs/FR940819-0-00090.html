			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Southwest Airlines and TWU Local 556 stated that this provision should apply to a flight attendant who is reassigned after reporting for work and the reassignment is beyond the operator's control. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> FAA Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has adopted this provision as proposed so that air carriers will not be penalized for operational delays such as those due to weather and air traffic control. The FAA recognizes that delays are costly and that operators avoid delays whenever possible. Sections 121.467(b)(14) and 135.273(b)(14) of this final rule apply to flights that are assigned and scheduled and that normally terminate within allowable duty limitations. However, this provision does not apply to operational delays relating to flight attendant staffing problems. A flight attendant's duty period begins when the flight attendant reports for a flight assignment and ends when the flight attendant is released by the air carrier. Changes to a flight attendant's schedule after a duty period begins must be made in accordance with the duty period limitations and rest requirements set forth in this final rule. In addition, if a flight attendant reports for duty and is later reassigned, the scheduled duty time before reassignment must be counted as part of the total duty period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Example: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A flight attendant is scheduled for a 13-hour duty period on flight staffed with the minimum cabin crew complement. The duty period consists of two flight segments_a flight from New York to Frankfurt followed by a flight from Frankfurt to Rome. Because of adverse weather conditions, the flight leaving New York is delayed 2 hours, causing the flight attendant's duty period to exceed the scheduled 14-hour duty period limitation. Although it is apparent at the time of departure that the flight attendant's duty period will exceed 14 hours, completion of the assignment will still comply with duty period limitations, because the flight attendant was scheduled and assigned to flights that normally terminate within the allowable duty period limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, if, for example, the flight attendant is reassigned in Frankfurt to a flight to Athens, the flight attendant's revised scheduled duty period cannot exceed a total of 14 scheduled hours, unless the flight attendant crew is augmented in accordance with &sect;&sect;121.467 (b)(4), (b)(5), or (b)(6), as appropriate, and each flight attendant is given the minimum required rest. The flight attendant's duty period did not start over in Frankfurt because of the reassignment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Rest Period Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA received numerous comments on issues related to the rest requirements proposed in the NPRM. Commenters addressed issues including the definition of a rest period, scheduled rest versus actual rest, minimum rest, reduced rest, subsequent rest, relief from duty in air transportation and air commerce for 24 consecutive hours of rest in any 7 consecutive calendar days, and on-board rest requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM defined a rest period as the period when a flight attendant is free of all restraint or duty for a domestic, flag, or supplemental air carrier or commercial operator and is free of all responsibility for work or duty should the occasion arise. ATA, the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions, and Southwest Airlines recommended revisions to the definition of rest period. The comments submitted by ATA and the Coalition of Flight Attendant Unions addressed reserve status in their recommended definitions of rest. Southwest Airlines stated that the definition of rest period should be defined as actual hours of rest, not scheduled hours of rest. Two commenters, including Delta Airlines, agreed with the definition of rest period as proposed in the NPRM. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NPRM proposed requirements for scheduling rest and reduced rest periods. Sections 121.466 (c) and (h) and 135.273 (c) and (h) of the NPRM proposed requiring that a flight attendant scheduled for 14 hours or less of duty be given 9 consecutive hours of rest, and that a flight attendant scheduled for more than 14 hours but less than 20 hours be given 12 consecutive hours of rest. Proposed &sect;&sect;121.466 (d) and (i) and 135.273 (d) and (i) proposed permitting an air carrier or commercial operator to reduce these rest periods to 8 and 10 consecutive hours, respectively. Three commenters (Southwest Airlines, TWU Local 556, and TWU of America) supported the minimum rest requirements proposed in the NPRM and also indicated that the rest requirements should not be increased. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RAA expressed concern that the requirement to provide 9 hours of rest for duty periods of more than 14 hours implies that a flight attendant who reports for a flight that is canceled is required to receive 9 hours of rest before the next duty period begins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

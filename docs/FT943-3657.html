			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Observer: Vladimir's welfare Some former communists are such excellent exponents of free market economics that you wonder what on earth was going on inside their heads just a few years back. Take former Communist party member Vladimir Dlouhy, for instance, currently the Czech Republic's most popular politician. In the five years since Prague's velvet revolution, Dlouhy has become leader of the liberal-conservative ODA party and also been taken on as minister for industry and trade. Dlouhy was in London yesterday, trying to drum up interest in investment from the Confederation of British Industry. He drew a convincing picture of an economy which has metamorphosed from Comecon dodo into lean, mean machine of new-found liberalism. He also did a slash and burn job on west Europe's welfare state practices, accusing them of being the root cause of damaging anti-dumping measures taken against former communist states. Dlouhy told the CBI that blaming low wages in Asia and eastern Europe for western Europe's relatively poor economic performance was wide of the mark. The true cause of European Union sluggishness is bloated social security payments, pushing labour costs in Germany to levels as much as 15 times higher than in the Czech Republic. So cut the welfare state nonsense and introduce proper competition, to the benefit of all. Where on earth did Dlouhy dream up such radical notions? Maybe he was thinking of those countries where the state is so bankrupt as to be unable to meet its pensions, healthcare and social security commitments  - such as former communist regimes.</p>

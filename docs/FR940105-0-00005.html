			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comment period expired on June 22, 1993. Forty comment letters were received. Twenty-eight were from power reactor licensees, six from unions, one from an industry association, one from a vendor, three from licensed reactor operators, and one from a private citizen. There was overwhelming support for the proposed reduction in the annual rate of random testing for licensee employees. Most of the commenters believed that the reduced rate also should apply to contractors and vendors, and several commenters proposed a flexible, performance-based rate. There was no support for excluding from any reduction in the random testing rate certain positions critical to the safe operation of a nuclear power plant, such as licensed reactor operators. A summary of the comments received and the NRC's responses are presented below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Comment. The random testing rate for licensee employees should be reduced to 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All of the 23 commenters submitting comments on the Commission's proposed reduction of the random testing rate to 50 percent for licensee employees supported the proposal. The reason most often expressed was the low rate of positive random test results experienced by licensee employees, particularly in comparison with other industries having significant safety concerns. These commenters believe that this low industry-wide positive rate justifies the lowering of the random testing rate to 50 percent. Some commenters stated that a 50-percent rate for licensee employees would make that rate consistent with the random testing rate currently required in the substance abuse programs mandated for entities regulated by the agencies within the Department of Transportation (DOT), including the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Highway Administration. They also noted that DOT is currently considering lowering its proposed random testing rate below 50 percent even though Federal Highway Administration data, for example, indicate a significantly higher positive rate than that experienced among NRC licensee employees. Another commenter pointed out that the lowered random testing rate for licensee employees subject to the NRC's FFD rule also would be consistent with the random rate applied in the Commission's own internal drug testing program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters supported the reduction with the expectation of significant cost savings for licensees as a result of only testing approximately one-half the number of employees now being tested. In this regard, the Nuclear Management and Resources Council (NUMARC) made reference to the November 1992 GAO report, ``Employee Drug Testing: Opportunities Exist To Lower Drug-Testing Program Costs'' (GAO/GGD&hyph;93&hyph;13), which suggests reduced random testing rates as a means of producing cost efficiencies in Federally mandated drug testing programs without adversely affecting program integrity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concerning the relative effectiveness of alternative random testing rates, some commenters believe that a 50-percent random testing rate would produce satisfactory deterrence of drug and alcohol abuse. This is particularly true in light of the fact that other FFD program elements, such as program awareness training and behavioral observation, and the access authorization program will continue to inhibit such behavior. Two commenters also supported the proposed change because it would lessen the disruption of workers lives and reduce the invasion of privacy that random drug testing creates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Response  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC concurs with those commenters who stated that a 50-percent random testing rate as applied to licensee employees can be expected to provide sufficient deterrence to justify lowering the rate at this time. It also agrees with the observation that the access authorization program and other FFD program elements, such as policy communications and awareness training, behavioral observation, for-cause testing, employee assistance programs, and the imposition of strict sanctions for violations of an FFD policy will continue to deter drug and alcohol abuse by most of the workforce. As some commenters noted, requiring fewer tests of licensee employees should decrease the privacy invasion experienced by some employees. It also should result in cost savings across the industry by reducing lost work hours and the number of tests to be administered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission recognizes that positive results in the nuclear power industry's random testing are generally among the lowest of any U.S. industry. Nonetheless, it realizes that there are many variables that can affect the rate of positive testing results and that relatively low positive test results, by themselves, are not the only indicator of the effectiveness of a testing program either on an industry-wide or a licensee program level. Some of the variables that could affect the testing results are the propensity of the population being tested to use drugs and alcohol, the effectiveness of other program elements, and the extent to which tested employees have been successful in subverting the testing process and avoiding detection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NRC does not have sufficient information about these or other factors that may influence testing results to be able to determine that the decreasing positive rates reported by licensees are an unqualified indication of FFD program effectiveness. Nonetheless, the Commission is gratified to observe the decreasing positive rates in licensee employees' random test results during the past three years. The recently published NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Volume 3, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Annual Summary of Program Performance Reports,'' indicates that licensee employees' positive random testing rate in 1992 was 0.20 percent as compared to 0.28 percent in 1990 and 0.22 percent in 1991. There also have been decreasing positive rates for random testing of contractor and vendor personnel, viz., 0.56 percent in 1990, 0.55 percent in 1991, and 0.45 percent in 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making its decision, the Commission has considered these testing results along with the apparent continuing strength of the other elements of most licensees' FFD programs, the reduced invasion of employees' privacy interests, and the potential for cost savings. In light of this industry experience and of these beneficial effects, the Commission has concluded that it is reasonable at this time to lower the random testing rate for licensee employees and contractor and vendor personnel to 50 percent. The response to Comment 4 discusses the Commission's reasons for allowing reduction in the random testing rate for contractor and vendor personnel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Comment. The random testing rate should be reduced to less than 50 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

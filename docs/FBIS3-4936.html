			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 27 Feb 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Japan [BOJ] expects there will be little  impact on the yen rate despite the fact the G-7 meeting ended  with member nations failing to clearly define cooperative  efforts toward stabilizing the exchange market, as Japan had  hoped. A senior official of the BOJ's International Department  said: "To a certain degree, the market already reflects the  fact that the exchange rate was not going to be high on the  agenda at the latest meeting."    At a meeting with the Japanese finance minister, the U.S.  treasury secretary requested in strong terms that Japan try to  cut its current account surplus. Some market officials,  therefore, predict a yen rise in the exchange market early next  week. However, the BOJ is doubtful, saying, "there does not now  seem to be an automatic appreciation in the yen when the United  States takes a hard-line attitude."</p>

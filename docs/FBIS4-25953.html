			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 16 (XINHUA) -- China today published a  12,000-word white paper on its intellectual property protection.    Published by the Information Office under the State Council,  the three-part white paper gives a detailed account of China's  basic position and attitudes toward intellectual property  protection, and a systematic introduction to its legislation and  law enforcement in this regard and China's efforts in fulfiling  its duties of international intellectual property protection.    The paper says that, as a whole, China, however, for a  variety of historical reasons, began work on its intellectual  property rights protection system at a comparatively late date.    After China started reform and opening to the outside world,  it accelerated the process of establishing an intellectual  property rights protection system in order to rapidly develop  social productive forces, promote overall social progress, meet  the needs of developing a socialist market economy and expedite  China's entry into the world economy, says the paper.    According to the paper, since the end of the 1970s, China  has  done a tremendous amount of effective work in this field,  covering in a little more than a dozen years a distance which  took other developed countries scores of years, even a hundred  years, establishing a relatively comprehensive legal system for  the protection of intellectual property rights, thereby  attracting worldwide attention for its achievements not only in  establishing the system but also in enforcement.    The paper says that it is the Chinese Government's view that  the intellectual property protection system plays a significant  role in promoting progress in science and technology, enriching  culture and developing the economy.    It adds that it functions both as an important institution  ensuring the normal running of the socialist market economy and  as one of the basic environments and conditions for conducting  international exchange and cooperation in science, technology,  economy and culture.    China considers the protection of intellectual property an  important part of its policy of reform and opening to the  outside world and of the building of its socialist legal system,  the paper says.    Since the initiation of the policy of reform and opening to  the outside world, China has formulated a number of laws, such  as those on trademark, patent, copyright and combating unfair  competition, and has been actively involved in the activities of  world intellectual property organization and other concerned  international institutions and become member states of related  international conventions.    When reviewing the World Intellectual Property  Organization's  past 20 years of cooperation with China, Dr. Arpad Bogsch,  director-general of the organization, pointed out that "China  had accomplished all this at a speed unmatched in the history of  intellectual property protection," the paper recalls.    In accordance with its national conditions and current  tendencies in international development, China has formulated  and fine-tuned various laws and regulations on intellectual  property protection, thereby constructing a socialist legal  system for intellectual property protection with Chinese  characteristics, says the paper.    It concludes that the scope of the intellectual property  rights protected in China and the degree of protection afforded  have gradually conformed with international practices and the  high degree of legal protection for intellectual property rights  has been realized.    The white paper points out that China's Intellectual  Property  Law stipulates the legal responsibilities to be borne by anyone  who violates the law, including civil liability, criminal  liability and exposure to administrative sanctions.    The white paper says that with the implementation of  intellectual property laws, intellectual property rights are  effectively protected in China. These laws are also actively  encouraging invention and other forms of creation and fair  competition. For instance, the protection of the right to the  exclusive use of registered trademarks has resulted in the rapid  growth of the number of trademarks registered by Chinese and  foreign businessmen in China. The Patent Law of China has  greatly encouraged inventions and other creations in China, and  has proved a magnet to patent applications from other countries  and regions.    The third part of the white paper gives a presentation of  the  executive system on the protection of intellectual property  rights, that is, the judicial as well as the administrative  approaches to the protection of intellectual property rights.    In China, any citizen, legal person or any other  organization  may appeal to the people's court in accordance with the law upon  infringement of their rights. They enjoy practical and  effective judicial protection. The people's court exercises  judicial authority independently. They submit only to law,  without interference from any administrative organs, social  organizations or individuals.    The white paper points out that in addition to judicature in  accordance with international practices, China's system for the  protection of intellectual property rights comprises the Patent  Law, the Trademark Law, and the Copyright Law and other  administrative channels designated in intellectual property  laws, all proceeding from China's actual conditions.    For instance, since the Copyright Law was put into force in  1991 local administrative organs responsible for copyright  affairs investigated and dealt with many cases involving  pirated books and video products and illegal duplication of  laser discs. They have confiscated and destroyed the pirated  goods and levied administrative sanctions on the infringers.    A large proportion of the cases concerning violations of  foreigners' intellectual property rights were investigated and  dealt with by China's intellectual property protection  administrative offices on their own initiative, acting in  accordance with their prescribed functions and powers.    The white paper points out in the concluding remarks that  more than a few international observers have come to the  conclusion that in terms of intellectual property protection  China has reached international advanced levels.    Nonetheless, China cannot remain satisfied with the  achievements it has already made. China is a developing country  and still has much work towards optimizing its intellectual  property system. This system in its modern form was established  only a short time ago, and as a result, awareness of  intellectual property rights remains underdeveloped in society  at large.    In some regions and in some governmental departments there  is  insufficient appreciation of the importance of intellectual  property protection. Some serious acts of infringement have  violated not only the legitimate rights and interests of the  holder of the intellectual property right, but also the dignity  of the law.    Accordingly, the State Council has drawn up decisions on  further strengthening the protection of intellectual property.  China is confident that the implementation of all the important  measures contained in the decisions will mark a great new step  forward in the nation's efforts to ensure the protection of  intellectual property rights.    China will continue actively to promote international  cooperation in the field of intellectual property and tries to  make positive contributions towards the development and  optimization of the international intellectual property system.</p>

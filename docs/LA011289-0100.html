			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEES GIVEN MORE TIME TO LEAVE S. TEXAS  </P> <P> A judge Wednesday extended for three weeks the period in which Central American  asylum-seekers can leave South Texas, where an immigration policy was blamed  for trapping hundreds in desperate conditions.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela postponed until Jan. 31 a hearing in a lawsuit  filed last week against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The hearing  had been scheduled for today, when a temporary restraining order against the  INS policy was to expire.  </P> <P> The order issued Monday restored the right for asylum-seekers to travel to U.S.  destinations while their cases are resolved, a right they will retain until the  rescheduled hearing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hundreds Stage Exodus  </P> <P> The order inspired an exodus of hundreds of Central Americans from the Lower  Rio Grande Valley.  </P> <P> "It's something fine for us, because we can go be with our families, and here  in the valley we don't have anybody," said Ana Rodriguez, a 23-year-old  Honduran headed for Austin, where she has relatives.  </P> <P> The Dec. 16 INS policy under fire required asylum-seekers to stay close to the  application center nearest their point of entry while their requests are  considered. Many Central Americans enter the United States in southern Texas  and file their requests at the busy center in Harlingen.  </P> <P> The policy left Rodriguez and other aliens unable to leave the area, where they  resorted to living in primitive camps, abandoned buildings and church shelters.  </P></p>

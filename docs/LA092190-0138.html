			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA PUTS FLORIDA TEAMS ON TWO YEARS' PROBATION  </P> <P> The University of Florida was placed on NCAA probation for the second time in  six years Thursday, and school officials were upset that the punishment  included a postseason ban for this year's football team.  </P> <P> The NCAA chose to impose less than the minimum proscribed penalties in a case  of major violations. The bowl ban for this season was the only punishment of  the football program, and there was no ban on television appearances for either  sport.  </P> <P> The Gators also will not be eligible for the Southeastern Conference football  championship because an SEC rule prevents teams that are ineligible for a bowl  game to win the conference title.  </P> <P> The basketball program's scholarships will be restricted, and it must repay at  least $287,000 in revenue from the 1988 NCAA tournament because guard Vernon  Maxwell played while he was ineligible. The Gators will be permitted 13  scholarships in 1991-92, two fewer than the maximum, and 14 scholarships in  1992-93.  </P> <P> First-year football Coach Steve Spurrier said the bowl ban was a more severe  penalty than Florida deserved.  </P> <P> "This has been a clean-run program in the last four or five years," Spurrier  said. "There's been no cash payments, no buying tickets of players, no  falsifying of transcripts."  </P> <P> As part of the ruling, the NCAA cited former basketball Coach Norm Sloan and  former football Coach Galen Hall, both fired last October, for unethical  conduct.  </P> <P> Chuck Smrt, director of enforcement for the NCAA, said the case was unique  because the school took significant corrective steps after the investigation  was disclosed. For that reason, Smrt said, the five-member Committee on  Infractions did not impose the minimum proscribed penalties.  </P> <P> The minimum penalties could have also included restrictions on postseason  basketball, recruiting in both sports and television appearances.  </P> <P> Florida even faced the remote possibility of having its football and basketball  programs shut down by the "death penalty." But even though the school escaped  severe sanctions, university president John Lombardi took exception to the  postseason ban on this year's football team, which is 2-0 and ranked No. 19.  </P> <P> "We are not entirely comfortable with a set of penalties that appear to us to .  . . penalize the innocent for the sins of a prior generation," Lombardi said.  </P> <P> "This is particularly difficult when you recognize that these players and these  coaches are now in the middle of their season, and these penalties at this time  in their season appear to us to be a particularly difficult blow to accept."  </P> <P> The school has 15 days to appeal the sanctions or ask that the ban on the  football team be delayed. Neither Lombardi nor Athletic Director Bill  Arnsparger would say whether the school will appeal.  </P></p>

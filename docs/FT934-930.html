			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / People: Law Debenture's new chairman John Kennedy, 59, who will shortly step down as senior partner of Allen &amp; Overy, is to take over as chairman of the Law Debenture Corporation, which owns Britain's biggest independent corporate trustee business. Kennedy, who has been a partner of Allen &amp; Overy for over 30 years, replaces Raymond Cazalet, on the board for 20 years, and chairman for the past two. Law Debenture, founded in 1889 by a group of prominent businessmen, politicians and lawyers, is an unusual City animal. It is a small but successful investment trust, managed by Michael Moule, which also owns a corporate trustee operation which competes with big international banks such as JP Morgan. Cazalet, like his predecessor, Sir Anthony Touche, came from the investment trust side of the business. However, the choice of Kennedy, senior partner of one of Britain's most profitable law firms, suggests that Law Debenture is keen to develop the trustee side of its business. It services over 1,800 issues with a nominal value of over Pounds 90bn and caters for over 700 banks and companies in over 50 countries. Christopher Duffett, Law Debenture's managing director, says he was keen to recruit a well known City figure who was familiar with Law Debenture's business. The new chairman has many years' experience of the domestic and international capital markets and also knows about the problems and difficulties of running a people-based business. Kennedy, who has recently joined the Securities and Investments Board, is following in the footsteps of one of the founders of Allen &amp; Overy, George Allen, who was also chairman of Law Debenture. He says Law Debenture's big attraction over other corporate trustees was its unmistakeable independence. 'You do not have a conflict of interest when making a decision.' Rob Williams, who has recently retired as a partner of Linklater &amp; Paines, has joined the board as an executive director, replacing Clive Rumbelow, a former partner of Slaughter &amp; May.</p>

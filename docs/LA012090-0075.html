			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAY LEAGUE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> TROY HITS CLUTCH FREE THROWS FOR VICTORY  </P> <P> With the game on the line Friday night, Troy High School's basketball team came  through at the line.  </P> <P> Troy (7-9 overall, 2-2 in the Freeway League) made 13 of 18 free throws in the  fourth quarter to score a 63-59 victory over visiting Sunny Hills (5-11, 3-1).  </P> <P> "It was nice for a change because we haven't shot free throws very well all  season long," Troy Coach Bill Morris said. "It was also the first night we've  been consistent for all four quarters. We've always had one bad quarter."  </P> <P> The Warriors' first two quarters weren't pretty, but at least they stayed  close. Sunny Hills held a 32-25 lead at the half, but Troy, which had shot 30%  from the field in the first half, connected on 11 of 22 in the second half.  </P> <P> Guard Chris Inman, who led Troy with 17 points off the bench, hit a  three-pointer late in the third quarter to give Troy its first lead of the  game, 40-39.  </P> <P> Inman also made five free throws in the final quarter. Guard Mike Abbott made  four free throws down the stretch and forwards Jermaine Butler and Richard  Wesley made two each in the fourth quarter to help put Sunny Hills away.  </P> <P> After the teams had traded baskets to tie the score at 49-49, Troy's Jim  Falletta hit a jumper with two minutes left in the fourth quarter to give the  Warriors the lead for good.  </P> <P> Wesley then hit a three-pointer to give Troy a five-point lead.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills guard Dominic Carnesi hit a pair of three-pointers in the final  minute, but it was too late. Carnesi led all scorers with 25 points, including  three three-point baskets.  </P> <P> Sunny Hills wasn't nearly as effective from the foul line down the stretch.  </P> <P> In the fourth quarter, Brett Mitchelson (12 points, 11 rebounds) missed two  free throws, David Ragsdale (eight points, 15 rebounds) missed the front ends  of a pair of one-and-ones, and Kenny Overby also missed the first shot of a  one-and-one.  </P> <P> There was one exception. Carnesi, who was 11 of 13 from the line in Sunny  Hills' 58-40 victory over Buena Park Wednesday night, made all eight of his  free throws Friday night. STUART MATTHEWS Buena Park 63, La Habra 57 --  Prentiss Johnson hit four of five free throws down the stretch to lead host  Buena Park (8-9, 3-1). La Habra dropped to 5-12, 1-3. Fullerton 76, Sonora 69  -- Procopio Misa had 22 points and Ladd Brunner 19 to lead visiting Fullerton  (6-11, 3-1). Anthony Choe scored 18 for Sonora (5-13, 0-4).  </P></p>

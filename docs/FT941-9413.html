			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Leading Article: AEA for sale Up to now, the government's 12-year privatisation programme has been largely about selling state entities with plenty of tangible assets: energy companies, public utilities and so on. The imminent privatisation of the Atomic Energy Authority poses a challenge of a different kind. The AEA - or at least that part of it which is to be sold off - consists mostly of brainpower and technology accumulated from half a century of developing Britain's atomic energy programme. The government is right to want to privatise the AEA. One objection is that it might be of strategic value, but that is not the case. The AEA today has expanded well beyond its original brief, and contains a high-class, possibly unique, amalgam of expertise, which can be marketed to a wide range of industries. Privatisation will wean the AEA off excessive reliance on government contracts and force it to earn a living. The question for government is how to extract full value from this collection of intangibles: the expertise, the people and the contracts which represent the AEA's flow of business, worth more than Pounds 200m a year. Apart from last year's sale of the Department of Transport's information technology arm (later assimilated by its new owner), the government has little experience in this area. The ideal solution must be a management buy-out. This would create a sense of partnership among the company's employees, and guarantee the AEA the independence to underpin its credibility as a consultancy. However it may be too much to expect a state-owned scientific agency to make that sort of leap in one bound - particularly when it does not even have a chief executive. The alternative would be flotation as a private company. This would not be easy, however, since investors would have to be sure that the AEA had a worthwhile portfolio of contracts, and that its principal assets - people - would not walk out of the door. Only as a last resort should the government consider the remaining alternative: sale in whole or in part to trade purchasers. This would be highly unsatisfactory. The AEA would lose its independence and, if broken up, its range of skills as well. The loss of those two attributes would also presumably reduce its sale value. The AEA should remain independent. The government's City advisers need to produce ideas for a sale that will keep it so.</p>

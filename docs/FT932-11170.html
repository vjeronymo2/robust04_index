			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Survey of Bulgaria (10): Russia still a vital link - The foreign trade picture has changed THE changing face of Plovdiv Fair, Bulgaria's largest annual trade event, epitomises the transformation taking place in Bulgaria's foreign trade. Four years ago, it was the classic Comecon trade exhibition where member states exchanged machines and capital goods according to pre-arranged quotas. These days, the fair offers Bulgarian companies the latest in western technology and consumer goods and acts as a showcase for Bulgarian companies, both state and private, which are looking for partnerships with foreign concerns. 'The fair reflects the change in the country's trade and commercial structure,' says Ms Maria Todorova, head of public affairs. 'Already, more than half of the Bulgarian exhibitors are from the private sector while the growth in trade with western countries has boosted foreign participation. This year we have participants from more than 35 countries.' The collapse of Comecon and the liberalisation of trade has opened up opportunities, especially in the Black Sea region. 'We want to promote Bulgaria as a bridge for trade with the Black Sea zone and the former Soviet Union. Western companies can market themselves in the region from here,' says Ms Todorova. Bulgaria's traditionally strong relations with the FSU may give it an advantage over neighbouring countries Greece and Turkey which are also trying to build up their trade relations. 'In a confused period like this, contacts and trust between business partners become vital. Official relations between Bulgaria and the former Soviet Union may have changed but the personal contacts are very much alive,' says Mr Konstantinos Livadas, a Greek investment consultant based in Sofia. 'Greek firms realise this. Many are using Bulgarians as middlemen for trade with the FSU.' According to the Ministry of Trade, the FSU accounted for only 28 per cent of Bulgaria's foreign trade last year compared to 75 per cent in 1989. In contrast, trade with western countries continued to grow. The European Community, with which Bulgaria has just signed an association agreement, accounted for 31 per cent of the country's trade in 1992. But most doubt the accuracy of the official figures, due to incomplete information on the private sector and the thriving black economy. 'It's very hard to keep track of what private companies are up to but we believe Bulgarian firms are very active in the former east bloc, and especially in Russia,' says Mr Ivan Kolev, head of the eastern European department at the Ministry of Trade. He believes there are already some signs of a revival in trade with the former Comecon countries, especially those exporting products made in partnership with foreign investors. With goods such as washing powder from Procter and Gamble's Rakona plant and Skoda/Volkswagen cars popular with Bulgarian consumers, imports from the Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary grew last year. While underlining that the country remains committed to developing closer trading links with the west, Mr Kolev says Russia remains a vital trading partner for Bulgaria. 'Above all, we need spare parts - many of our industries run solely on Russian-made equipment,' he explains. He is also looking to the future: 'Russia is a vast country with many resources. Links with western markets give us new possibilities but they cannot substitute for the opportunities in the east.' He welcomes initiatives to revive economic co-operation between the former Comecon countries which were discussed at the April meeting in Copenhagen between the EC and its eastern European associate members. Bulgaria hopes to join the trade pact agreed between Hungary, Poland and the Czech and Slovak republics last year.' A regional free trade area will help us in the short term. It can also foster eventual integration into the EC - unlike in the past, we will work to international practices and standards,' Mr Kolev says. But there are other reasons for pursuing rapprochement with the former east bloc. 'We need time to adapt our production and raise standards to be competitive in the west,' says Mr Valentin Karabashev, minister of trade. He deplores the EC's decision last month to ban the import of livestock and dairy products from eastern Europe. 'It is a worrying precedent. Bulgarians think that behind the formal reasons were purely economic motives. The restrictions came exactly at Easter time when the price of lamb on the Greek and Italian markets is at its highest.'</p>

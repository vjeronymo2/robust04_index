			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> GAME OF THE DAY  </P> <P> Chicago (5-3) at Green Bay (4-4), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Packers can make it a three-team race in the NFC Central by knocking off  the Bears. Chicago's defense looks menacing again with Richard Dent back, but  Green Bay's Don Majkowski leads the NFL in passing with 2,303 yards and 16  touchdowns, and has made a star of receiver Sterling Sharpe. Jim Harbaugh  replaces Mike Tomczak at quarterback after leading the Bears past the Rams. The  Bears have beaten the Packers eight consecutive times, including 24-6 and 16-0  last season. Chicago is 4-1 at home, 1-2 on the road. The Packers are 4-1 at  home.  </P> <P> INTERCONFERENCE GAMES  </P> <P> Cleveland (5-3) at Tampa Bay (3-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Browns beat Houston last week with an assortment of gadget plays, but may  not need any tricks against Tampa Bay, which has allowed 88 points in the last  two games. Bernie Kosar was back in form, throwing two long touchdown passes to  Webster Slaughter and running for another, but the running game continued to  lag. Tampa Bay's Vinny Testaverde has thrown three touchdown passes in each of  his last three games, but can't escape the interception. He had three passes  intercepted last week and has 10 this season. Testaverde threw 35 interceptions  last year.  </P> <P> Philadelphia (6-2) at San Diego (2-6), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> San Diego Coach Dan Henning saw enough of rookie quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver  in three scoreless quarters against Seattle that he's going back to Jim  McMahon, who nearly pulled out a victory over the Seahawks. Philadelphia will  send Reggie White and the rest of Buddy Ryan's sackmen after McMahon, who isn't  as mobile as he once was. San Diego has lost its last four games; the Eagles  have won their last four and seven of their last eight on the road.  </P> <P> Buffalo (6-2) at Atlanta (2-6), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Bills have won three in a row with reserve quarterback Frank Reich but  might turn the reins back over to Jim Kelly. Linebacker Shane Conlan also may  be ready to play, rejoining a defense that was the first to sack Dan Marino  this season. However, the Bills have won only two of their last five road  games. The Falcons have lost five of six despite the standout play of  quarterback Chris Miller.  </P> <P> Detroit (1-7) at Houston (4-4), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Rodney Peete and Barry Sanders can pile up the yards in Detroit's Silver  Stretch offense, but the Lions have trouble scoring. Detroit gave up 345 yards  passing to Green Bay, good news for Houston's Warren Moon, who has thrown for  1,910 yards and 12 touchdowns, and hasn't had a pass intercepted in his last 68  attempts.  </P> <P> AFC GAMES  </P> <P> Indianapolis (4-4) at Miami (4-4), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Colts figure to leave Eric Dickerson on the bench, hoping his nagging  hamstring injury will heal. That leaves the running chores to Albert Bentley.  The Colts have beaten Miami three consecutive times, including 15-13 and 31-28  last season. Indianapolis might have learned from Buffalo's defense, which  sacked Miami's Dan Marino twice last week after he hadn't been down in 759  passing attempts.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh (4-4) at Denver (6-2), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 4.  </P> <P> The Steelers are a different team with Bubby Brister at quarterback, as he  showed when he returned to lead them over Kansas City last week. After allowing  92 points in its first two games, Pittsburgh has given up only 94 while winning  four of six games. The Steelers beat Denver, 39-21, last season at Pittsburgh.  John Elway was inconsistent again in Denver's loss to Philadelphia, having  three passes intercepted before leading a rally that fell short when he  fumbled.  </P> <P> Seattle (4-4) at Kansas City (3-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Chiefs have won five of their last six games at home, losing only to  Cincinnati in the final minutes. Seattle has won three in a row on the road.  Christian Okoye leads the league in rushing and had 156 yards in a 20-16  victory over Seattle four weeks ago. Steve Largent's pairing with Brian Blades  figures to help Dave Krieg, who has thrown 13 touchdown passes, but has been  intercepted 11 times. The Chiefs have beaten Seattle seven consecutive times at  Kansas City.  </P> <P> New York Jets (1-7) at New England (3-5), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Jets are off to their worst start since 1974, when they also were 1-7. New  York's defense has outscored the offense, 24-16, in the last five games -- with  safety Erik McMillan scoring three touchdowns on returns this season. Jet  quarterback Ken O'Brien was sacked nine times last week by San Francisco. New  England has jelled offensively the past two games with Steve Grogan back at  quarterback. The Patriots have beaten the Jets four consecutive times, winning  27-24 on opening day, and 14-13 and 28-3 last season.  </P> <P> NFC GAMES  </P> <P> New York Giants (7-1) at Phoenix (4-4), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> The Giants hope Phil Simms' ankle injury won't keep him out, since they  struggled with Jeff Hostetler while beating Minnesota Monday night. The Giants  are off to their best start since 1939. Six weeks ago, New York intercepted  four of Gary Hogeboom's first eight passes and rolled past the Cardinals, 35-7.  The Giants have won eight of 11 from the Cardinals, who beat the Giants, 24-17,  last season at Phoenix. The Cardinals might have found a ground game with Earl  Ferrell and Tony Jordan.  </P> <P> Dallas (0-8) at Washington (4-4), 5 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: ESPN  </P> <P> The Redskins bring Doug Williams off the injured-reserve list and into the  starting lineup, benching Mark Rypien, who has nine interceptions and has lost  six of 11 fumbles. The Redskins have won five of their last six against Dallas,  which scored a 24-7 victory at RFK Stadium last season -- the Cowboys' only win  in the last 20 games. Washington trounced Dallas six weeks ago, 30-7. With one  more defeat, Cowboy rookie Coach Jimmy Johnson will equal his total in six  seasons at the University of Miami.  </P> <P> MONDAY NIGHT  </P> <P> New Orleans (4-4) at San Francisco (7-1)  </P> <P> TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m.  </P> <P> Joe Montana returns to the San Francisco lineup, but the 49ers learned in  recent weeks they're not in bad shape with Steve Young or Steve Bono. However,  the 49ers will be without nose tackle Michael Carter, replacing him with former  Giant Jim Burt. The 49ers have beaten the Saints three consecutive times, 24-20  four weeks ago. The Saints have come on strong since then, winning the last  three behind a stingy defense and a hot quarterback, Bobby Hebert.  </P></p>

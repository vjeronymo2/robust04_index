			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GATT CHIEF URGES COMPROMISES  </P> <P> GATT Director General Arthur Dunkel, declaring that world trade talks are in  crisis, called today for compromises to be reached early in a final ministerial  meeting in Brussels next week.  </P> <P> The Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade wound up four  years of work in Geneva late Monday by agreeing on a package of draft texts and  comments to send to the ministers, but large gaps remain.  </P> <P> "The round is in a crisis, and the negotiators have to get out of this crisis  in the first hours and days in Brussels," Dunkel told a news conference.  </P> <P> Dunkel said differences were so great that negotiators were unable to agree to  include texts on three areas in the 391-page package draft -- agriculture,  anti-dumping measures and trade-distorting conditions on foreign investment.  </P></p>

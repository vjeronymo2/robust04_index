			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FLACH TAKES A WALK, SHOWN THE GATE  </P> <P> Ken Flach, who walked off the court at the U.S. Open Saturday in the third set  of his first-round mixed doubles match with partner Patty Fendick, was fined  $3,200, defaulted from the competition and also defaulted from the men's  doubles with partner Robert Seguso.  </P> <P> Flach left the court with his team trailing Elise Burgin and Laurie Warder,  5-2. Apparently upset over a series of line calls, Flach twice slammed tennis  balls off the court, then walkedaway.  </P> <P> Grand Slam supervisor Ken Farrar fined Flach $350 for each instance of ball  abuse, $1,500 for failing to complete the match and $1,000 for defaulting the  match.  </P> <P> Farrar also automatically defaulted Flach and Seguso from the men's doubles,  which they won in 1985.  </P></p>

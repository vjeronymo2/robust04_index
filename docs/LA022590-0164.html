			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BELLFLOWER COUNCIL OKS STREET BARRIER TO CURB DRUG TRAFFICKING  </P> <P> The City Council has approved installing a temporary traffic barrier in an  effort to curb drug trafficking in a Bellflower neighborhood.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to place orange traffic cones at the intersection  of Eucalyptus Avenue and Alondra Boulevard to prevent cars traveling on Alondra  from turning south at Eucalyptus.  </P> <P> Eucalyptus south of Alondra will still be accessible from Flora Vista Street.  </P> <P> Although neighbors have said they would like to see the street barricaded  completely, Mayor John Ansdell said merchants in a nearby shopping center would  suffer if the street were closed.  </P> <P> Residents have argued that anyone who breaks the law to sell drugs would not be  afraid to drive through the barrier on Eucalyptus.  </P> <P> Ansdell said Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies will strictly enforce the  new traffic regulation.  </P> <P> "This is just a temporary measure to see if we can stop the drug trafficking,"  Ansdell said. "It's a start."  </P></p>

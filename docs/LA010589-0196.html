			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: NATURE STILL REIGNS IN THIS OAK CANYON  </P> <P> The two tracts of Anaheim Hills land are a modern study in contrasts. On one  side of Walnut Canyon Road is the Anaheim Hills Golf Course, closely tended,  carefully groomed, a series of finely sculpted undulating carpets of uniform  green fairways and minutely clipped and pampered greens. It is a place where  the cooing of quail is something that upsets your putting stroke and a 3-iron  is needed to deal with rattlesnakes.  </P> <P> On the other side of the road is the Oak Canyon Nature Center, where both the  quail and the snakes, if they show up in the right place at the right time,  likely will get a free meal and a few hundred curious looks each week.  </P> <P> Part of the Anaheim city parks systems, the nature center is one corner of  Anaheim Hills where the original tenants -- the local animals -- still hold the  lease. In a highly developed residential section of Orange County, it has  remained a place where humans are still the visitors.  </P> <P> Set into a canyon in one of the hills, the nature center is covered by nearly 6  miles of hiking trails, many of which border a stream that cascades along the  canyon bottom. It is a specialized sort of park, said center director Cathy  Glasgow, in that it exists primarily to satisfy the sense of sight. Picnicking,  cycling, smoking, pets, rock or leaf collecting and other activities that are  often permissible in other city parks are taboo in an area in which field mice  and frogs run the show.  </P> <P> "Take away only memories; leave nothing but footprints" is the primary rule  posted at the entrance to the center.  </P> <P> Not that there aren't opportunities for hands-on activities. Just inside the  entrance is a building housing the facility's interpretive center, a  combination museum and classroom designed primarily for schoolchildren. On  display are dozens of live and mounted birds, reptiles, rodents and other  animals (mounted specimens were found dead in the wild, Glasgow said), as well  as areas set up for games and other activities, such as a microscope table,  relevant to the study of nature.  </P> <P> Most of the center's visitors, Glasgow said, are elementary school children,  who are taken on guided tours by one of the center's 10 part-time naturalists.  But, she added, programs are also available for adults, handicapped visitors  and senior citizens. These programs are offered by prior arrangement, and fees  are set at $1 to $3.20 per person, depending upon the length of the tour -- 45  minutes to 3 hours -- and the variety of subjects covered by the naturalists.  </P> <P> However, Glasgow said, many visitors, particularly on weekends, come simply to  walk one or all of the eight trails that wind through the canyon. She cautioned  that walkers should familiarize themselves with poison ivy and poison oak, both  indigenous to the canyon, and should stay on the trails to avoid contact with  either. Also, she said, in warmer weather rattlesnakes are sometimes seen,  although they tend to shy away from contact with humans and usually present no  danger to on-trail hikers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> OAK CANYON NATURE CENTER AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> Where: 6700 E.

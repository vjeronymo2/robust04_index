			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORM OF ARTHRITIS REPRODUCED IN RATS;  </P> <P> SCIENCE: EXPERIMENTS HELP CONFIRM LINK BETWEEN GENE REGULATING IMMUNE SYSTEM  AND A TYPE OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCHERS SAY THE ACHIEVEMENT WILL HELP TRACK THE  AILMENT FROM ITS EARLIEST STAGES.  </P> <P> Experiments for the first time have reproduced a form of human arthritis in  genetically altered rats and confirmed a previously established link between a  gene involved in regulating the immune system and this form of arthritis,  researchers said Thursday.  </P> <P> The achievement means researchers now have a reliable animal model to aid  studies of ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis and  related diseases.  </P> <P> The rats carry the human genes for a tissue type found in many patients with  these diseases, which are collectively known as spondyloarthropathies.  </P> <P> These forms of arthritis are believed to affect about 200,000 Americans,  primarily young adults. Other types of arthritis, such as rheumatoid arthritis  and osteoarthritis, are more common.  </P> <P> The advances, reported by researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern  Medical Center in Dallas, may eventually lead to better treatments and  prevention strategies. Their findings are being published today in the journal  Cell.  </P> <P> The Dallas researchers injected a solution containing DNA fragments of the two  genes that encode for the tissue type into fertilized one-cell rat eggs. They  then performed experiments that confirmed that the genes had been incorporated  into the genetic material of the rats and that the rats produced protein  molecules encoded by the genes.  </P> <P> Several months after birth, the rats develop symptoms similar to those found in  the human arthritic diseases, such as arthritis of the spine and large joints,  and inflammation of the bowel, skin and nails.  </P> <P> "We are all very pleased with this remarkable scientific advance," said Dr.  Lawrence E. Shulman, director of the National Institute of Arthritis and  Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, which was one of the sponsors of the  research. "The discovery clearly shows that genetic factors participate  directly in causing (the diseases)."  </P> <P> Shulman added: "Now they need to find out how these genes act and work to  produce the arthritic changes, and what, if any, co-factors are involved in  this process."  </P> <P> The development of an animal model "allows us to examine the development of the  disease from its very earliest stages," said Dr. Joel D. Taurog, one of the  researchers.  </P> <P> About 7% or 8% of Americans are believed to carry genes for the tissue type  HLA-B27. This tissue type is also present in the vast majority of individuals  who develop spondyloarthropathies, an association that was first noted in 1973.  </P> <P> Researchers seeking to understand these diseases have been puzzled by the fact  that only a minority of individuals -- estimates vary from 1% to 20% -- with  the HLA-B27 tissue type become ill. One theory is that the diseases are  triggered by exposure to certain types of intestinal bacteria. Another is that  some individuals with the HLA-B27 tissue type make a protein encoded by the  genes, and therefore become ill, while others do not make the protein and  remain well.  </P> <P> "The findings provide strong evidence that the B-27 gene is directly involved  in causing the disease," Taurog said.  </P> <P> The University of Texas researchers and others had previously conducted similar  experiments in mice, but the animals did not become ill. They now hope to study  the effects of various drugs on the development of arthritis in the rats and  try to learn more about the changes in the rats which initiate the development  of disease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ARTHRITIC DISEASES  </P> <P>  These are major forms of the group of arthritic diseases known as  spondyloarthropathies. An estimated 7% of Americans have a genetic  predisposition to developing these diseases, but only a minority of these  individuals do so.  </P> <P> ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: This ailment causes pain and stiffness in the joints of  the body's trunk, including the back, neck, hips, shoulders and ribs. In severe  cases, a stiff and inflexible spine can develop, as well as eye, heart and  other complications.  </P> <P> ARTHRITIS OF INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE: Some patients with the bowel disorders  ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease develop arthritis, primarily in the hands  and feet.  </P> <P> PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS: Individuals who have the skin disease psoriasis sometimes  have an accompanying joint inflammation, especially in the knees and elbows.  </P> <P> REITER'S SYNDROME: A type of arthritis transmitted by sexual contact that is  the most common cause of arthritis in young men. Features include pain in the  joints, eye inflammation, skin rash and a penile discharge.  </P></p>

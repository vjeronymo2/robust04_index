			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, May 24 (AFP) -- The contact group trying to  restart the Bosnian peace process will meet Wednesday [25 May]  in Talloires, a town in the French Alps, French Foreign Minister  Alain Juppe said Tuesday.    The group, which includes experts from the European Union,  Russia, the United States and the United Nations, is attempting  to define a common stand concerning Bosnia in order to press the  warring factions there to end the more than two-year conflict.    "If the parties involved don't want peace we will act  accordingly," Juppe said.    Earlier this month, foreign ministers from the contact group  met in Geneva and united in a bid to put the peace process back  on track, by calling for a four-month ceasefire and a resumption  of peace talks.    They also urged the warring parties to reach agreement on  the  basis of a European plan for the ethnic division of the former  Yugoslavia, providing 51 percent of the territory for a Bosnian  Croat-Moslem federation and 49 percent for the Bosnian Serbs.    "This plan respects Bosnia's unity," Juppe said, adding that  if it were rejected by the warring parties, France would  consider withdrawing its peacekeeping troops from Bosnia by the  end of the year.    Spain and Britain have also said they may pull their troops  from the war-torn country if there is no breakthrough in the  peace process.    Juppe said members of the contact group did not plan to wait  for an answer to their proposal beyond mid-June when they are  due to hold another ministry-level meeting.</p>

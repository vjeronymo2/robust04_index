			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / 'Aunt Sallys' resigned to their pay rebuff: 'More clout, less dosh' attracts high-flyers to Civil Service Changes to job security stressed 'WHEN we join the public service, we recognise that we are Aunt Sallys. If we wanted to make a fortune, we would have gone elsewhere.' That was the response yesterday of one Whitehall mandarin when the government announced it was overruling the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB)recommendation for leading civil servants, judges and the military. Instead of the average 19.7 per cent recommended by the body, those people will have to make do with 4 per cent this year and further instalments over the next two years. The mandarin continued: 'The problem of setting top people's pay is so thorny that ministers set up an independent pay review body to do their dirty work. Despite being stuffed with anti-public-sector businessmen, it finds that senior civil servants are earning much less than what they would earn in the private sector for similar jobs. 'But the politicians cannot bring themselves to do the decent thing by the people they rely upon to advise them and to carry out their policies. So when the predictable row breaks, they take the easy way out and run for cover. It makes me sick.' The rebuff is unlikely, however, to encourage him to seek another job. Nor, according to Mr Stephen Bampfylde of headhunters Saxon-Bampfylde, will it necessarily make it much harder to fill top jobs in the future. Although there is a minimum salary level below which recruitment and retention would become difficult, salaries in top public-sector jobs do not need to match those in the private sector. 'The pro bono publico feeling is alive and well in Britain,' says Mr Bampfylde, who has helped fill 15 top public-sector posts in recent years. 'Enormously talented people are prepared to take salary cuts for jobs which carry great prestige. 'The management challenge in many of these jobs is so great that they can't turn them down. 'More clout, less dosh' just about sums it up.' In spite of yesterday's furore, many senior public servants are likely to be more understanding in private of the government's position than they suggest publicly. 'I would guess that if someone offered a rise of Pounds 30,000, they are not going to turn it down,' said one recently retired general now working in industry. 'But the top three already earn over Pounds 100,000, which is not bad really. And there are other rewards in honours and esteem.' Another serving top civil servant acknowledged that public sympathy was probably thin on the ground. 'BBC TV's Yes Minister has a lot to answer for,' he says. 'It makes us look so aloof and scheming. I'm not sure that I would be in favour of the TSRB award if I was outside the Civil Service.' Mr Ivor Manley, who retired last year as deputy secretary at the Department of Employment, said pay rises of anything like 24 per cent would have set a bad example and that many of those covered by the review body realised that. 'I do not believe many civil servants are solely motivated by money,' he said. 'When awards have been phased in in past years I cannot remember any heated conversations about it in the Civil Service canteens.' However, Mr Manley - who used to interview graduates for jobs - said that in the past five or six years there had been signs of a shortage of really good candidates to start as high-flying civil servants. 'Some of us worried about the recruitment of people of quality if salaries were being pegged below the market rate,' he said. 'There is a danger of the ablest candidates going elsewhere.' There was evidence of that during the boom years of the 1980s. Successive reports from the Civil Service commissioners implied that while there was no shortage of candidates for the fast stream, the quality of applicants was falling off as the best graduates headed for the City. That concern has lost force with the economy in recession. This year there were 9,000 applications for just 160 places, with 2,000 for 30 mature-entry places. At higher levels, jobs are increasingly filled by open competition - advertised on the open market with salaries set at whatever level is needed to attract the right candidate. The posts of 53 of the 81 chief executives of the new executive agencies were advertised in open competition, with 30 coming from outside the Civil Service. Even in the core Whitehall departments, 13 of 66 jobs filled last year were openly advertised - including that of director of public prosecutions. One option would be to move towards open competition for all top Civil Service posts, with each salary determined by negotiation. However, attracting suitable candidates on the open market might require much higher salaries than those set by the review body. It took Pounds 140,000 a year, for example, to lure Mr John Chisholm from industry to run the Defence Research Agency. He reports to Sir Christopher France, permanent secretary at the Ministry of Defence, who must get by on Pounds 87,600 a year after yesterday's increase. Doing away with centrally agreed pay scales might be attractive to politicians who want to avoid political controversy. The consequence might be that the bill for top people's salaries ended up much bigger once market forces began to operate. Additional reporting by Daniel Green and Michael Smith.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric suffers 7% fall MATSUSHITA Electric, hit by weak sales and a strengthening yen, yesterday reported a 7 per cent decline, to Y33.7bn (Dollars 326.2m), in first-quarter consolidated pre-tax profits. The Japanese consumer electronics group said sales were down 7 per cent, to Y1,596bn compared with a previous Y1,713bn. Net income was 23 per cent lower at Y6.7bn against Y8.7bn. Matsushita, in common with other Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers, has suffered the impact of the high yen, continuing sluggish demand for audio-visual products, and a cool summer in Japan. Although sales in overseas markets were actually higher than the previous first quarter on a local currency basis, the gains evaporated under the impact of the higher yen, Matsushita said. In Japan, the company continued to face weak demand as consumer spending tailed away. The weakness of personal consumption and private capital spending have been cited as the main factors preventing the Japanese economy from recovering. Sales of video products declined 13 per cent, while audio equipment fell 6 per cent on slow demand. Home appliances were down 13 per cent as sales of air conditioners were hurt by an unusually cool summer in Japan. Demand for communication and industrial equipment was also weak. Matsushita is currently enjoying huge box-office success with Jurassic Park, a movie produced by its MCA film studio subsidiary. However, it still suffered a 2 per cent decline in sales from its entertainment businesses. This was blamed on the yen's appreciation, which more than offset an increase in dollar-based sales, the company said. Although Matsushita has had some recent consumer successes, such as an advanced rice cooker, and cordless telephones, it has faced prolonged weakness in the Japanese market, particularly for audio-visual products. The strong demand expected for key products, such as the digital compact cassette, a digital portable audio format developed with Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics group, has not materialised. It will take considerable time for demand to emerge for other promising products, such as high-definition TV. The company's second-quarter results are expected to be disappointing. Private consumption is not expected to improve significantly in the near term, unless the government agrees to an income tax cut soon.</p>

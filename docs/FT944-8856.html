			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / France plans initiative on pensions reform Mr Edmond Alphandery, the French economy minister, yesterday relaunched plans to encourage private pension funds in France, announcing that a reform of the country's pension system should be implemented next year. 'Conditions should be right for an initiative in 1995,' Mr Alphandery said in a speech to members of the COB, the French stock market regulator. The development of capitalised pension funds is seen as an important means of reducing pressure on the existing 'pay-as-you-go' system and curbing the French welfare deficit. But reforms have been delayed by the political sensitivity of the issue and the complexity of reform. The current system, in which pensions are paid from contributions from the existing workforce, suffered a deficit of more than FFr40bn (Pounds 4.75bn) last year and faces increased strains because of the country's ageing population. Mr Alphandery also regards private pension funds as a way of strengthening France's financial markets and increasing long-term savings. 'Since this government took office it has sought to shift short-term savings to the medium or long term,' he said. Measures to encourage the formation of private pension funds, originally slated for this year, have been delayed by several factors. The reform of the pensions system is politically sensitive and has been opposed by some trade unions. 'The existing system is a source of solidarity between age groups and social classes,' said an official at Force Ouvriere, one of France's largest unions. 'Incentives for private schemes will favour the wealthy and will harm the economy by reducing consumption.' Reform has also been complicated by divergences between reform proposals and disputes between companies seeking to participate in capitalised pension schemes. The Patronat employers' federation, the Association of French banks and Mr Jacques Barrot, chairman of the National Assembly's finance committee, have all drawn up separate projects. Insurance companies and banks have been at odds over whether retirement payments should be made in lump sumps, which the banks favour, or in the form of annuities. Industry observers said yesterday that the political sensitivity and complexity of the issue meant reform was unlikely before next spring's presidential election. 'I don't think we will see a text for a reform for the next few months,' said one French merchant banker.</p>

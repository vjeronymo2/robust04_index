			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Amante E. Bigornia: "Two Ways of Looking at </F> Military Rebellion"]    [Text] Whom to believe: President Ramos or Gringo  [Gregorio] Honasan on the rebellious mood of the military?    The poser came up when the president praised former Armed  Forces of the Philippines Chief of Staff Gen. Lisandro Abadia  for supposedly having unified the military, in effect making the  RAM or Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [Nationalist  Revolutionary Alliance] of Col. Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan  irrelevant.    The commendation was given by Mr. Ramos when Abadia turned  over the AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] command to his  successor, Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, former Philippine Army  commander, at rites in Camp Aguinaldo last Tuesday.    The president said the AFP "has already put behind it the  ravages of dissent and adventurism... The armed forces managed  (during the three-year stint of Abadia as chief of staff) a  remarkable turnaround and now we see a more united and  professional corps of officers, enlisted personnel and civilian  employees."    The day following, last Wednesday, Gringo belied the  president's claims. The leader of the two failed military coups  during the preceding administration dismissed the presidential  claim as a hollow praise given willy-nilly during traditional  retirement parades.    The conflicting views deserve some consideration. The  government is holding simultaneous but separate peace  negotiations, although currently stalled, with the military  rebels and two other insurgent groups, the Communist Party of  the Philippines/New People's Army, and the secessionist Moro  National Liberation Front.    The problem posed by the mutinous military must have been  serious when the group was included in the peace process  initiated by Mr. Ramos immediately after his taking office  almost two years ago.    However, things must have happened, either within the  rebellious military or in the entire military establishment  itself between then and now to justify the president's claim of  unity in the Armed Forces. General Abadia had several informal  talks with the mutinous military leaders, separate from the  talks between them and a government panel.    On the other hand, General Abadia, only last February,  accused the rebel leadership of allegedly using the liberty they  enjoy during the negotiations to muster support in various  military camps for their movement.    Gringo naturally denied this, claiming it was but natural  for  them to go around the military camps to talk shop with  comrades-in-arms, specially old friends, after their long stay  in the underground.    But Gringo did not deny that his group was still active. In  fact, he reportedly claimed that they still had in their  possession considerable arms and ammunition, presumably enough  to mount another coup attempt.    At a recent social gathering, Gringo told this writer that  the rebellious temper of the troops was spreading down to the  enlisted men's level at a faster pace than imagined. "You'd be  surprised how deep down the movement has gone," he said.    What was more astounding, he added with evident pride and  satisfaction, was the growing support his group was getting from  the civilian population. This, to us, was ominous.    For at the same gathering, other rebel leaders admitted,  although not as a strategic mistake, that in the two real coup  attempts against the Aquino administration, they did not make  any effort to gain popular support before they staged their  failed putsches.    If they staged a coup, would they have the support this time  of the civilian population, which was the crucial element of the  successful EDSA [Epifanio de los Santos Avenue] revolt in 1986?    Their current activities do not seem geared towards  generating active popular support -- or they could again be  committing a miscalculation.    They have lately been attending press conferences,  television  talk shows and other information fora so often, their motives  have elicited what might be wrong impressions.    Already, Gringo is suspected of wanting to be a senator, a  position he could easily win. Asked if his group was fielding  candidates in next year's elections, he said, "If the playing  fields are level, we will consider it."    By this he might be entertaining ideas of shifting from a  military to the parliamentary struggle to gain the reforms his  group is fighting for. How effective that could be is open to  question.    But he might be forgetting that his being seen, read and  heard too often in person, in newspapers and on television could  erode the glamour that surrounds his persona as well as the  mystique his group has acquired not only by their failed  adventures but also by their unknown, mysterious movements for  many years.    Honasan, of course, is masculinely handsome and charismatic.  But he is playing against the adage that no man is a hero to  his valet, or the more popular saying that familiarity breeds  contempt.    At any rate, by next year, according to law, the Philippine  National Police (PNP) will take over from the Armed Forces the  mission of solving the insurgency problem. With the  anti-insurgency campaign taken away from it, the AFP would be  nothing more than a reserve and training command, not an ideal  source of mutiny.    It is unlikely that Gringo's group has or can make inroads  into the PNP. For the most part, the mutinous officers are  army, air force and navy officers, and their former comrades in  the AFP who have joined the PNP are getting fat in the belly and  therefore not keen on reform.    Mr. Ramos may have solved the RAM problem, but without the  reforms in the military and civilian establishments that the  rebels demand, the national recovery he hopes to achieve will be  slow in coming.</p>

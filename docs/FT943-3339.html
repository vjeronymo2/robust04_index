			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Baseball strike could cost Labatt CDollars 16m John Labatt, the Canadian-based international brewer, says the North American major-league baseball strike, which began on August 12, could cost its sports and entertainment subsidiary up to CDollars 16m (USDollars 11.5m) after tax in fiscal 1995, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Labatt's estimate of the cost was made on the assumption that the whole season will be lost. The sports and entertainment unit, Labatt Communications, posted a first-quarter sale gain to CDollars 97m. Overall, Labatt's net profit for the first quarter ended July was CDollars 62m, or 63 cents a share, up nearly 9 per cent from CDollars 57m, or 58 cents, last time, on revenues of CDollars 924m against CDollars 682m.</p>

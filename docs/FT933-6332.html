			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Ex-Ferruzzi chiefs' assets are frozen THE rift caused by Italy's Ferruzzi financial scandal deepened yesterday after a Milan court confirmed a temporary freeze on up to L500bn (Pounds 211m) in assets each against five former executives, and against the heirs of Mr Raul Gardini, the group's former chairman, who killed himself last month. The group's new management, imposed by creditor banks this year, may try to extend the legal action against other former managers if shareholders in Ferruzzi's Montedison subsidiary agree at a meeting next Monday. The case revealed a deepening split within the Ferruzzi family, which controls the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company, and Mr Gardini's heirs. While family members blamed the irregularities in group accounts largely on him, his heirs claim the difficulties arose after he left in 1991. On Tuesday, Ferfin shareholders will vote on plans to slash the nominal value of shares to L5 from L1,000. It is then proposed the shares be consolidated on the basis of 200 for one to restore the nominal value. The first top legal figure to be probed in Italy's graft scandal has been formally warned he faces investigation over alleged abuse of office, judicial sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Milan The notification was sent to Diego Curto, vice-president of Milan's civil court and head of its commercial division, by magistrates in the neighbouring northern city of Brescia.</p>

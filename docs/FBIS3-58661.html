			<p>Language: <F P=105> Swedish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Among Friends for Peace"] </F>   [Text] From passivity Bill Clinton has moved to swift  action. After the summit in Brussels the talks in Prague with  central European leaders were a relaxation prior to the contacts  in Moscow with Boris Yeltsin and other Russian leaders. But  what can the U.S. President achieve in the nervy beginning of  Russia's new "parliamentary" phase, and what sort of security  solutions are he and other NATO leaders actually offering Europe?    One would like to see key players being able to achieve  great  things. Take the newly launched Partnership for Peace (PFP),  for example. Of course it would mean a great deal if a number  of central European states did not simply feel disappointed, but  actually saw an opportunity to begin to make a practical  contribution in a far-reaching security arrangement.    And take Clinton's belief that his meeting with Yeltsin will  strengthen Russian democracy and developments toward a market  economy or his conviction that he has solved the problem of  Ukraine's nuclear arms. If only it were so simple.    Or take the Brussels summit's decision to sharpen up the  bombing threat against Bosnia's Serbs, if they continue to defy  the United Nations. If only these Serbs, the strongest side in  war-torn Bosnia, were to finally say to themselves that this  time NATO is in earnest about its warning. Then the UN  peacekeeping forces could at least perform some of their  humanitarian mission among people who are under threat from the  horrors of a second winter of war.    However, in reality NATO is restating its previous, never  tested readiness to intervene using aircraft, if General  Secretary Butrus-Ghali at the request of the UN commanders on  the ground orders the first armed action. But as a result of  losses among French soldiers French President Mitterrand has  finally been forced to back a seemingly new purposefulness.  NATO is also making a direct linkage not only (at Clinton's  request) to the lifting of the Serbs' strangulation of Sarajevo,  but also to demands for a change of guard in besieged Srebrenica  and the opening of the airport at Tuzla to Hercules aircraft  with necessary supplies for a suffering civilian population.    Tuzla's role in this context is of direct significance for  Sweden. According to the warning that has just been repeated in  Brussels, NATO aircraft could be deployed where the Nordic  battalion has its headquarters in direct combat against Bosnian  Serbs. We can ponder what this could mean for the Nordic  troops' activities on the ground, but NATO's attitude  illuminates as if by lightning the potential importance of the  PFP offer.    NATO's plans, whose aim is to hold back outside countries'  wishes for full membership, opens up what are perhaps completely  new cooperation possibilities that have never been on the agenda  before as far as Sweden is concerned.    In its diffuseness PFP clearly does not go far toward giving  central Europeans a feeling of increased national security. But  through joint exercises, maneuvers, consultations, and liaison  officers a country like Sweden would have an insight into and be  involved in the planning of peace operations that are of  importance to the security of the whole of Europe.    The Bildt government's reaction has been one of welcome, and  the Social Democratic Party suddenly seems to see PFP as  something operationally better than a role in the consultative  NACC [North Atlantic Cooperation Council], of which it was until  recently a keen supporter. The idea is that the PFP will be  tailor-made for each country, and Sweden must of course take a  closer look at the possibilities -- particularly in the light of  the fact that today the Nordic battalion is already under a UN  military command which has in practice been set up by NATO.    But we have to realize that the prospects now opening up  will  not necessarily lead to a totally harmonious front against  disturbers of the peace embracing both the United States and  Russia.    Russian ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's comment on  NATO's bombing warning was that Mitterrand is mad. This is the  same Zhirinovskiy who, after his unfortunately success in the  elections in December, is preparing to try to dominate the  Russian parliament's second chamber, the Duma.    It is good that Boris Yeltsin is sticking to the new  constitution which in principle increases his independence of  the popularly elected assembly. But the president clearly  thinks it unwise to go against Russian nationalism, which could  just as well be called imperialism or revanchism. Government  head Viktor Chernomyrdin reiterated to the Duma on Tuesday that  the pace of reform will be slowed down; we do not know what  scope for maneuver overwintering Russian reformist ministers  will have.    Today's Russia is in all its misery a great power which is  threatening its little neighbor, Latvia, with a "very tough  reaction." Not an easy partner for Bill Clinton.</p>

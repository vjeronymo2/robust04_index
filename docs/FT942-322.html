			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bearish undertone, bourses in technical recovery Afternoon weakness in the dollar, US treasuries and US bond futures made little initial impact on bourses, mostly up yesterday on Monday's recoveries in the US instruments, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Mr Nicholas Knight, a strategist at Nomura in London, said he was still a bear of Continental equities, seeing sizeable room for depreciation, for example, in both Paris and Frankfurt. Mr Knight based his pessimism on loose monetary policy in the US, and over-tightness in Japan threatening the US dollar and long bond, the nascent Japanese economic recovery and the Nikkei. Other world markets would be caught in the crossfire. He said that the bottom in the bond markets ('still not immediately visible, but not far off') would not mark the bottom for equities. Accordingly, Nomura reduced its equity exposure by another 10 per cent to the benefit of cash, and anticipated committing this liquidity to the bond markets in the second half of 1994. FRANKFURT was marked by thin turnover but a lot of professional interest as the Dax index recovered 29.66 to 2,018.26 in technical trading, and managed a further token gain to an Ibis-indicated 2,022.25 in the post-bourse. Turnover rose from DM6.9bn to DM7.1bn. At Bank Julius Bar, in Frankfurt, Mr Edgar Benischek offered two reasons why equities were resilient in the afternoon: first, that the September bund future, having come back to a six basis-point gain on the day at one stage, recovered to a 31-point rise by the Ibis close; secondly, there was talk that some institutions might be looking for better equity prices when they closed their books tomorrow. The technical rebound was good for banks, where Commerzbank climbed DM13 to DM315.50 and Deutsche Bank rose DM11.80 to DM677.80. Meanwhile, the biggest gains came in engineering, where Deutsche Babcock put on DM10.50 at DM228.50 on the session, and Klockner Werke DM7.80 at DM149.20. A trade association reported that orders in the sector increased by a real 18 per cent in May from a year earlier. PARIS moved forward in line with the Continental trend, the CAC-40 index closing 14.16 up at 1,925.76 while turnover eased to about FFr3bn. Lagardere was active after reporting to a shareholders' meeting that it expected a good rise in earnings in 1994, mainly due to the completion of its acquisition of the controlling interest in Matra-Hachette. Moulinex was marked down heavily at the start of the session, falling FFr10.80 to a low of FFr116.50 on a long awaited funding plan which included a two-for-three rights issue at FFr90. Investors were concerned at the difficulties the household appliances group might experience in raising the new cash, having seen the problems encountered recently by Eurotunnel and Euro Disney. However, Smith New Court in London commented that the announcement was positive in the medium term, amd saw the rights issue pricing as 'attractive'. Moulinex closed at FFr122. MADRID broke back through the 300 level again, the general index closing 4.17, or 1.4 per cent higher at 302.34 although here, too, dealers said that the recovery was technical, and fragile. Telefonica rose Pta35, or more than 2 per cent to Pta1,765, and traded in 3m shares as Mr Bill Coleman, telecommunications analyst at James Capel in London, reaffirmed his buy recommendation for the stock. Last night, Mr Coleman said that this was 'the last great opportunity to invest in a European telecoms operator which is coming out of its cocoon', noting that Italian telecoms stocks had tripled in the same process. BBV's placing of 4.2m Repsol shares, 1.4 per cent of the oil company's equity, took market turnover back up to Pta47bn from recently depressed levels. Repsol rose Pta15 to Pta3,870. ZURICH was led higher by derivatives, and volume picked up on a day dominated by professional trading. The SMI index added 43.0 or 1.7 per cent to 2,604.4. Financials saw the firmest performances. UBS, in demand by foreign investors, gained SFr29 to SFr1,174 and, among insurers, Zurich advanced SFr20 to SFr1,320. Nestle drew strength from large block orders, particularly from foreign investors, adding SFr24 to SFr1,126: Goldman Sachs adjusted down its earnings estimates for 1994 and 1995 to reflect the firmer Swiss franc, but maintained its market performer recommendation. Among smaller issues, Holderbank rose SFr12 to SFr889 as the cement group announced a FFr842m takeover offer for the French building materials group, Origny Desvroise. MILAN put in a firm performance, but ended off the day's highs, in volume which remained thin. The Comit index rose 6.96 to 700.97. Industrials led the recovery with Olivetti L45 ahead at L2,460 and Fiat L80 higher at L6,425: on Monday, the motor group said that results for the first three months were a significant improvement on budget and that a significant recovery was under way. Montedison rose L25 to L1,503 and analysts commented that the growing perception of its turnround potential provided more of a spur than a re-run of rumours that it planned more asset disposals. The insurers were mixed after Monday's slide. Fondiaria lost L445 or 3.5 per cent to L12,370, after Monday's 4.1 per cent decline, still weighed by its warning of a possible capital increase in coming months. Generali picked up L234 to L41,100, the news of its lower than expected premiums in the first five months already discounted. AMSTERDAM resumed an upward course helped by technical trading and bargain hunting following the market's recent declines. The AEX index improved 4.12 or 1.1 per cent at 381.22. Heavy trading was seen in both KLM and Philips, the shares gaining Fl 1.90 and Fl 1.50 respectively to Fl 47.90 and Fl 50.60. The airline group was supported by a broker's upgrade.

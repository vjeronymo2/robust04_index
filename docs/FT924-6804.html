			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / UK Company News: S Jerome approaching break-even THE continuing improvement at S Jerome &amp; Sons (Holdings) was reflected in the 1992 first-half figures, which showed a near break even position. Mr Alan Jerome, chairman, said the group was 'moving towards a satisfactory performance with the eventual return to profitability.' The pre-tax loss was cut from Pounds 576,000 to Pounds 9,000, on turnover of Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 16.9m). The specialist textile side turned round to an operating profit of Pounds 54,000 (loss Pounds 262,000) on turnover ahead 12 per cent. Now that the balance sheet had been considerably strengthened by the sale of CMR, the electronics division, Mr Jerome said it was intended to concentrate on the core textile interests via expansion into new areas. The electronics side lifted operating profit from Pounds 137,000 to Pounds 422,000. But that growth meant increasing calls on working capital and management resources, so it was sold to Westinghouse last month. As a result net bank borrowings fell from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 3.2m and gearing from 70 per cent to 33 per cent. Losses per share were 0.08p (4.9p). There is no interim dividend; last year it was 1p but the final was passed.</p>

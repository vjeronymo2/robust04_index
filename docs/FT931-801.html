			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Fashion: Designers take refuge in Spiderwoman clothing - After weeks of observation, Avril Groom is still trying to make sense of the autumn collections AFTER THREE weeks of Europe's autumn collections, the only clear message is that fashion is changing radically. Even some of the world's top designers are uncertain how to make the change from short, sharp tailoring to long, soft fluidity. As usual in confused times they resort to fancy dress and historic costume. The cast of thousands includes swashbuckling dandies, Victorian tarts, medieval damsels, low-life waifs, urban warriors, orthodox Jews, Spiderwoman and the brides of Dracula. Buyers have the tough job of turning characters into clothes which, once the dust has settled, will mean something in your wardrobe come the autumn. They may sit through outlandish catwalk shows to catch the mood, but the serious business is done in the designers' showrooms where, stripped of exotic accessories and the most outrageous items, collections can be pieced together as real women wear them. Buyers are spending more time in showrooms because increasingly that is where fashion excitement lies, with young designers, followers of the avant-garde, who feel that their understated 1990s style does not benefit from the broad canvas of the catwalk and who cannot afford glitzy locations and supermodels. London led the way with, for the first time, a Pounds 30,000 Department of Trade and Industry grant, by staging a smaller exhibition where hotel rooms doubled as showrooms and with notably smaller-scale catwalk shows. In Paris, Martin Margiela, most influential of the Belgian and Nordic designers whose severe style, often made from recycled fabrics, is now becoming almost mainstream has, until now, held anarchic shows in derelict locations and felt unhappy about them. This season in his showroom he talks visitors through his collection with the help of a video and speaks for many others when he says the 'human element' of conversing with his customers is important. 'That way I learn what people want from my clothes, and they learn to understand them. It is easy to become remote from reality as a designer.' Buyers agreed that 1990s fashion is a soft and delicately-detailed flower, better viewed on an intimate scale, and that the narrow-shouldered, wide-hemmed, gracefully-fluted longline silhouette promoted by Margiela and his peers since 1988 is the basis for current change and should be at the root of anything you buy for autumn or even for this spring. It is, broadly-speaking, a 1970s shape, but the current rash of styles and accessories directly inspired by that decade will be but a summer's passion, in spite of the tight-bottomed black flares being sported by women of all ages in Paris's spring sunshine last week, far more to French taste than the long, droopy skirt. By the autumn, according to Amanda Verdan, buying director for London's Harvey Nichols department store, wide, soft trousers will have taken over. 'They go with the softer but tailored jacket that no working woman will abandon', she says. 'Skirts are harder to wear - they should be slightly A-line or bias-cut. But the real story is soft layers. Fine knit is easiest but the bold way is with mixed textures - rugged knit with tweed and chiffon, velvet with crochet, lace and pinstripe. Pinafores and white shirts with long cuffs are important, plus a velvet jacket and a greatcoat to go over everything. Colours are black, other rich deeps and brown. The designers doing it best are Montana, Ozbek, Dolce and Gabbana, Callaghan, Moschino, Betty Jackson, Jasper Conran and British knitwear firms.' Her American counterpart at Saks, fashion director Nicole Fischelis, is in broad agreement. 'This is a romantic, rich season for fabrics like velvet, lace, brocade and tapestry. And black cobwebby crochet - the Spiderwoman look. Everything is soft - even Armani has ruffles. Soft knits will be huge  -Missoni has its best collection in ages.' She is also very struck by Lagerfeld's 'use of sheers and sophisticated Edwardiana' at Chloe, Dolce and Gabbana's 'retro but freshly modern' dandies and Lacroix's 'wearable print and knit mixes in wonderful, unexpected colours'. Like her, Joan Burstein who owns Browns, one of London's best-known boutiques, is committed to knits. 'Length and fluidity are essential, even for the working woman,' she says. 'Jackets will continue but very softly, perhaps as a cardigan. The long, knitted gilet is the newest shape. Missoni and Sonia Rykiel, who always do knitted layers, look exactly right now, as do Romeo Gigli's muted layers.' She is excited by the so-called avant-garde - Comme des Garcons, Ann Demeulemeester and Martin Margiela. 'No-one need be afraid of these clothes. They don't have to look 1970s or raw-edged low-life but this will be a season when wise shoppers will get personal help so it looks individual, not fashion-victim. These designers are pushing fashion to its edge but, carefully edited, the clothes are beautiful'. Rita Britton, of Pollyanna in Barnsley, one of Northern England's most adventurous shops, has had a long love affair with the avant-garde and finds this autumn 'the most exciting season ever for buying. Glitz is dead; now it's about the simple, dark, cleverly tailored layers that I and my customers love'. She is shortly to open a shop devoted to the original Japanese avant-garde triumvirate of Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Garcons and Issey Miyake, and has bought Margiela for the first time. 'I filter creative collections and buy quite safely,' she says, 'and I try everything on because most of my customers are like me - middle-aged. I love wide trousers, especially Yamamoto's, Comme's mixes of chiffon and knit, Margiela's soft cable knit with net overlay and Gigli's soft cashmeres with ankle-boots. For evening, medieval velvet or bias-cut chiffon and satin looks right'. Lucille Lewin, whose Whistles shops are known for promoting young designers, loves the new narrow-shouldered silhouette. 'It's easy to wear because it concentrates on the shoulders, which are often pretty, and camouflages difficult areas like hips and thighs.' Her choices are minimal and understated - Margiela, Demeulemeester, Marcel Marongiu's Nordic severity, Koji Tatsuno's 'wonderful experiments with fabric,' and Ghost's bias-cut layers in antique-looking fabrics. She is also clever at finding unknowns who get the look right at lower prices. And what of the fashion journalist's view of next autumn? My own accolades would go to the recycled low-life look, flatteringly cut and made believable by Margiela, to Lacroix for taking a ragbag of old silk prints, heavy lace and tweed and making it look stunningly sexy and to Chanel and Montana for showing us new ways to wear old favourites, breathing new life into bright tweed jackets by way of a loose white shirt and longjohns, and into leggings with cavalier boots and a riding jacket. Even such established names have discovered that recycling is good for you.</p>

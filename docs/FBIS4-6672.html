			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of remarks by Aoyama Gakuin University Professor </F> Ryutaro Komiya from an interview with unidentified ASAHI SHIMBUN  correspondent; place and date not given]    [Text] It is incorrect to regard the trade surplus as  "profits." U.S. deficits do not also mean that the United  States is suffering losses. Surplus countries provide "goods"  to deficit countries in exchange for "funds." Trade surpluses  and deficits have nothing to do with profits and losses because  surplus countries do not take away funds without providing goods.    The surpluses earned in Japan are invested in foreign  countries. Some of them are invested directly in building  factories, and others in bonds, such as U.S. Government bonds.  Wherever they are invested, they are put to good use.    Some people say that domestic investment should be increased  rather than making use of foreign investment. However, their  opinion does not touch on the essence of this issue. Private  companies are supposed to invest in projects which are more  profitable. Their business operations should not be manipulated  artificially. With regard to public investment, the cost of  building subways should be borne by those who will benefit from  them. It is improper to increase the burden of government  spending.    In any case, regardless of the size of the surplus, the  government should judge the proper scale of public investment.    It is important to lower import barriers and to improve the  transparency of the various systems and policies. However,  these measures will not be effective in reducing the surplus.  Even if the volume of specific imports, such as cars, is  increased, the surplus reduction effect will be offset by the  foreign exchange rate moving toward the depreciation of the yen.  It is beneficial for the people for good and cheap products to  be imported from foreign countries. Therefore, regardless of the  surplus, steady efforts should be made in dealing with this task.    A substantial portion of the current surplus has resulted  from the sluggish economic situation. I think there are still  several financial measures to be implemented, including lowering  the official discount rate. However, with regard to fiscal  policies, any further economic stimulation may, on the contrary,  destabilize the economy.</p>

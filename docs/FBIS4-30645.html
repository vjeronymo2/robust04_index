			<p>BFN     [Text] Vientiane, June 25 (KPL) -- The government of  Sweden has extended its forestry assistance to the Lao PDR [Lao  People's Democratic Republic] to another four-year term from  1995-1999.    Jorgen Schonning, first secretary to the Swedish embassy,  who  is now acting as charge d'affaires a.i. signed a memorandum of  understanding on the assistance with Deputy Agriculture and  Forestry Minister Phimpha Thepkhamheuang on June 23.    The Swedish assistance to Laos in the forestry sector has  entered its fourth stage lasting five years. In the past, the  Swedish government has provided considerable assistance to the  country in this sector. The signing of the memorandum came  after SIDA and the Lao side held their meeting between May  30-June 3 in Vientiane. The meeting reviewed the implemented  plan of the Lao-Swedish forestry cooperation programme over a  period of six months from October 1993 to March 1994.    This programme includes seven projects: the technical  support  project, the nation-wide forestry survey project, the forestry  project, the technical study project, the forestry resource  preservation project, the project for ending slash-and-burn  farming and the project for forestry development area.    The meeting unanimously viewed that the activities of all  these projects proved very successful, particularly the ending  of the destructive method of farming, the allocation of fixed  engagement for farmers, the trial of forest and land allocation  for villages and families to manage and use in several areas,  personnel training, afforestation, and tree nursing.</p>

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Survey of Korean Financial Markets (9): 'Wild West' in view  -New strategies will be needed after deregulation KOREA'S banks face a tougher future. The planned deregulation of the country's financial markets is expected to lead to fiercer competition forcing banks to focus on improving profitability through the reduction of overheads and better credit analysis. 'For the banks it will be like the Wild West,' says Mr Young-Wook Chin, director of the Bank Division at the Ministry of Finance. 'They will have to develop new strategies.' Korean banks have led a closely-regulated existence for many years. Privatisation may have freed the commercial banks from direct state control, but they must still obey guidelines on credit allocation, while interest rates on loans and deposits have been tightly regulated. The first stage of interest rate deregulation at the end of 1991 affected bank overdraft loans, commercial paper, overdue loans, bank certificates of deposit, trade bills, repurchase agreements and corporate bonds with maturities exceeding two years. However, the most important step will be the next one, consisting of the deregulation of interest rates on all bank lending (with the exception of loans financed by the government), longer-term deposits with maturities of more than two years, corporate bonds with maturities of less than two years and bank debentures with maturities of over two years. Mr Choi Kak-Kyu, Economic Planning Board Minister, recently said this step would not be implemented until the first half of 1993. Once effected, 75 per cent of lending rates and 30 per cent of deposit rates will have been deregulated, according to the Korea Federation of Banks. By 1997, all interest rates should have been deregulated. The lifting of interest rate regulations is expected to result in a narrowing of interest margins. The Office of Bank Supervision warns that liberalisation of interest rates will lead to tougher competition between the banks and lower profitability. So banks will have to focus on improving profitability in a number of ways. These include: Reducing expenditure and overheads. Many Korean banks have large branch networks and are overstaffed, with cumbersome administration departments. Some have stopped hiring new staff, and are supplementing expensive offices with automated teller machines. Introducing more competitive products which provide a higher return. Banks are already trying to move away from interest-bearing to more fee-based services, according to the Korea Federation of Banks, both in the corporate and consumer area. Improving credit analysis. Existing guidelines on credit allocation have done little to encourage good credit analysis and, in the words of one foreign banker, 'the result is that lending is not conducted purely on good business sense and credit analysis'. Bankers complain that the numerous rules force them to make loans to risky borrowers. For example, 45 per cent of bank lending is supposed to go to small and medium-sized companies, but bankers argue that these are the ones currently feeling the pinch due to the combination of the slowdown in export growth and high interest rates. Many of them cannot meet their interest payments and bankruptcies among small and medium-sized companies have reached worrying levels with about 5,000 smaller concerns and 18 listed companies failing in the first nine months. Non-performing loans have risen as a proportion of total assets from 1.8 per cent in 1991 to 1.9 per cent at the end of June: while the figure is well below the 1987 level of 5.4 per cent, it is still a cause for concern. The Office of Bank Supervision is encouraging banks to introduce loan office systems to evaluate credits and to monitor borrowers. But some analysts are worried the proportion of non-performing loans may rise further in view of the characteristic high gearing of Korean companies and difficulties faced by the smaller companies.</p>

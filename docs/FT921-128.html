			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Issuers restricted by volatile conditions NEW issue activity remained restricted to small, targeted issues in the international bond market yesterday as volatile conditions in most government bond markets deterred potential issuers. The State Electricity Corporation of Victoria, the Australian state-backed utility, launched an unusual ADollars 150m 15-year deal, wholly underwritten by Merrill Lynch. The bonds, which have an investor put option after two years, pay an initial coupon of 8 per cent. If the put option is not exercised this would rise to a level where the yield is 12.18 per cent. The paper was targeted at investors with an optimistic long-term view of the Australian market despite the recent weak performance of bond prices, and was placed in the Far East and continental Europe. From an issue price of 101.25, the lead manager traded the bonds at 100.25 bid. Late in the day, Bayerische Hypotheken-und Weschel Bank added CDollars 75m to its outstanding CDollars 100m three-year issue launched in November last year. Lead manager Wood Gundy re-offered the 8 1/2 per cent paper to investors at a fixed price of 98.10, a level held until the close of trading. SASIB International, a unit of the Italian industrial group, launched a L65bn five-year mandatorily convertible bond offering, lead managed by Lehman Brothers International. The bonds will be priced later this week with a coupon of 8 3/4 to 9 1/4 per cent and a conversion premium of 2-5 per cent over the prevailing price of SASIB's non-voting shares. At maturity the bonds automatically convert into shares. The Bundespost, Germany's state-owned postal authority, has authorised Deutsche Bank to arrange a DM2bn commercial paper programme, according to banking sources, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Ferranti wins RN contract Ferranti International, the electronics company in administrative receivership since December, has won a preliminary contract to equip two new assault ships for the Royal Navy. The contract, although worth only about Pounds 200,000 for the final 'project definition' phase, provides an important boost for Ferranti's naval command and control business, one of its key remaining defence activities. It has beaten competition from GEC-Marconi and BAeSema, the joint venture between British Aerospace and the Sema systems company which in recent years has ousted Ferranti from a near-monopoly in UK naval command systems. Both BAe and GEC-Marconi are among companies short-listed as possible purchasers of the bulk of Ferranti's businesses. Joint receivers Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of Arthur Andersen, described the contract as 'very significant' in demonstrating the company's long-term potential. They were optimistic that formal purchase negotiations for Ferranti could start in March. About eight companies, also including Thorn EMI and Thomson-CSF of France, are expected to be asked to submit 'indicative' bids by the end of this month. Ferranti won a contract last autumn for a similar system for the navy's new helicopter carrier. The first of the two planned assault ships is due to be ordered by the end of next year.</p>

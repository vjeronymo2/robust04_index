			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / International Company News: CRA announces 26% fall in net profits CRA yesterday announced a 26 per cent cut in net profits to ADollars 350m (USDollars 269.2m) for the year to December, continuing a run of poor results from the Australian mining sector. The group, which is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK, said the setback was caused by lower demand, falling metal prices and an increase in tax payments from 37 per cent to 49 per cent of gross profits. It said the fall in net profits was reduced to 13.4 per cent after excluding abnormal items from the earlier period, which included profits on the sale of convertible notes issued by Klockner Werke, the German steel and engineering group. However, after including extraordinary losses of ADollars 384m, the group declared bottom line losses of ADollars 34m, compared with profits of ADollars 400m for 1990. The biggest component of the extraordinary loss was a write-off of the ADollars 267m carrying value of the group's 53 per cent holding in Bougainville Copper, which owns the Panguna copper mine in Papua New Guinea (PNG). CRA said there was no sign of a resolution of the conflict between the PNG government and Bougainville separatists, who forced the closure of the mine several years ago. The group said that the cost of reopening the mine was now estimated at up to K450m (Dollars 427.5m). CRA also wrote down the value of its other copper and gold assets by ADollars 110m to reflect the impact of financing and development constraints in Australia and unrest in PNG, where the group's Mount Kare mine was recently attacked by armed bandits. The carrying value of the group's downstream aluminium businesses was reduced by ADollars 134m following its decision to concentrate on bauxite mining, alumina refining and smelting. In addition, CRA booked an extraordinary loss of ADollars 32.8m as its share of an extensive write-down of asset values announced earlier this week by Pasminco, a zinc and lead miner in which the group holds a 40 per cent shareholding. The extraordinary loss would have totalled ADollars 544m but for an offsetting profit of ADollars 159m resulting from a transfer to the profit and loss account of surplus contributions to superannuation fund. CRA said 1991 had been a 'difficult' year of weak economic growth and warned the prospects of an early recovery in mineral prices or demand were 'poor.' The directors declared a final dividend of 24 cents, fully franked, making a total of 34 cents, compared with 44 cents in 1990. The shares closed 24 cents higher at ADollars 14.10 on the Australian Stock Exchange, reflecting investors relief that net profits had not fallen as far as many analysts had forecast. Big cuts in profits were announced earlier this week by Pasminco and Comalco, the Australian aluminium producer which is 67 per cent owned by CRA. Renison Goldfields, the mineral sands producer, announced a 20 per cent rise in interim net profits, but warned that second-half earnings would be 'well below' last year. Poseidon Gold, part of Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy Poseidon group, announced a net profit of ADollars 29m before minority interests for the six months to December, compared with ADollars 41m for the comparable period of the previous year.</p>

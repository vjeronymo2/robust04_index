			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Current paragraph (d) of &sect;1.53 would be redesignated as paragraph (d)(1) and would be amended to delete the references to the processing and retention fee practice which would be eliminated by this proposal in view of the proposed provisional application practice. Under proposed paragraph (d)(2), the provisional application could be filed without the basic filing fee (set by S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 as $150.00 for other than a small entity, subject to a 50 percent reduction for small entity) and without the complete cover sheet required by proposed &sect;1.51(a)(2). In such a case, the proposed rule provides that the applicant will be notified and be given a period of time in which to file the missing fee, and/or cover sheet and to pay the surcharge set forth in proposed &sect;1.16(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.53(e)(2) would be added to indicate that a provisional application would not be given a substantive examination and would be abandoned no later than twelve (12) months after its filing date as set forth in S. 2467 and H.R. 5110. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.55 would have the reference to 35 U.S.C. 119 replaced with a reference to 35 U.S.C. 119(a)&hyph;(d) and would specify that a provisional application is not entitled to the right of foreign priority under proposed 35 U.S.C. 119(a)(&hyph;(d). S. 2467 and H.R. 5110 amend 35 U.S.C. 119 by assigning letters (a), (b), (c) and (d) to the existing paragraphs of 35 U.S.C. 119. These paragraphs are directed to claims for foreign priority. In addition, 35 U.S.C. 111 is amended to provide that a provisional application may not claim or be entitled to the right of foreign priority of any other application under 35 U.S.C. 119. Therefore, provisional applications are not included in &sect;1.55. In addition, the reference to 37 CFR 1.17(i)(1) would be replaced by 37 CFR 1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to &sect;1.17. No substantive change is intended by this proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.59 would delete the reference to the processing and retention fee which is proposed to be eliminated from &sect;1.53(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.60 would be removed and reserved. The procedures set forth in &sect;1.60 for filing a continuation or divisional application are unnecessary in view of the recent rule change to &sect;1.6(d) which permits the filing of a copy of the signed oath or declaration. This is appropriate since neither the statute nor the rules require a recent date of execution to appear on the oath or declaration and the duty of disclosure requirements under &sect;1.56 would apply to the continuing application. The issue of a stale oath or declaration would be eliminated by appropriately amending the procedures set forth in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office currently receives a number of petitions requesting that an application filed under &sect;1.60 be accepted even though at the time of filing of the application, applicant failed to comply with all the requirements of &sect;1.60 due to inadvertent error on the part of the applicant. The deletion of &sect;1.60 will help reduce the number of petitions and will simplify the procedures for filing an application for both the Office and patent practitioners. Applicants may use the procedures set forth in &sect;1.53 to file a continuation or divisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) by providing the Office with a copy of the prior application. Failure to submit a complete copy of the prior application may be corrected by way of a petition under &sect;1.182. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1.62 would state that the procedure could be used for filing a continuation, division or continuation-in-part of a complete application filed under &sect;1.53(b)(1) but not a provisional application under &sect;1.53(b)(2). The section would specifically preclude the use of the file wrapper continuing procedures set forth in &sect;1.62 for filing the first complete application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) which claims the benefit of an earlier filing date of a provisional application. In view of the relatively small filing fee for a provisional application and the fact that the provisional application will not be examined, Office handling must be kept to a minimum and these provisional applications, once complete, will be sent to the Files Repository for storage rather than being kept in the examination area of the Office. It would be burdensome for the Office to retrieve these provisional applications so that an applicant could use the procedures set forth in &sect;1.62. Furthermore, since claims and an oath or declaration are not required in a provisional application and the first complete application would most likely contain additional subject matter not disclosed in the provisional application, the procedures set forth in &sect;1.53 for filing an application will meet applicants' needs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference to 37 CFR 1.17(i)(1) in &sect;1.62 would be replaced by 37 CFR 1.17(i) to be consistent with the proposed change to &sect;1.17. Furthermore, the phrase ``Serial number, filing date'' in &sect;1.62(a) and the term ``application serial number'' in &sect;1.62(e) would be changed to ``application number.'' The term ``application number'' is found in current &sect;1.5(a). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Process plant contractor sold HUMPHREYS &amp; Glasgow, the venerable but loss-making UK process plant contractor, is changing hands in a deal that switches ownership from Dallas-based Enserch Corporation to Jacobs Engineering Group of Pasadena. The sale, for which terms were not disclosed, comes in the centenary year of H&amp;G, which was founded by two American-trained engineers, Dr Alexander Humphreys and Dr Arthur Glasgow, to tackle the carburetted water gas business in Europe. Since 1892 H&amp;G has developed a worldwide reputation for its process-plant contracting skills with expertise in industries ranging from refining to pharmaceuticals and power generation.

H&amp;G's offshore business, employing 650 to 700 people, was sold in February to Kvaerner of Norway. Jacobs is acquiring the remaining process contracting business, a 50 per cent stake in a successful new joint venture with Anglian Water, and a 40 per cent stake in Bombay-based H&amp;G Consultants. Mr Robert Clement, vice-president of marketing services at Jacobs, said it had been searching for a long time for the right company to expand its presence in Europe. 'This is an excellent opportunity to shape and mould H&amp;G into a winning organisation,' he said. 'Our perception is that the losses are manageable.'</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The total cost of overfill devices to the industry is calculated first by estimating cost by vessel type and use for an average size vessel, and then by aggregating the costs for all vessels engaged in the trade. The analysis includes self-propelled and non-self-propelled tank vessels. Total costs, including present value costs, are estimated separately by vessel type, use, flag, and route. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assuming a 5-year life for alarm devices and a 15-year life for high level indicating devices, the present value cost of compliance through 2015 to tank vessel owners and operators is projected to range between $103.1 million and $113 million, distributed as follows: (1) to U.S. tank barges and tankships (commercial or privately owned), $51.8 million; (2) to foreign flag tankships, $49.2 to $59.1 million; and (3) to U.S. Government tankships, $2.1 million. The present value of the cost of compliance to the U.S. is $53.9 million through the scope of this analysis (2015). The regulation will affect approximately 1,615 inland and coastal barges, 147 U.S. flag (commercial or privately owned) tankships, 375&hyph;450 foreign flag tankships, and 23 U.S. Navy and U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) vessels. Enforcement costs to the Federal Government are estimated at $785,000 per year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The analysis indicates that if the entire cost of the implementation of the regulation were passed on to consumers, the retail price of domestically consumed petroleum products would increase approximately .019 dollars per ton or .000007 dollars per gallon; and the retail price of U.S. petroleum products in export markets would rise by approximately .112 dollars per ton or .0004 dollars per gallon. Export markets will be impacted more heavily because 48 million tons of oil are exported every year versus 850 million tons of oil transported per year in domestic markets. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to Coast Guard records, approximately 73,000 gallons of oil and petroleum products were spilled in U.S. waters from cargo tank overflows in 1989. The Coast Guard hopes that this regulation will prevent 100 percent of these oil spills or save approximately 73,000 gallons of oil from spilling per year. Nevertheless, it is expected that some failures will occur. For comparison, four models are presented: one in which it is assumed high level indicating devices are 60 percent effective and alarms are 80 percent effective (60%&hyph;80%); and one on which stick gauges are 80 percent effective and alarms are 100 percent effective (80%&hyph;100%). Each of these models is presented in two cases, Case I and II. Case I assumes that there are 500 applicable foreign vessels, Case II assumes 600. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present value of the quantified direct benefits from the installation of overfill warning devices on tankships and tank barges is 634,021 gallons of oil not spilled, assuming a 60%&hyph;80% model, calculated through 2015 and at a 7 percent discount rate. Assuming an 80%&hyph;100% model, benefits increase to 836,489 gallons of oil not spilled. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RA estimates four cost-benefit ratios for this rulemaking, depending on case (Case I or II) and effectiveness (60%&hyph;80% or 80%&hyph;100%). The ratios are defined in terms of ``net present value,'' which is the ``present value'' of costs ($117.1 to $127 million) per ``present value'' of benefits (634,021 to 836,489 gallons of oil not spilled). The cost to benefit ratio for tankships and tank barges is between $140 and $200 per gallon of oil not spilled for this rulemaking. In other words, the rulemaking results in a cost of $140 to $200 to prevent the spillage of 1 gallon of oil. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that the benefits of other rules need to be reassessed according to the benefits claimed from this rule. In particular, the comment stated that because this rule will reduce the number of oil spills, the benefits claimed for the rulemaking entitled, ``Discharge Removal Equipment for Vessels Carrying Oil'', (58 FR 67988), would be less. The comment indicated that the interrelationships of the OPA 90 rulemakings should be assessed as each rule is proposed. The Coast Guard is preparing a programmatic regulatory impact analysis (RIA) which will consider the interrelationship of all OPA 90 rulemakings, however it is considered to be impractical to re-examine this RIA in its entirety for each rulemaking. Where there are obvious and significant interrelationships, the Coast Guard has taken these factors into account. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the comments received and to lessen the burden on small entities, the Coast Guard has revised the regulations to apply only to tank vessels with a cargo carrying capacity of more than 1,000 M <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This covers 21 tankships and 391 tank barges which are owned and operated by small companies. They would have been included in the rulemaking as it was originally proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Coast Guard has permitted the alternative of high level indicating devices for tank barges. This is a less expensive option and will be much less costly for the smaller entities contained within the tank barge industry. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

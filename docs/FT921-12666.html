			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Japan's premier apologises for wartime misdeeds MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday broke a long taboo and became his country's first political leader to apologise in the Diet for Japan's wartime past. He apologised too for recent political scandals and pledged to 'clean up politics as a top priority'. The scandals threaten to overshadow the Diet session and to impede the progress of legislation, including financial liberalisation measures and the Budget bill - which would allow Japanese servicemen to serve overseas on United Nations peace-keeping missions. Mr Miyazawa's speech followed a visit to South Korea, where he repeatedly apologised for misdeeds during colonial rule and the Second World War. His unprecedented expressions of remorse come in the wake of public debate about the war generated by the 50th anniversary last month of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Nevertheless, Mr Miyazawa's words fell far short of the explicit account of Japanese atrocities which some Chinese, Koreans and other Asians, who suffered at the hands of the Japanese military, have demanded. The prime minister's minute-long reference to the war contrasts with the widely-admired hour-long speech to the Bundestag by Mr Richard von Weizsacker, the West German president, in 1985. Mr Miyazawa referred indirectly to the trade concessions made to Mr Bush during the US president's recent visit to Japan. He said Japan had benefited greatly from American support after the Second World War. Now that the US faced 'some problems of its own', it behoved Japan 'to make every effort to co-operate'. Speaking about the economy, Mr Miyazawa said the government's budget for the year from April, together with recent interest rate cuts and other measures, would contribute to inflation-free sustained growth. Emiko Terazono adds: The Japanese government, pushing for changes in Japan's financial system, will submit a series of bills to the Diet next month. They include measures to prevent the recurrence of political and stock market scandals, and the reform of Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Law - Japan's version of the US Glass Steagall Law which separates the banking and securities industries. The bills would set up a securities and banking supervisory commission; establish capital adequacy standards for brokers; and increase fines for breaking the Securities and Exchange Law.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department agrees that standards and guidelines prepared at a more local level would be better tailored to fit resource conditions and livestock management practices. Therefore, the Department has not carried forward the standards and guidelines as included with the advance notice. However, in order to promote greater administrative consistency, and to focus management attention and resources where they will result in the greatest environmental benefit, the Department recognizes a need to establish clear national requirements for grazing administration and guidance for the preparation of State or regional standards and guidelines. These national requirements and guiding principles for State or regional standards and guidelines have been included in the text of this proposed rule. In addition, the Department recognizes the importance of putting standards and guidelines in place in a timely manner, and has provided a mechanism for doing so in this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department intends that State or regional standards and guidelines for grazing administration would be developed in consultation with multiple resource advisory councils, interested public, and others within 18 months following the effective date of the final rule. In the event State or regional standards and guidelines have not been completed and approved by the Secretary within 18 months of the effective date of the final rule, fallback standards and guidelines provided in this proposed rule would be implemented. The Department feels this provision for fallback standards and guidelines is needed to provide for necessary resource protection and to encourage prompt action toward the development of State or regional standards and guidelines. The fallback standards and guidelines would also provide a benchmark by which to measure the adequacy of State or regional standards and guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The national requirements, guiding principles for the development of State or regional standards and guidelines, and the fallback standards and guidelines proposed in this rule all focus on attaining and maintaining healthy rangeland ecosystems, including riparian areas. The Department recognizes that achieving and maintaining properly functioning ecosystems is critical to the protection of public rangelands and resources, and resource uses. Achieving and maintaining healthy rangeland conditions greatly benefits resources and uses such as wildlife and fish habitat, water quality, and recreational activities. Although BLM land use plans and activity plans may provide for achieving resource conditions that go beyond the benchmarks for ecological health and functional condition proposed in this rule, achieving properly functioning ecosystems is prerequisite to the conservation of rangeland resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The national requirements for all grazing-related plans and activities on public lands under this proposed rule include continuing or implementing grazing practices that maintain or achieve healthy, properly functioning ecosystems and riparian systems; continuing or implementing grazing practices that maintain, restore or enhance water quality and assist in the attainment of water quality that meets or exceeds State water quality standards; and continuing or implementing grazing management practices that assist in the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of the habitat of threatened or endangered species, or species that are classified as candidates for threatened or endangered species listing. These requirements are intended to reflect the fundamental legal mandates for the management of public lands under the Taylor Grazing Act, FLPMA, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), and other relevant authorities. Where existing management practices fail to meet these national requirements, the BLM authorized officer would be required to take action as soon as practicable but not later than the start of the next grazing year. This would include actions such as reducing livestock stocking rates, adjusting the season or duration of livestock use, or modifying or relocating range improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standards and guidelines would be developed to provide further guidance, within the framework of the national requirements, in the administration of livestock grazing on public lands. Bureau of Land Management State Directors, in consultation with the affected multiple resource advisory councils, would be responsible for identifying the appropriate geographical area for which standards and guidelines would be developed. Standards and guidelines would be developed for an entire State or for an ecoregion encompassing portions of more than one State. Standards and guidelines would not be prepared for a smaller area totally within the boundaries of a single State except where the BLM State Director, in consultation with the multiple resource advisory councils, determines that the combination of the geophysical and vegetal character of an area is unique and the health of the rangelands within the area could not be adequately protected using standards and guidelines developed on a broader geographical scale. The intent of this limitation on the geographical scope of standards and guidelines is to provide for the development and application of uniform standards and guidelines across an area including public lands of similar character. This limitation would result in more consistent application of standards and guidelines, and would encourage collaboration between BLM offices, multiple resource advisory councils, and the public in addressing the resource management needs and concerns of an area. Standards and guidelines could be developed for ecoregions involving public lands within more than one State for the purpose of ensuring the consistent application of rangeland management measurements and practices across an identifiable ecoregion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

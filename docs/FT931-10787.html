			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Leading Article: The right G7 agenda BE WARNED. Global co-ordination of economic policy, long out of vogue, is back on the agenda. The Clinton administration wants an early meeting of ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries to reinvigorate the G7 consultation process. European Commission president Mr Jacques Delors called on Monday for the G7 to put the world back on a growth tack. And at the World Economic Forum in Davos, a talk shop for the fat cats of international economics and business, the corridors were abuzz this week with talk of global growth initiatives. If policy co-ordination is making a comeback, it is not hard to see why. Yesterday's figures for the Japanese current account make the point all too plainly. With the surplus up by more than 60 per cent to a record Dollars 117.6bn for 1992, there are justifiable fears that the re-emergence of trade imbalances in the G7 will inflame the protectionist instinct of hawkish elements in the new US administration. Yet experience suggests that G7 initiatives are, to put it kindly, something less than a panacea. The case for co-ordination rests on increasing economic inter-dependence. In a typical OECD country, between a quarter and a half of the impact of domestic policy on economic activity falls not at home, but in other economies. Hence the suggestion that a better collective economic outcome can be achieved through co-operative policy setting; and that the perceived loss of sovereignty involved is more apparent than real. Perverse results It sounds sensible enough, but the results have been perverse. The locus classicus of such co-ordinated global growthmanship was the Bonn summit in 1978, at which the US called on Germany and Japan to act as locomotives to pull the world towards a faster recovery. The US attacked the Japanese current account surplus - there is nothing new in global economics - and argued that Japan and Germany, with their low inflation and strong external accounts, were failing to do enough to boost global demand. The two surplus countries then embarked on a fiscal expansion, which coincided with the second oil shock. Inflation was the result, especially in hypersensitive Germany, where it topped 5 per cent in 1979 - even higher than its present post-unification level. Despite some benefits, such as the decontrol of US energy prices, the Bonn summit gave co-ordination a bad name. Subsequent attempts have been less ambitious, but arguably more damaging. In the 1980s the US, with a savings shortage, and Japan with a mirror-image surplus, became interdependent to an unprecedented degree. Seemingly logical policy co-ordination, first in the Plaza accord, then in the Louvre agreement, ended up by imposing an excessively lax monetary policy on Japan. There followed in Tokyo the biggest speculative bubble since 1929. The aftermath threatens to leave Japan with nil or negative growth this year. For its part, the US failed to deliver on its promises to address its structural budget deficit, which now plagues the Clinton administration. Monetary strains In Europe, meantime, the ambitious attempt to turn the semi-fixed exchange rate mechanism into something more rigid has foundered, largely because co-operation was confined to monetary policy and exchange rates. The monetary mixture was incompatible with the loose fiscal policy adopted by Germany after unification. Hence the monetary strains that caused Britain, with a more heavily indebted economy than most other ERM members, to leave the system. It is possible to be too downbeat about concerted economic action. The early economic summits after the first oil crisis almost certainly helped avert a rapid move to protectionism. But the subsequent lessons suggest that any return to economic co-ordination should focus on limited and attainable objectives. The most important issue on the agenda remains the preservation of the multilateral trading system. The overwhelming priority should be the completion of the Uruguay round. Equally pressing is the stabilisation of the Russian economy, where loans, technical assistance and improved market access need further attention. But where the big issues of fiscal and monetary policy are concerned, it would be foolish to expect very much. The experience in the ERM amply demonstrates the problems of defining and addressing exchange rate disequilibria. Where fiscal policy is concerned, the Japanese could be excused, after their experience in the late 1980s, for inserting ear plugs before the siren call comes for more co-operative policymaking. Domestic recession is anyway prompting further fiscal and monetary relaxation, which holds the key to reducing the trade surplus. What is needed from the Clinton administration, before a more ambitious programme is contemplated, is a demonstration that it really does have the will to put its own house in order before jawboning the rest of the world. On past form, that self-denying ordinance seems unlikely to be observed.</p>

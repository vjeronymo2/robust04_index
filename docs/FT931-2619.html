			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Company News: Production chief steps up to BMW chairmanship BMW, the current star of the German motor industry, has replaced its retiring chairman with the youngest member of the board. Mr Bernd Pischetsrieder, 45, currently responsible for production, will take control at the luxury car group's annual meeting on May 13. At the same time, Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, 64, the outgoing chairman, will propose an unchanged dividend of DM12.50 on ordinary stock and DM13.50 for preference shares. Bolstered mainly by the launch of the new 3-Series, and outselling rival Mercedes-Benz for the first time, BMW managed to ride through the worst of the downturn which cut Volkswagen's earnings by 87 per cent last year. Even so, net group profits shrank to DM726m (Dollars 436m) compared with DM783m, on sales up almost 5 per cent to DM31.2bn. The figures reflect the sharp downturn in the domestic market which hit all German automotive groups in the second half of the year. At the halfway mark, BMW's earnings were up 10.5 per cent and turnover had risen 12 per cent.</p>

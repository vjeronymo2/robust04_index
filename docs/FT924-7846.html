			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Guide to UK Property (7): Energy and drive - Wales / Cardiff and Newport are expected to out-perform most other provincial areas THERE is no faulting the energy and drive of the Welsh Development Agency. On the pretext of Columbus Day, London agents and journalists had been drawn down to Newport to watch fireworks outside Columbus House, an office development nearing completion by Midlands developers Wilson Bowden with help from the WDA. Then it was on to Cwmbran, a few miles away, where the WDA was relaunching marketing for the renamed Brecon House, a high specification manufacturing base abandoned by a departing US electronics company for whom it had been designed in the mid-1980s. The government agency and the developer were putting a good face on it, but both buildings will be difficult to fill. The problem with Brecon House is the very high specification of which it boasts. No one other than computer manufacturers needs the sort of clean rooms Brecon House offers: and that industry is contracting at present. Columbus House, an altogether more standard 25,000 sq ft office block, faces a different struggle: competition. The building is sensibly divisible into four self-contained units, if necessary, and its location, alongside the M4 outside Newport, is sound. But the 55-acre Langstone Office Park which it inaugurates faces competition from two other business parks in Newport: Cleppa Park, which has already attracted tenants of the quality of TSB; and Celtic Lakes, a massive planned 2m sq ft science and business park, of which the core is the 50-acre Imperial Park for Imperial College with the WDA among its joint venturers. The WDA has a well deserved reputation for cajoling inward investment into South Wales - to the tune of 100,000 jobs and Pounds 4.7bn of capital in the past 10 years. But, notwithstanding top flight letting agents - Jones Lang Wootton for Celtic Lakes and Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks for Langstone Park  -it will take Newport some time to absorb the space these schemes represent. Possibly because of the vigour of the WDA and its success in attracting big overseas owner-occupiers, South Wales has not been seen as an attractive region for institutional portfolio investment. But in a property recession as severe as today's, that may be a blessing in disguise. Jones Lang Wootton believes that rents in Cardiff, the premier location, have fallen back from about Pounds 18 to Pounds 15-Pounds 16, with rent-free periods a common feature. But that is a far cry from the 50 per cent drop in Central London rents and the inducements to tenants are not so lavish. As a business centre, Cardiff has still to see the full effects of its docklands redevelopment. Legislation is still awaited before the Cardiff Bay Barrage can go ahead, for example. Some of the more ambitious ideas - such as a light railway linking town centre and bay along a Champs Elysee-style boulevard - may be abandoned. But the scheme continues to attract interest from investors and would-be tenants while avoiding the excesses which undermined London's Docklands. Outside the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation's area, however, the presence of the WDA is vital for developments of any scale. Typical of its new policy of partnership with the private sector is the 90-acre Cardiff Gate business park at North Pentwyn. This involves DMD, a local developer, and a civil engineering division of Fiat. It will provide extensive housing and leisure facilities in addition to between 1m and 1.5m sq ft of business space. If that project has yet to show more than potential benefits, another WDA initiative at the western end of the Newport-Cardiff axis is already well into its second phase. Bridgend has been transformed with the attraction of multinationals such as Ford and Sony, both of which are planning local expansion despite retrenchment elsewhere. Ford is putting Pounds 450m into its South Wales plants and will build 350,000 Zeta engines at Bridgend. Sony is spending Pounds 150m upgrading its Bridgend facilities and other technology-based companies are prospecting in the area as part of the spin-off. To the north of the favoured M4 corridor, prospects remain more mixed. Not all the efforts of local authority and development body have been able to guarantee the long-term commercial transformation of Ebbw Vale. One local agent believes the 'footfall at the Garden Festival was lower than we hoped and has produced few bankable proposals'. In any case the commercial engine of the principality must be expected to remain in the south-east. Cardiff and Newport are expected to out-perform most other provincial areas from early in the upturn when it comes. The Cardiff Bay Barrage should put the seal on the capital's regeneration and Newport's prospects will further brighten with the opening of the second Severn Bridge in 1996. Meanwhile both continue to show exceptional defensive strengths at a time when other areas have sagged noticeably with the steepening recession.</p>

			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Foreign policy gridlock The first reaction of some Clinton supporters last week, when the Democrats lost control of both houses of Congress, was to suggest that from now on the president would concentrate on foreign policy, which has come to be seen as his greatest strength. That in itself is a remarkable development. Bill Clinton won the presidency two years ago by arguing that his predecessor spent too much time on foreign policy and not enough on America's domestic problems. For most of the time since he has been portrayed as hopelessly inept and indecisive in foreign policy. Only lately, as his domestic programme ground to a halt, has his foreign policy performance, notably in Korea, Haiti and the Middle East, begun to look a little better. It is also true that the balance of powers between president and congress is more favourable to the former in foreign than in domestic policy. But that is not saying much. Foreign policy involves spending money, and the president cannot spend money, even abroad, without congressional authority. The world was abruptly reminded of this last week when Mr Clinton had to end US participation in the enforcement of the arms embargo on Bosnia: an action which might make sense if it were part of an overall strategy to help the Bosnian government achieve military victory, but which in the present context serves only to destroy a very delicate consensus among the leading powers that took well over a year to reach, and in the process badly undermines what is left of the Atlantic alliance. The president also has to obtain the consent of the Senate for his nominations to ambassadorial posts and other senior positions in the state and defence departments (though not in the National Security Council). His Republican predecessors often had difficulty with this, not from Democrats but from a fellow Republican, Senator Jesse Helms, who regards the entire foreign service as a bunch of liberal elitists, and who is a master of the art of procedural delay. Mr Helms is deeply suspicious of almost all forms of US engagement with the rest of the world, especially those (such as the Uruguay Round) that take a multilateral form and require the US to abide by rules that other countries have a role in setting and administering. He describes the United Nations as 'that long-time nemesis of millions of Americans . . . which costs the American taxpayers billions of dollars'. He is against virtually all foreign aid, except aid to Israel. He even disapproves of efforts to make peace between Israel and Syria, since for him it is axiomatic that Syria's desire for peace cannot be sincere. Come January, Mr Helms will be chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Mr Clinton's freedom of action to pursue any foreign policy of his own will from then on be severely constrained. Those who rely on US leadership and commitment in confronting the complex problems of the post cold war world would be well advised to look elsewhere.</p>

Among the indicators used by the Wifo  [Economic Research Institute] expectations regarding production  were clearly more optimistic than three months ago: More  companies expect an expansion instead of a decline in production  over the coming months. Orders and capacity utilization are also  assessed more favorably, a Wifo report on the economic  development says.    At the end of 1993, rising export orders stimulated  industry.  During the fourth quarter, industry produced 1 percent more  than a year before. The recovery began in advanced sectors.  <H5>  Recovery in the Construction Sector </H5>   In the fourth quarter -- for the first time since autumn  1992  -- exports also surpassed the level of the previous year (plus  1.5 percent). Exports to Western Europe were down, but this was  offset by higher demand from the United States, Southeast Asia,  China, and Eastern Europe.    Domestic demand also developed in a relatively favorable  manner at the end of 1993. Retail trade turnover remained  stable in seasonally adjusted terms around the end of the year.  The situation was particularly good in public works and  foundation work; building construction also experienced an  increase.    As a result of the beginnings of an economic recovery, the  labor market stabilized. In February, while unemployment was  only slightly higher, employment was slightly lower than last  year. If this trend continues, the unemployment rate might stay  below the predicted value for this year.  <H5>  Declining Inflation Rate </H5>   At the beginning of this year, inflation abated, falling  from  3.5 percent to 3.1 percent in January. The increase in prices  of industrial and retail goods, foodstuffs, and private  services, in particular in tourism, decreased. The rise in  petroleum tax and charges for some public sevices at the  beginning of the year, on the other hand, accelerated inflation.    In contrast to previous years, rates for some public service  increased more strongly than the prices of private services. To  what extent the participation in the European Economic Area has  contributed to dampening inflation has not yet been  investigated, according to Wifo.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / FT Exporter (15): Takeovers behind a success - Tony Jackson finds that an appetite for acquisitions is behind the rise of this company / Profile of BTR The spectacular rise of the industrial conglomerate BTR in the export rankings is a tribute less to its salesmanship than to its appetite for acquisitions. At the end of 1991, BTR swallowed one of the grand old names of British engineering, Hawker Siddeley, in a bitterly contested takeover battle. Though much smaller than BTR, Hawker had exports of comparable size - well over Pounds 300m in its last year of independence. These were broadly spread, from electrical switchgear from its Brush factory in Loughborough to electric motors, aerospace components and diesel engines. The acquisition shot BTR from 26th to 16th in the rankings last year, and more than doubled its exports to Pounds 753m. But BTR is a formidable exporter on its own account. Its Dunlop International Technology subsidiary  -the product of another bitter takeover battle in 1985 - won the Queen's Award for exports last year. Among other BTR companies, DCE exports over 80 per cent of its dust control equipment and International Radiator Services exports over a third of its radiators and cores to mainland Europe. In spite of that, exporting is not an activity readily associated with BTR, simply because its operations are so widely spread around the world. Even after the Hawker acquisition, only Pounds 1.4bn of the group's Pounds 5.4bn of operating assets - 26 per cent of the total - were located in the UK. This was a lower figure than the Americas, with Pounds 1.5bn, and not much bigger than Australasia, where BTR has built up a powerful presence through its Nylex subsidiary. The company is now at a delicate stage in its development. Its founding genius, Sir Owen Green, retired this year and, in a development which surprised many outsiders, he was succeeded not by the Australian managing director Alan Jackson, nor by the American chief operating office Robert Faircloth, but by Norman Ireland, the former finance director and the man credited with putting in place the financial controls which form the backbone of BTR's management method. Mr Ireland had retired from active service with BTR three years earlier, turning instead to a highly successful stint as chairman of the packaging group Bowater. His return to BTR looks like a temporary solution, the implication being that the company has yet to solve the all-important question of how the first generation of management establishes the succession. BTR may be at a crossroads in a wider strategic sense. Under Sir Owen, it was an unrepentant conglomerate, at a time when the concept was rapidly drifting out of fashion. In the past few years, it has become received wisdom in the developed world that conglomerates belong to an early stage of industrial development. They may still work for Korea or Malaysia. But in the US or Europe, the fashion is for focus and specialisation. Hence, for instance, last year's break-up of ICI. At the same time, contested takeovers are becoming rarer. In the low-growth environment of the early 1990s, it is widely felt that the risks involved in a hostile bid no longer make sense. As a conglomerate built on takeovers, BTR is thus doubly unfashionable. In spite of that, it looks like a survivor. Although its products range from gravel and glass bottles to aircraft wheels and golf clubs, it can claim a focus of its own: as a specialist in industrial management, manufacturing low or medium technology products to a high level of efficiency. Until it settles on a new direction, it can afford to bide its time.</p>

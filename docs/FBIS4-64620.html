			<p>BFN     [Text] Halit Dagli, True Path Party [TPP] deputy leader,  has said that his party does not accept the right of any  authority or group outside the assembly to speak on behalf of  the nation and the people and that the nation is closed to any  antidemocratic interim-regime formula.    Speaking at a news conference in Ankara, Dagli said that all  the country's problems will be solved within the framework of  the pluralistic democratic structure and the assembly. He noted  that seeking new and artificial government formulas will be  detrimental for the country and will be a waste of time. Noting  that the coalition government is advancing with determination on  the path of structuring Turkey as a contemporary and advanced  country while approaching the 21st century, Dagli added that all  the obligations cited in the coalition protocol are being  fulfilled. He noted that the terror and economic problems were  the result of erroneous policies implemented for years, adding  that the government has the willpower to solve these problems.    In reply to a question, Dagli said that the Chief of Staff's  Office should not be dragged into political polemics. He added:  No one has the authority to wear out this institution. We do  not welcome this. In reply to a question of the extension of  the chief of staff's term in office, Dagli said that Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller is satisfied with his performance and that  all the commanders of the Turkish Armed Forces have contributed  greatly to the solution of the problem of terror.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Arts: Funny lines that lead nowhere - Karen Fricker reviews Neil Simon's latest play to open on Broadway Laughter on the 23rd Floor marks Neil Simon's return to the safer ground of autobiographical comedy after his recent attempts at the adult relationship play (Jake's Women) and the musical (The Goodbye Girl). Laughter, which opened this month (November) at the Richard Rodgers Theatre, picks up Simon's life story where the final installment of his successful Brighton Beach Memoirs trilogy left off. Young Simon - here named Lucas and played by the fresh-faced Stephen Mailer  -lands his first big writing job on a live television comedy programme which bears a strong resemblance to Sid Caesar's Your Show of Shows, for which Simon indeed wrote in the early 1950s. This seems material ripe for the genre of writing at which Simon excels  - tidy, nostalgic plays laced through with Jewish humour - and Simon has certainly written a constant stream of funny lines in Laughter, which keep the audience chuckling, often howling. He just has not constructed much of a play to hold the jokes up. Laughter's comic pleasures turn out to be of the fleeting kind: jokes fade from memory as soon as their launched, and the plot is stretched so thin it is barely there. The play takes place in a dingy conference room in a Manhattan office building in 1953. The characters, many based on the real-life comedy titans on Caesar's writing team - Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Larry Gelbart - come off as a bag of overblown, but funny, stereotypes: the high-strung Russian head writer; the laconic, chain-smoking Irish-American; the token woman; and the perennially late, arrogant Jewish hypochondriac, among others. Towering over them all in character, but dwarfed by many in actual stature, is the Caesar doppelganger, Max Prince, whom Nathan Lane brings to marvellously overblown life. Some of the play's richest humour is mined from the matter-of-fact exposition of Max's eccentricities: that he sends out his suit to be cleaned during the working day and conducts business in trenchcoat, shirtsleeves and boxer shorts is all the funnier because no one on stage finds it remarkable. The play is built on the humour of repetition rather than its more complex and interesting cousin, the humour of accrual. In the first act, the characters straggle in to work, exchange a few-one liners, grab a bagel and coffee, and bicker, bicker, bicker . . . and in the second act they do exactly the same thing. There are a few wisps of a story, mostly based around the programme's dodgy relationship to the network, and substantial issues hinted at - particularly the parallels this very Jewish writing staff draws between McCarthyism and the Holocaust - but all end up providing flavour rather than any backbone to the play. So what is the point of all this? We are given our answer, thumpingly, midway through the second act when the programme is under threat and one character tells Max: 'we don't quit because maybe we'll never have this much fun in our lives.' So now we know that this is a 'best years of our lives' play; but we should have known that much sooner. Laughter traffics in nostalgia, relying on the audience's knowledge of and fondness for the subject matter rather than on effective plotting or characterisation. This not particularly well-done play is given a top-notch production. Director Jerry Zaks (Guys and Dolls, Six Degrees of Separation) keeps the pace at just the right pitch of controlled hysteria. Standing out among the performers, along with Lane, are JK Simmons as the bloodhound-faced Irishman, Brian, and Ron Orbach as the loathsome hypochondriac, Ira. Tony Walton's set is appropriately grotty - smudged windows, vinyl sofas, and all; Tharon Musser's lighting casts a fluorescent glow that is just sickly enough; and William Ivey Long's costumes capture both the period and the essence of each character, from Brian's tacky poly-blend suits to Prince's exaggerated pinstripes.</p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Wanted - good friends in the City: BAe has found it difficult to win back favour Returning to work after a few days in the Caribbean, Mr Dick Evans, the British Aerospace chief executive, should have been relaxed. Instead, with other senior company executives, he has been exasperated by the reaction of BAe shares to a renewed batch of bearish comments on his company's prospects. 'We are on track with the strategy set out in our rights issue document last year,' he said. Mr Dudley Eustace, BAe finance director, added: 'Our cash position is satisfactory. Dick and I have held a host of meetings with institutions to explain our position and plans. Nothing has changed during the last few weeks. What more can we do to get the message through?' BAe shares dropped sharply last week after Nomura, the Japanese securities house, circulated a private note to clients painting a bleak picture of BAe's prospects. The impact was all the greater because the note reported negative comments about BAe by Sir Peter Levene, the former head of Britain's defence procurement. Worries were increased by doubts about BAe's negotiations over the second phase of the Al Yamamah defence programme in Saudi Arabia worth about Pounds 2bn a year. The City had hoped for confirmation of the new contract by the end of December. Although BAe announced other contracts involving corporate jets, all eyes have been fixed on Al Yamamah. 'It's understandable. It's such a big event. Selling corporate jets does not make a big difference. But confirmation of the second Al Yamamah contract will remove a lot of doubts,' Mr Eustace explained, emphasising there was never a December 31 deadline for the second phase of the deal. The company remains confident of securing the new contract and senior BAe executives are due to resume negotiations in Saudi Arabia this weekend. The second phase of the Saudi deal is expected to include a mix of construction and defence hardware including Tornado and Hawk aircraft and the construction of the Al Sulayyil base. BAe shares bounced back above the 300p level during the past two days to close at 311p yesterday. Nomura circulated a second private note to clients this week expressing regrets to BAe and Sir Peter for any embarrassment caused by its first note and stating that Sir Peter had no interest in depressing the BAe share price. Reports that BAe was negotiating the sale of its 16 per cent stake in DAF, the Dutch truckmaker, and expectations that one leading City broker will put out a positive note on the company today have contributed to lifting sentiment. But the shares are still substantially below the 380p offer price in last year's flopped rights issue which, coupled with the resignation of chairman Prof Sir Roland Smith and an unexpectedly gloomy profits warning, sent confidence in the company crashing. Since then, BAe has sought to rebuild investor confidence by putting into place the recovery strategy focusing the company on its core businesses including defence; commercial aircraft; cars; and property and construction. Mr George Simpson, chairman of BAe's Rover car group subsidiary, has been appointed deputy chief executive to reinforce BAe's top management structure. Mr Evans confirmed that a shortlist of candidates to take over from Sir Graham Day, BAe's interim chairman, had been drawn up and a decision would be taken near the company's annual meeting in May. The defence business has also been re-organised into a new company, while commercial aircraft activities are being shaken up by splitting BAe's activities in the European Airbus programme from its other civil aircraft programmes. However, BAe has found it harder than expected to win back favour in the City. The fundamental circumstances facing the company have not changed since last September's management crisis. The recession and government defence cuts have put pressure on all BAe's main businesses. But the company expects eventually to reap benefits from its rationalisation and restructuring. 'We are now better positioned when the turnaround comes,' Mr Eustace said. Once the car market recovers, BAe expects Rover to swing quickly back into profit. Last year, BAe shocked the City by its failure to communicate the extent of the difficulties and cash-flow problems facing the group. It is unlikely to risk springing another bad surprise next month when it announces its preliminary financial results for last year. These are expected to show a group profit before tax and exceptional items of about Pounds 150m as forecast in the rights document. The exceptional items will include a Pounds 250m restructuring charge and a further Pounds 45m charge to cover Rover's withdrawal from the US as well as a Pounds 15m gain from the group's controversial sale of its shareholding in the SD-Scicon computing services company. BAe also stated in its rights issue it would maintain its final dividend. Although there has been occasional market speculation that it may be tempted to cut or omit the dividend, this is hardly likely. If it were, the repercussions on the company's still shaky credibility would be enormous.</p>

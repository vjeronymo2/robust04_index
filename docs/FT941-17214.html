			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Derivatives markets continued to exert a powerful influence over the underlying stock market yesterday, writes Terry Byland. But stock index futures were themselves highly volatile as locals, or independent traders, tried to anticipate the expected bout of profit-taking in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index. There was also continued nervousness over expiry on over the counter programmes. The March futures contract ignored a firm opening in equities and fell sharply as the locals sold it down relentlessly until it stood at a small discount against the index itself - fair value now stands at around 13 points. Selling pressure also came from the US, where investors feared that interest rates may rise. In what has become a rare response, London securities firms opened 'negative' basket programmes, buying the future and selling the blue chip stocks. At midsession, however, futures selling died away and the contract rallied strongly, closing at 3,422, almost in line with fair value. Trading volume was high at just above 13,000 contracts. Business in traded options was also strong, at 40,740 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 option recording 18,658; the half-session on New Year's Eve saw 5,992 Footsie contracts traded. The Euro FT-SE option had 3,571 lots dealt. Individual contracts were headed by Glaxo, with 2,355 traded as the market responded to the news on US sales rulings. Tomkins, Ladbroke and Trafalgar House, favoured in the new year recommend-ations of several broking houses, had 1,488, 1,129 and 1.016 contracts transacted respectively.</p>

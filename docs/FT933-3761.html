			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Finance and the Family: Risks worry over BES returns FIXED-exit business expansion schemes are promising investors annual returns after five years of about 14 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer, an attractive figure given that base rates are 6 per cent. Some 'too good to be true' rates are just that, but here the returns are made possible by exploiting the tax relief of up to 40 per cent. Readers have expressed concern, however, that there could be underlying risks not mentioned in the statutory warning section carried in the prospectuses. Neil Warriner, of law firm Herbert Smith, says the prospectuses are worded carefully to avoid misrepresentation, since the BES company cannot give a cast-iron guarantee. The schemes are based on a contract between the institution (most likely to be a university) and the BES company and are enforceable under contract law. Warriner says the main risk is that the university might not have enough money to buy back the property after five years. 'If this were to happen, the investor knows that the BES company has the property and could sell it to satisfy the obligation of the university. So, the risk here is a valuation one; the price would have to be high enough to provide the promised rate of return and the BES company could face a corporation tax liability.' To avoid defaulting on their obligations, many university schemes are cash-backed. Investors should check to see if this backing will cover everything that it should, and note the financial strength of the institution where the money will be placed. When a prospectus is launched, most sponsors are unable to say how much they will put aside, or with which institution. 'This is because they do not know how much will be raised and the market might change between the launch of the scheme and its close,' says Warriner. Christopher Parkinson, a partner at law firm Gouldens, says investors should look for a bank guarantee, the track record of the directors and sponsors, and the directors' benefits. 'If you are worried about any scheme, it is a good idea to spread risk by investing Pounds 40,000 across a number of schemes,' he adds. Investors in university schemes should remember they could lose tax relief if an immediate family member becomes a tenant of the BES company. The university should be told so the student can be housed elsewhere. Meanwhile, sponsor Johnson Fry this week launched its ninth cash-backed BES for the Loughborough University of Technology with a fixed-exit price after five years of 119p (equating to an annual return of 13.69 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer if the investor takes the 1p discount offered until September 24). Johnson Fry has also launched a scheme linked to the FT-SE 100 index to buy property from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education. The return after five years is 60p plus 1.65p for every 1 per cent rise in the index. There are lock-ins after a 37 per cent rise (equating to an exit price of 121p) and after a 100 per cent rise. Joint sponsors Smith &amp; Williamson and Matrix Securities have released Cavendish Geared II to buy residential property in London. The sponsors can borrow 60 per cent of property acquisition costs if most of the funds are raised, providing additional gearing for investors. There is a 2p discount for investments made before September 30. The Footsie-linked schemes are lagging behind the arranged-exit BES in popularity. BESt Investment says only Pounds 28m of the 1993/94 BES funding has gone into these so far, compared to Pounds 293m in the arranged-exit schemes. Save &amp; Prosper, which launched its BESSA Oxbridge scheme two weeks ago and has raised Pounds 23m of its Pounds 38.75m target, says 70-75 per cent of applicants have chosen the fixed-exit option of 121p. It feels the exit price (equating to an annual return of 13.9 per cent to a higher-rate taxpayer) and the strength of the stock market may have swung investors in favour of the arranged-exit companies.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Industry unites against subsidies for VW German employers yesterday united in protest against Volkswagen's efforts to obtain state subsidies for the introduction of shorter working hours at its six domestic factories. The BDA confederation of employers' associations insisted that the vehicle maker's rehabilitation plans had to be carried out without money from the federal employment office. The protest followed clarification of part of VW's plans, which call for some of its 100,000 workforce to work normal hours for nine months of the year and then be registered as unemployed - and paid benefit - for the remaining three. They would then be rehired for a further nine months. Describing the scheme as 'bogus' because the employees would remain tied to VW, the confederation said the contributions of workers and companies to federal unemployment funds were not intended to pay for 'general operating cost reductions'. VW, which has agreed with its workforce on a nominal 28.8-hour week (in various formulations) for the next two years, claims its model would be far less of a burden on state funds than the alternative: dismissing 30,000 people. However, it has already promised that there will be no redundancies for the duration of the draft restructuring agreement with the unions. While the group says the scheme would reduce labour costs by around DM1.8bn (Pounds 710m) a year, independent estimates put the cut at only DM1.3bn (Pounds 510m). It has also been pointed out that, with losses forecast to hit DM2bn this year, Volkswagen in any case would be hard-pressed to finance redundancies on the scale threatened. Observers say that state 'subsidies' would probably be questioned by the competition authorities at the European Commission. Details of a mounting deficit at the labour office, released yesterday, suggest that it, too, could find it hard to justify paying partial unemployment benefit. The office faces a deficit of DM25bn this year, compared with the DM18bn expected earlier, the Bonn government said in a written parliamentary answer. Any increase in the deficit, which will be covered by a federal subsidy, could be paid for only by increased revenues or spending cuts elsewhere, it added.</p>

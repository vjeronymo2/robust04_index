Choe Ung-mo, an ex-journalist in Chongno District, Seoul,  said the New Year address of respected President Kim Il-song  gives a new hope and confidence to the people in the South who  are yearning after the North under the politics centring on the  masses as a beacon of hope.    The group of traitors is resorting to vicious slanders and  smear propaganda against the North in a bid to stop the minds of  the people in the South from turning toward the North, but the  people in the South stubbornly fight for the day when they will  live under the administration of the president, looking up to  the North, an earthly paradise of the working people, as a  beacon of hope, he added.    Yi Myong-chol, a peasant in Puchon, pointed out that the  peasants in the South failed in farming because of man-made  calamities and, still worse, had to give up farming because the  "president" opened rice market to the Yankees.    I heard the news that last year a bumper harvest visited the  North under the sagacious agricultural policy of President Kim  Il-song and, no doubt, this year, too, a bumper harvest will  visit the North thanks to the agriculture-first policy set forth  by the president, he noted, adding that the earnest wish of the  peasants in the South is to do farming to their heart's content  under the care of respected President Kim Il-song who is  pursuing the best agricultural policy in the world.    A dissident Yi Sang-o in Kwangju said the proposal for  achieving reunification by means of confederacy reclarified by  President Kim Il-song in his New Year address is a banner for  the reunification movement that the Korean nation should hold  aloft.    There is no alternative but reunification by means of  confederacy, the way of reunification which is acceptable to  anyone under the present situation in Korea and this formula of  reunification is the most fair and aboveboard and most  realistic, best one, he said.    He vowed to devote his wisdom and energies to the struggle  to  reunify the country by means of confederacy as taught by  President Kim Il-song.</p>

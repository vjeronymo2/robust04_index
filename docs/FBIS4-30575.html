			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yu Yong-ku] </F>   [Text] With the 28 June preliminary contact for South-North  summit talks and the 8-11 July North Korean-U.S. high-level  talks just ahead, the North Korean authorities' remarks  slandering the South and the United States have diminished.  However, North Korea continues to denounce South Korea and the  United States through its media and broadcast from the truce  line to the South. This makes people wonder about North Korea's  real intention.    North Korea's domestic Central Broadcasting Network and  Pyongyang Radio to South Korea recently carried commentaries  berating the United States for aggravating tensions and  denouncing the ROK for preparing for a war, citing the U.S.  Forces' moves on and around the Korean peninsula and U.S.  officials' remarks on the North Korean nuclear issue.    The North Korean broadcasting services stress each day that  the situation on the Korean peninsula is "on the brink of war,"  denounce the United States for preparing "the second Korean  war," regard the ROK's strengthening of its alert posture as a  "war maneuver for a northward invasion," and do not hesitate in  making such unsparing words as "war to war" and "South Korea  will not be safe, either."    With important talks ahead, it is hard for us to understand  a  North Korea that continues to denounce its counterparts.  However, we do not have to pay serious attention to this since  such North Korean attitudes are not new.    North Korea has never stopped slandering, not even during  South-North high-level talks, working-level contacts for an  exchange of envoys, or North Korean-U.S. high-level talks.    This is aimed at having an advantage in negotiations. That  is, by continuously expressing its strong position, North Korea  intends to have its counterparts make concessions. This is also  aimed at preparing to cope with a possible worse situation in  the contacts with South Korea and the United States. North  Korea believes that, in order to safeguard its system, it should  prevent the people's ideological stir even if the outside  situation changes somewhat.    In light of the fact that the North Korean people are all  the  more urged to unite around Kim Chong-il on the occasion of the  anniversary of the Korean war, it seems that North Korea's  denunciation of South Korea and the United States has an  internal political purpose to strengthen Kim's position.    This is proved by Pyongyang's radio special talk on 22 June  that stressed, "Let us overwhelm the enemy in the serious  political and military confrontation without gunfire and firmly  defend the national sovereignty by upholding General Kim  Chong-il."    As they announced the resumption of North Korean-U.S.  high-level talks following North Korea's withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty as a victory of Supreme  Commander Kim Chong-il's determination, the North Korean media  are probably preparing to attribute any successful result of the  upcoming dialogue with South Korea and the United States to  North Korea's intransigence under international pressure to  defend its sovereignty.</p>

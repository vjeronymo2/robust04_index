			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: North and South may yet become friends after Rio ARE relations between the developed industrial nations and the developing world about to take a turn for the better? The question seems an odd one in the wake of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro where the discussion between North and South often appeared acrimonious. But there are straws in the wind to suggest that the forthcoming economic summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Munich could mark a new beginning in North-South relations as both sides struggle to come to terms with the post-communist world. Germany's Chancellor Mr Helmut Kohl is planning to have only five formal items on the agenda of his summit meeting with the leaders of the US, Japan, France, Britain, Italy, Canada and the European Community. Links with the developing world are second on the list after the traditional opening round of talks on the world economy and growth. Third World ties have been placed ahead of items covering future relations with the former Soviet Union and with eastern and central Europe and dealing with proposals to make safe the nuclear power stations of the former east bloc. Another sign that the big industrialised nations want to involve developing countries more closely with the economic future of the planet has come from Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary. He will be meeting finance ministers from 11 Latin American countries on Wednesday and Thursday of next week to hear their views on trade, debt and investment in the region ahead of the Munich talks. This will be the first such hemispheric gathering ahead of a G7 summit. Nor have the developing nations been holding back from initiating contacts with the G7. Mr Abdou Diouf, the president of Senegal, recently wrote to the German government on behalf of 15 developing countries asking to be able to appear at the Munich summit. This request was turned down. But Mr Horst Kohler, the senior German official preparing the summit, met the Senegalese foreign minister and has ensured that the points made by the G15 have been fed into the preparations for the discussions in Munich in July. The G15 includes such large and potentially powerful countries as Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico and Venezuela. Germany has undertaken to brief Senegal as chairman of the G15 about the Munich summit discussions. These contacts are reminiscent of early links between the G7 and the Soviet Union at the end of the 1980s. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev caused a minor sensation in July 1989 when he wrote to the Paris G7 summit to propose closer co-operation between the summit powers and the then Soviet Union. By the 1990 Houston summit, Mr Gorbachev's proposal had turned into an appeal for G7 aid for his struggling empire. Last year's London economic summit marked one of Mr Gorbachev's last notable appearances on the world stage when he met the G7 leaders for a special session of talks after the formal summit proceedings were over. In Munich, Mr Boris Yeltsin, president of Russia, will join the G7 leaders for an afternoon of discussions after the summit. Western officials stress that there are no plans to turn the pre- and post-Munich contacts with the G15 into a formal North-South dialogue. It is also unlikely that the links will be as close as those that have been established with, first, the Soviet Union and, now, Russia. But Germany's positive reaction to the Senegalese approach marks a change of style compared with earlier years. In the past, the US, Japan and Germany, in particular, have resisted moves that seemed likely to embroil the G7 deeply in the North-South debate. An important reason for this change lies in the willingness of developing countries such as the G15 members to embrace western concepts of market economics, good governance and democracy. The detailed points made by the G15 in their letter to the Bonn government have not been disclosed. But officials from the industrialised countries say they have been impressed by the 'realistic' views expressed by the Senegalese-led group and the convergence between the viewpoints of the G7 and G15. Chancellor Kohl believes the problems facing the industrialised countries can only be solved together with the developing nations. His objective at the Munich summit will be to ensure that his fellow leaders share this view. In non-economic areas, there are important issues that clearly need shared solutions. The environment is one that has had a full airing in Rio. Other problems that can best be tackled through co-operation include immigration, action to control epidemics and the international trade in drugs. In the economic sphere, the industrialised nations are learning that they can benefit from closer ties with the developing world. This realisation lay behind President George Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI), launched nearly two years ago, and Mr Brady's decision to invite the Latin American finance ministers to Washington next week. The advantages of closer North-South ties in the context of Latin America were spelled out recently by Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury under secretary for international affairs, in a lecture to the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based free-enterprise policy research institute. The US, he said, needed 'Latin America's economic prosperity and political well-being now and increasingly' as the world grew more competitive. Every Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) of US exports to Latin America created 20,000 US export-related jobs, he noted. However, protectionist sentiment in the industrialised countries is a significant barrier to a more fruitful relationship between North and South. So long as the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks are stalled, the G7 and the other industrialised nations will be poorly placed to make the best of moves towards market-based economics and political pluralism in developing countries.</p>

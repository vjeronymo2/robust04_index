			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Plysu sharesfall 20p on warning SHARES IN Plysu, the maker of plastic bottles, fell 20p to 220p after the company warned profits would be well below market expectations. Mr Stephen Nobbs, finance director, said Plysu was comfortable with its brokers' downgrading of pre-tax profits for the year from the Pounds 12m previously forecast to Pounds 8m. Plysu said it had successfully concluded negotiations with leading UK dairy groups for the supply of milk and juice bottles. The negotiations had, however, taken three to four months longer than anticipated which would have a temporary adverse effect on profits this year. Profits would be 'well below market expectations' but it remained confident that prospects for subsequent years were excellent. On the new profits forecast Plysu is trading on a prospective multiple for the year of about 20, described by one analyst as allowing little scope for further delays in the economic recovery.</p>

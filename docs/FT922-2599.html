			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Chinese bank opens in UK LI GUIXIAN, governor of the People's Bank of China, today opens a representative office in London, the central bank's first outside China, writes Alexander Nicoll. The office is a sign of a more outward-looking approach from the Chinese authorities as they proceed with 'open door' economic reforms. The Bank of China, a state-owned commercial bank, already has a London operation and opens a new building in the City this week. As well as being an observation point for European economic developments, the central bank's office could be useful in the management of China's rapidly growing foreign exchange reserves, which exceed Dollars 42bn (Pounds 22.7bn). As part of the reforms, the People's Bank was officially designated the central bank in 1984. It oversees the banking system, which is still in great need of restructuring, partly because much lending is directed to loss-making state-owned industries at subsidised interest rates.</p>

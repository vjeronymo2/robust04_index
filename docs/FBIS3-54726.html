			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference given by President Leonid Kravchuk on 30 </F> December; place not given; with questions by unidentified radio,  television, and UKRINFORM correspondents -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, today is  New Year's Eve, and on this day people traditionally assess the  year that is coming to an end. What is your opinion of 1993?  What have we achieved having lived through it? Or, maybe, you  think that it will go down in Ukraine's history as a year of  lost hopes?    [Kravchuk] Well, I would say that this year we did not only  have bad affairs. But, unfortunately, good ones were fewer.  This is true.    Although, to go further and move forward along a more  clear-cut course and at a faster rate, it was necessary to live  through this time as well. Although, it could have been  possible to live through it easier, if so many mistakes of both  objective and subjective nature were not allowed to occur. For  example, here are some facts. Over the time that has elapsed,  though not only this year, Ukraine has withstood such powerful  price blows that they are even difficult to imagine. For  example, the price for oil and oil products in Ukraine has grown  5,000 times over, not 500, but 5,000 times. Sometimes, I even  think on how the economy managed to endure this. I would like to  tell you that it is only thanks to our people who are able to  work under the most difficult conditions, and to our leaders in  industry and agriculture, farmers, those who are already private  owners and commercial structures, that we did not collapse  altogether and already in 1993, especially its end became, say,  the time of even a certain slow-down in production decline.    [Word indistinct] I know that figures have a certain meaning  when everything is available in the shops, but facts are facts.  Well, for example, over the 11 months of last year [1992] the  national income decreased by 18 percent. But in  January-November of this year [national income decreased] by 13  percent. Certain enterprises, for example, [word indistinct],  the Transport Ministry, the State Housing and Communal Economy,  corporation Ukrmontazhspetsbud [Ukrainian assembly and special  construction], and others achieved volumes of production that  exceeded those of last year. Exceeded. The number of electric  locomotives, specialized [word indistinct] systems, [word  indistinct] equipment, generators, and woodworking machines has  grown, in other words, very many other items could be  enumerated. Also, something has been done in conversion and  saving fuel and energy resources. This was simply a demand of  life. Well, I cannot but thank the countryside workers who  gathered in 45.6 million tons of grain this year. [Word  indistinct] vegetables and fruits more than last year. Milk  yields have to increase somewhat. That is to say, something has  nevertheless, been done. I would not like us to look at our  life with such pessimism, or form it only [word indistinct].  There are grounds to say that something has been done.  However, if to assess [word indistinct] on a general scale, I  think this year can be referred to as the year of the beginning  of a transition toward new forms of economic life. Well, I, for  example, would mention only some of these.    First, we approved a program of anti-inflation measures.  We managed to work out the principles of relations between the  state and the agrarian sector. Only recently we discussed this  issue at the Coordinating Council and agreed in principle on how  to settle debts. This is very important (?as we are  responsible) to the farmers who yielded such a rich harvest, and  who live in poverty, worse than anyone else. We agreed on how  to give more freedom to regions. For example, there was a  meeting recently, and I will go through with this affair because  I am convinced that they do have possibilities to work better  without the direct interference of the center.    We managed to agree with Russia and Turkmenistan on the  prices and volumes of energy sources, which is principally  important for Ukraine. That is to say, certain steps got  underway toward, I would say, more active work here based on  market and other principles. Therefore, to sum up what I have  said, it is already possible to say that our time in 1993 was  not wasted.    [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych. All Ukraine had an  opportunity to watch our people's deputies working in the  session hall. Quite often it happened that there were about  190-200 deputies in the hall. But when it is time to vote, the  Narada electronic voting system shows at least 300-320 [word  indistinct]. What I have in mind is that some of the deputies  vote instead of their colleagues, doing this at a sprinter's  speed when it is necessary to vote. They insert their cards by  turns and thus adopt relevant documents. But can such documents  be considered legal? I mean, for example, the latest events  when the deputies imposed [word indistinct] on the president's  edicts, in particular, concerning the Blasco-Black Sea Shipping  Company. The chosen representatives of the people seem to block  the course of the reform deliberately. What is to be done? Who  is to blame? [Words indistinct]    [Kravchuk] True, from the point of view of law and the  Constitution, such decisions, if made with such a gross  violation of the rules, are, as a matter of fact, illegal.  However, during the past four years the Supreme Council has not  adopted permanent rules of its activity. And this is one of  such, well, very important gaps, because the rules are the  internal law of work. They are the internal constitution. It  does not exist. If it does not exist one can act this way,  although the temporary rules clearly define the conditions under  which the Supreme Council works in a session regime. That is to  say, there must be not less than two thirds of the deputies in  the hall. However, this electronic display speeds work on the  one hand, but, on the other, it gives an opportunity to carry  out such manipulations. They are being carried out openly, in  public. This is why it could be possible to do it this way: To  register at the tables and then vote by a show of hands. This  is real. It is possible to appoint a counting commission, for  example, and to work. I just do not see any other option. You  are correct in saying [words indistinct]. Well, I analyzed this  myself and charged my [word indistinct]. I can say frankly  that, for example, there are actually no people there on  Thursday, especially at the evening session, and on Friday, at  the two sittings, but the voting goes on. That is to say,  falsification takes place (?in the eyes of) the people.  Strictly speaking I am also involved because I sign the laws  which are adopted. But is there any way out? For example, it  is written in the Constitution that the law, if not signed by me  within 10 days, will come into force anyway.    Secondly, there is no Constitutional Court where I can  appeal and say that I want to consider this or that disputable  issue. They blame me for the fact that the Constitutional Court  was not elected. I was interested in it most of all, and this  is why I had been initiating the election of the Constitutional  Court all the time. But it was difficult to elect it, not only  because there was a split in assessments by people but, again,  because there were no people in the hall. When they were  registering themselves at the tables there was no two-thirds  majority.    I proposed another move when I met the deputies: Let us do  as  they do it throughout the world, for example, half is to be  elected by the president and half is to be elected by you. The  Constitutional Court chairman has been elected and let the  Constitutional Court decide: If the president's decree is  anti-constitutional, the court will say this, if not, the court  will also have its say. For example, if the court did exist a  veto is imposed. What is to be done next? According to the  constitution this veto is to be submitted to the Constitutional  Court for assessment. At present, the veto is imposed but who  will assess it? Nobody. Therefore, the Supreme Council has no  counterbalance that would influence it. For example, there is  no law to revoke a deputy. The Constitutional Court is  nonexistent. The rules are nonexistent.    In general, one can get an impression that the Supreme  Council is both the judge and the legislator all together, in  one organization, as they say. And the president, for example,  has no specific influence. For example, over this period the  Supreme Council has already twice given and taken away plenary  powers from the president. Should I act correspondingly  adequately? There are no regulators, no levers that I have been  talking about. This, well, is for example a very dangerous  thing. And, if you started to talk about these vetoes, then I  understand. I would not like to analyze now whether this veto  was imposed correctly or incorrectly.    But I would like to say one thing, that this is a purely  economic and managerial issue, if we take the issue of the Black  Sea shipping company. And I have dozens of telegrams now, very  serious telegrams because there are hundreds of ships that sail  to all ports. Relevant treaties and agreements with foreign  firms have been concluded. And the veto meant that the  activities of the shipping company was virtually brought to a  halt. One hour spent by a ship, either being unloaded or loaded  in a port, costs thousands of dollars. I would like you to know  this. And I understand that not everybody knew this. But there  were people there who deal with, who know what the sea [word  indistinct] is. So, he came out and said: Esteemed people's  deputies, this is correct but let us first examine the issue.  Let us appoint a commission and then take a decision on veto.    But, you know, our Supreme Council is seriously affected by  one illness: presidentophobia. If the president submits  something, no matter whether it is correct or incorrect, vote it  down, because this was submitted by the president. Somebody  even told me that they say: If you want this to be turned down,  ask Leonid Makarovych to submit it. It will never be adopted.  That is to say, the real, the contents are  substituted...[sentence incomplete] I do not want to say that  this refers to all the deputies. There are some sober-minded,  clever deputies. Quite a few political figures came from the  Supreme Council and more will come, I am sure. But the  situation today is very complicated, extremely complicated and  the president cannot protect himself, what is important, he  cannot, he has no levers to put the Supreme Council in its place  through the Constitutional Court, for example. And the Supreme  Council is able to put the president in his place by means of  voting. Where are equal rights, I wonder? Both the Supreme  Council and the president were elected by the people. But the  president has no regulators that could influence the Supreme  Council. This is dangerous, simply dangerous, the more so that  they vote on their on behalf and on behalf of another person.  They can vote for anything and this just evokes my anxiety.    [Correspondent] Leonid Makarovych, you probably know  better than anybody else that people have gotten tired of price  blows, inflation, and impoverishment. What changes in political  and economic life of our country do you think can give us hope  for the better and realize this hope next year?    [Kravchuk] First, I have already told you about the steps  which have already been taken. Second, I hope that the people  will elect the new Supreme Council; that responsible and  well-prepared people, those who take the cause to heart, will be  elected; that raging passions and debates will give place to  real work; that this Supreme Council will elect the government,  appoint a government which will also consist of new people with  new thinking, creative and responsible people. They have  already come into being in Ukraine over this period.    You know, I already observe this process. Someone in the  government left, but this in no way means that such a person is  incapable of doing anything. There are relevant conditions and  situations. In other words, the idea is that people have  acquired experience and learned a lot over this time, and I hope  we will manage to unite them, to consolidate them under a single  idea, a single theme, a single objective. Thus they will be  able to work and will be of benefit.    I again turn to the fact that in its time the Supreme  Council  failed to adopt a constitution. You know, they have been  working for [word indistinct] years, twice submitted something  to the Supreme Council, but nothing [words indistinct]. And  there is no hope of it being passed by the Supreme Council.  This is why I will make a direct appeal with a legal initiative  to the people, bypassing the Supreme Council, to include the law  on power on the 27 March referendum, in other words, to provide  a constitutional law on power which will determine the system,  the forms of the system, state [word indistinct], regional  autonomy, thereby determining what Ukraine will be like.    For example, I believe we need a parliamentary-presidential  system, that the president as head of the state must exercise  relevant plenary powers. The government, the prime minister  must be head of the executive power and fully responsible for  all executive power, for economic policy, for government  programs, and for their implementation.    The Supreme Council must be a legislative body. That is to  say, there must be a delimitation of powers, as is written in  our Declaration, but no one abides by this so far. And let the  people vote; this will become the basis. It will be easier for  the new Supreme Council to adopt all the rest, because, unless  this is done now, what can the Supreme Council begin with when  it assembles? To work on the basis of the obsolete Constitution  which was patched up plenty of times and from which whole  chapters were excluded? If you read this Constitution you will  find it consists entirely of contradictions.    We have to begin with the constitution, but in the meantime  laws have to be made. The legislative field is such a difficult  one; moreover, it has already been ploughed with government  decrees. To some extent it was changed by the president's  decrees. If, as sometimes happens, the law differs from the  decree, the law may be better than the decree. Which should we  lean on? Some say it is better to rely on the decree, others  say it is better to rely on the law. So, as you see, there are  big problems.    I think I will ask people to show understanding and vote for  themselves. This is their foremost right, the right of a  sovereign people, and when the holder of people's power has made  its decision, no one's hand or tongue will be urging people to  elect this one immediately, re-elect another one, dismiss  someone else, give something to another. Do you see what is  happening? For three or four years we, the Supreme Council,  have either been giving or taking away, changing or adding.  These fundamentals will then be approved by the people and the  Supreme Council will work on the basis of this law. This is a  political question of principle.    If we do this, we will open the way to political and  economic  reforms and to normal functioning of the Supreme Council. So,  if we manage to do this, as I think our people understand, they  will know what is soundly based and what is mere foam. If we  decide this together, we will make a great step forward. I hope  we will do this.    [Correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, the United  Nations declared 1994 the year of the family. Our people know  you not only as the head of state, but also as the head of your  large, close-knit family, and it was very pleasant to meet your  family in the press, magazines, and other publications. What  will be your wishes for the Ukrainian family in 1994 and for the  families of other nationalities living in our land. What new  legislation should we expect in terms of family protection?    [Kravchuk] First of all, I am head of state, my wife is head  of the family. My hands are so full with state concerns that I  am a mere onlooker to what is going on there, and how well it is  going, but I do not interfere in the way things are actually  done. She supervises it herself, an she seems to be doing a  good job.    Second, the family is really not just a number of people, be  it large or small. It is a source of life, a source where the  morals, the nation, and the people are formed. Life is given  there, and from there it takes off, develops, and [word  indistinct] itself. This would not happen without a family. It  is the determining factor.    I know the role played by the woman as mother of the  family. She gives life, she protects it, and she organizes it.  If any man thinks he is the one doing this, he is wrong. If  the woman knows her stuff, she will do it in such a way that he  will think he did it, but in fact his role is not very big. I  can see this in my own family, and in the families of my  friends. I can see how cleverly women do this.    Third, in conditions like ours, our women are using their  (?wisdom), [word indistinct], and skills to solve various  problems, concerning food or whatever. We can only thank our  women for this.    But our family is not just a family circle. Ukraine is a  whole family. It is a huge state with a large number of  nationalities and peoples, a family of people with different  ethnic origins. I would like to take advantage of this question  to wish all people living in Ukraine happiness, good fortune,  and health.    I hope nobody will ever even think of saying anything which  could cause tension in relations between people of different  ethnic origin. I hope they will all be citizens of our united  state, and that they will all be masters of it. To that end, we  will do our best in terms of legislation to make sure that no  person feels inferior or superior to anybody because of their  ethnic background. All are equal, and all will have equal rights  and freedoms.    I would also like to mention that numerous Ukrainians are  living abroad in other states, and that many people of other  nationalities are living here. We have been living together in  the former Soviet Union, and it is clear that the kind of  migration processes still taking place then were a normal fact  of life. I would like to wish them health and say that we have  lived through a very difficult year, a year laden with doubt, a  year of searching. We have been searching within the CIS, there  was something we found, there was something we failed to find,  but that depended not only on ourselves, I mean not only on  Ukraine.    The summit in Ashgabat showed how much we have learned in  forming and upgrading this structure. It is [word indistinct].  Ukraine will do its best to make it work efficiently and  equally for all. As a sovereign state, it requires new  principles and new foundations.    In the next year we must solve the nuclear problem and  everything connected with it, and I think we will succeed in  doing this. I hope we will solve the problem of the Black Sea  Fleet. There is the will to do this. If there is enough good  will in Russia -- and now the United States is getting actively  involved in this effort -- it will help us solve many issues.    I hope that when all this is put together, all this will  guarantee one thing for the family: peace. If you ask, not only  a woman or a mother, but any normal person, they will tell you  that men always want to look a bit braver than they are, and  that leads to pugnacity. Men do have this trait, history knows  it. So, even if you ask them what they want most, what they  always long for, they will tell you they want peace and quiet in  the family, under every roof, within our large state, and in  relations with other states. If we have all this -- and I will  say sincerely that as long as I am president I will do my utmost  to ensure peace in every home, in every house, to prevent  bloodshed in our land -- we will manage everything; we will  build, restore, and take the democratic and law-governed road of  development. This is inevitable, we merely need time. But let  us not destroy that which we have, let us not destroy life.    We will greatly intensify and take new steps to step up the  fight against corruption, crime, and all shameful phenomena now  existing. We are not concealing a single fact referred to in the  Supreme Council or elsewhere. I have instructed the  prosecutor's office to sort this out, and we will show  everything to the people -- both facts and analysis. Those  guilty will made to bear responsibility, while the innocent will  be innocent, and we will not stick labels on them, will not  insult them or brand them as criminals before the verdict of a  prosecutor or a court. (?Do not think that because) you happen  to be a people's deputy you can get away with it.    I think we will get over all these diseases in a way worthy  of our people who are patient, wise, peaceful, and closely  bound, and will do their best to keep it that way. As for  families, I wish them good fortune, health, and happiness,  health to children and grandchildren. I have children and  grandchildren myself and I know how important this is -- when I  hear that my daughter or my grandson is sick, I cannot put it  out of my mind even with the strenuous and difficult job I have.  Whenever I have a free minute I run to the phone to find out  how they are, whether their fever is high or not. That's me,  with my workload. What about other people? Actually the  workload has nothing to do with it, it is a normal thing for a  person to want a clearly determined future, to want its family  to go on and, as they say, to wish that our family will never  become extinct.    I also wish you well, as a woman who has her own family and  wants her family to be healthy, and all those guarding our  family. As for the legislation, it will improve.</p>

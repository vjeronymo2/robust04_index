The comrade secretaries of the party branches and governors  continued their meetings yesterday morning under Dr. Sulayman  Qaddah. The meeting was attended by comrades 'Abd-al-Qadir  Qaddurah, speaker of the People's Assembly; Mahmud al-Zu'bi,  prime minister; members of the Regional Command, the two deputy  prime ministers; some ministers; the chairman of the Party  Control and Inspection Commission; the deputy heads of party  bureaus; the presidents of universities; and the directors of  media institutions.    Comrade Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' presented a review  of  the recent political developments on the Arab and international  levels. He said: The landslides and repercussions resulting  from the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait are still continuing in one form or  another on the regional and international levels.    Al-Shar' added: The world is still going through a  transitional phase full of great challenges after the old  international system has collapsed without being replaced by a  new international order of sound and balanced international  relations. The situation in the Arab homeland has also been  further fragmented as a result of the Gulf War. Inter-Arab  relations are weak and loose, Arab obligations have receded, and  Arab solidarity has deteriorated to a lower level.    Having reviewed the current situation in Iraq, the blockade  imposed on Libya, the events that took place in Somalia, the  regrettable developments in Algeria, and the recent tragic  conflagration in Yemen, Al-Shar' said: These grave developments  and challenges could not have been confronted so wisely and  courageously were it not for the Corrective Movement and the  unique leadership of struggler President Hafiz al-Asad.    Al-Shar' added: The Corrective Movement and its historic  leader are the strongest guarantee and fortification for Arab  Syria in facing the different challenges on the Arab and  international levels. He said: Syria has remained sincere to  its course, loyal to its principles, and its leader President  Hafiz al-Asad has always made the correct and courageous  decisions which express the nation's concerns and legitimate  aspirations and continuously adhere to Arab solidarity and the  common interests and destiny of the Arab nation.    The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's pan-Arab  role in Lebanon and its concern for its unity and national  reconciliation have prevented that country from becoming another  Bosnia or Afghanistan. Al-Shar' said: The wise decision which  was made by the president at the Cairo summit following the  Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had spared the Arabs from an even more  disastrous and dangerous situation. He added: This Syrian Arab  stand greatly reduced the losses and damages and preserved a  minimum level of mutual Arab obligations, at least among the  eight Arab states which signed the Damascus Declaration.    The comrade foreign minister affirmed that during the  occupation of Kuwait, Israel had planned to have a say in Arab  decisions and resources and to normalize its relations with the  Arab Gulf states and other Arab states without withdrawing from  the occupied Arab territories or committing itself to  implementing the UN resolutions relating to the Arab-Israeli  conflict and the Palestine question.    The comrade foreign minister added: The U.S. initiative,  which is based on UN resolutions and international legitimacy  and the principle of land for peace, would not have materialized  in its present form were it not for Syria and the well-known  resolve and wisdom of its leader, as well as the support of the  sincere ones among his Arab brothers who adhered to the  achievement of just and comprehensive peace based on  international legitimacy and the UN resolutions.    The comrade foreign minister reviewed the stages of the  peace  process and its recent developments in light of the continued  U.S. efforts, despite Israel's attempts to place obstacles from  to time on the path of this process. In this regard, comrade  al-Shar' referred to the deportation of more than 400  Palestinians, the Hebron massacre and the acts of murder and  suppression which followed it, the siege on the occupied  territories and Holy Jerusalem, and Israel's continuous  aggressions on Lebanon. He also referred to Israel's desperate  efforts to play down the impact and results of the Geneva summit  between Presidents Hafiz al-Asad and Bill Clinton.    The comrade foreign minister affirmed that Syria's adherence  to its national and pan-Arab principles is neither stubbornness  nor extremism but a sincere expression of its firm desire to  achieve the option which Syria has chosen out of its own free  will in order to achieve just and comprehensive peace which ends  Israeli occupation, guarantees Arab rights, and ensures security  and stability for everyone in the region.    After the comrade foreign minister had replied to all  questions and queries from the comrade participants, the  conferees continued to make their comments on organizational,  educational, and other public issues concerning the citizens.</p>

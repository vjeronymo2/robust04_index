			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F> Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by Nato Oniani in Tbilisi--live]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Good morning. We are presenting a  radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the  Georgian parliament and head of state. Mr. Shevardnadze, I  remember you said during last week's interview that no grave  crime had been committed in the republic for the last 24 hours.  On 20 April, a new terrorist act was committed in Tbilisi, when  Major General Gia Gulua, head of the transport police and a  deputy interior minister, was assassinated.    Do you think this killing could be politically motivated? At  any rate, considering the result, we can say that the event has  created the impression that the authorities are not sufficiently  secure; it has also raised questions as to who will be next and  why all this is being done. A feeling has been created both  within the country and outside that terrorist acts are common in  Georgia. Furthermore, the time has come when it is necessary to  have the investigation brought to completion so that this case  will not remain a common unsolved case of a terrorist act.    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. I already  expressed some of my concerns regarding this case at a meeting  of heads of law enforcement bodies and rayons of the republic  which was shown on Georgian television; those who were  interested were able to hear them then. This is an event that  has given rise to grave concern. [passage omitted]    Of course, I have charged the law enforcement bodies to  solve  the case in the very near future and to ensure that incidents  like this do not happen again. I have said that the bodies  which must fight terrorism and which must aim to reach a  situation where they are able to rule out terrorism as a  phenomenon are still not up to the mark.    This cannot be justified by asserting that Georgia is not an  exception and terrorist acts happen in other countries, too.  This is true. They do happen in other countries, too. But  this could prove disastrous for Georgia. If the world gets an  established image of Georgia as a country where terrorism is a  common occurrence, we will not be able to speak about the  development of a large and serious economy or about the  involvement of big and serious foreign business.    So this is a political issue, and that is why I regard  terrorism as a phenomenon which should be combated with all  possible means. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that  Gia Gulua's assassination was connected with past deeds.  [passage omitted]    Now, are the authorities and senior officials in general  adequately protected? I would say that they must be provided  with the essential minimum. Although I prohibit anything  excessive -- I mean special means and special transport that  require large expenses -- the minimum of what is needed to  protect the authorities should be provided and it has not been  sufficiently provided so far. In any normal country, the  authorities should have guarantees of security. Thus, we have  to draw serious conclusions from what has happened. [passage  omitted]    [Oniani] During your meeting with law enforcement bodies  you spoke about drug addiction. Last week your edict on urgent  measures to enhance the struggle against drug addiction and drug  trafficking was released. According to this edict, a national  bureau to combat drug addiction and drug trafficking has been  established on the basis of a former ministry department with a  similar task. Is it possible that this edict will share the  fate of your previous edict? We are very well aware that no one  has quit his post because of drug addiction; there have been no  cases like this. Do you think it possible to fight against the  phenomenon when, for instance, Irakli Menagharishvili, our  deputy prime minister, said during that meeting that the  narcotics gangs had powerful patrons in the power structures  [Security, Defense, and Interior Ministries and Procurator's  Office]. The population knows everything and is very well aware  of the ways drugs are brought into Georgia, who sells them, and  what bars a supplier has to pass, or rather, whom and how much  he has to pay to bring these drugs into Georgia. Yet another  question, if you permit. Will the law relating to drug  traffickers become stricter? This was also mentioned at your  meeting with law enforcement bodies.    [Shevardnadze] Drug addiction, together with terrorism, must  be considered as the most serious threat to our national  statehood and, I would say, to the whole population -- all  citizens and our future generations. The thing is that Georgia  attracts drugs trafficking by its geographic situation, and will  attract more in future. Regrettably, no guarantees have been  created in the world to restrict the growth of drug trafficking  into an international force. It is not late yet; drug addiction  and drug trafficking have not reached syndicate proportions and  they should never do so. [passage omitted] When drug  trafficking reaches that stage, Georgia will not be able to  afford a fight like this. It will hardly be possible to overcome  the problem later. [passage indistinct]    Thus, paramount importance is attributed to an edict I  signed  recently and structures being established at the moment -- in  particular, a government commission which will be chaired by  Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagharishvili. Working groups  have been established. The same sort of commissions and groups  should be established in rayons and towns. [passage indistinct]  A battle has started. This will be a long and complex battle  and I agree with Deputy Prime Minister Menagharishvili that much  will depend on how we succeed in destroying any kind of support  for drug trafficking within the law enforcement bodies. Playing  with drugs and especially patronizing drug trafficking must be  declared a dreadful crime.    I am for making laws stricter. Of course, parliament will  make the ultimate decision but, if needed, I can use my right of  legislative initiative to speed up drafting laws and to set  conditions for the parliament to create a legal basis for  fighting drug addiction and drug trafficking.    [Oniani] Talks pertaining to the Abkhazian issue continued  last week. How should the results of our activities be seen  today in light of the Moscow meeting in May? Another question:  It was said on television yesterday that we did not capture  Gudauta because Shevardnadze thought that this would result in  the genocide of Abkhazians and psychologically that was not the  aim of the Georgian side. Could you comment on this, because it  is not very explicit?    [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] A meeting in Moscow has  been  arranged for 10 May. Roughly the same parties as in Geneva will  be involved there. The representation may be wider in certain  issues. I would say that if the 10 May Moscow meeting fails to  pass a decisive and serious resolution under the UN aegis,  securing all conditions for a safe return of refugees that would  be acceptable to us, we will be obliged rather than forced to  appeal to the CIS. [passage indistinct]    There is a third version combining the two. According to  this, there will be military forces in accordance with the CIS  summit concept and UN observers. However, this combination  would be more complicated, I suppose. We are rather short of  time and I believe the UN representatives will seriously  consider compressing the time so that the UN accomplishes its  mission. If it does not, we will turn to the CIS and will have  everything done within a CIS framework.    As for the question pertaining to last night's television  program, I can say that the question was asked in such a way as  to imply that Shevardnadze was concerned about danger and so on.  My God, some people enjoy turning inside out 100,000 times what  I have said 10,000 times.    I have explained why all this happened so many times. There  were not even any plans to enter Gudauta, just as there were no  plans to stop in Sukhumi. There were even no plans to enter  Sukhumi. I did not issue an order to enter Sukhumi. This was  an unauthorized action. And now it is being interpreted in a  special way. I think that, having entered Sukhumi, the troops  should not have stopped there. We spent [word indistinct] days  in Sukhumi and no one knows how we spent these days. You all  know that.    Later, after Sukhumi, our troops were in Leselidze,  Gantiadi,  and Gudauta and then the question of joining those troops by  marching from Sukhumi through Gudauta was put forward, but it  was too late. Strong defense lines and covering forces had been  created there. A question was asked whether to enter Gudauta or  not. Then I expressed my opinion, indicating that it would be  wrong to enter Gudauta. There would be heavy casualties. Of  course many thousands of Georgians would be killed but the  Abkhazians who were there would be exterminated. I do not think  anyone can see anything odd in the fact that the head of state  demonstrated certain caution and care about people. We can call  it genocide or simply elimination. This was the case.    But this probably was not the only thing. I am saying this  for the first time. Marching into Gudauta meant a virtually  direct clash between Russian and Georgian Armed Forces. This  was the issue then. [passage omitted] Everyone must realize  that it was not just like that that we could march into Gudauta,  and because we did not do it, we lost everything. But  apparently we have not lost absolutely everything because we did  not go for Gudauta. You are all well aware what a direct clash  with Russia Armed Forces would mean. Everyone knows why it was  like this, what forces were accumulated at Gudauta Bombora  airport and the adjacent territory, how much armament was  concentrated there, and many other things. This is my answer:  we could not act otherwise.    [Oniani] There is no logic in demanding that the government  admit officially that Russia was fighting against us in Abkhazia  on one hand and on claiming that we could capture Gudauta and  did not do so on the other hand, because if Russia fought  against us and Russian forces were involved in it, no one would  give up Gudauta.    [Shevardnadze] This kind of talk has to be stopped, too.  Some say that we have to declare that we were and we still are  in a state of war with Russia. They did not realize then and  fail to realize now what effect this would have. [passage  omitted]    [Oniani] Mr. Shevardnadze, you visited the Tavtavi  agricultural scientific and production organization yesterday  and familiarized yourself with its activities. What are your  impressions?    [Shevardnadze] I spoke yesterday at the meeting attended by  scientists, practical workers, experts, and in the first  instance the staff of Tavtavi and the management of the  organization. [passage omitted] The less we talk about the  country having been ruined and about the country being doomed  and beyond salvation, and the more we think of the available  resources and possibilities which remain unused and which do not  require investing billions, the better.    Here is one concrete example. What can be done by  cultivating soya? No country can survive without fats. We are  importing fat just by grams. We sell 200 grams of margarine a  month to the population and think that this is the height of  delight. But life cannot go on like this. [passage omitted]  Georgia seems to be created for the purpose of cultivating  soya. I said yesterday that in 1905-1910 some 360,000 pounds of  soya was exported from Kutaisi to Japan. We have forgotten all  this.    I returned from my visit very encouraged. The people there  care about production. We have certain foreign credits we can  invest in this business. We can after all buy a factory. We  can conclude a contract with farmers on good and favorable  terms. A possibility will probably be found to pay them in  kind, or in dollars so that they are able to safeguard their  life.    The main thing is that we have to create an owner, a  proprietor, I mean a proprietor in science, in industry, and a  proprietor in breeding this culture. I am deeply convinced that  if we take to this business using all our potential fully, I  mean the scientific potential, an industrial potential and all  our experience, the harvest will be miraculous. [passage omitted]    If we add the production of rape which provides huge  long-term effects, and which also provides a large quantity of  vegetable oil, we will be able to satisfy our own requirements.  The development of cattle production will take a little longer  and we have to search for ways to do this.    Although the meeting could have been held without me, I went  there yesterday to say that we possess huge reserves. [passage  omitted]    [Oniani] The parliamentary majority made a statement last  week about the necessity for drastic economic reforms. During  your speech at the meeting with the law enforcement bodies you  said that the implementation of decisions made in the economic  sphere is essential. Does this mean that a decision has already  been made and really drastic economic reforms will be  implemented in the very near future?    [Shevardnadze] I have long been aware that without drastic  economic reforms the country will not be able to overcome the  crisis and [words indistinct]. But in order to speak seriously  about drastic reforms we needed basic preconditions -- I mean,  we had to prevent the danger of a civil war and help the country  to escape the state of war. Now, we have an opportunity to draw  breath. It has also been necessary to establish basic order.  One can hardly speak of drastic economic reforms without  establishing basic order. At present, this precondition is also  being created. [passage omitted]    For me, a decision on the implementation of drastic economic  reforms already exists. The essence of the activities is to  speed up the process and we are creating grounds to go ahead in  this direction. Drastic measures are necessary for the creation  of [word indistinct] of money. We have had talks on this  subject and I think that by the end of April we will know what  to do and what actions are to be taken to bring the economy into  a relatively healthy state.    A drastic turn is necessary toward ownership. I dream of the  time when every citizen is as proprietor. Every citizen must  have a certain share in the wealth created over hundreds of  years. This may be production or commercial spheres or any  other. [passage omitted]    Drastic measures are also required to create the most  favorable conditions for foreign investments. There is  competition in this field, too. Investments stream down to  countries where the most favorable conditions exist. Conditions  for this can be created by geography, geopolitics, relative  order, and so on, but unless there is a taxation system  stimulating investors to come here, to settle down, and lay firm  grounds for himself in order to help us and gain something for  himself, no large-scale foreign investments will enter Georgia.    Also drastic measures must be taken in the fight against  corruption. I have often spoken about this. Corruption will  nip in the bud any kind of initiative. A proprietor's work will  be made futile if this disease gets into the whole structures of  the huge state institutions and lawenforcement bodies. [passage  omitted]    In concluding our present conversation I would like to say  that we shall be able to come out of the crisis only by drastic  reforms, and the time is ripe for this.

The Iranian National Resistance Council (INRC) said in a  statement that the homes in Iraq of families connected to the  Iraq-based Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) were destroyed in  the attack on Friday.    However the report could not been confirmed by independent  sources.    The KDP, which is the main Kurdish opposition to the Tehran  regime has bases in Kurd areas in northern Iraq, many of them  near the border with Iran.    Mas'ud Rajavi, chairman of the INRC and leader of the  People's Mojahedin [Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization], the main  armed opposition to Tehran based in Iraq, denounced what the  press statement termed a "criminal and terrorist attack".    He called on the UN Security Council to take measures  urgently "to prevent the slaughter of the Iranian people and of  the population of Kurdistan".    The INRC was founded in 1981 and brings together the  People's  Mojahedin and other closely-related Iranian opposition groups.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (14): Strategic vision needs to be restored  -David Buchan notes some handicaps to innovation and efficiency in an impressive R &amp; D establishment The French like to think of themselves as thoroughly modern. They have an impressive array of technical and scientific achievements to their credit - among these, the French-inspired Airbus and Ariane rocket projects, one of the world's biggest military and civil nuclear programmes, the high-speed TGV (train a grand vitesse), and Nobel physics prizes for 1991 and 1992. But can they keep it up? Mr Francois Fillon, the research minister, has voiced doubts in public. He not only complained of rigidities in France's R &amp; D (research and development) establishment which stifle innovation, efficiency and mobility, public laboratories out of touch with industry, insufficient research by the private sector itself, but also declared that 'the state no longer has a strategic vision' about the future of research. This was quite an admission in a country where invention and innovation have been state-led since the 17th century. It could be dismissed as over-dramatisation from a young new minister, seeking to exaggerate a problem to make a name for himself - were it not for two sets of facts. One is the quantity of effort and money that the French government puts into R &amp; D. France rates consistently second among the big industrialised countries: second only to the US in terms of total public funding of all kinds of research (as a share of gross domestic product); second again to the US in public funding of defence research; and second only to Germany in public funding of civil research. But the output, at least in industrial terms, is still disappointing. Of all patents registered in Europe in 1991, 9 per cent were of French origin, 20.4 per cent were German, 24.7 per cent American and 24.4 per cent Japanese. The French state spends about FFrs 80bn a year on R &amp; D, of which FFr 30bn is military and the rest civil, divided about equally between basic research and sectoral programmes. Among the latter, the largest programme is FFr 9bn a year for space (Ariane). Computing/electronics/telecommunications, health/medicine, and agriculture get about FFr 4bn each. Lesser amounts are for research into energy, aeronautics, the environment and manufacturing processes. France has always been a main proponent of European Union R &amp; D programmes, but it does not reap any great financial savings as a result. For instance, France continues to fund R &amp; D into electronic components which are not of sufficiently wide interest to the 12 member states of the EU; only Siemens of Germany and the Franco-Italian company of SGS-Thomson still make mass market semi-conductors in Europe. Mr Fillon sees it as his main job to give clearer direction to the 100,000 researchers who work in public R &amp; D institutes, universities and engineering schools. So he is establishing a 'strategic orientation' committee in his ministry, setting France the goal of matching the research effort of the US, Japan and Germany by the year 2005. But the real problem lies with French industry itself, which spends relatively little on research - with the honourable exceptions of big companies in the aerospace, pharmaceutical, electronic and telecommunication sectors. The upshot is that the state funds 51 per cent of all R &amp; D in France, 49 per cent in the US (because of defence), 35 per cent in Germany and 22 per cent in Japan. Too little R &amp; D is carried out in smaller, middle (as distinct from high) tech companies. Very few researchers in the public laboratories - half of whom are over 45 years old - dream of taking the risk of starting up their own businesses to translate their scientific invention into technical innovation. Changing this bureaucratic culture in research is not something that Mr Fillon will be able to do speedily. But he probably could have done without the recent language law of his fellow minister, Mr Jacques Toubon, responsible for culture. Most of France's scientific community has strongly opposed the Loi Toubon which requires the use of the French language in scientific congresses in France and the publication in French of any work funded by the French state. Most French scientists claim that this ignores the fact that English has become the lingua franca of international science, and that only in English can they let the world know what they have achieved.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / France's ruling parties agree Euro-poll pact The two parties in France's ruling coalition, the Gaullist RPR and the centre-right UDF, yesterday negotiated a common policy platform for this June's European elections, ending the threat of rival electoral lists, which would have split the government of Mr Edouard Balladur. The coalition, which is expected to be approved by the parties' leaders later today, is likely to win up to 40 per cent of the vote, according to opinion polls, making it by far the largest force. The opposition Socialists are expected to take less than 20 per cent in a divided left-wing field. But the coalition has yet to decide who should head their common list, or whether their Euro-MPs will sit in the same political grouping at Strasbourg. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing's UDF has been trying to persuade the RPR to join it in the Christian Democrat grouping known as the European People's Party. Until now, the Gaullists have sat together with Ireland's conservative Fianna Fail party in a separate group, while deputies from the UDF have been split between the Liberal and EPP groups.</p>

			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Tarmac rights News that Tarmac, Britain's largest housebuilder, was asking for Pounds 215m by way of a rights issue came as no surprise whatever to sector analysts, who had been predicting such action for several months. But some specialists sounded unconvinced by the board's plans for the new cash injection, commenting on the group's change of view on the prospects in the domestic housing market. The shares eased by a couple of pence to 145 1/2 p, with some traders maintaining that the stock is overvalued by as much as 20 per cent. Mr Robert Donald at NatWest Securities said that, on his own forecast that earnings per share of 10p are likely in 1995, he would be prepared to pay the 120p price for the rights issue, but not the current price in the stock market. However, the share price ticked up to around 151p in initial response to news of the rights issue, which was understood to be easily underwritten. Mr Mark Hake at Nikko Europe said the market may wait to see if Tarmac overpays for the additions to its land bank for which the fund-raising is intended. After considering the trading statement and rights issue proposals, analysts at UBS are believed to have recommended the stock to clients.</p>

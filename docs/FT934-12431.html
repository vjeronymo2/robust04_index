			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Foreigners will still face uphill task to win orders - It will take more than official good intentions to break open the market THE Japanese government's proposals to open up the construction market to foreign companies may appease US government officials and help to avert sanctions. But it is likely to take more than the formal blessings of Japanese officials for foreign companies to win a greater share of Japan's public procurement construction market. 'If a foreign company really wants to participate in the market they will benefit from the new proposals,' says Mr Akira Rokuhara, executive director of the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, a private institute. He believes they will be able to win contracts in these areas. For a foreign construction company keen to do business as a general contractor in Japan, recruiting the large numbers of experts they would need to undertake general contracting work is no easy task. Such experts are only available at the established Japanese construction companies and without such a skilled workforce with knowledge of the Japanese industry, foreign companies are likely to find it extremely difficult to carry out general contracting work. Meanwhile, the options of acquiring a Japanese company or forming a joint venture with one, providing foreign companies with access to a skilled workforce, are also limited, says Mr Peter Hedges, chief representative of Trafalgar House Corporate Development Tokyo. 'There is a natural inertia and unwillingness to change; unless these companies are being pushed hard by price and political pressure,' they are generally unwilling to enter joint ventures meaningful for the foreign partner, he points out. If the experience of foreign companies in other Japanese markets are any guide, it will also take foreign companies considerable time to build up a reputation for reliability which, in Japan, often counts for more than price competitiveness in winning business. 'Since we use taxpayers' money we must be sure the company is reliable,' an official at the Ministry of Construction explains, in defending the Japanese system of awarding contracts to designated bidders. 'If bids are opened to any company, the danger exists that the work will be of bad quality. There is a trade-off between transparency and reliability.' Mr Rokuhara points out that 'in construction it is not possible easily to compare the end products, as it is in electronics. So a lot depends on whether or not a company is reliable.' But while the government's new guidelines call for 'objective, transparent and publicly stated criteria' in determining a company's reliability, in Japan reliability is more often judged by local reputation than objective standards. US computer companies, for example, in spite of pre-eminence in world markets, face an uphill struggle in the Japanese public procurement market. Japan's construction market, like many others the target of US criticism, is built on a network of relationships developed over a long time. Trafalgar House, for one, is not counting on the new proposals to help it win greater business in Japan. Although the UK company has won large public works contracts internationally, it is not looking to enter the Japanese market as a general contractor. 'We're more concerned with establishing the relationships that will help us build up business,' Mr Hedges says.</p>

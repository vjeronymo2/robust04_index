			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 4 KYODO -- The cabinet of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa formally endorsed on Friday an  inflation-adjusted economic growth target of 2.4 percent for  fiscal 1994. The targeted growth rate, first set forth at a  special cabinet meeting on February 10, is a rebound from the  sluggish 0.2 percent growth envisaged for fiscal 1993 that ends  March 31.    The projection is based on gross domestic product (GDP), the  total value of goods and services produced in a country.    The cabinet also approved projections for key economic  items,  including for government spending and national income.  Government spending is projected to rise 7.8 percent in nominal  terms and 7.5 percent in real terms to 92.7 trillion yen for the  coming fiscal year.    National income is forecast to increase 3.5 percent to 372.8  trillion yen. Corporate earnings are projected to rise 5.4  percent to 60.2 trillion yen, the first increase in six years.</p>

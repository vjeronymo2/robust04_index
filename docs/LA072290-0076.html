			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAR CLUB GETS ITS CASE ON TAPE  </P> <P> A Culver City discount electronics store, stung by a major distributor's  accusations that it was trying to pass off refurbished goods as new, struck  back at its accuser with a sting of its own.  </P> <P> Star Club, a discount shop on Sepulveda Boulevard, has sued Canon USA Inc., the  American distributor of products by Canon, the Japanese maker of photographic,  video and office equipment.  </P> <P> To bolster their contention that authorized Canon dealers were disseminating  what they say are unfounded allegations against Star Club, owner Aviv Mizrahi  and his brother Alon mounted an impromptu sting operation. They posed as  customers at competing stores and, using a floor-model camcorder, videotaped  the proceedings.  </P> <P> One tape they submitted to a judge shows a Canon sales representative repeating  the accusations. On the basis of the tape and other information, the brothers  obtained a Los Angeles Superior Court order last August barring further  dissemination of the allegations made in a letter from a Canon regional sales  manager.  </P> <P> According to court documents and the attorneys involved, it was in July, 1989,  that the Canon manager wrote to several authorized Canon dealers that Star Club  was selling, as new, video cameras that had been refurbished and were not  covered by Canon's U.S. warranty -- allegations that Star Club denies. The  letter, from Glenn Scharaga, video division sales manager for Canon's Western  States region, said this had been discovered from a tracing of camcorder serial  numbers.  </P> <P> "Please advise your customers not to purchase these units (from Star Club),"  which is not an authorized Canon retailer, Scharaga wrote.  </P> <P> When the Mizrahi brothers heard about the letter from comparison-shopping  customers, they went shopping themselves.  </P> <P> Having learned from an advertisement that a Canon sales representative would be  on hand to show off some Canon products, Aviv and Alon Mizrahi went to Audio  Video City in Culver City. As one of the brothers worked a demonstration Canon  camcorder, the other discussed camcorder prices with sales representative Russ  Avisson and mentioned that the same model at Star Club cost "a couple hundred  dollars less" and was backed by a good warranty.  </P> <P> "That's not an authorized dealer, and he's selling open refurbished goods," the  videotape shows Avisson replying. "They (Audio Video City) are not going to  match prices with that. That's like buying a brand new Cadillac and then coming  back and saying, 'I found a Cadillac for half the price, but it's four years  old and it's got 100,000 miles.' "  </P> <P> Avisson referred to a copy of Scharaga's letter that was on display. "Canon  does not even honor (Star Club's) warranty," he told the Mizrahis.  </P> <P> The sting operation was repeated at four other authorized Canon retailers,  three on the Westside and one in the San Fernando Valley, Alon Mizrahi said. In  each shop, Scharaga's letter, framed, was sitting on the sales counter, Mizrahi  said.  </P> <P> Star Club filed its suit seeking unspecified damages in August charging Canon,  Scharaga, Avisson and the authorized dealers with unfair competition, libel,  slander, interference with its business and antitrust violations. A trial is  expected this fall in Los Angeles Superior Court.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Star Club is drumming up attention to its cause. It played the sting  video on big-screen TVs at a news conference earlier this month at the store,  which drew, among others, a Japanese television station and newspaper. Loyal  customers stood by for interviews.  </P> <P> "It's just a publicity stunt," Canon's attorney, Carl W. Shapiro, said of the  news conference.  </P> <P> "I need to clear my name," Aviv Mizrahi said.  </P> <P> Star Club sees the situation as nothing less than a campaign by Canon to  eliminate it as a competitor to Canon's authorized dealers. The 5-year-old  store, which sells below manufacturers' suggested retail prices and will not  quote prices over the telephone, is "a real force in the retail market here,"  Star Club attorney Paul H. Rochmes said.  </P> <P> "If I sell at a volume basis, I believe I will be able to sell at a heck of a  lot less than the manufacturer's (suggested price)," Aviv Mizrahi said in an  interview. "If I would decide to make less profit, it's my business.  </P> <P> "Why would a major Japanese company like Canon pick on me?"  </P> <P> Canon attorney Shapiro insisted that there was no vendetta against Star Club.  Plenty of retailers sell at discount, he noted. Canon believes that "authorized  dealers are able to provide better services and support" to customers, he said.  "But Canon as a company does not go out and attack unauthorized dealers.  </P> <P> "This is an isolated incident by a local sales manager," Shapiro said, and only  when Star Club filed suit did Canon's headquarters learn of Scharaga's letter.  </P> <P> "This is one of those things you don't anticipate happening," Shapiro said.  "Canon would have preferred if (Scharaga) would have checked with someone"  before he sent the letter. The regional sales manager, as well as sales  representative Avisson, have been "counseled," but they remain in their  positions at Canon, Shapiro said.  </P> <P> Scharaga, at Canon's offices in Costa Mesa, declined to comment, other than to  read a statement issued by Canon headquarters in New York: "The employee  involved and the person who wrote the letter acted on information they believed  to be accurate. . . . Without admitting or denying the allegations . . . such  alleged behavior by its employees has never been approved by Canon management  and would never be condoned."  </P> <P> As for the video, Shapiro said, the Star Club representatives "goaded the  people into making statements."  </P> <P> Star Club says its reputation has been sullied, and the lawsuit alleges that  the resulting loss of sales and profits exceeds $25,000.  </P> <P> Although he insisted that sales have suffered at the store, Star Club President  Isaac Ziv declined last week to disclose any sales figures. He said camcorders  account for about one-quarter of the store's business, which also includes  televisions, VCRs, boom boxes, telephone answering machines and stereos.  </P> <P> "Before a person is going to spend $1,000 on a camcorder, he will go and shop  around. And when you shop around in other stores and see such a letter, would  you go to buy at Star Club? We have no idea how many people saw that letter --  hundreds, maybe thousands," Ziv said.  </P> <P> Aviv Mizrahi said: "We'll never, never be able to know how bad it (sales) was  affected."  </P> <P> Canon attorney Shapiro responded, "They haven't come forward with any evidence  of any injury to their business," such as sales figures.  </P> <P> Ziv, who manages the store's day-to-day operations, said that even now, nearly  a year after Canon retracted the letter under court order, "if (we get a call  from a potential customer about) a camcorder, the second question is if that  merchandise is new."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE STAR CLUB STING  </P> <P>  Here are some excerpts from the sting videotape recorded by Star Club owner  Aviv Mizrahi and his brother, Alon.  </P> <P> Alon Mizrahi: What do you mean when you say that if you find a better price  within a month, you can come back?  </P> <P> Russ Avisson, Canon sales representative: Yeah, they guarantee their prices.  </P> <P> Alon Mizrahi: But we found, in Star Club. . . .  </P> <P> Avisson: But that's not an authorized dealer, and he's selling open refurbished  goods. They (authorized dealers) are not going to match prices with that.  That's like buying a brand new Cadillac and then coming back and saying, "I  found a Cadillac for half the price, but it's four years old and it's got  100,000 miles."  </P> <P> Aviv Mizrahi: The guy tells me he has an American warranty.  </P> <P> Avisson: He can tell you whatever he wants to tell you. I don't know what he's  telling you. . . . All it is I know is that we have traced back serial numbers  and we found out that he's selling goods that do not have a United States  warranty, and they are refurbished goods. So it's your choice. . . . But that's  what the factory found out.  </P> <P> Aviv Mizrahi: Give us your best price.  </P> <P> Avisson: Well, it's marked here, $1,299. That's the suggested price. What have  you found so far?  </P> <P> Alon Mizrahi: Star Club was much cheaper.  </P> <P> Avisson: Yeah, but Star Club is not even selling you new goods. So I'm not even  going to consider those guys. . . . He does no warranty. If it's a warranty,  it's his own, because Canon does not even honor his warranty.  </P> <P> Aviv Mizrahi: You're sure?  </P> <P> Avisson: You just read the letter.  </P></p>

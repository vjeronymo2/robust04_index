Governor Shao Qihui gave a  speech, in which he stressed: Leaders at all levels should  realistically change their work style and turn their ideology  and work to implementing all tasks.    This provincial government plenary meeting was an important  meeting held by the provincial government after the convocation  of the second session of the eighth provincial people's  congress. Governor Shao Qihui first relayed the guidelines of  the NPC and CPPCC sessions, the national rural work conference,  the national family planning work conference, the State Council  conference on maintaining social stability, and the State  Council conference on anticorruption work, and relayed the  important directives which leaders of the party Central  Committee and the State Council had given for our work, and  devised specific measures for grasping this year's work.    On agricultural work, Governor Shao said: At present, spring  plowing is now in full swing and wheat sowing is being  successively carried out from the south to the north. All  localities should seize the opportune moment to carry out spring  plowing, rationalize the farming structure, implement the grain  farming plan, and guarantee the farming acreage of beet, flax,  and flue-cured tobacco. It is necessary to extensively raise  production funds, and make tapping potential as the point of  departure. Agricultural loans should be granted in a timely  manner and payments for the purchase of beet, flax, and  flue-cured tobacco should be given to peasants rapidly.  Relevant departments should formulate plans for implementing  reform of the grain purchasing and marketing system and  establishing the risk-taking fund for grain in the province in  line with the central policies. Governments at all levels  should do a good job in publicizing and explaining this system,  and strive to implement the grain tasks in the grass roots and  among peasant households at the earliest possible date.    In referring to social stability work, Governor Shao Qihui  said: At present, our province's social stability work is very  heavy. We must never neglect it. We should regard stabilizing  the enterprise contingents as the priority of social stability  work, realistically guarantee the basic living of the masses of  workers, and solve the problems on delaying the wages of workers  and pension for retired workers. Meanwhile, we should actively  organize workers to provide for and help themselves by engaging  in production, make proper arrangements for settling workers  from enterprises which have declared bankruptcy or be merged  with other enterprises, further attend to helping enterprises  end deficits and increase profits, and fundamentally solve the  problem concerning the unstable ranks of workers. Governments  at all levels should strengthen leadership over the work of  handling people's letters and visits, form a system of  rotationally working in the office for handling letters and  visits, and directly listen to workers' voice and opinions.    Governor Shao stressed: To carry out this work, we make pay  attention to the priorities. This year and for some time to  come, we should regard the industry of precision and intensive  processing of farm and side-line products as a new economic  growing point, designate it as an important task of the  provincial government and governments at all levels, and strive  to yield good results this year. Successfully controlling  commodity prices is also one of the work priorities of the  provincial government. During the past two months, prices rose  quite rapidly in our province. We must conscientiously conduct  a province-wide price inspection, persist in controlling the  prices of commodities that are essential to people's living, pay  great attention to the vegetable basket work, and realistically  implement the system of mayor assuming responsibility.    Governor Shao also said: To grasp this work, we must change  work style. After listing 10 unhealthy trends of leading  cadres, he said: The provincial government has called on  government functionaries at all levels, particularly the leading  cadres, to strengthen study, strive to know the market economic  theory well, and solve problems personally.    Governor Shao stressed at the end of his speech: It is  necessary to deeply, enduringly, and more effectively conduct  anticorruption struggle and continue to place the emphasis of  anticorruption work on grasping three tasks. Leading cadres  should continue to implement the five stipulations on keeping  oneself clean and self-disciplined. This year, we should attach  importance to investigating and handling cases on corruption,  bribery, abusing power to seek personal gain, and violations of  law and discipline involving leading cadres.    Vice Governor Cong Fukui chaired today's meeting. Sun  Kuiwen, Zhou Tienong, Yang Zhihai, Wang Zhongzhang, and Ma  Shujie, and other provincial government leaders, and responsible  persons of various provincial-level organs attended the meeting.  Leaders of various prefectures and cities watched the live  broadcast at their own locality.</p>

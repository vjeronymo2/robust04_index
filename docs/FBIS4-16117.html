			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov held a meeting with  ambassadors accredited to our republic in connection with the  latest intensification of the Armenian attacks. Our colleague  Menzere Sadiqova reports:    [Sadiqova] At a meeting in Baku with the representatives of  the embassies and missions of 15 countries and the UN, as well  international organizations such as the Red Cross and Doctors  Without Borders, Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov gave  a briefing on the extraordinary situation that has emerged at  the fronts. In this context he referred to the Azerbaijan  president's televised address yesterday and touched upon the new  positions set out in that address.    Gasan Gasanov noted that the new wave of powerful Armenian  attacks above all results from the impunity enjoyed by the  Armenian Republic. The countries of the world have so far not  imposed any military, political, economic, or even the least  moral sanctions against the Armenian aggressors, who have been  occupying Azerbaijani territory for the past six years.  Instead, the Armenian Republic receives both arms and  humanitarian assistance from abroad.    The minister pointed out that giving humanitarian assistance  to an aggressor state is an unprecedented event in international  practice. The Armenian Republic is the first state ever to  receive humanitarian assistance from foreign countries while  engaging in military aggression. In an attempt to mislead the  international community, the Armenian leaders often assert that  the war is being waged by Daghlyk-Karabakh [Nagorno-Karabakh].  If so, which country or countries are providing the most modern  weapons, heavy artillery, and fuel to Daghlyk-Karabakh? In  refutation of this duplicitous Armenian policy, the Azerbaijani  foreign minister produced substantial proof. Speaking to the  international community, he firmly condemned attempts by certain  forces to force Azerbaijan to its knees and noted that history  has repeatedly shown that it is not possible to suppress the  people's will.    Noting that foreign countries have adopted a passive stance  toward the aggression of the Armenian Republic and its  occupation of more than 20 percent of Azerbaijani territory,  Gasan Gasanov explained that the intensification of the Armenian  attacks is linked to the end of winter. If we recall the events  of the last three or four years, we see that Armenia has usually  seized Azerbaijani territory between April and September.    In an all-around assessment of the Azerbaijani president's  televised address, Gasan Gasanov once again clarified our  state's peace-loving position regarding the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict. Referring to yesterday's presidential address, he  emphasized that if the war is ended we will unconditionally  guarantee the security of the Armenian population of  Daghlyk-Karabakh.    After Gasanov's statement, the diplomats were invited to ask  questions, but none of them wanted to ask anything or make a  statement, because the situation in our republic is well known  to foreign diplomats.    Relevant documents were distributed to the guests after the  meeting. We hope that these foreign diplomats will report back  to their countries on the issues raised today during the  Azerbaijani foreign minister's meeting with them, and that when  the international community gets this objective information on  the real situation in Azerbaijan it will finally move to  restrain the aggressor Armenian state. For this to happen, the  efforts of the foreign diplomats must coincide with the  political interests of the countries they represent.    Gasan Gasanov held a news conference today on the subjects  discussed at the meeting. He noted that the big powers' failure  to brand Armenia as an aggressor and the free hand given them as  a result has been encouraging the Armenians, who have the  impression that they can achieve their goals sooner if they  occupy more Azerbaijani territory. Having disregarded the  peace-making efforts of prestigious international organizations  and (?various) groups, the Armenians--who usually have military  successes during summer--have now launched a new campaign of  aggression. We must use all our diplomatic means and sanctions  should be implemented to halt the aggressor.    It became obvious at the news conference that the latest  attacks have wreaked destruction in Geranboyskiy and Terterskiy  Rayons; and in addition to the fighters, civilians have also  been harmed.    Gasan Gasanov answered reporters' questions on (?current  affairs). Though there were not many reporters, the news  conference was held in a lively atmosphere.</p>

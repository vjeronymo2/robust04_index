			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: First Chinese flotation on Australian stock market AUSTRALIA and China may have battled for the right to host the 2000 Olympic Games. But yesterday relationships between the two countries struck a more harmonious note, as the first Chinese company was floated on the Australian stock market. Guangdong Corporation (GDC) made its debut on the Australian Stock Exchange at 11am, and watched its shares go to an immediate 27 cents premium over the offer price of 78 cents. At one stage, the shares hit ADollars 1.10, although they later eased back from these levels. Around 9.6m shares had been up for sale, raising ADollars 7.5m (USDollars 4.9m). In Melbourne, Sino Securities International, which underwrote the share issue, claimed that there had been 'interest from the Chinese community, both within Australia and in Asia'. Just over half the investors in the issue had been Australian, calculated Mr Richard Li, managing director, with the balance coming from Singapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong, and elsewhere. To date, the only Chinese listings to occur overseas, outside of Hong Kong, have taken place in New York. In Australia, a handful of Chinese companies - like Brilliance Automotive - have floated over the past year, although the vehicles involved have generally been associated with foreign joint venture companies. GDC, by contrast, is backed by the government of Guangdong Province, the region close to Hong Kong and a relatively prosperous area of China. GDC's ownership structure is complex. Following the flotation, 64 per cent of its equity is held by Guangdong Investment (GI); another 28 per cent by the newly introduced public investors; and 8 per cent by GDC's managing director, Mr Paul Tsui. GI is itself listed in Hong Kong. However, almost half its shares are owned by Guangdong Enterprises (GE) which, in turn, is ultimately controlled by the government of Guangdong Province. The stated aim of both GI and GE is the economic development of Guangdong. GDC, however, has 'normal' commercial objectives. Its main operating business is called Full Arts Metal Works, and was founded by Mr Tsui in 1978. This specialises in supplying 'curtain wall' systems and industrial cladding to construction companies. In the year ended March, GDC had sales of about ADollars 21m, and most of its main 'curtain wall' revenue was derived from Hong Kong. According to the prospectus, GDC would like to reach a point where more than half group sales are sourced in China, with Hong Kong making up the remainder. GDC's operating profit last year was ADollars 2.71m. GDC is no colossus, and the amounts of outside capital sought in the issue were small. However, Mr Li maintains that the decision to list in Australia was at least partly motivated by the fact that trading would be conducted in an Asian time zone, and that the country contains a large Chinese community. Not unnaturally, he hopes that other Chinese companies will follow suit: 'I would expect to see more listed on Western exchanges, and after this, I'd expect more to come to Australia.'</p>

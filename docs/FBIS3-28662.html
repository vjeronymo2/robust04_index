			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 9 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa said Wednesday [9 February] that Japan-U.S. "Framework"  trade talks are deadlocked, showing pessimism on whether a  settlement can be reached before his meeting with U.S. President  Bill Clinton in Washington on Friday. "Everything has come to  an impasse," Hosokawa told reporters when asked about progress  in talks focusing on automobile and auto parts, insurance, and  government procurement of telecommunications and medical  equipment.    Asked whether he will send International Trade and Industry  Minister Hiroshi Kumagai to Washington in a last-minute effort  to break the impasse, Hosokawa said the situation is still  "fluid." He said various moves were possible to break the  impasse, suggesting that Kumagai will go to the United States.    Senior Japanese and U.S. officials met Tuesday in Washington  for yet another round of talks on ways to ensure U.S. access to  the Japanese market, but no agreement was reached.    The biggest stumbling block, Japanese and U.S. officials  said, centers on the issue of "objective criteria" for measuring  if the Japanese market is truly open to imports. The U.S.  Government has demanded that Japan accept a variety of numerical  targets such as import levels to evaluate the openness of its  market to foreign goods.    Hosokawa told reporters Japan's acceptance of such  "objective  criteria" is "impossible," adding that the U.S. is also showing  no sign of softening its stance. The premier made the remarks  after a meeting with Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Finance  Minister Hirohisa Fujii and the trade minister at his official  residence.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Books: Sick with power WHEN ILLNESS STRIKES THE LEADER by Jerrold M Post and Robert S Robins Yale Pounds 19.95, 243 pages A LARGE number of political leaders, whether kings, presidents or prime ministers, have been physically or mentally ill, sometimes both. The problem is how to get rid of them before their illness impairs their judgment. There is, as Jerrold Post and Robert Robins write in this new study, a 'lack of a general theory relating health to political events and of the interdisciplinary training necessary to address this domain'. Happily, the two American academics do not attempt entirely to fill the gap, for it would be impossible outside Utopia to have a panel of experts deciding when someone should cease to lead on grounds of health. For a start, who would rule on the health (or the motives) of the panel? Instead their book should be read as a seriously anecdotal account of madness in great ones. A disconcertingly large number of the case studies turn out to be British. There were not only King George III and Castlereagh, the foreign secretary who killed himself because it was rumoured he was a homosexual. There was also Churchill who, when he returned as prime minister in 1951 at the age of 76, was a 'virtual walking text-book of pathology. He had significant illnesses affecting his heart, brain, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, skin and eyes.' At one stage both Churchill and Eden, his most obvious successor, were incapacitated at the same time and the news was concealed from all but a small number of the cabinet. The Americans have had their problems, too: Woodrow Wilson, F D Roosevelt and John Kennedy, to name but a few, were all in some way impaired. Richard Nixon was in a desperate state in the last period of his presidency and the damage done to Ronald Reagan in the Hinckley assassination attempt was much more serious than was admitted at the time. In France President Pompidou managed generally to conceal his illness until almost the end, though curiously his judgment seems to have been unaffected. Dictators, such as Hitler and Stalin, we know about. No one was powerful enough to advise them to step down, but the authors add interesting points. They argue that if President Hindenburg had not been senile, Hitler might never have become chancellor, and note that when Lenin became ill he tried very hard to prevent Stalin taking over but was too physically weak to press his case. Two leaders who were obliged to give up power by a small group of advisers were Ludwig II, the mad king of Bavaria, and President Bourguiba of Tunisia, but the circumstances are too diverse to allow any conclusions to be drawn. The country that has come closest to devising a constitutional approach is the US, which introduced the 25th amendment after the assassination of President Kennedy. Oddly enough, it has not been directly used in spite of several disabilities since, the White House preferring to act on a more ad hoc basis. Thus the best guidance the authors give to advisers, political or medical, is 'When in doubt, shout]'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Jose Maria Brunet report: "Government Denies Political </F> Responsibility in Roldan Case"]    [Text] Madrid -- The government denies that it has  political responsibilities stemming from Mariano Rubio's conduct  in the handling of his private assets. Prime Minister Felipe  Gonzalez will maintain in the state of the nation debate, which  begins tomorrow, that in the first place the facts must be fully  clarified. To this end there will be two essential mechanisms  -- a parliamentary committee of inquiry and the judiciary's  activity through the government attorney's office and the courts.    This stance is unanimous in the government, although some  ministers believe that the government should have responded  vigorously to the corruption phenomenon much earlier.  <H5>  Mistaken Line </H5>   The mistake, they assert, was not to appoint Rubio as Bank  of  Spain governor or to defend him when the first irregularities in  connection with Ibercorp were attributed to him, but to have  maintained an irresolute political line on the corruption cases.    Various government sources consulted believe that the  previous days' rumors about the possibility that the Rubio  affair, combined with a possible severe electoral setback in  June, could lead to Felipe Gonzalez' resignation, are unfounded.  "It is a possibility that must be completely ruled out," a  member of the government said yesterday, stating that a  resignation of this kind "is not at all in keeping" with  Gonzalez' personality and would not be consistent with his  analysis of the government's proper role against corruption.    Thus the prime minister will open the state of the nation  debate by referring immediately to the Roldan and Rubio cases,  in order to reaffirm the government's commitment against  practices involving the misuse of power for private advantage.  Gonzalez will state that he has undertaken this commitment in  personal terms, as he explained in the campaign that led to the  6 June election.    The government is preparing a set of specific proposals for  the debate, on the basis of the conviction that the essential  thing is to apply the regulations already existing at various  levels in order to ensure the institutions' good functioning or  to suppress, where appropriate, conduct contrary to it. The  government is concerned about the lengthy duration of the penal  proceedings in these cases; hence the idea of introducing more  summary trials in certain cases. However, this conflicts, on  the one hand, with the need not to reduce procedural safeguards,  depending on the type of offense, and, on the other, with the  obvious fact that some proceedings for matters connected with  corruption, such as the investigation into Filesa -- the PSOE's  [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] illegal funding network --  have been under way for two years, with no end in sight.    However, various government sources consulted acknowledge  that the debate will center not on the future, with respect to  what can be done, but on analysis of the episodes that have  emerged over the past few weeks and of the existence or  otherwise of immediate political accountability in this respect.  This discussion, a prominent member of the government asserted  yesterday, "is clearly fraught with subjectivity," because the  concept of political responsibility "is anything but objective."    The government's line of argument against these charges is  to  state that the accusations against Rubio and the issue of  whether these influenced his public activity must be verified.  To this end, the government has set in motion all the machinery  at its disposal, with the aim of dispelling the idea that there  is "impunity" for corruption in Spain.    Last Friday's [15 April] parliamentary session, with the  appearance of Rubio himself, forms part of this line of  argument. Thus it is believed in government and Socialist group  circles that the speech by PSOE spokesman Juan Pedro Hernandez  Molto to the Economy Committee had the virtue of making clear to  the opposition and the public at large the intention to clarify  the matter completely.    Yesterday, Molto himself made statements in which he  asserted, with respect to his speech last Friday, that "the  important thing is that the Socialist group said what it  believed and also what many citizens believe." Molto also said  that in this matter there are no political responsibilities,  just personal responsibilities, since nobody has linked Mariano  Rubio's private actions with his conduct in charge of the Bank  of Spain.    A prominent PSOE Executive Committee member, for his part,  said yesterday that the reaction of the government and the party  to the Rubio affair has been similar to "the massive  administration of drugs to a patient: Now everything depends on  how his organism responds." According to this leader, neither  Felipe Gonzalez nor Carlos Solchaga has political responsibility  for this case. However, he stated that the investigation opened  after the first accusations about Ibercorp must have detected  irregularities on Rubio's part in the handling of his finances.</p>

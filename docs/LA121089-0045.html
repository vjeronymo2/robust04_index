			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 'ICE CURTAIN' BETWEEN ALASKA, SOVIET UNION MELTS  </P> <P> The stern-faced Soviet border guard, his green cap bearing the sword and shield  of the KGB secret police, hammers his stamp on the exit visas of travelers  boarding the twice-weekly jet to Japan.  </P> <P> One passenger pushes an American passport and a tiny blue-and-gold pin shaped  like Alaska across the officer's desk.  </P> <P> "Try it on. It's a souvenir from the other side of the pond," says the grinning  journalist from Alaska, one of 10 reporters and broadcasters touring the  once-closed, forbidding Soviet Far East. "We're neighbors."  </P> <P> Indeed they are.  </P> <P> Hardly a flight arrives in this city of 600,000, close to the Chinese border,  without a delegation of Alaskans intent on business ventures or scientific,  cultural and educational exchanges. Khabarovsk is the military, administrative  and aviation center of the Soviet Far East, and the only city in the region  that is officially open to foreign visitors.  </P> <P> This year hundreds of Alaskans and Soviets have crossed the Bering Strait  between Provideniya on the Chukchi Peninsula and Nome, Alaska, traveling in  skin boats, ships, propeller-driven planes and jetliners. Officials on both  sides say the "ice curtain" that once separated the two superpowers has all but  melted.  </P> <P> "From Cub Scouts to opera singers," says Gina Brelsford, an Alaska official who  oversees exchanges, "they are all visiting the Soviet Far East."  </P> <P> Visits through Alaska's back door to the Soviet Union were eased in September,  when U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister  Eduard A. Shevardnadze signed an agreement allowing visa-free travel across the  Bering Strait for Eskimos of both countries. The accord also established a  six-member border commission to monitor trips by the more than 2,000 Eskimos of  the rival superpowers.  </P> <P> Soviet authorities had closed the border in 1948. It didn't officially reopen  until last year.  </P> <P> Already, a Nome-based airline, Bering Air, is flying round-trip charter flights  between the United States and Provideniya, carrying both dollar-paying  Americans and ruble-paying Soviets.  </P> <P> Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who helped thaw the curtain with the first  "friendship flight" of Eskimos and state officials to the Soviet Far East last  year, is a man with a mission.  </P> <P> "We're the people who are geographically and historically positioned to go into  the Soviet Union and do what we can to bring our two countries together,"  Cowper said. "I want the Russians to see us as something more than a military  target.  </P> <P> "Alaska was owned by czarist Russia and we have a lot of Alaskans who have a  Russian heritage." One of Cowper's ancestors was President Martin van Buren's  ambassador to czarist Russia in 1840.  </P> <P> Not to be discounted, says Cowper, is Alaskans' "natural curiosity. We're  adventuresome and we'd like to help over there if we can. The possibilities are  enormous."  </P> <P> For example:  </P> <P> * Alaska Airlines, a profitable, Seattle-based regional carrier with routes  from Mexico to the Arctic, has applied for an international route to Magadan,  Soviet Union and Khabarovsk.  </P> <P> Alaska fishermen are negotiating several dozen deals, some involving the  exchange of American fish-processing technology for rights to fish Soviet  waters for king crab and salmon.  </P> <P> * An Anchorage, Alaska, businessman, Mead Treadwell, is negotiating a deal to  assemble 6,000 personal computers a year in Magadan, which is officially a  closed, high-security city. The parts would be made in the United States, South  Korea, Japan and Taiwan. With his ruble profits, Treadwell plans to buy Soviet  amethyst, reindeer horn, and beer.  </P> <P> * Alaskan and Soviet scientists have exchanged visits to study, among other  things, polar bears, mining technology and medicine. At least one Russian  doctor has assisted in operations at an Alaska hospital.  </P> <P> * Alaska and Soviet outdoorsmen and women teamed up earlier this year to travel  by skis, dog sled and umiak -- skin boat -- more than 1,200 miles from Anadyr  in the Soviet Far East to Nome.  </P> <P> * Hundreds of Alaska and Soviet schoolchildren have exchanged visits, linking  Anchorage and Nome with Provideniya and Magadan.  </P> <P> * Eskimo village elders from both sides of the Bering Strait have met on U.S.  territory to discuss cultural and family problems.  </P> <P> Executives in Anchorage and Washington, D.C., envision possibilities as varied  as oil and gas exploration on the Soviet side of the Chukchi Sea and a new  maritime cargo route from the American West Coast to Europe, through the Arctic  Ocean, using Soviet icebreakers.  </P> <P> Despite the pace and variety of Alaska-Soviet ties and his enthusiasm for them,  Cowper, and the U.S. State Department, inject a note of caution to American  businessmen.  </P> <P> "Everybody's anxious to do business," says Cowper, "but let's get a couple of  small things together that work, and go from there."  </P></p>

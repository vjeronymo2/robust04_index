			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning </F> Commission, from the "Grasp the Opportunity and Revitalize the  Pillar Industries" column: "Motivate the National Economy To  Improve Its Quality As a Whole"]    [Text] Editor's note: As set forth in the report of the  14th Party Congress, we must "revitalize the engineering and  electronics, petrochemical, automobile, and building industries  to make them become the pillar industries of our national  economy." This is a major strategic decision. In order to let  you have a deeper understanding of the meaning of this decision  as well as the current situation and development prospects of  our country's pillar industries, probe into issues encountered  in developing and revitalizing our country's pillar industries,  and seek solutions, the economic desk of this newspaper and the  Research Office of the State Planning Commission are jointly  opening a special discussion column called "Grasp the  Opportunity and Revitalize the Pillar Industries." We hope you  all will pay attention to it. [end editor's note]    An important change in our country's economic development  strategy for the 1990's is precisely to transform the extensive  type of economic growth into an intensive one, to alter the  current situation of industrial structure with a low level of  processing, technology, and added value, and to speed up  industrial modernization. Revitalizing pillar industries  conforms precisely to this demand. The pillar industries are,  in general, characterized as being technology-intensive and  having a high degree of linkage with other industries and a high  degree of income flexibility. The revitalization of pillar  industries will definitely bring about the development of a  number of interrelated industries and will help upgrade the  overall quality of the national economy.    Revitalizing pillar industries is also a historical demand  in  line with our country's economic development. The high-speed  growth of our country's agriculture and consumables industry in  the 1980's played a vital role in supporting and promoting the  development of the economy as a whole. In the 1990's, we must  continue to advance our economic development to a new stage and  have a new target for economic growth while maintaining the  steady growth of agricultural production. It is the inevitable  trend of economic development to select pillar industries as the  new target for economic growth. Comrade Jiang Zemin once said  that the electronics industry is the multiplier of the national  economy. More national income can be created under the  situation of a nonexistent or limited increase in resources  investment by utilizing electronics technology to transform  traditional industries and to develop high-technology products  that save energy and resources. The electronics, engineering,  automobile, and petrochemical industries have greater growth  potential than other industries, and thus play a greater role in  promoting the national economy. As demonstrated by the  experience of some rising industrialized countries and regions,  during the period of accelerating industrial development, only  when these industries maintain a higher rate of growth can we  advance the process of industrialization and modernization in  giant strides.    The development of production must be in line with the  changes in market demand. As far as consumption demand is  concerned, our people now have adequate food and clothing and  are moving toward having a relatively comfortable life. City  and town dwellers' consumption of food, clothing, and durables  has surpassed the average level of medium-income countries.  However, our per capita consumption in transportation and  communications makes us one of most backward countries in this  area. In the 1990's, with constant economic growth, our  people's standard of living will advance to another new stage.  As consumption demand is becoming more and more diversified,  and the field of consumption is constantly widening, the focus  of consumption will gradually shift from the several major  household appliances in the 1980's to a new generation of  durables, including household communication products, household  computers, houses, and cars. Due to such changes in consumption  demand, the industries producing these commodities are being  urged to speed up their development so that the industrial  structure can adapt itself to changes in the consumption  structure. As far as investment needs are concerned, with  technological progress and the readjustment of the industrial  structure, the demand for engineering and electronics products  of high technical standards will maintain a high growth rate.  In particular, integrated circuits, computers, program-  controlled telephones, and other investment-type electronics  products; cars, aircraft, ships, and other means of transport;  and power-generating equipment, petrochemical facilities,  ethylene, new building materials, and other industries of raw  and processed materials have an extremely huge potential market.    At present, our country's key productive technology for the  auto industry still has hardly any competitive power; with the  huge growth of imports of large electrical engineering equipment  for domestic use, greater and greater foreign trade deficits in  electrical engineering products are being incurred;  petrochemical industrial enterprises lack a large economic scale  without a strong capability for developing high value-added  products, such as refined petrochemical products; and buildings  completed are of low grade and poor benefit. Due to the  existence of these problems, our economy, after linking up with  the international economy, will be at a disadvantage in the  competition. Hence, we must have a sense of urgency and of  crisis in developing the pillar industries.    To develop the pillar industries, we should attach  importance to the role of industrial policy. The development of  pillar industries has a number of prominent characteristics;  that is, it proceeds in a centralized manner and on a large  economic scale, and we cannot follow the beaten path of starting  from primitive competition. All localities cannot "rush  headlong into mass action" and develop these industries at the  same time. The state must work according to the objective law  of economic development, give play to the basic role of the  market in resources distribution, and draw up long- and  medium-term plans to coordinate the overall arrangements.    We must treat the expansion of exports as an important  strategy for developing the pillar industries. As far as the  development level of our countries's pillar industries is  concerned, we still do not have the capability to get into the  international market. Most of our exports are products of low  quality and have low added value, which only represent a small  proportion of international trade. The state must formulate a  policy to focus on bolstering enterprises which possess key  products, which are oriented toward the international market,  which have strong competitive power, and which operate on a  large scale, The state needs to build up a number of key  industrial projects, of a high standard and on a large scale,  for the international market.    Realizing an economy of scale in production and encouraging  competition is an important link in developing the pillar  industries. The scale of production and operation of our  country's pillar industries falls short of international  standards. Overall, the economy of scale has not taken shape.  For example, international automobile production has reached  the level of 2 million per year, whereas our country annual  automobile production amounts to only 250,000. Due to defects  in the system, enterprises in the realms of the pillar  industries scatter and are engaged in production on a small  scale, with a low degree of specialized supply of spare parts  and a small output of low quality. Moreover, the phenomenon of  repeated construction and production is quite serious. To  develop the pillar industries, we must follow the law of large  scale modernized production and insist on organizing our  construction in accordance with the demand of economies of scale.    To develop the pillar industries, we must also properly  handle the relationship between the utilization of foreign  investment and the development of nationality industries. An  important measure for developing the pillar industries is to  introduce foreign investment and technology with an emphasis on  enhancing our capability of self- reliance. After all, the  markets for automobiles, household appliances, and other  products in China should be filled with Chinese commodities. We  should group outstanding talent together and strive to digest,  assimilate, and innovate the technology that is introduced. We  must move to the path of independent study and self-development  as soon as possible on the basis of introducing technology from  the outside, running joint ventures, and cooperating with  foreign investors.    Making small profits with quick turnover should be an  important principle of the development of our country's pillar  industries. The prices of many mechanical and electronics  products in our country are currently higher than those in the  international market. It is true that costs are high, but the  profit rate is also high, and this is one of the reasons behind  blind and repeated construction. We must form a mechanism  whereby prices are determined by the market through  consolidating market competition, draw up a consumption policy  in line with the new stage of economic development, abolish  various unreasonable charges, and develop production while  meeting market needs.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: US West set to enter cable TV with Atlanta purchases US West, one of the six US regional telephone companies, yesterday appeared poised to become the first Baby Bell to enter the US cable television business, after agreeing to buy two Atlanta-based cable systems for Dollars 1.2bn in cash and shares. It has agreed to buy Wometco and Georgia Cable Television from the privately-held Robert M. Bass group, and plans to use them to provide 466,000 households in metropolitan Atlanta with interactive information and entertainment services. US West said the price it was paying - Dollars 490m in US West stock, Dollars 160m in assumption of debt, and the balance in cash - was equivalent to 11.1 times the systems' annualised fourth-quarter cashflow. The acquisition comes amid a whirlwind of activity by US media groups, as they scramble for positions in the fast-developing US communications industry. Earlier this week, Comcast, one of the biggest US cable television companies, overthrew a planned merger between QVC, the home-shopping channel, and CBS, the broadcast television network, by launching its own Dollars 2.2bn bid for QVC. Yesterday's agreement marks the third attempt by a Baby Bell to move into the cable television business. Bell Atlantic tried to take over Tele-Communications Inc, and Southwestern Bell had planned a joint venture with Cox Enterprises, but both deals collapsed earlier this year. Two weeks ago Bell Atlantic won regulatory approval for an alternative strategy: competing head-on with cable television companies by providing interactive television services over its telephone wires. US West has already entered the cable television industry in the UK, where it has a joint venture with Tele-Communications Inc which provides cable and telephone services in 16 owned and eight affiliated franchise areas. In the US, US West has a 25.51 per cent stake in Time Warner Entertainment, the cable-television division of the Time Warner media group. The two are working in partnership to speed development of so-called full service networks in the areas they serve.</p>

Baysa] </F>   [Text] The AFP [Armed Forces of the Philippines] Civil  Relations Service (CRS) yesterday revealed the propaganda war  between two rival factions in the underground movement.    The CRS said the word war is raging between the Stalinist  and  the breakaway revisionist blocs. The Stalinist group is  reportedly controlled by Jose Ma. Sison, self-exiled Communist  Party of the Philippines (CPP) chairman.    The CRS said based on seized CPP documents, the Stalinist  bloc has intensified a re-education and indoctrination campaign  to counter the headway by the other faction.    Sison's followers accused members of the rival faction of  involving themselves with "the bourgeoisie proletariat" instead  of aligning with peasant workers and masses in the countryside.    They assailed the tendency of the revisionists to sympathize  with the economic policies of President Ramos as "tantamount to  the alliance with the government."    In the Southern Tagalog Region, the tug-of-war shows the  extent of the schism in the communist movement, the CRS added.</p>

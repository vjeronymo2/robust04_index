			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to survive the seven-year hitch / Investigation into the measures you can take to reduce liability to inheritance tax This month's British Budget, with its relaxation of rules governing inheritance tax, has made it easier for the next generation to prevent all that it inherits in a family business from dissolving in the tax man's grasp. Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, raised the threshold at which inheritance tax comes into force and increased the reliefs on business assets to take an estimated 900 businesses out of the tax net entirely in 1992-93, while lightening the burden on a further 1,600. However, the imminence of a general election and the prospect of a Labour government installing a less accommodating tax regime mean that business owners should act fast to make the best use of existing tax rules, tax specialists advise. 'It does not bring the Inland Revenue a lot of money but it can still be important for the individual company if the owner dies young or unexpectedly,' says Mavis Sargent, a tax partner at accountants Moore Stephens. The problem with planning for inheritance tax is that forces the business owner to accept his or her own mortality, says David Bowes, a consultant with accountants Grant Thornton. 'People don't think about it until they are near retirement or they have a serious illness. They should do it much earlier.' Bowes cites the case of a businessman, a widower with children, who died in his 50s. He had made no plans to reduce his exposure to inheritance tax so his children arranged to pay it off over 10 years from dividends. When the family business ran into a difficult patch and was unable to pay any dividends, the children were forced to sell it to pay the tax. But because the business was not doing well, they sold it for much less than they would have achieved in more buoyant times. So how should the business owner set about avoiding inheritance tax? A popular way of reducing exposure to the tax is to make a lifetime gift (in tax jargon, a 'potentially exempt transfer'). If the individual making the transfer subsequently lives for seven years, there is no inheritance tax to pay. Dying within seven years triggers a tax liability on a tapering scale. The business owner could make an outright gift of shares but this can bring problems: the children may be too young to take responsibility for the business; someone else may gain control of the shares; or the owner may not yet want to cede voting control over the shares. The answer may be to set up a trust. This puts the shares into safe hands and the trustees may include the owner and spouse. Trusts conjure up images of offshore tax havens, brass name plates and shady lawyers but the reality is more prosaic. The Inland Revenue calculated last year that there are about 260,000 trusts in existence in the UK. Most are fairly small and only 4 per cent had an income of more than Pounds 25,000. A simple, standardised trust document could be pulled off a solicitor's word-processor for Pounds 200 but a custom-made trust for a family business would cost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000 in solicitors fees - less outside London, says Mark Buzzoni, a partner at solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett. Drawing up a trust deed could be completed within a week to 10 days with much of the time taken up gathering information on the business and family background. Many trusts become dormant once they have been established and there will be no administration costs until the time comes to take action under the trust's terms. But if regular dividends are paid or investments are reshuffled, there will be fees to pay to solicitors or accountants. A trust allows an individual (the settlor) to retain control of his assets but it also imposes limits. The settlor cannot draw dividends from shares put into the trust, though his wife can. Nor can the settlor get back the assets he put into the trust if it is unwound. He cannot, for example, force his children to return any shares he has given them through the trust. 'You give up ownership of the shares and any rights to benefit for ever,' says Buzzoni. Creating a trust should be left to a lawyer but there are points the family owner should watch out for: Do not start shifting assets around and making promises to your heirs before taking legal advice. One business owner decided to put some land and shares into a trust. He made the mistake of transferring the shares into the trust  -so he no longer had a controlling stake - before transferring the land. Since he no longer controlled the company when the land was transferred, he was unable to claim the inheritance tax relief on the land. By reversing the transactions, he would have saved his heirs a lot of money. Make sure that the other shareholders are aware of what you are doing. Gifting shares into a trust may trigger their pre-emption rights and a dissident shareholder could create problems. Remember that there is a 'tension' between the rules of inheritance tax, which argue in favour of making a lifetime gift, and those governing capital gains tax. The latter suggest it makes more sense to do nothing because capital gains are 'washed out' on death. Take out life assurance to meet any expected inheritance tax liability. However, it may be difficult to judge how much cover is required because the Revenue may not accept your valuation of the asset and you may not know the tax rate which will apply. Tax advisers do not expect all these tax breaks to remain in place if a Labour government comes to power though it is unlikely that Labour would make its legislation retroactive. This, coupled with the fact that share values are low in the depths of the recession (tax is calculated on the value of the assets at the time of the transfer) mean it makes sense to take action before April 9, advisers suggest. But even if the Conservatives are returned to power, there is every prospect they will take a hard look at the taxation of trusts. In the past two years, the government has tightened up the rules governing offshore trusts while a recent government consultative paper questioned whether trusts should be taxed differently from individuals. The tax rules which affect the transfer of business assets from one generation to the next have an important impact on the health of family businesses. With an estimated 75 per cent of all UK companies under family control, the overall economic impact is considerable.          THE MAIN BUDGET PROPOSALS* FOR INHERITANCE TAX Raising the tax threshold from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000 increasing the higher rate of relief from 50 percent to 100 percent for: Interests in unincorporated business Holdings of more than 25 percent in unquoted and USM companies increasing the lower rate of relief from 30 percent to 50 percent for: Controlling holdings in fully quoted companies Holdings of 25 percent or less in unquoted and USM companies *Theses proposals were not included in the abbreviated Finance Act although the tax threshold will increase to Pounds 147,000 on the basis of automatic indexation</p>

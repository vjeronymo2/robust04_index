			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / International Company News: MGM cuts first-quarter losses METRO-Goldwyn-Mayer, the Hollywood studio taken over by Credit Lyonnais, its French bank creditor, has reported reduced first-quarter losses. Net losses were Dollars 51.21m, against Dollars 87.4m a year earlier, on lower revenues of Dollars 196m compared with Dollars 298.9m. The net losses include extraordinary losses of Dollars 9.83m on repurchases of debt during the quarter. As a result the company anticipates lower interest costs in future. Last year's first-quarter results included a one-off charge of Dollars 33m related to changes in accounting for income tax. MGM said the latest results reflected a fall in feature film revenues due to quarter-to-quarter differences in the timing of theatrical releases and availability of products for home video and pay television markets. Revenues in the feature films and television programming operations dropped to Dollars 149.2m from Dollars 243.5m. Theatre revenues fell to Dollars 46.87m from Dollars 55.37m, mainly due to currency fluctuations. MGM said theatre operations remained profitable and investment in multiplex theatres in Europe would continue. Mr Alan Ladd and Mr Dennis Stanfill, co-chairmen, said the company had 'accelerated MGM's development and production activities with the support of Credit Lyonnais'. They indicated, however, that these increased activities would not be immediately reflected in the company's results, due to the long lead times for development and production of feature films. Tele-Communications (TCI), the largest operator of cable TV systems in the US, has announced a Dollars 53,000 after-tax profit for the three months to end-March. The figure compares with an Dollars 18,000 loss in the same period of 1992, writes Nikki Tait in New York. Revenues rose from Dollars 856m to Dollars 1.02bn, and per-share earnings stood at 11 cents, up from a loss of five cents in the first quarter of 1992.</p>

According to the vice president, North Korea's reluctance to  join the nonproliferation movement is one such danger. The  Christian Democratic International has always aimed and  continues to aim to make the treaty on the renunciation of  possession, testing and use of nuclear weapons in definite and  encourage as many countries as possible to join it.    The congress, which is being attended by delegates from 18  countries of Europe, Asia and Africa, will discuss, during its  three days of work, problems of dialogue between different  denominations of Christianity, Buddhism and Islam, plans for the  expansion of activity of Christian Democrats in African and  Commonwealth countries and specify the conceptual framework for  the development of the organisation after the disintegration of  the socialist camp in Eastern Europe.</p>

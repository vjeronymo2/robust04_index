			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 30 May, (BIZNESS-TASS) -- "The possibility  of a change in the macroeconomic situation in Russia is  emerging," Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said today  in the Russian Federation Government at a meeting of heads of  administrations. The Constitution itself and a package of  presidential economic decrees signed last week are the  legislative preconditions for that.    "The crisis has reached its peak", V. Chernomyrdin pointed  out. Ensuring that the economic situation finally goes in the  direction of getting better, that is, implementing the reforms  in the production sphere is what should become the task for the  government in 1995-1997. But the basis for this has already  been prepared. This is shown by the figures of the dynamics in  the rise of production, and the stabilization of the ruble (in  particular, the steady fall of the inflation rate and a  reduction in the Central Bank's refinancing interest rates), the  prime minister said.    According to V. Chernomyrdin, the Russian regions have  always  been the moving force behind the reforms. That is why today's  meeting with the heads of administrations was devoted to  examining such issues as designing measures for the final stage  of the vouchers' privatization process, discussing the program  for the privatization of state and municipal enterprises after 1  July 1994 and the examination of the new Russian Federation Land  Code. As is known, the heads of oblast and kray administrations  took part in drawing up these documents together with experts  from ministries and departments.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Kidder Peabody dismisses senior options trader Kidder Peabody, the US investment bank which dismissed its top US bond trader in April, accusing him of faking Dollars 350m in profit, faces further embarrassment following the revelation that it has fired a senior London options trader for allegedly concealing about Dollars 6m in losses. Mr Peter Bryant, 34, a senior vice-president of the company's futures and options operations in London, is alleged to have hidden losses, incurred during recent bond market volatility, on trades of French and Spanish government bond options. Mr Bryant denies the allegation. Company officials said yesterday the concealment was discovered last month during normal review procedures. The sacking raises fresh questions about the effectiveness of the way the company monitors the activities of its traders. 'The normal controls worked well,' said Mr Tony Zehnder, director of public relations at Kidder Peabody in New York. He stressed that Mr Bryant's dismissal was unrelated to the sacking in April of Mr Joseph Jett, the head of Kidder's government bond trading desk in New York, for allegedly conjuring up Dollars 350m of fictitious profits through his bond trading activities to mask losses of as much as Dollars 100m. Mr Jett has since hit back, suggesting senior Kidder executives were aware of his trading strategy and saying he is being made a scapegoat. The case is in arbitration. Soon after firing Mr Jett, Kidder, a unit of General Electric, dismissed Mr Neil Margolin, a trader on its interest rate swaps desk in New York, for concealing about Dollars 10m in losses from derivatives trades. As a result of Mr Bryant's alleged concealment, the company will make a Dollars 10m write-down against pre-tax profits, of which Dollars 6m is directly attributable to Mr Bryant's activities, it said. The remaining Dollars 4m is due to a change in the way it prices its options positions. The volatility in European bond markets, blamed for the losses, has led Kidder to cut its options positions by about 35 per cent in the past week alone. Officials said this year the company has cut its options portfolio to about Dollars 3.3bn from more than Dollars 6bn. Mr Bryant joined Kidder in 1986, from Lazard Freres. He was the company's leading futures and options salesman in London for several years and earlier this year was promoted to his position as senior vice-president.</p>

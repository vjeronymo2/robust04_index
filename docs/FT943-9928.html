			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Ciba's genetically engineered wheat is first in field The world's first experimental crop of genetically engineered wheat has been harvested from a field in the UK. The success of the trial, carried out by Swiss-owned Ciba Seeds in Cambridgeshire in the east of England, has enormous implications for agriculture. It shows that scientists can alter the characteristics of important cereals in a reliable way, by giving them genes from other species. The work is expected to lead within a few years to new wheat varieties with increased resistance to drought and disease, less requirement for expensive fertilisers, and other improvements. Although Ciba was first into the field, several other industrial and academic laboratories are close behind, including Zeneca Seeds, the John Innes Centre and the Institute of Arable Crops Research in the UK. The wheat grown at Great Abington, Cambridgeshire, contains 'marker genes' of no commercial significance, chosen to prove that foreign genetic material, DNA, can be passed on predictably from one generation of plants to the next. Some of the plants contained a red pigment gene taken from wild Peruvian maize. When they were harvested last week, all their grains showed red spots  -looking unlike any wheat grown on Earth before. The other plants produced bacterial enzymes which the Ciba scientists detected in simple lab tests, proving that the new genes were switched on success-fully. Mr David Thompson, head of research at Ciba's cereal breeding business, said the 16 square metre trial plot yielded several kilograms of genetically engineered wheat. The crop has been flown to the company's US research centre in North Carolina for further analysis. The strains were created last year in North Carolina, by shooting thousands of microscopic gold balls coated with DNA into wheat cells. Ciba scientists then grew two generations of plants in greenhouses before sending the seed to Cambridgeshire for the field trial. The UK was chosen because of the country's expertise in wheat breeding and because Ciba sees Europe as the first market for its genetically engineered wheat.</p>

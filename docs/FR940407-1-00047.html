The expected growth rate of dividends is also commonly based upon the growth rates published by professional investment services, since investor expectations are the desired quantities in the DCF model, and investors' growth anticipations are based in part upon the projections of such services. Growth forecasts of dividends per share, earnings per share, and book value per share are published by several services, including Value Line Publishing, Inc. (``Value Line''), and the Institutional Brokers Estimation Service (``IBES''). Such growth rates are published on a regular basis, usually for five-year periods, and are readily available to investors. Expert witnesses usually develop a consensus forecast by averaging the forecasts of the professional analysts, and use this average in calculating ``g.'' The Commission's proposed rule similarly specifies that ``g'' will be measured by using the average of: (1) The five-year dividend, earnings, and book value forecasts published by Value Line, and of (2) the five-year earnings forecast published by IBES. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> IBES produces a consensus forecast of earnings based on the individual predictions of virtually every major brokerage house. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) The Sustainable Growth Rate. The third technique used to estimate ``g,'' known alternately as the ``sustainable growth,'' ``retention ratio,'' or ``plowback'' method, is to multiply the proportion of earnings expected to be retained by the company, ``b,'' by the expected return on book equity, ROE. The relationship is expressed algebraically as g=(b)(ROE). The theoretical underpinning for the method is that future growth in dividends for existing equity can only occur if a portion of the overall return to investors is plowed back into the firm rather than being paid out as dividends. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To illustrate the sustainable growth rate method, assume that a hypothetical regulated company is expected to retain 75 percent of its earnings, and is expected to earn a 10 percent return on book equity. The company's sustainable growth rate estimate of ``g'' is: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> g=.75(.10) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> =.075 or 7.5 percent. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Both historical and projected values of ``b'' and ROE are used to estimate ``g.'' Projected values are regarded as superior, however, since forecasted values incorporate current and predicted changes into the values. In addition, the use of historical realized book returns on equity in estimating ROE has been criticized because the realized returns are the product of the regulatory process itself, and are also subject to tests of reasonableness. Therefore, the Commission's proposed rule requires that the forecasted values of ``b'' and ROE published by Value Line be used in implementing the sustainable growth method. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 01 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

Brady, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. The loan will  be issued to back up a $4-billion credit to be extended jointly by the  International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the newspaper said. Mexico,  with external debt estimated at $100 billion, will be the first indebted nation  to receive aid under the Brady plan. Japan also will offer a substantial loan  to the Philippines, whose external debt is estimated at about $28 billion, the  newspaper said.  </P></p>

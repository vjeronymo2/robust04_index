			<p>920520 FT  20 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lib Dems press on environment THE Liberal Democrats yesterday called on Mr John Major to apply 'all his international negotiating skills to the full' at next month's Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro, Ralph Atkins writes. The party also launched a cross-party appeal for a Commons debate beforehand. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said preparatory negotiations for the summit had gone in the wrong direction. He proposed stabilising carbon dioxide emissions at 1990 levels by 1995, increasing resources for family planning in developing countries and 'Red Cross' style immunity for those engaged in environmental clean-up operations.</p>

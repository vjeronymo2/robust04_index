			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BE PRO-FACTS, PLEASE  </P> <P> As an ardently pro-life Republican, I feel disenfranchised by the results of  the election in the 76th Assembly District on Aug. 8 and angered by the news  coverage of the election ("Pro-Choice Forces Take Credit for Victory in 76th,"  Aug. 10). I voted for candidate Dennis Koolhaas because he was an excellent,  experienced candidate and pro-life.  </P> <P> He and the other pro-life Republicans captured 57.8% of the vote, yet the news  media continue to report the victory of Tricia Hunter as a pro-choice victory.  True, two pro-choice candidates won, but if this election is to be treated as a  referendum on the abortion issue, why do the Los Angeles Times and other news  media ignore their own statistics, which show 57.8% for pro-life candidates to  40.3% for pro-choice candidates?  </P> <P> The peculiar nature of the race, which allowed crossover voting, further  muddies the issue. Republicans in the district are left to choose between two  pro-choice candidates, both largely selected by Democratic voters. Democrats  urged Democrats to vote for Tricia Hunter. Thus the large majority of  Republicans who voted for pro-life candidates are effectively left with no  choice in the October election. But at least report the significance of the  statistics correctly.  </P> <P> W. ROBERT GODFREY  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

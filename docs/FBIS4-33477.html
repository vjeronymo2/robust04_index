			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, June 7, IRNA -- President Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani here Tuesday expressed optimism over further  improvement in the international oil market in the current  calendar year. The president was speaking at a press conference  this morning with the participation of over 100 local and  foreign reporters and cameramen.    "It seems that situation in the oil market would further  improve this year," the president replied to a question.    On the impact of the recent visit to Iran of a group of  American editors on Tehran-Washington relations, the president  said: "Such a visit could have no impact on the relations but  could shed further light on some of the realities for the  American people."    As for Iran's view over the policy the British Government  has  adopted in former Yugoslavia, Hashemi-Rafsanjani told the  reporters that there were evidences proving that Britain did not  cooperate well to repel the Serbs aggressions.    Commenting on [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia leader]  Zhirinovskiy's statement that Russia should dominate its  southern neighboring countries including Iran, President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said: "The Islamic Republic of Iran considers  such statements as the viewpoints of an irresponsible individual  and attaches no value to such words."    In reply to a question on situation in Iraq the president  noted: "We had repeatedly condemned Iraqi aggressions in the  past and believe that the Ba'th Party has treated the Iraqi  people improperly. On the other hand, we believe that Saudi  Arabia's measures claimed to be for the salvation of Iraqi  people is not proper."    On the export of the Islamic revolution, the president said  that the issue of the export of revolution has never been  raised. "We have said that we would elucidate our ideology and  those inhezed [as received] could accept it. We will employ all  our potentials for the developmenf our country."    As for the future of Tehran-London ties, given the British  bugging of the Iranian embassy, the president said that the  outcome of Britain's illegal measure is mistrust in bilateral  relations and we do not want to see such an atmosphere of  mistrust prvail on our reations with other countries.    On fluctuations in foreign currency rates,  Hashemi-Rafsanjani  said measures were underway to adjust supply and demand in order  to approach the single parity rate. He predicted that the  actual foreign currency rate will appear in the coming months  which he said would be lower than the current rates.    In reply to a question on the probable amendment of the  Constitution to facilitate his re-election at the end of the  presidential tenure, the president said he would rather prefer  no change in the Constitution. "If I perform my duties properly  within these eight years, I think there will be no need for  re-electing me," he added.    On foreign investment in Iran President Hashemi-Rafsanjani  said that there was no restriction on the investment of foreign  countries within the framework of the Islamic Republic  Constitution.    As for foreign minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati's participation  in the Cairo Non-aligned Movement ministerial session, the  president said that the visit did not imply a change in Iran's  Middle East policy and Velayati's presence in Egypt was only for  attending the meeting.    On Iran's cooperation with Central Asian republics despite  U.S. hindrances, he said the areas of cooperation were so  natural and vast that no one could stop it. However, he added,  dimensions of cooperation might shrink due to foreign pressures,  but, it should be noted that Iran and Central Asian region were  complementary to each other and none could deny it. He also  noted that Iran was determined to boost its cooperation with  Asian countries. Cooperation within the framework of the  Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) as well as bilateral  cooperation with India and Malaysia were expanding, he said.    The president added that tripartite cooperation among Iran,  Pakistan and India could lead to the formation of a great  economic grouping in the region and in order to achieve this  objective, the Indo-Pak differences should be settled.    On assassination of Iranian dissidents in some European  countries, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that the alleged involvement  of Iranian officials in the killing of Iranian dissidents abroad  is an unfounded allegation, adding that "we think that the  killings are the result of inter-group rivalries". He  underlined that Iran's policy is not to eliminate the dissidents  but to encourage them to embrace Islam and return to their own  country.    Commenting on the prospect of Iran-Egypt relations, the  president said: "We believe that by signing the Camp David  Accord, Egypt created a gulf among the anti-Zionist Muslim and  Arab countries. Nevertheless we consider Egypt as a great  Islamic country and welcome conditions enabling us to resume  relations with that country."    In response to a question on Tehran-London relations,  Hashemi-Rafsanjani said that there was no need to cut off  relations, the two countries once witnessed the break-off of the  relations and found out that it could not change anything. The  relations, even though at a low level, should exist, we only  react to any inappropriate action on their part, he added.    On Iran-U.S. trade relations, the president said that Iran  has never broken off its trade relations with the U.S. "As for  diplomatic relations with the U.S., we believe that the U.S.  lacks goodwill and it has not taken a proper position during the  post revolution era. The Americans are for dialogue but we  think it will not be in our interest to start negotiations," he  said. "If U.S. officials have good intentions, they should  first release Iran's frozen assets," the president said.    The two countries have a broad trade cooperation, he  reiterated, adding "a great deal of our military equipment is  made in the U.S. and therefore we cannot throw away such a great  national asset."    "We showed our goodwill by helping secure the release of  American hostages in Lebanon but the Washington government did  not keep its promise of releasing our frozen assets. This  caused us to lose our trust in them," Hashemi-Rafsanjani said.    In reply to a question as to reasons for inviting American  editors to Iran, the president said that not all writers should  be considered agents of the global arrogance. There are  freedom-loving people working in foreign mass media who write  the truth, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said. He added that considering  anti-Iranian propaganda in the U.S., the invitation of American  journalists was a positive measure.    On claims of human rights abuses in Iran raised by the  global  arrogance, the president said that human rights were routinely  violated in the West but "they (Western countries) are making  hue and cry over the issue because their propaganda machine is  stronger than ours."    "I openly declare that human rights are observed in the  Islamic Republic better than in any other parts of the world and  we are ready to debate with anybody who claims otherwise," he  said.    Commenting on planned negotiations in tehran between  belligerent parties in Tajikistan, Hashemi-Rafsanjani noted that  the war was not in the interest of either Tajik government or  people. He added that Iran would try to restore peace to that  country in cooperation with the parties involved. On Iran's  mediation efforts in Azerbaijan-Armenia dispute, he stressed  that "although the mediation efforts have not been successful  yet, we have not been disappointed."    The continuation of conflict will not benefit either  Armenia,  Azerbaijan or Karabakh, the president said, adding that Iran  intended to launch new efforts to establish peace in the region.    In response to a question as to whether or not an Israeli  pilot was held in Iran, he said for sure no Israeli pilot was in  Iran. By raising such allegations, the Zionist regime is trying  to cover up the kidnapping of four Iranians in Lebanon, the  president said. The Westerners should not view the issue from  their own self-interested perspective but should also be  sensitive to the abduction of the four Iranians.    On the claim of the United Arab Emirates on the three  Iranian  islands in the Persian Gulf, the president warned "the United  Arab Emirates will gain nothing from such claims and they have  to cross a sea of blood in order to reach these islands."  However, Hashemi-Rafsanjani voiced Iran's readiness to  negotiate with UAE officials on the issue.    On Iran's stance on the current crisis in Yemen, the  president said Iran was against the partition of Yemen,  believing that Yemen should remain united.    He stressed that Iran was not after nuclear weapons, saying  that this has been confirmed by inspectors of the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) who regularly visited Iran.  Hashemi-Rafsanjani added that "Iran is not for proliferation of  nuclear arms but is for the nuclear disarmament of all  countries. Every and each country should try to eliminate  atomic weapons."    On the Middle East peace talks, Hashemi-Rafsanjani said  "what  is going on now is not peace because during the negotiations the  rights of the Palestinian nation are denied." He reiterated  that Iran was not going to interfere in the ongoing negotiations  between Arabs and the Zionist regime.</p>

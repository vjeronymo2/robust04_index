			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Mikhail Zheglov: </F> "Turkey's Defense Minister Has Arrived in Moscow"]    [Text] On 20 April Minister of Defense of the Republic of  Turkey Mehmet Gelhan arrived in Moscow on an official visit.    As is the custom in the West, the 65-year-old Gelhan is not  a  professional military man but a politician. He was one of the  founders of the ruling Correct Way Party in Turkey. Prior to  being appointed to his present post, he served as minister of  state in the Tansu Ciler Cabinet.    By a convergence of circumstances the visit by the head of  the Turkish military ministry to Russia coincided with a drastic  exacerbation of the situation in the former Yugoslavia, as well  as with stepped-up activities between Azerbaijan and Armenia.  Since Turkey has interests in both areas, it has proposed its  own alternatives for resolving the conflict. This set of issues  will undoubtedly be the primary subject of discussion during  talks with Russia's military leadership.    The main purpose of the visit, however, is still one of  further developing bilateral technical military cooperation. It  is no secret that a significant portion of the armament of  Turkey's army does not measure up to contemporary requirements,  and Turkey is interested in modernizing them with new purchases  abroad. in October 1992 Turkey was the first NATO country to  conclude an agreement with Russia on shipments of weapons and  combat equipment, including helicopters and armored equipment.  In May of last year the heads of the military ministries of the  two countries signed a memorandum of mutual understanding  calling for bilateral cooperation in the areas of military  training and the defense industry.    The signing of these agreements, especially the former,  evoked a clear-cut reaction in the West. However, from all  accounts, it will not pose an obstacle to the development of  interaction between Russia and Turkey in the military area.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Farm Loans Due To Grow Hefty 28 Percent This </F> Year"]    [Text] The Agricultural Bank of China vows to help the  government rack up a 4 per cent rise in loans earmarked for  farming this year.    As China's leading financial arm for rural investment, the  bank plans to lend more than 29 billion yuan ($3.3 billion) to  farmers for their production this year, up 28 per cent from 1993.    Loans affecting farm production still receive top priority  in  lending policy decisions taken at the bank. However, the  government-set schedule for separating commercial banking from  policy banking will eventually make the bank's practices more  commercial. Mandatory lending will be turned over to the  soon-to-be-created Agricultural Development Bank.    The bank is responding to the government's call for ensuring  that loans earmarked for agricultural production account for at  least 10 per cent of the country's total bank credits in 1994,  up 4 percent from last year.    To cope with the growing demand for capital from the  countryside, the bank officials said, the bank's arranged loans  this year also include 4 billion yuan ($460 million) in poverty  alleviation loans and 2 billion yuan ($230 million) for  comprehensive agricultural development.    Starting this year, the Agricultural Bank will also strongly  back construction in the country's 500 centrally-controlled  grain production centres and the 150 State-controlled high  quality cotton-growing counties, bank officials said.    Ma Yongwei, president of the bank, predicted inflationary  pressure in 1994 will exert greater pressure on farmers to cut  production costs.    If inflation remains at last year's level, he said, it will  stimulate a spiralling of agricultural prices as well as a  higher demand for bank loans.    In addition, Ma added, the disparity between available  capital and the demand for credit will widen this year, as the  Agricultural Bank must shoulder a heavier burden in buying State  treasury bonds and co-operated bonds.    Official figures show that during the first quarter of this  year the bank lent nearly 20.1 billion yuan ($2.3 billion) to  farmers for their production, two times more than in the same  period of 1993.    The bank's major branches in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan,  Tianjin and Nanjing expanded their agricultural loans by 300  million yuan ($34.5 million) to 500 million yuan ($57.5 million)  each during the January-March period, a busy season in the  agricultural calendar.    This was backed by a considerable increase in the bank's  personal savings deposits, which jumped 23.8 billion yuan ($2.7  billion) over a year ago.</p>

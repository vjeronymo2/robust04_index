			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets made a subdued return from the New Year holiday, and stock index futures, in particular, failed to join the underlying stock market in its rise to new peaks, writes Terry Byland. The March futures contract on the FT-SE Index traded close to fair value, the premium which allows for financing and dividend flows. It closed at a premium of 20 above the cash market, of which 15 was accounted for by estimates of fair value. At no time did the contract make any move to challenge its peak of 2,891, reached over the Christmas/New Year period. Trading volume, at 8,459 lots at the official close, indicated a modest day's business. Traders commented that many funds were still on the sidelines, and that stock index futures had been left to the locals, or independent traders. Strategists commented that the futures markets had been able to dominate the underlying stock market over the holiday period, but that it could well prove more difficult when the market returned to full-time working. In traded options, however, business was a more healthy 20,476 contracts, compared with only 8,691 on New Year's Eve. Among individual stock contracts, Fisons headed the list with 1,234 lots dealt, followed by BP on 1,199, Asda on 1,075 and TSB on 1,004. Also active was the Euro FT-SE contract, with 597 lots traded in a busy session.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Britain is withdrawing a number of staff from its  embassy in Belgrade, capital of the war-torn former Yugoslavia,  the Foreign Office confirmed tonight.    Dependents of embassy officials and other non-essential  members of staff will leave as "a sensible precaution," a  spokesman said.    "The embassy will remain open, but operating at a reduced  level," he added.    The embassy was also reported to be contacting all British  and Commonwealth nationals registered with it. "If anyone wants  to leave at the same time they can come with our convoy," First  Secretary David Campbell told REUTERS in Belgrade.    The Foreign Office said the withdrawal of personnel was "a  sensible precaution because of increased tension".    There are 11 British diplomats at the Belgrade embassy,  which  will remain open but probably with a reduced number of staff.    The evacuees, expected to number less than 20, will leave by  road convoy -- possibly tomorrow.    Elsewhere in Belgrade there are about 60 other British  residents, most of them journalists or married to local people.    The Foreign Office issued advice some time ago for British  nationals to leave the city.</p>

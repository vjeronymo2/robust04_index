			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Japanese housing market recovery JAPAN'S housing starts in April rose 0.4 per cent from a year earlier, the first increase in 18 months and a sign that the recession in the residential property market appears to have bottomed out. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate fell from to 2.1 to 2 per cent during the month, though the jobs-to-applicants ratio fell from 1.22:1 to 1.17:1, as the labour shortage eased in tandem with the slowing of the economy. The recovery in the housing market was uneven, with houses built for sale down 28 per cent, while owner-occupied starts and houses for rent showed increases. Starts of corporate dormitories rose 15.5 per cent, reflecting companies' attempts to attract high-quality labour with high-quality accommodation. Large numbers of unsold apartments remain on the fringes of Tokyo and Osaka, Japan's second largest city, where there was a flurry of speculative building in 1989 and 1990 before the housing market collapsed. Until April's increase, starts had fallen for 18 consecutive months. Leading apartment builders are forecasting a tentative recovery in the year ahead, with demand strongest for two-bedroom apartments of around Y40m (Pounds 171,000), the budget end of the Japanese market. Office occupancy remains at around 95 per cent or above in Tokyo, but renewed construction of delayed projects is expected to depress this rate in coming months. Japan's jobs-to-applicants ratio has been in continuous decline since it peaked at 1.47:1 in March last year, and the present rate is the lowest since early 1989. The Ministry of Labour said the fall in new job offers was likely to continue until after summer, despite the acute labour shortage in various sectors, including the retail and construction industries.</p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> CITY MAY EXPAND NO-SMOKING BAN  </P> <P> The Santa Paula City Council is scheduled to consider an ordinance Monday that  would restrict smoking in public places.  </P> <P> The city has had a no-smoking policy in government buildings since 1987, and  the council is being asked to consider broadening that policy to other public  places such as restaurants, theaters and health-care facilities.  </P> <P> "It's going to take a lot of guts for the council to pass such a measure,"  Mayor Kay Wilson said.  </P> <P> "The council has to be sensitive to the needs of the business owners and their  ability to make a living."  </P> <P> Compliance with the regulation could be a problem for small businesses such as  mom-and-pop cafes, she said, where segregating smokers from nonsmokers would be  difficult because of size limitations.  </P> <P> However, a survey of other cities in the county has shown few problems with  similar ordinances, City Clerk Stacey MacDonald said.  </P> <P> "After the first 60 days, during which people expressed concerns, there have  been no problems reported," she said.  </P> <P> A first violation would earn a fine of $100 or less. A second infraction would  cost $200.  </P> <P> A third instance of noncompliance would be considered a misdemeanor and would  cost the business owner $1,000. AMELIA CHAFFEE  </P></p>

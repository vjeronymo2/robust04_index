			<p>BFN     [Text] In Rwanda the first Belgian paratroops have landed  at Kigali airport. Thus, the green light has been given for the  evacuation of our fellow countrymen from Rwanda. At 1645 hours  a first C-130 plane landed in Kigali. An hour later four more  planes followed.    Just now a news conference was held in Evere with Defense  Minister Delcroix. Together with Chief of Staff Charlier, he  explained the progress of the evacuation. Delcroix also paid  homage to the 10 Belgian blue helmets who were killed by Rwandan  soldiers.    Here is a report by Bruno Huyghebaert:    [Huyghebaert] Operation Silverback is the codename under  which the Defense Ministry and Army have conceived the  evacuation operation from Rwanda. Initially the intention was  to land in Kigali early this morning between 0300 and 0600  hours, Minister Delcroix said. But Rwandan troops had blocked  the airport. Then, in cooperation with the French and the  United Nations, we had to negotiate until this afternoon in  order to be able to begin the evacuation. The intervention  unit of the paracommandoes was meanwhile in the Kenyan capital,  Nairobi. Chief of Staff Charlier said that 250 paracommandos  landed in Kigali this evening with the necessary support  equipment. They will take refugees to Kigali airport where, if  necessary, they will be provided with medical assistance and be  evacuated on to Belgium via Nairobi. The entire operation is  proceeding with French, U.S., Dutch, and Italian assistance.  The names of the refugees will be circulated by the foreign  affairs ministry via the media. The first refugees will be  arriving at 0230 hours at Melsbroek military airport from  Bujumbura in Burundi where they had gone under their own steam.    Minister Delcroix also paid homage to the 10 Belgian blue  helmets who were murdered in a cowardly fashion in Kigali.  Meanwhile, their bodies have been flown from Kigali to Nairobi  by a C-130.

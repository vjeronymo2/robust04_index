			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Boston reels at papal posting THE city of Boston was thoroughly flabbergasted on Tuesday night when Mr Raymond Flynn, its mayor for the past 10 years, announced he was to be the next US ambassador to the Vatican. There had been no hint in the days before St Patrick's Day that the popular Mr Flynn - Boston-Irish, liberal, Catholic and an opponent of abortion - would be so honoured or was thinking of leaving in the middle of his third term. Most local speculation had centred naturally enough on who was to become the next ambassador to Dublin, a nomination long expected to mark the visit to the White House yesterday of Mr Albert Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister. Another woman with impeccable political credentials, though no formal career in politics, is also widely expected to get the plum embassy in Paris: Mrs Pamela Harriman, English-born widow of the US statesman Averell Harriman, former wife of Mr Randolph Churchill, and mother of Mr Winston Churchill, the Conservative member of parliament. The London embassy, like Paris, is normally reserved for political patronage. But it is widely believed Mr Raymond Seitz, the first professional US ambassador to the Court of St James, has been asked to stay on for at least another year. Another important embassy, Tokyo, also seems to have been earmarked: for Mr Richard Holbrooke, an Asian expert in President Jimmy Carter's State Department.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A news conference was held at the People's Cultural  Palace yesterday [23 June] in connection with the South Korean  authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons development.  Participating in the news conference were reporters from the  publication and media organizations in Pyongyang, such as NODONG  SINMUN, the KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY, the Korean Central  Broadcasting Committee; foreign correspondents; and publication-  related functionaries at various foreign embassies in our  country.    At the news conference, Ho Hyok-pil, vice director of the  Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of  the Fatherland [CPRF], first of all, issued a memorandum of the  CPRF exposing the truth that nuclear weapons development has  been pushed for in South Korea. The memorandum pointed out that  South Korea has accelerated nuclear weapons development in a  planned way and systematically abrogated the joint declaration  on denuclearization, while possessing reprocessing facilities,  and extracting and bringing in plutonium in an illegal way.    The memorandum pointed out as follows that South Korea's  post-irradiation test facilities [chosahu sihom sisol] are  reprocessing facilities disguised as experimental ones:  Although South Korea is disguising the post-irradiation test  facilities in Taedok as peaceful atomic facilities, it can be  confirmed by all data that they are reprocessing facilities.  Above all, the post-irradiation test facilities have been built  for reprocessing purposes. The post-irradiation test facilities  are reprocessing facilities of extracting plutonium in terms of  their structure and operational process.    South Korea is extracting plutonium directly from spent  nuclear fuel by making use of post-irradiation test facilities.  According to obtained data, the South Korean authorities  extracted plutonium after taking 4 meter-long 2,148 nuclear fuel  rods, 12 bundles, to the post-irradiation test facilities at the  atomic research center from the Kori No. 1 Power Plant alone on  24 May, 1985, in accordance with an agreement with the United  States.    Nuclear material is being diverted in an undisguised way in  South Korea. In cahoots with the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], the South Korean authorities have systematically  reprocessed, and extracted huge amount of plutonium every year  from, spent nuclear fuels--which they did not burn completely  at, and extracted from, the heavy-water reactor and  multi-purpose research reactor--after taking those fuels to the  post-irradiation test facilities. The total amount of it is 50  kg according to the data-- which have been rudimentally  obtained--alone.    The memorandum pointed out that South Korea is trying to  legalize the introduction of plutonium from abroad and bring it  in in large quantity. The memorandum pointed out as follows  that the South Korean authorities have created artificial  obstacles to the implementation of the joint declaration of the  denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which the North and  South sides adopted and effectuated, reflecting the unanimous  aspirations and wishes of all countrymen: The present South  Korean authorities have launched maneuverings of abrogating the  North-South joint declaration of denuclearization in a planned  and systematic way. Meanwhile, they are even advocating the  theory of nuclear sovereignty and that of counter-nuclear  development [taeung haekgaebalnon].    The South Korean authorities ought to scrap the  post-irradiation test facilities--the reprocessing  facilities--while making public the plutonium which they have  illegally obtained.    We present--and strongly protest against--to the aboveboard  public opinion of the world the fact that the IAEA is applying a  double standard.    He made remarks on the issuance of the memorandum. He said  that the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a resolution on  10 June for discontinuing the agency's cooperation with our  Republic, adding that this is a wanton infringement upon our  Republic's sovereignty, an unfair act, and an integrated  expression of the agency's application of a double standard.    He pointed out that those who have pushed for nuclear  armament [haekmujanghwa] on the Korean Peninsula are the South  Korean authorities.    He laid bare that the post-irradiation test facilities in  the  Taedok Complex in South Korea are extracting plutonium from  those facilities, while saying that they are the reprocessing  facilities of extracting plutonium in a thorough-going way in  view of the purpose of their introduction, structure, and of the  process of realistic diversion.    He also pointed out that South Korea has illegally brought  in  huge amount of plutonium from abroad, exposing that it is  applying spurs to the development of a fast-breeder reactor  today to make its introduction of plutonium legal.    He stressed: Nonetheless, the IAEA has never taken issue  with this. We bring a charge against the agency's unjustness to  the public opinion of the world.    At the news conference, Vice Director Ho Hyok-pil and (Paek  Hyon-su), a responsible researcher for the fatherland's  reunification, answered the questions raised by reporters.    They said that South Korea, which is said to undergo the  IAEA's inspections, is extracting plutonium through the  post-irradiation test facilities, adding: The IAEA has conducted  more than 2,000 cases of inspections on the average every year  since the Nonnuclear Proliferation Treaty took effect. This  notwithstanding, the agency has never exposed even a single case  of the nuclear materials being used for military purposes.    They said: In particular, the IAEA has conducted nuclear  inspections of South Korea. But, it has turned its face away  from South Korea's nuclear weapons development and even from its  introduction of nuclear raw materials [haek wollyo].    They stressed: The South Korean authorities have  intentionally publicized to the public that all of their  attempts for nuclear weapons development up until now have been  given up. This is nothing but a smoke screen to cover up their  nuclear armament.    They disclosed: The world's social circles strongly call for  exposing, and taking issue with, the maneuverings for nuclear  armament in South Korea. Because even those inside South Korea  have begun exposing the authorities' maneuverings for nuclear  weapons development since last year, the South Korean  authorities have been put in an awkward situation and have  placed the public opinion under their sway in a deceitful way  with a view to coping with this.    They pointed out in a concrete way: Because their  development of a fast-breeder reactor has faced strong protests  and denunciations at home and abroad, the South Korean  authorities are trying to bring in plutonium by any means  [kioko] under the pretext of developing an improved light-water  reactor; and have invited an agency team for inspections and  safety examination to cover up their relations of conspiracy  with the IAEA and to continue to apply spurs to their nuclear  armament behind the scenes of conspiracy.    In conclusion, they said emphatically: It is necessary to  raise the voice of justice, on a worldwide scale, of denouncing  the South Korean authorities' maneuverings for nuclear weapons  development.</p>

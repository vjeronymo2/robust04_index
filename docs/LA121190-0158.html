			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 37 DIE IN FIERCE TRIBAL CLASH IN SOUTH AFRICA  </P> <P> At least 37 people were killed today as rival black factions battled with guns,  knives and axes, setting fire to shacks and chasing terrified people through  the streets.  </P> <P> Dozens of homes were burned and hundreds of residents fled as rival groups  battled for several hours during the morning in Tokoza, a black township, and  in a surrounding industrial area.  </P> <P> Hacked and mutilated bodies lay outside houses that had been burned and  pillaged.  </P> <P> The fighting pitted mostly Xhosas loyal to the African National Congress  against Zulus of the Inkatha Freedom Party in what increasingly appeared to be  a tribal confrontation. The Xhosas live in a squatter camp, while the Zulus  live in adjoining hostels.  </P> <P> At least 53 people have died in factional fighting in Tokoza since the latest  fighting began on the weekend.  </P> <P> Xhosa squatters armed with clubs, spears and knives gathered for safety at one  end of the township, while hundreds of armed Zulus in white headbands were  waiting in a migrant workers' hostel at the other end of Tokoza.  </P> <P> "We want revenge! . . . We want to fight!" some Zulus chanted.  </P></p>

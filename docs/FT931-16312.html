			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: CS aims to create a giant among the gnomes - The group's agreed bid for Volksbank would strengthen its home base CS HOLDING, the parent company of Credit Suisse, appears to be creating a new meaning for the term 'universal bank'. If its agreed SFr1.6bn (Dollars 1.14bn) bid for Swiss Volksbank is successful, the group will have at least one significant, independently-branded company for virtually every financial business. Through this takeover, the CS group - long regarded as the most aggressive of the big three Swiss banks internationally - would also considerably strengthen its Swiss base. In terms of assets, it would be slightly larger than the current number one, Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), although not in profitability. At the end of June 1992, UBS had total assets of SFr258.8bn, Swiss Bank Corporation SFr201bn, and CS Holding SFr241bn (of which roughly SFr4bn are attributable to CS's share in its only non-banking subsidiary, Electrowatt, an electric utility and engineering group). The Credit Suisse banking group alone had total assets of SFr163.7bn. The addition of Volksbank, with its total assets of SFr48.5bn at the end of June 1992, would appear to put the enlarged CS banking group comfortably into first place. But CS may want to make large provisions for bad loans and the costs of rationalisation at Volksbank. CS's profits, even including those of Volksbank, are still well behind those of UBS. CS had net income last year of SFr980m and Volksbank SFr68.4m, while UBS net income was SFr1.2bn. CS made clear yesterday that, following the takeover of Volksbank, it would accentuate the specialisation of its financial subsidiaries. Credit Suisse itself would remain the flagship global bank, concentrating on international activities, securities underwriting and major corporate and institutional clients, while CS First Boston would maintain its investment banking speciality. These two would fulfil the group's main strategy, which was stated last year by Mr Rainer Gut, the chairman, as 'building up global wholesale and investment banking capabilities so that at least one of the group's companies will be able to service any major banking transaction wherever and whenever it may arise.' Volksbank is seen as the group's domestic Swiss business bank, and will shed its relatively modest international activities and put less emphasis on its securities business in order to focus on lending to small and medium-sized companies. But both Credit Suisse and Volksbank, which will be managed and report financial results together, will continue to operate retail branch networks in Switzerland. Perhaps CS believes it can win in this overcrowded field with a two-brand strategy, although it may just be hesitant about breaking customer loyalties for some time. Bank Leu, active mainly in Swiss markets before CS acquired it in 1990, will (with other CS subsidiaries) increasingly concentrate on private banking. While this structure has a pleasing symmetry, analysts doubt that it will work that way in practice. Mr Michel Petitpierre, head of research at bankers Pictet &amp; Co in Geneva, said he expected the group to rationalise aggressively and bring its banking activities gradually under unified management. Mr Hans Kaufmann, of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, noted that Credit Suisse already carried out Bank Leu's data processing. He said there were more than 100 locations where branches of Volksbank and Credit Suisse overlapped, and he expected closures to proceed rapidly. Redundancies among the 6,600 Volksbank staff would occur more slowly, he added. Mr Kaufmann predicted that, in the long term, Credit Suisse would probably move out of retail banking. CS claimed that the combined forces of Credit Suisse and Volksbank would take leading market shares in many sectors in Switzerland. In mortgage lending, for example, it would have a 14.3 per cent share, based on 1991 figures. That is fractionally larger than those of UBS and Swiss Bank Corporation, the current number two. Credit Suisse alone has only a 9.5 per cent share. In clients' deposits, it would also move into first place with a 17.5 per cent share, compared with 14.3 per cent at UBS and 11.3 per cent at Credit Suisse now.</p>

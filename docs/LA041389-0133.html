			<p><P> April 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESS CHANNEL MARKS BIG-TIME CABLE DEBUT FOR NBC  </P> <P> At 6 a.m. (EDT) Monday, CNBC, the nation's newest cable network and NBC's  biggest-ever push into cable, will start its 24-hour-a-day service with "World  Business," a lot of hope and only three well-known names.  </P> <P> CNBC -- the initials stand for Consumer News and Business Channel -- says it's  starting up with 13 million homes, or 26.3% of the nation's cable-equipped  homes, able to receive its programming. A rival claims the actual figure is  only 6 million.  </P> <P> The "name" anchors it will have on launch day are a mixed lot: former CNN  anchor Mary Alice Williams, who may not be permanent; conservative talk-show  host John McLaughlin, and Dick Cavett, once of ABC, then PBS, and better known  for his discussions of cultural creativity than of crass commerce.  </P> <P> Still, many industry eyes will be on the new venture, which reportedly is  costing $65 million to start and is housed on two floors of a new,  impersonal-looking grey office building in this busy New York City suburb.  </P> <P> Ted Turner, founding father of CNN, will be watching. So will executives of CBS  and ABC. David Meister, president of the Financial News Network, will take  particular interest in how his new competitor fares.  </P> <P> A neutral observer, Sander Vanocur, anchor of ABC's Sunday "Business World,"  feels that there is room in TV for another player in the fields of high  finance, business news and consumer news.  </P> <P> "I think that business is the best story around now," he says. "It's better  than politics -- because business, financial and technological decisions always  seem to move ahead of government's ability to deal with them."  </P> <P> But Vanocur may be in the minority in feeling there is room for another  business-news venture. Something may have to give.  </P> <P> Consider. New York-based FNN, begun in 1981, says it serves 32 million U.S. and  Canadian homes. CNBC says it needs 30 million homes to break even.  </P> <P> Is a turf tiff imminent? Is the nation in for the cable equivalent of the  gunfight at the OK Corral?  </P> <P> "I don't know if it's as much that as it is walking down a deserted street late  at night with your hands in your pockets, wondering about sounds and shadows  and noises in the dark," says the feisty Meister.  </P> <P> "We don't know what they really are," adds FNN's chief, saying he's not certain  that CNBC will be only a financial and consumer news channel. He also asserts  that it will have 6 million homes on debut day.  </P> <P> There is muttering from the Turner camp, too, that CNBC is but a ploy to lay  the groundwork for a general-news channel battling Turner's successful Cable  News Network.  </P> <P> Such talk nettles CNBC president Michael L. Eskridge, whose NBC-managed company  is to be owned 50-50 by NBC and Cablevision Systems Corp. when an agreement  reached last year becomes final.  </P> <P> Sitting in his office, his cowboy boots propped on his desk, Eskridge flatly  denies that CNBC is headed the way of a CNN.  </P> <P> "No, absolutely not. Consumer news and business news are what we started out to  do, and that's what we're doing," he says.  </P> <P> Furthermore, he says, CNBC's contract with its cable affiliates "precludes our  doing general news."  </P> <P> But comparisons with Turner's 24-hour news service are inevitable, although CNN  only had access to 1.7 million homes when it began in 1981.  </P> <P> Back then, CNN had a staff of about 300 -- now up to around 1,600 world-wide.  CNBC also is starting small, with a staff of 275 -- 200 of whom will be based  in Ft. Lee. Fifty are anchors and reporters providing 17 hours of live and  taped first-run material each weekday, with seven hours of repeat material  aired after that.  </P> <P> CNN took five years and $77 million in red ink before turning a profit in 1985.  Eskridge projects that CNBC will be in the red -- he won't say how much -- for  three years before turning profitable in the fourth year.  </P> <P> Also like CNN, CNBC is non-union, which keeps costs and salaries of its on-air  and production staff well below those of the networks.  </P> <P> Even more important, say officials of each company, being non-union allows for  far greater flexibility than is possible under union contracts at the three  major networks, including NBC.  </P> <P> "We've got a lot of young, aggressive people here who have a little bit of  training in a few fields, and a couple of senior people who will help finish  the training job," Eskridge says.  </P> <P> "And those people will operate a camera one day, run a Chyron (character  generator) the next day, sweep up the studio the third, then carry furniture  around, write copy, do all this stuff that you just can't do" under rigid  network-style union rules, he says.  </P> <P> This ability to have jack-of-all-trades employees "is great from their point of  view, and great from ours. . . . We can afford to survive."  </P> <P> For the predominantly young staff, it's a way to break into the major leagues.  But it's likely, once CNBC gets going, that they'll be hearing from organizers  from technical unions and the American Federation of Television and Radio  Artists. The latter represents on-air anchors and correspondents at the major  networks, as well as entertainers.  </P> <P> When NBC originally announced plans for its cable venture, they included a  weekend sports package. But that idea was quietly dropped early this year.  Eskridge, who was executive producer of NBC's Summer Olympics telecasts last  fall, frankly admits that it "never made a great deal of sense to me."  </P> <P> There already is a lot of weekend sports on cable and the networks, and CNBC  wasn't going to able to afford "anything that was substantially different, yet  it was going to cost us a significant amount of money for rights," he explains.  </P> <P> As it turned out, cable operators felt the same way, he says. Now, Eskridge  says, he'll use weekends for counter-programming against sports and trying new  projects.  </P> <P> The start of CNBC's day may prove a tad early for West Coast viewers. Sign-on  will be 3 a.m. PDT, because all CNBC shows will air nationally at the same  time.  </P> <P> A CNBC spokesman said the service will be available in the Los Angeles city  area on United Cable and West Valley Cable. Elsewhere in Southern California,  it will be on cable systems serving Ventura, Alhambra, Pasadena, Riverside,  Santa Ana, Fullerton and Seal Beach. In San Diego, CNBC said, the service will  be carried by Cox Cable and Americable.  </P> <P> CNBC's weekday schedule so far has "World Business" starting the day, then  "CNBC Morning," then the constantly updated, 8 1/2-hour "Money Wheel" of  financial, market and business news segments, starting at 5:30 a.m. (PDT).  </P> <P> That's followed at 2 p.m. (PDT) by "Smart Money," a consumer show with a studio  audience.  </P> <P> Then comes "Media Beat," a half-hour report on media business that initially  will be hosted by Mary Alice Williams, who last month joined NBC News after  eight years at CNN. How long she'll remain isn't certain. Her main duties lie  at NBC News in Manhattan, where she's substitute-anchoring regular network  newscasts and planning to co-anchor a new prime-time news series.  </P> <P> Her CNBC work "depends on how her schedule shapes up with her network  obligations," Eskridge says. She'll probably do her CNBC turn "until it becomes  logistically difficult."  </P> <P> Following "Media Beat" will be "Business View," a one-hour wrap-up of the day's  hot business news, then "The Dick Cavett Show" at 4:30 p.m. (PDT), in which  he'll interview guests on consumer, business and life-style issues in front of  a studio audience.  </P> <P> Then comes "CNBC Live," described as a two-hour information show with a format  akin to that a network morning program. That will be followed by "McLaughlin,"  another studio-audience show with the host interviewing people from business,  politics, law, medicine, media and other fields.  </P> <P> After that, everything except "Money Wheel" is repeated until 3 a.m. (PDT) the  next morning.  </P> <P> CNBC's 24-hour service continues on weekends, under the umbrella title of "CNBC  Weekend." But it only will have three to 3 1/2 hours each day of first-run  material, including a Sunday childrens' program called "Kids Are Consumers,  Too." Other special weekend segments will cover real estate, the business of  sports, workplace conditions, a women-at-work segment, and a "consumer  speak-out" segment, a spokesman says.  </P></p>

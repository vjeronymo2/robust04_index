The Devon-based group, announcing pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.94m (Pounds 7.25m), said its results for the 12 months to December 31 would have been better had it not faced an unwelcome offer by Sibelco, a privately owned Belgian company which owns 46.7 per cent of the group's shares. Although Sibelco's 420p-a-share offer lapsed last September, WBB incurred Pounds 910,000 in exceptional costs fighting the bid. Pre-exceptional profits for the group, which specialises in ball clay extraction for sanitaryware and tile manufacturers, however, rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 8.85m on increased turnover of Pounds 76.3m (Pounds 69.8m). Mr John Pike, managing director, said: 'We are beginning to see more positive signs, but in our main markets intense price competition remains a very difficult challenge.' Earnings per share rose marginally to 23.3p (23.1p), but the group highlighted a pre-exceptional earnings rise of 20 per cent to 27.7p. A final dividend of 8.5p (8p), gives a total of 12p (10.7p).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by presidential candidate Eduardo Vallarino of </F> the Christian Democratic Party, PDC, during the final  presidential "debate" sponsored by the Latin American Institute  of Advanced Study and the Media Presidential Debate Committee;  place and date not given -- recorded]    [Text] Fellow countrymen: Our country is facing one of the  most critical moments of its history. Within the next five  years, we must prepare ourselves to manage the Canal. We have  already lost more than 15 years. We must also make good use of  the reverted areas and goods so that these will generate  opportunities for the country and its people. These areas and  goods must not be used to enrich a few or to become a burden on  the government. They must not become a source of shame for the  Panamanians, as happened with the railroad and other  installations. Likewise, we must consolidate our democratic  institutions so Panamanians can live in an atmosphere of  justice, have better opportunities for development, and enjoy  true social peace.    In the international field, we must decide on our future in  the face of the large economic blocs of countries that are  becoming organized worldwide. The most important aspect is we  must launch a true war against poverty and malnutrition, against  the lack of health and education, as well as against the lack of  hope, opportunities, and future for the most important thing  Panama has: our children and youth.    This electoral process offers us a beautiful opportunity to  solve these problems if we know how to act wisely. Fortunately,  the campaign has been managed well. Fortunately, the campaign  has been managed well, and it offers us an opportunity to show  the world Panama's good face. Lately, Panama has been in the  news only with reports on narcotics trafficking, money  laundering, and gun running. This has done us great harm, and it  affects the most humble Panamanians because it makes investments  difficult. Therefore, this affects the creation of new sources  of employment, which is what the people need.    So far, this has been a clean and peaceful electoral process  that will give us the opportunity to show our good face and even  serve as a good example for the entire world. It will be an  opportunity to begin cleaning up once again the image of Panama  and of the Panamanians, and to say that we are also serious  people.    The only thing that has marred the electoral process has  been  too many polls that have apparently been made not to inform the  people, but rather to misinform and to create an alleged  polarization between certain candidates. It is a good idea that  the Electoral Tribunal has just issued a decree regulating polls  and even banning them as of tomorrow [as heard]. The good thing  is that on 8 May, all polls will be at zero, and the only thing  that will count will be the true will of the Panamanian people.  That will be the only important and decisive poll.    Therefore, when you enter the voting booth, remember that  you, and only you as the voter, are responsible for choosing the  next president. At that moment, as a responsible citizen, you  must forget all publicity and polls and vote according to your  conscience for whomever you think is the candidate best prepared  to serve the country. At that moment, you have our future and  that of our children in your hands. You will be responsible for  the kind of ruler Panama will have. It is my duty at this time  to tell you what our candidacy has to offer you.    In the first place, I have the best academic and  professional  training of all the candidates. In addition, I am the only one  who has true experience in the field of international relations,  which are so important for Panama in the next five years. In  the second place, I have devoted my professional life to  activities that are directly related to the creation of sources  of employment. This experience is important in view of the  large unemployment there is in the country. I know how to  create jobs, and that is what Panama needs now. No other  candidate has any similar experience.    In the third place, I offer the testimony of a life of over  35 years at the service of Panamanians by creating civic  organizations and professional associations for solving  education problems, preventing improper use of drugs, and coping  with unemployment. I did not wait to become a candidate before  I started working for my country. I have served my country with  my work, at the service of the people, which is the most  important thing our country has. That is my testimony, not just  of now, but something I have done all my life. I want to do  1,000 times more from within the government of this work that I  have been doing as an ordinary citizen.    I also have a pact with the people which contains the  answers to our country's main problems. I consider this a firm  and serious commitment I have signed before a notary public.  This commitment stems from my most intimate convictions. I  highly regard my own signature a promise and much more. I am  the only candidate who has had the courage and honesty to sign  such a document. I have no personal commitments with anyone in  particular, but rather with the people. There is no economic  power supporting me, like those which have been supporting the  governments for many decades. I am moved only by the sincere  wish to serve my fatherland.    The presidency of the Republic is neither a carnival nor a  picnic. It is something extremely serious. In such critical  moments for our future and that of our country, you must decide  who you want as president of the Republic. As a fellow  countryman, I ask you to think during the next five days with  your conscience about the seriousness of the commitment you have  on 8 May and to decide wisely. I ask that you, with your vote,  you give me the opportunity to do within government what I have  been doing in private throughout my life: to work for Panama  and for Panamanians. Thank you very much.</p>

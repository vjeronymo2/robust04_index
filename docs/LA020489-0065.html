			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOCTOR CHARGED IN MURDER FOR PROFIT CASE  </P> <P> A Glendale physician was arrested on suspicion of murder Friday, concluding an  eight-month investigation into the death of a man whose body allegedly was used  to collect $1 million in life insurance.  </P> <P> Glendale police arrested Richard P. Boggs, 55, in the parking lot outside his  office on North Central Avenue shortly after noon as Los Angeles County  prosecutors were filing murder, conspiracy and insurance fraud charges against  him.  </P> <P> Also charged in the scheme were two Ohio businessmen, Melvin Eugene Hanson, 47,  and John Barrett Hawkins, 29, owners of a retail clothing firm in Columbus.  </P> <P> The murder charges against the three men include two special allegations of  murder for financial gain and aiding and abetting a murder for financial gain,  meaning that all three could be sentenced to death if convicted.  </P> <P> The case, which investigators said came close to being a perfect crime,  revolves around the death of Ellis Henry Greene, 32, of North Hollywood.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Heart Disease Blamed  </P> <P> Investigators said Greene died in Boggs' office early on the morning of April  16, 1988, of inflammation of the heart. Boggs, however, identified the body as  that of Hanson. Hanson's partner, Hawkins, then claimed the body from the Los  Angeles coroner's office and had it cremated. He later collected $1 million  from Farmers New World Life Insurance of Washington on a policy carried by  Hanson.  </P> <P> Boggs had reported the cause of death as heart failure, and the coroner's  office accepted that conclusion.  </P> <P> The Glendale Police Department began an investigation in June after an inquiry  from the insurance company led them to discover that Hanson's fingerprints,  obtained through the Ohio Department of Motor Vehicles, did not match those of  the dead man.  </P> <P> The body was later identified as that of Greene, who had lived with an aunt in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> Boggs told investigators at the time that Greene had been his patient for  several years, but he said he knew the man as Hanson.  </P> <P> In a search of the doctor's office last November, Glendale police found a stun  gun, a weapon commonly used by police to disable suspects with an electric  charge. Deputy Dist. Atty. Al MacKenzie of the district attorney's major fraud  unit said the use of a stun gun as a murder weapon is still under  investigation, and Boggs was charged Friday with assault with a stun gun.  </P> <P> Investigators for several agencies embarked on what a spokesman described  Friday as "a painstaking labor of love" to reconstruct every move from the last  time Greene was seen alive the night before his death to the present.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Combined Effort  </P> <P> Investigators for the FBI, the fraud bureau of the California Department of  Insurance, the Glendale police and the Los Angeles county coroner's office  worked on the case with officials from Columbus, MacKenzie said.  </P> <P> A break in the case occurred Monday when Hanson, who already had been charged  in Columbus with insurance fraud, was arrested by customs officials at the  Dallas-Ft. Worth airport. He was carrying a fraudulent passport as he attempted  to return to this country from Mexico, authorities said. He was returned to  Ohio and is being held in Franklin County Jail. Hawkins is still the object of  a nationwide manhunt.  </P> <P> Boggs, who was under 24-hour surveillance by Glendale police several days  before his arrest, is being held without bail in the Glendale Jail. He is  scheduled to be arraigned Monday in Los Angeles Municipal Court.  </P> <P> MacKenzie said Los Angeles and Columbus officials are discussing whether Hanson  will be extradited to California.  </P></p>

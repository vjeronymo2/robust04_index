			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ZSA ZSA GABOR FOUND GUILTY  </P> <P> The manifest homophobia of Ms. Gabor during her trial for a variety of traffic  and assault violations has brought great pain to the lesbian/gay community. She  states that she fears going to jail because the lesbians there would threaten  her.  </P> <P> Later we are told in The Times (Sept. 21) that "She told jurors that Kramer  (the arresting officer) must hate her because he is gay. . . . Three gentlemen  came up to us, under oath, and said they slept with Mr. Kramer," Gabor  testified, and she added, "Don't you know, a gay would not like a woman like  Zsa Zsa Gabor. Why would he? I marry all the men he would want to have."  </P> <P> She made these statements to attempt to prejudice the jury in her favor. For  shame! We lesbian/gay folk were impeached in testimony, denied access to  community resources, to the decision-making processes of society for thousands  of years by just such homophobic statements. Happily for us, we have staged a  worldwide nonviolent social revolution to change such attitudes. What we have  commenced to do is working -- far from perfectly, but working.  </P> <P> I know nothing of Officer Paul Kramer's private life (and it is none of my  business), nor that of Ms. Gabor. I do know something about jail conditions.  Yes, there are lesbians in custody, along with unknown numbers of non-gay  women. They have troubles enough with survival, and search for justice under  day-to-day conditions, without Ms. Gabor trying to worsen their situation.  </P> <P> Her statements have forced us to recall just how judgmental society was until  this generation. Our educational effort must go right on. But we must take time  out to respond to such painful statements.  </P> <P> MORRIS KIGHT  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Management: Desert island manager - John Guinness John Guinness, 58, spent most of his career as a diplomat and civil servant before taking over as chairman of BNFL, the nuclear fuels reprocessing company, in 1992. In his last nine years as a civil servant he was deputy secretary then permanent secretary in the Department of Energy and was responsible for the privatisation of the electricity industry. Who would you take with you other than your family? I would have a chat with the Almighty and try to get my former boss, the late Victor Rothschild. He was the nearest thing to Renaissance man I have known. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, an expert on the spermatozoa of the bull, a county cricketer, he could have made a very good career as a jazz pianist, he wrote the bibliography of English 16th century first editions and he was a great wit and bon viveur. He was also head of the Think Tank, where I had two spells in the 1970s. What would you miss most? I would miss the opportunity to go to obscure private picture collections. I have a collection of a quarter of a million photographs of historical portraits which I have amassed since I was 15. I also advise Sotheby's and Christie's, sometimes helping to identify portraits. What would you miss least? Bureaucracy (in both the private and public sectors), complacency and negativism. What would you read? The first thing would be the Nuclear Installations' Inspectorate's safety regulations. But then I would ask for Dom David Knowles's four volumes on English monasticism, one of the great works of English scholarship. I would also ask for the news pages of the Times and the business pages of the FT. What film? Kind Hearts and Coronets. Sir Alec Guinness is the most distinguished person with the name of Guinness. I only wish I could prove we were cousins. What drink and food? I would want fish and chips, especially as there would be so much fish around the island. It is a food I adore; one of my ambitions is to write a guide on fish and chip shops from London to Norfolk. I would also want some diet Coke. You can have one item of office equipment. I learned to type when I was 13 and I have always felt comfortable with it. When I was in the Department of Environment I used to sign off my reports with 'composed, typed and sent by JRS Guinness.' But if I had to make a choice it would be a telephone, so that I could talk to my family and employees. What vehicle? I would want to take my 1900 Clement Panhard. It is partly for this reason that the telephone would be essential. My wife is the engineer of the family. She can take cars apart and put them together with ease. I could telephone her and she could tell me how to repair it.</p>

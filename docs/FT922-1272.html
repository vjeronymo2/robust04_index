			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: BSN to take control of Belgian brewer BSN, the French food group, is expanding its interests in Belgium by taking control of Alken-Maes, one of the largest Belgian breweries which produces Maes Pils and Cristal. The French company is increasing its stake in Alken-Maes, which had sales of BFr5.73bn (Dollars 177m) in 1991, from 50 to 75 per cent. For BSN, already Europe's second biggest brewing group, the Belgian deal forms part of a programme of increasing its international beer interests, which provided one-tenth of its FFr66bn (Dollars 12.69bn) group sales last year. Earlier this year, BSN strengthened its position in the Spanish beer market by buying a 24 per cent stake in San Miguel, one of the country's best-known beer brands. BSN already had substantial a brewing business in Spain due to its 33 per cent holding in the Mahou brewery. BSN, under its veteran chairman, Mr Antoine Riboud, has become one of the most aggressive players in the increasingly competitive European food market by developing an international portfolio of products in sectors such as mineral water, biscuits and yoghurt.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / Letter: Need for urgent action on salmon and sea trout stocks Sir, The National Rivers Authority's response to the government's invitation to submit proposals for the phasing out of the north-east drift net fishery has dismayed members of the Salmon &amp; Trout Association. We have long argued that the existence of an interceptory drift net fishery for salmon and sea trout, using monofilament nets, is a national scandal. Over the past 20 years, catches of Atlantic salmon have plummeted by 80 per cent. We would be the first to agree that part of this decline may result from actions and circumstances beyond our shores. But we must now do all in our power to safeguard remaining stock. The NRA envisages that this fishery will run down by natural wastage under existing legislation over the next 30 years, with a 50 per cent reduction achieved within 10 years. We believe that a shorter period should be considered and that any necessary legislation to this end should be speedily enacted. We understand that the NRA board would also favour an earlier cessation of the fishery - if the government were also of the same opinion. Mr John Gummer, minister of agriculture, fisheries and food, is no doubt heavily involved in revision of the Common Fisheries Policy during the UK's presidency of the European Community. He should also take appropriate action as far as the UK's coastal fisheries for salmon and sea trout are concerned.

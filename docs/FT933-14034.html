			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / North sees continued increase in sales TWO OF the biggest regional economic surveys carried out by chambers of commerce - covering more than 2,000 companies in north-west England and the Yorkshire and Humberside region - have given further evidence of economic recovery, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. Both reported that domestic and export sales had continued to rise after 'more tenuous' increases in January and March. The nine north-west chambers said domestic sales and orders, especially for smaller companies, had strengthened further. Yet they cautioned that orders from mainland Europe were slowing, although exports generally remained 'quite buoyant'. Companies in north-west England, however, are still reporting little pressure on capacity, which remains under-utilised. This is contributing to continuing caution on new investment. There also appears to be continuing disparity in job markets, with small- and medium-sized companies responding quickly to the upturn by increasing recruitment, while larger manufacturers are continuing to shed labour. In Yorkshire and Humberside, 47 per cent of manufacturers are attempting to recruit, compared with 39 per cent in the first quarter. The respective figures in the service sector are 42 per cent and 36 per cent. Confidence on both sides of the Pennines was reported at its highest for two years. Yet companies are worried about financial stability and any tightening of conditions as sterling appreciates.</p>

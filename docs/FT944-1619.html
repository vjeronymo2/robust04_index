			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of the Czech Republic (6): The Dollars 1bn draw - The SPT Telecom offer Excitement over the Czech Republic's telecoms privatisation is reaching a peak. Rival telecoms executives from the US and Europe - and their investment bankers - trip over each other in hotel lobbies. In the breakfast rooms they confer in hushed voices to ensure they will not be overheard. Ten companies remain in the running for the 27 per cent stake on offer in SPT Telecom. Three consortia have emerged: one, already announced, grouping Bell Atlantic of the US and France Telecom; another pairing Ameritech, another US regional operator, with Deutsche Telekom of Germany; and a third led by KPN of the Netherlands and including AT&amp;T of the US and Swiss Telecom. Telecom Denmark, Southwestern Bell and Italy's Stet are still casting around for partners. 'I've never been on a deal where I've met so much bidder interest,' says Michele Goffin, a vice-president of JP Morgan, advisers to the government. She describes how bidders argued about how many people could go into the 'data room' to look through SPT documents for the specified 12 hours. 'It was incredible to watch them cram 14 people into a room.' Financial investors, too, are buying into SPT Telecom, even ahead of privatisation. In the second wave of the Czech Republic's voucher programme, 26 per cent of the company has been allocated to individuals and voucher funds. These shares will be distributed early next year. Already, however, western hedge funds and private investors are engaging in contracts with Czech institutions to take future delivery of stock. This market has set a price of about Kc3,500 a share. The intensity of interest puts Czech officials in a strong bargaining position. 'We are not begging investors to come,' says Jiri Makovec, chairman of SPT. 'We are just telling them that this is an opportunity.' The sale is likely to raise more than Dollars 1bn, making it the biggest transaction yet in eastern Europe. Such fierce competition reflects the fact that for western operators the sale is a rare opening. 'The opportunity to buy into and influence an emerging markets telecoms company is disappearing. This is the biggest play around at the moment,' says a western investment banker. The Latin American telecom deals are largely completed and west European privatisations are generally taking the form of public offerings. Thirty per cent of Hungary's telecoms company Matav has been sold to Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech; Poland still appears uncertain about how to conduct its telecom privatisation. 'The timing for the Czechs has been impeccable,' says Ms Goffin. SPT Telecom has its own special attractions. The Czech Republic is home to eastern Europe's most successful economy and must carry SPT with it. 'Telecoms has to do well because otherwise they won't turn around their industrial society,' says Harvey Schuster, chairman of Corus, a Czech voucher fund that has invested heavily in SPT. Investors believe the company is well managed. Operating profit in 1993 was Kc6.5bn (Dollars 230m). The company has little debt and will have still less: the winning western consortium will take its 27 per cent stake through a capital increase. The Czech budget is in rough balance; so all the proceeds will go to SPT, none to the government. The concern of investors is an unusual one: SPT's gearing is too low rather than too high. 'They won't have to borrow a cent for two to three years,' says one adviser. Even the company's failings have silver linings. Line density at 20 per 100 inhabitants is low by western standards. Waiting lists are still high at 600,000. But frustrated demand offers the potential for rapid revenue growth. Labour turnover is high at about 20 per cent per annum. This leads to rising salaries but it also makes cutting back the labour force easier. One problem is the Czech Republic's distorted phone tariff structure. International calls are among the most expensive in Europe while local calls are the cheapest at about US5c for unlimited time. The government is unwilling to raise charges sharply ahead of elections in 1996. The group most likely to win will be the one which can promise the most rapid development. The target is to double the number of lines by the year 2000 at a cost of about Kc130bn. Only large-scale investment will ease widespread criticism of the telecoms company. 'We are public enemy number one,' says Mr Makovec of SPT. 'No other company is so unpopular.' Attacks come not only from the general public. SPT's international switch is overloaded and businesses are stepping up their criticism. 'Lines are getting worse. They've hooked up so many that you can't get through,' says Andrew Reicher, outgoing general director of investment bank CS First Boston in Prague. France Telecom cites its experience in transforming a backward telephone network to one of the world's most modern in the space of a decade. But most of the companies competing are technically up to the task. Stet will have to bear Italy's often unjustified reputation for broken lines but it is likely to compensate for that by bidding high. Bell Atlantic, France Telecom and KPN all have the advantage of longstanding links with SPT. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom suffer the handicap of state ownership. Deutche Telekom and Ameritech will find it difficult to promise the Czech Republic any role as a regional hub for telecommunications traffic after having done so already in Hungary. But the deciding factor may be nationality. The Czech government's view of French state companies has been soured by Air France's unsuccessful investment in CSA, the Czechoslovak airline. A leading role for Deutsche Telekom would reinforce Germany's economic influence, already uncomfortably large, over a country it occupied in the second world war. Moreover, a sale to a state-owned company would hardly be the privatisation in which the Czech government believes so strongly. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are addressing these concerns. Each led its respective consortium in Hungary. In the Czech Republic they are taking a back seat to their US partners. Whichever western consortium comes out on top, SPT and the Czech Republic are bound to be winners. All the conditions are present for a bidding war. 'It is going to take a billion dollars or more to walk away with it,' says an adviser.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sharply reverses early plunge Wall Street After plummeting more than 50 points at the opening following heavy losses in overseas stocks and US bonds, share prices rallied impressively yesterday to end firmly in positive territory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 22.51 at 3,831.74, which represented a 76-point swing from its low of the day of 3,755.76. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion to end a net 0.37 ahead at 464.81. The American SE composite, however, remained weak, finishing 3.64 down at 466.32, while the Nasdaq composite ended 5.17 lower at 783.47. NYSE volume was heavy at 361m shares, while declines still outnumbered rises at the close by 1,424 to 772. Heavy overnight selling on foreign equity and bond markets, and early declines in US bond prices in New York, set the stage for a sharply downbeat opening to equity trading. Within minutes the Dow was showing a double-digit loss, and it was not long before the average had posted a 50-point decline, which triggered the NYSE's 'circuit breakers', which limit program trading. The circuit breakers, however, and a sharp rebound in US bond prices (the 30-year bond recovered from a one-point decline to end slightly higher), stemmed the tide of selling. By midday, stocks were rallying, aided by the news that the US government will not immediately take punitive action against the Japanese for failing to open up their markets to US goods and services. With demand for cyclical issues (many of them components of the Dow) surging during the afternoon, the market eventually moved back into the black. Yet, in spite of the Dow's rebound, the wider market remained weak, and investors' mood sombre. Bond and stock prices in the US and Europe have been falling because of fears that signs of resurgent inflation in the US will prompt the Federal Reserve to put up interest rates again. Yesterday's report from the Commerce Department that wages and salaries rose by 1 per cent in January - double the growth in the previous month - only fuelled investors' fears about inflation. Among individual sectors, financial stocks again took a beating because of concern about rising interest rates. Bankers Trust was hardest hit, falling Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 78 3/8 after the New York bank was forced to issue a statement denying rumours that it had incurred huge losses on its derivatives trading. JP Morgan, down Dollars 1 at Dollars 66 1/2 , was another to suffer from speculation about trading losses. Elsewhere in the sector, Citicorp slipped Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 39 1/2 and Nationsbank Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 47 7/8 . Car manufacturers led the market's recovery, Ford Motor rising Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 64 1/8 , General Motors Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 60 1/2 and Chrysler Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 57 3/8 . Other cyclicals on the rise included Alcoa, up Dollars 2 at Dollars 76 1/2 , Caterpillar, Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 112, General Electric, Dollars 1 ahead at Dollars 105 7/8 , and Union Carbide, Dollars  1/2 firmer at Dollars 24 1/2 . Canada Toronto stocks shook off much of their earlier rate-driven weakness in afternoon action, but failed to match New York's resurgence and ended still easier on the day. The TSE-300 composite index closed 28.2 down at 4,362.2 after tumbling almost 57 points early in the session. Falls finally led rises by 513 to 249 after volume of 63.8m shares. Eleven of the 14 stock groups declined, led by the golds sector, off 2.50 per cent. However, the Comex gold bullion price finished only USDollars 0.50 easier at USDollars 378.90 after trading as low as USDollars 374.00 per ounce.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Computer bugs at New York exchanges A COMPUTER problem disrupted price reporting for all of New York's major commodity and futures exchanges yesterday, resulting in delayed opening and shortened sessions. A representative of the New York Mercantile Exchange said the cause of the computer disruption had not been determined. The exchanges are located in the World Trade Centre building, which was subject to a terrorist bomb blast in February. All the exchanges had managed to open by 11.30 EDT and said the shortened sessions would not affect the day's settlement prices.</p>

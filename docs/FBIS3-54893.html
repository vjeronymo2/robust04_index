			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] According to reports by the mass media abroad,  U.S.-Russian talks are now being held in Washington (?pending)  the meeting of the Presidents of the United States and the  Russian Federation in Moscow. Is it a fact that, as asserted by  these mass media, a Ukrainian delegation is also taking part in  the talks in Washington? Will Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk participate in the Moscow summit?    Our correspondent asked the chief of the Ukrainian Foreign  Affairs Ministry's Information Directorate, Yuriy Serheyev, to  comment on these reports.    [Begin Serheyev recording] A delegation of Ukraine, led by  Mr. Shmarov, is indeed in Washington, where the topics of  consultations are the same old topics, i.e. the questions of  balancing our mutual relations with the United States and having  them concentrate on the sphere of the economy, rather than just  on military and political negotiations and military and  political cooperation -- this is a topic known to you and is  also one of the principal aims of our delegations and the task  that it is faced with, and of course continuing the  consultations, that have been in progress for a long time and  were stepped up in December, precisely on nuclear arms  elimination issues [sentence as heard]. So this topic is  well-known, the consultations are going on, and so far we cannot  add anything new. The delegation will return and perhaps  something new will be added which might be described as a  working version which could then be tabled before higher-level  delegations.    As for the report that you quote as saying that a meeting in  Moscow is possible, circulated by INTERFAX and some other  agencies, there is indeed a certain mutual relationship between  facts, events, and necessity. When presidents or high-ranking  statesmen meet to talk, they have to have documents tabled  before them to be looked at and signed by them. Up till now, we  have only said that consultations and negotiations to work out  possible documents are under way. I do not know what is the  source of information about the possibility of such a meeting.  What I do know is that a document has to be prepared to be  considered at any meeting between presidents and any meeting  between prime ministers. So it may yet be premature to talk  about such documents having already been made ready now for the  dates cited by INTERFAX, which are 14-15 January. At least, our  delegation has to return from the United States, possibly for  Mr. Shmarov and possibly for the Foreign Affairs Ministry and  the president's administration to be asked that question.  Perhaps this would provide a more logical situation for comment  on a future meeting.    What everything rests on is that nobody has sought and  worked  for a meeting for the sake of a meeting although, you know, much  speculation has been made on this: In the past, whether Kuchma  would or would not be allowed in the United States, and now,  whether there would or would not be a meeting with the President  of the United States. All this, as it were, is emotional. The  main thing and the main topic, however, and the main answer will  be where common interests and common, compromise decisions will  be found. Then, perhaps, what you intended to say in your  question will be implemented. Perhaps, this is how it is.    That is why, I am not in possession of any information that  I  can provide you with, for me unequivocally either to confirm or  deny the possibility of such a meeting. However, what I can do  is to comment on this in this way, since the consultations and  talks are still in progress. [end recording]</p>

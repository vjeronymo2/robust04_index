			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Yang Hong (2799 4767): "Prevent Power From Invading the </F> Market"]    [Text] Speaking in terms of essence, power is not a  commodity, and does not have the content and feature of a  commodity, therefore, it cannot enter the market as a commodity.  But in some localities the "real text" of a socialist market  economy has been distorted, and there are frequent phenomena of  various powers entering the market. For example, some local  government departments change themselves into companies,  corporations, or enterprise groups, while their original staff  and functions remain unchanged. They then take over the rights  and interests from their subordinate enterprises. Some  departments, which posses power in certain areas, claim that  they are "going to the sea" and "running entities," but what  they are actually doing is monopolizing and doing business  through power. The exchange of power for money has spread to  notes of approval, documents of approval, loans, taxation,  examination of goods, and buying and selling of land, and some  persons used money to buy power, then used the power to make  money, and in this way they quickly earned tens-of-thousands of  yuan, hundreds-of-thousands of yuan, or even millions of yuan.  Some localities abused power in setting up barriers to block  others who wanted to do business, or stop the sales of local  products to other markets. Power's invasion of the market has  brought about a series of negative effects:    1. It contradicts the law of market competition, and hinders  fair competition in the market. Competition is the basic  feature and demand of the market economy, but competition must  be conducted under equal status, law, tax burden, loan, and  interest rate. No unfair competition is allowed by the market  economy. The entering of power into the market will cause a  kind of unfair competition, because some people, with their  power, may obtain special consideration, light tax burdens, good  loans, and high profits. Therefore, when power enters the market  as a commodity, it will lose its fairness, as well as its  qualification for and ability of guiding, cultivating, and  managing the market.    2. It destroys the balance in economic structure, and  disrupts the order of economic operation. In any country,  economic development should rest on structural balance which is  on an orderly basis. When power enters the market, it will  interfere in the regulation of economic operation by the law of  value, the law of competition, and the law of supply and demand.  It will hinder the implementation of the principle of a legal  system, the principle of distribution, and the principle of  taxation system, and it will affect the arrangement of resources  and lead to chaos in the market.    3. It weakens the functions of laws, rules, and regulations.  The market economy has a legal system as a precondition; the  main body of economy participating in the market should be  managed and supervised by legal system, and the operational  order of market economy should be standardized and maintained by  legal system, while the state's macroregulation and control of  the market should also be recognized and guaranteed by the legal  system. Once power enters the market, and especially when the  power of law enforcement organs enters the market to the extent  that those who know the law and enforce the law break the law,  then the state's laws and regulations will be relentlessly  trampled upon to the extent that they lose the authoritativeness  they should have, and consequently market economy cannot operate  normally.    4. It undermines the building of party work style and  clean-government building, and causes the emergence and  spreading of corruption. Power is nothing more than a duty of  serving the public entrusted to someone by the state and people.  Once it enters the market, it will become the tool for pursuing  private interests of individuals and groups, leading to the  corrupt phenomena of bribery, corruption, abuse of power,  exchange of power and money, the running of businesses with  power, and assisting business with power.    5. It distorts government behavior and misguides the process  of government organ reform. When power enters the market, it  will not play the function of promoting government organ reform,  but will play the function of degenerating the process. For  example, when "renamed companies" enter the market as power,  they do so not to streamline organs which should be separated  from the government, they enable these organs to be preserved  lawfully in the name of "enterprise," "company," and "group."  This not only distorts government behavior, but also guides  government organ reform in an erroneous way.    In order to ensure a healthy development of socialist market  economy, we must take forceful measures to stop power from being  changed into a commodity for entering the market.    First, deepen the reform of government organs, and practice  "self stripping" of quite a large portion of power from  government departments. Under the old system of planned  economy, which was characterized by a high degree of  centralization, government departments relied on administrative  orders and mandatory plans to manage the economy through  allocating funds, materials, and projects. The government not  only took charge of macroeconomic matters, but also took charge  of microeconomic matters. It not only carried out indirect  management, but also carried out direct management, and it did  not give enterprises decisionmaking power, but viewed  enterprises simply as subsidiary organs. This did not meet the  demand of the market economy.    From now on in government  organ reform, we should practice "self stripping" of certain  power from government departments and, according to the demands  of the socialist market economy, change from direct management  to indirect management, change from micromanagement to  macromanagement, and change from allocating funds, materials,  and projects to using economic levers and engaging in planning,  coordination, supervision, and service, so that we can  resolutely give the power and right which originally belonged to  enterprises back to enterprises.    Second, strengthen legislation and law enforcement, and give  appropriate restraint to power. Why has power's invasion of the  market become so rampant? It involves the question of  restraining power which invades the market. To give restraint,  there has to be just legislation and strict law enforcement.  For example, enterprise law, company law, competition law,  securities law, transaction law, taxation law, planning law,  auditing law, budget law, banking law, investment law, foreign  trade law, law governing foreign-funded enterprises, individual  economy law, private economy law, joint-venture economy law, law  on management of state assets, law on protecting the rights and  interests of consumers, law against undue competition, and so  on, are the laws which we should have. However, we still lack  many such laws, and although some laws have been formulated,  they are not perfect, to the extent that in some localities and  domains, power has invaded the market and disrupted the order of  economy, but nothing can be done according to law. In addition,  our law enforcement is not strict enough, and there have been  frequent phenomena of replacing law with power, replacing law  with words, and giving light treatment to serious infringements.  Inadequate legislation and slackened law enforcement means  loopholes for power to invade the market. A new order of  socialist market economy can really be established when there is  no loophole.    Third, change the planned economy system to the market  economy system as soon as possible, and solve problems by the  change of system. Analyzed from the viewpoint of theory, we may  say that under a completely centralized planned management  system, there cannot be any bureaucrat-businessmen, because  under such conditions there can only be bureaucrats, no  businessmen. In a healthy and perfect market economy system,  bureaucrat-businessmen also do not exist, because when they  pursue private benefits they will at the same time infringe upon  the property rights of certain persons and violate certain laws.  Bureaucrat-businessmen are the outcome of a kind of  semiplanned, semimarket, semi-open, and semirestricted economy.  They have emerged under the "double-track system" and through  "fishing in the troubled waters." Therefore, to eliminate  bureaucrat-businessmen, we cannot rely only on administrative  orders, meetings, documents, and even rectification campaigns.  The problem can only be solved by realizing a thorough  transformation from the planned economy system to the market  economy system as fast as possible.    Fourth, wipe out money fetishism and power fetishism, and  eliminate the subconsciousness of power invading the market.  The most direct reason power has so enthusiastically entered  the market comes from the tremendous magic power produced by the  exchange of power and money, whereas the catalyst and  subconsciousness produced by this kind of magic power are money  fetishism and power fetishism. At present, money worship and  power worship among some people cannot get worse. "When you  have money you can order a ghost to push the millstone, when you  have money you can order a ghost to sing a song," and this has  already become the basic sense and "golden rule" among some  people. Therefore, to prevent power from invading the market,  we must resolutely do two kinds of work simultaneously and, as  we vigorously carry out reform and opening up, promote socialist  spiritual civilization construction. We must eliminate the  influence of money fetishism and power fetishism, establish the  correct outlook on power and money, and build a mental Great  Wall preventing power from invading the market.</p>

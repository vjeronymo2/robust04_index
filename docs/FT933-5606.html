			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Simon loses Pounds 53m in first half: Simon passes dividend SIMON Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear, plunged into the red in the first half, with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 52.6m. It also announced yesterday it was passing its interim dividend and talking to its bankers. The group, which has breached one of its covenants, was confident of securing facilities through to the end of next year. The deficit marks the culmination of more than two years of bad news from the group, which has suffered from an ill-fated diversification into environmental engineering, loss-making plant contracts, the recession and rising debts. Mr Michael Davies, who became chairman last month, described the results as 'extremely poor'. Mr Maurice Dixson, who took over as chief executive yesterday, said his main priority would be to reduce net debt to less than Pounds 100m from its current Pounds 143m. Further businesses and properties would be sold. He planned then to identify the strong remaining elements to establish a base for future profits. The first-half loss compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.16m a year earlier when the interim dividend was 5p. Turnover fell from Pounds 242.3m to Pounds 190.8m, including Pounds 5.4m from discontinued activities. Shares slid 15 1/2 p yesterday to close at 57 1/2 p. They have tumbled from nearly 400p in early 1991. Mr Davies said the first half should be seen in three parts. First the group incurred an operating loss of Pounds 6.9m, including Pounds 5.9m of trading losses from businesses now sold. Second, it had made exceptional provisions of Pounds 28.9m for further cost reductions, debt refinancing, potential legal expenses and property write-downs. Third, exceptional charges of Pounds 12.3m had arisen from the disposal of loss-making businesses. In spite of the sale of most of the group's environmental division at the beginning of the year, net borrowings rose to Pounds 133.9m - gearing of 195 per cent - at the end of June because of increased working capital requirements, continuing poor trading and payment of the 1992 dividend. The loss per share was 54.8p, compared with earnings per share of 3.6p. The company, which does not expect to pay a final dividend, made a transfer from reserves of Pounds 55.1m. The powered access equipment division was expected to improve. Parts of the industrial services division were generating both cash and profits. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source at the office of Council of  Ministers Chairman Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas has made a  statement to the Yemeni news agency, SABA'. He said in the  statement that there have been successive improvised and biased  decisions from 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the latest of which is a  decision announced through the Sanaa news media to suspend Prime  Minister Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas and to charge another person  to carry out his duties. Earlier 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih issued a  number of decisions suspending Defense Minister Haytham Qasim  Tahir, Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun, minister of oil and mineral  resources, and Aden Governor Salih Munassar al-Syayli.    The source said this type of decision reflects the state of  bewilderment experienced by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih after his  ill-fated decision to drown Yemen in a bloody war. He pointed  out that these decisions not only contradict the Constitution  which he trampled under foot when he declared the war, but also  reflect the psychology of defeat which has controlled his mind  following the setbacks suffered by the forces of his gang in  more than one military position. He is now trying to patch up  his shaky position before those he promised to occupy Aden  within a few hours.    The source confirmed that these decisions have been rejected  in their entirety because they violate the Constitution and go  against it. He clarified that confidence in the prime minister  can only be withdrawn by the house of deputies. The ministers  cannot be dismissed except publicly and with the prime  minister's consent. When this occurs or when the prime minister  resigns himself, the entire Council of Ministers must be  considered as having resigned.    The source wondered: What can we expect from the man who  ignited the war, the strife, and the civil war? What can we  expect from the man who directs his guns against the citizens  and children and stabs at the very heart of unity? What can we  expect other than these stupid decisions through which he is  implementing his secessionist goals.    The source ridiculed such decisions and said they have no  impact whatsoever after the war decision adopted by 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih. He pointed out that these decisions are  additions to the declaration of war by means of which he  announced the liquidation of unity and the liquidation of  everything that would remind him of it.    The source concluded by saying that all the decisions issued  by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih are constitutionally invalid and are  (?capricious) and unrecognized. He said that the theatrical  farce being implemented by 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his gang  after the war decision cannot fool anybody, particularly as he  cancelled the legitimacy of unity and adopted a secessionist  decision by declaring war on 27 April. It is a decision he will  not be permitted to achieve because unity is the will of the  people, and they will defend it to the last breath of life.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Turkey has welcomed the fact that the UN  International Maritime Organization accepted the package of  rules and proposals to enhance the safety of passages through  the Istanbul and Canakkale Straits.    A Foreign Ministry statement noted that regulating the  traffic in the straits will benefit all interested parties. The  statement remarked that the new statute pertaining to the  passage through the straits was prepared in line with basic  international rules of law, which stipulate that every country  can determine the procedures in the waters under its own  sovereignty in order to ensure maritime safety and environmental  protection. This statute will go into effect on 1 July 1994,  the statement noted, adding that the new statute will continue  to adhere meticulously to the Montreux Convention, as was the  case in the past.</p>

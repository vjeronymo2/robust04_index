			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Markets: National Savings still has an edge - Serious Money NOT SO long ago, a report of a change in National Savings rates would have struggled to qualify as a brief in most newspapers, even on a slow day. Nowadays, it makes the front page. The building societies have been complaining about the excessive competition and the government has caved in twice, once by cutting the return on its First Option bond and now by slashing rates across the range. There is a nice irony here. Most retailers and manufacturers are complaining that British consumers are saving, not spending. But the traditional recipients of British savings, the building societies, are claiming that they are being starved of inflows. One explanation is that consumers have been repaying debt. But the problem is compounded for building societies because they have been trying recently, while interest rates have been high, to favour their borrowers. They know only too well that high mortgage rates depress the housing market and lead to bad debt problems and repossessions. On occasion, as happened in February this year, the societies have cut mortgage rates in anticipation of a reduction in base rates. Since then, mortgage rates have been around 0.7 of a percentage point above base rates, compared with a more normal margin of 1 percentage point. Late in the 1980s, the societies could have made up this margin by penalising savers. At that time, the government was in budget surplus and had no need to offer competitive rates on National Savings. But now the government has to finance a Pounds 28bn to Pounds 30bn budget deficit, National Savings is once more a handy fund-raiser. As we have argued many times, some of the recent National Savings products have looked very good value for savers. And plenty of British savers have agreed. The government has raised Pounds 2.1bn via this route since the start of the financial year. This week, the 37th issue of certificates, which paid 8 per cent per annum tax-free if held for five years, was withdrawn. The new 38th issue will go on sale from August 24, paying 7.5 per cent. But only Pounds 5,000 can be invested in the issue, compared with Pounds 7,500 in the 37th. (An additional Pounds 10,000 can be reinvested from matured certificates immediately.) In line with the new issue of certificates, the overall return on the yearly plan will fall to 7.5 per cent per annum. Series D Capital Bonds, which paid a taxable 10.75 per cent per annum if held for five years, have also been withdrawn. The new Series E, available from August 24, will pay 10 per cent. For basic rate taxpayers, this means the return will be the same as on the 38th issue of certificates - 7.5 per cent. But note that you have to pay tax on this issue before you receive the interest, which is available only when you cash in the bonds. And higher rate taxpayers will do better to buy the 38th issue. The 5th index-linked certificates, which pay a tax-free 4.5 per cent per annum on top of inflation if held for five years, are still on sale. Whether they are a good deal depends if inflation averages above or below 3 per cent between now and 1997. Issue B of children's bonus bonds, which paid 10.9 per cent per annum over five years, has also been withdrawn. The new Issue C will pay 10.1 per cent. There were also cuts in the rates on income bonds (from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent) and on the investment account (from 8.5 per cent to 8.25 per cent). The changes will take effect on September 18 and August 19 respectively. You can now get better (variable) rates at a number of building societies than from National Savings. As the table on page V shows, Bristol &amp; West is paying 10.45 per cent (a net 7.84 per cent) on Pounds 2,000 and 10.9 per cent on Pounds 25,000. There are also some fixed-rate products available, although not for as long as five years. Coventry BS, for example, is paying 10.75 per cent, fixed until October 31 1993, on investments over Pounds 1,000. And some guaranteed income bonds can offer better fixed rates over five years. If you have Pounds 50,000 to invest for that period, you can get 8.6 per cent from Liberty Life. But average savers who keep their money in a major building society will still have to work hard to beat National Savings rates. Take the Nationwide, which yesterday cut rates to savers by around 0.4 of a percentage point. Someone with Pounds 10,000-Pounds 25,000 in its CapitalBuilder account will earn just 9 per cent gross, or 6.75 per cent for a basic rate payer. Indeed, savers will need to be alert to get the best rates over the next few years. For one thing, the Germans are bound to allow European interest rates to fall eventually. And, second, financial institutions are offering ever more sophisticated products which may disappoint unwary investors. That point was emphasised by the Consumers' Association this week in its criticisms of the standard of financial services' advertising as 'abysmal.' Savers should heed its warnings: check the small print, treat claims and statistics with caution, and watch out for what the ads don't say.</p>

			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Saatchi writes off Pounds 600m of goodwill: Group shows underlying profit SAATCHI AND SAATCHI, the world's second largest international advertising group, yesterday wrote off Pounds 600m of goodwill associated with US acquisitions made when the group was expanding in the 1980s. However, excluding the write-offs, the underlying position of the group for 1992 showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 18.9m, against 1991's losses of Pounds 47.2m. The figures were compiled under FRS 3, the new accounting standard. Group revenues grew by 1 per cent last year to Pounds 748m. Trading profits were up 67 per cent at Pounds 34.2m, with operating margins up from 2.8 per cent to 4.6 per cent. Mr Charles Scott, who takes over as chief executive from Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus in April, said he expected operating margins to be 6 per cent this year. Mr Scott said 14 companies within the group incurred losses in 1992, in Japan, Sweden, China and the UK, but their combined losses had been reduced from Pounds 14m to Pounds 7m. Losses of Pounds 13.4m on disposals were reported. Net debt at the year-end was Pounds 194m, up from Pounds 181m. Losses per share were 387.2p, against a restated 58.6p. Excluding the write-offs and losses on disposals, earnings per share were 0.2p (against losses of 15.4p for 1991). No dividend will be paid. The write-offs - which do not affect the group's cash position - particularly relate to the Ted Bates agency, bought for Pounds 450m in 1986. Mr Scott said that Pounds 238m of goodwill remained on the books associated with the 1980s acquisitions. Mr Scott said the group had reduced the number of staff on annual salaries of Pounds 150,000 and above from 300 to 250. Mr Scott denied that British Airways - one of the group's most important global accounts - was considering swapping agencies. Some big US clients had chosen to spend relatively more of their marketing budgets on sales promotions than brand advertising. Analysts are forecasting 1993 pre-tax profits of about Pounds 24m.</p>

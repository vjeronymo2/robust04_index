			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Government may lift broadcast ban on Sinn Fein The abolition of Britain's six-year-old broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein may come closer today amid signs that the government is edging nearer to accepting the IRA ceasefire as permanent. With London under pressure to respond more positively to last month's IRA announcement, Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, is expected to use today's first full cabinet meeting for two months to argue that the ban no longer serves any useful purpose. Conservative rightwingers, however, remain convinced that an early lifting of the ban would be unwise, and any move may be delayed until after next month's Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. The sixth anniversary of the ban's imposition will fall on October 19. Meanwhile, Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, appears ready to conduct a major US propaganda tour, given that his visa is almost certain to be granted. He is pushing ahead with plans to visit at least 10 US cities, including Washington and New York, though he has not yet submitted a visa application. A draft programme of the trip is understood to include meetings with Senator Edward Kennedy, Mr Tom Foley, speaker of the House of Representatives, and officials of the National Security Council who advise President Bill Clinton on Northern Ireland policy. There are also plans for Mr Adams to address high profile forums such as the National Press Club and the Council for Foreign Affairs. Although resigned to the visit, London would be dismayed if Mr Adams succeeded in meeting administration officials. Senior Conservatives are anxious the trip should not coincide with the Tory conference, beginning on October 11. US, UK and Irish officials are thought to be in agreement that Mr Adams' visit should not precede that of other senior political figures who are due in Washington in the next two weeks. This suggests the visit could coincide with the Labour conference, beginning on October 3. Mr Adams is anxious to have his US trip well under way before congressional elections on October 7. As Dublin yesterday welcomed a statement supporting the peace process from IRA prisoners in Belfast's Maze prison, Mr Major indicated the IRA had still not done enough to convince the government that its cessation of violence was for good. At Chequers, he said he hoped the IRA had given up its 'intolerable outrages' of over 25 years. Last night, the Ulster Freedom Fighters group threatened police officers and their families, saying it would take 'affirmative action' if recent violence in loyalist areas and harassment by the RUC did not stop.</p>

			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES: THE MAN OF KABUKI TALKS ABOUT THE WOMEN OF KABUKI  </P> <P> The steps, in turn, were maundering, menacing, mincing. The facial expression  switched from snort to smirk with the rise or fall of a painted eyebrow.  </P> <P> It was a mini-tour of the recondite world of Kabuki, Japan's popular theater,  and with Leonard Pronko as guide, the lecturees at the Pacific Asia Museum in  Pasadena last week were not only instructed but enthralled.  </P> <P> Pronko, professor of theater arts at Pomona College, was the first non-Japanese  to study Kabuki at Japan's National Theater, and his Pasadena insights, many  agreed, were as much fun as a performance.  </P> <P> That a man should interpret the art form was only fitting, since Kabuki now is  an all-male province. Not always, though, Pronko explained.  </P> <P> Originally "a sort of folk dance, with erotic and comic elements added," Kabuki  was introduced in Kyoto in the 1590s by a woman named Okuni. Her troupe was  wholly female, Pronko said, "many of them prostitutes." By 1629, woman dancers  were outlawed "because the important part of the performance was taking place  after the performance."  </P> <P> Even the word Kabuki has changed meaning: "Originally," Pronko said, "it meant  'leaning' -- leaning in the wrong direction -- since the early actors indeed  had strange, and not entirely savory, bents." Now the word means, "song, dance  and skill," the final bowdlerization of a once-bawdy divertissement.  </P> <P> Men now perform stylized male and female roles alike. "They had to devise a way  to suggest not a woman but absolute femininity," Pronko said, "the essence of a  woman." And they did it so well that "nowadays, they say a woman can't possibly  capture that elusive essence." What she would have to do, said Pronko, with a  beguiling tip of the fan, "is imitate a man imitating a woman. . . ."  </P> <P> 14-Year-Old Sets Her Wonders to Music  </P> <P> She has been hard at work composing for six years, and now, at long last, Julie  Yang has won her first major music award.  </P> <P> Julie, of Westwood, was declared Southwest Division winner in the Junior High  School classification of the Music Teachers National Assn./Columbia Pictures  Publications Student Composition contest -- in effect, crowning Julie as the  best young composer in a six-state area: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada,  New Mexico and Utah.  </P> <P> Her winning composition was "Six Variations of Wonders," written for solo piano  -- "because I play the piano myself." (She also plays cello with the Junior  Philharmonic Orchestra of California, sings soprano with the Los Angeles  Mandarin Baptist Youth Choir and dabbles enthusiastically in a variety of  pursuits, from the sciences to "general school life.")  </P> <P> Julie, who was born in Taiwan and came to the United States in 1984, describes  her composition as limning "the different stages of my life, since I was 4 --  kind of like flashbacks of feeling, remembering how I felt. As a child, you  really don't know what's coming up. Not that every period is a 'wonder,' but in  a different sense, you're always wondering."  </P> <P> Has Julie, then, wondered about life as a professional musician? "Not  necessarily," she says. "I enjoy many things. Music certainly is a way of  expressing myself, but not the only way. I may well go to UCLA -- that's where  my brother is -- but I really don't know what I'll be doing in the future.  Remember, I'm not even 15 yet."  </P> <P> One More Time, Counselors, From the Top  </P> <P> They're human after all. Then again, one might have expected a lighter side to  men and women who spend so much time at the bar.  </P> <P> Over the weekend, the Orange County Bar Assn.'s Theater Wing presented "Law  Revue '89," a musical comedy, in the Chapman College Auditorium, a show that  demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that judges too can tap dance.  </P> <P> "You understand," lawyer William Jackson said before the show, "that it's to  raise money for charity, for the Orange County Bar Foundation's community  programs. But at the same time, it is great fun."  </P> <P> "We take a lot of (San Francisco lawyer) Morris Bobrow's musical parody, then  we intersperse it with talent of our own," said attorney Karen Taillon,  theater-wing chair. "We have an all-attorney barbershop quartet doing 'Law and  Motion Here I Come,' 'Justice Rose,' a few others. The chorus line is all  judges, and yes, they do tap-dance. There's a number called 'Brush Up Your  Motions' and another one: 'Mamas, Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Lawyers.'  "  </P> <P> Alas, no "Sue City Sue" or "Bill Bailiff Won't You Please Come Home," but there  was a series of comedy sketches whose chronology, as seen by lawyers, was  telling: "Singles in America," "Our Love," then "Visitation Blues.  </P> <P> "There's another benefit to a show like this," Jackson said: "getting judges  and commissioners and attorneys together in a social venue. Remember, sometimes  we too have an adversarial relationship. We don't always get along with those  guys either."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Manner of submitting proposals. Proposals and all supporting instruments must be submitted on the forms furnished by the Owner and must be delivered in a sealed envelope addressed to the Owner. The name and address of the Bidder, its license number if a license is required by the State, and the date and hour of the opening of bids must appear on the envelope in which the Proposal is submitted. Proposals must be filled in in ink or typewritten. No alterations or interlineations will be permitted, unless made before submission, and initialed and dated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Familiarity with conditions. Prior to the submission of the Proposal the Bidder shall make and shall be deemed to have made a careful examination of the site of the Project and of the Plans, Specifications, Construction Drawings, and forms of Contractor's Proposal and Contractor's Bond on file with the Secretary of the Owner and with the Engineer, and shall become informed as to the location and nature of the proposed construction, the transportation facilities, the kind and character of soil and terrain to be encountered, the kind of facilities required before and during the construction of the Project, general local conditions and all other matters that may affect the cost and the time of completion of the Project. Bidders will be required to comply with all applicable statutes, regulations, etc., including those pertaining to the licensing of contractors, and the so-called ``Kick-back Statute'' (48 Stat. 948) and regulations issued pursuant thereto.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Proposals will be accepted only from those prequalified bidders invited by the Owner to submit a proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Alternate designs. The Owner reserves the right to confine its consideration of the several bids to one type of design regardless of alternate types of design which may be specified in the Plans and Specifications and offered in the Proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The Time for Completion of Construction of the Project shall be as specified by the Engineer in the Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Bid bond. Each Proposal must be accompanied by a Bid Bond in the form attached or a certified check on a bank that is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, payable to the order of the Owner, in an amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the maximum bid price. Each Bidder agrees, provided its Proposal is one of the three low Proposals, that, by filing its Proposal together with such Bid Bond or check in consideration of the owner's receiving and considering such Proposals, said Proposal shall be firm and binding upon each such Bidder and such Bid Bond or check shall be held by the Owner until a Proposal is accepted and a satisfactory Contractor's Bond is furnished (where required) by the successful Bidder and such acceptance has been approved by the Administrator, or for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date hereinbefore set for the opening of Proposals, whichever period shall be the shorter. If such Proposal is not one of the three low Proposals, the Bid Bond or check will be returned in each instance within a period of ten (10) days to the Bidder furnishing same.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. Contractor's bond. The successful Bidder will be required to execute two additional counterparts of the Proposal and, for a Contract in excess of $100,000, to furnish a Contractor's Bond in triplicate in the form attached hereto with sureties listed by the United States Treasury Department as Acceptable Sureties, in a penal sum not less than the contract price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Failure to furnish contractor's bond. Should the successful Bidder fail or refuse to execute such counterparts or to furnish a Contractor's Bond (where required) within ten (10) days after written notification of the acceptance of the Proposal by the Owner, the Bidder will be considered to have abandoned the Proposal. In such event, the Owner shall be entitled (a) to enforce the Bid Bond in accordance with its terms, or (b) if a certified check has been delivered with the Proposal, to retain from the proceeds of the certified check, the difference (not exceeding the amount of the certified check) between the amount of the Proposal and such larger amount for which the Owner may in good faith contract with another party to construct the Project. The term ``Successful Bidder'' shall be deemed to include any Bidder whose Proposal is accepted after another Bidder has previously refused or has been unable to execute the counterparts or to furnish a satisfactory Contractor's Bond (where required.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Contract is entire agreement. The Contract to be effected by the acceptance of the Proposal shall be deemed to include the entire agreement between the parties thereto, and the Bidder shall not claim any modification thereof resulting from any representation or promise made at any time by any officer, agent or employee of the Owner or by any other person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Minor irregularities. The Owner reserves the right to waive minor irregularities or minor errors in any Proposal, if it appears to the Owner that such irregularities or errors were made through inadvertence. Any such irregularities or errors so waived must be corrected on the Proposal in which they occur prior to the acceptance thereof by the Owner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. Balanced bid. The Owner reserves the right to reject any or all Proposals. The attention of Bidders is specially called to the desirability of a proper balance between prices for labor and materials and between the total prices for the respective Construction Units. Lack of such balance may be considered as a reason for rejecting a Proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Discrepancy in unit prices. Where the unit prices in the Contractor's Proposal are separated into three columns designated as ``Labor,'' ``Materials'' and ``Labor and Materials,'' and where a discrepancy appears between the sum shown in the ``Labor and Materials'' column and the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column and the ``Materials'' column, the correct addition of the sums appearing in the ``Labor'' column and the ``Materials'' column shall control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

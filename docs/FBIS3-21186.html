			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Mitsui &amp; Co. (Naohiko Kumagai, president) will  offer  patent information services. It has developed KISPAT, a patent  information service system using ISDN. It will begin a gazatte  of patent applications in December and a patent announcement  service in April 1994. This is related to the Patent Office's  allowing re-publishing of its patent applications gazette as of  January 1993 and its patent announcements as of January 1994.    Kokusai Information Services, a joint venture between Mitsui  and the telephone company KDD, will sell the database services.  It will be the first patent database transmission service using  ISDN in Japan. Most users of patent information only need about  one to two percent of the available patent information. The  Patent Office's CD-ROM includes much unnecessary information and  time is needed to find the necessary information. Under the new  system, the necessary information will be entered two days after  the publication of the CD-ROM at one-third the cost. Moreover,  not just the patent division, but also laboratories and  individuals can access the original database from a PC.    Japan is a ``patent kingdom.'' Our annual total of more than  500,000 patent and utility model applications make up about  40%  of the world's total.    The Patent Office has already been moving toward eliminating  paper. In October 1992 it accepted the report of the information  subcommittee of the Patent Office's Industrial Property Council  and it began electronic publishing in CD-ROM form in January  1993 as well as allowing re-publishing of the electronic gazette.    Mitsui decided this was a promising business, so it began  developing a new system. The service will begin in December with  the patent gazette which publishes patents one and a half years  after application. In April 1994, following the Patent Office's  permission granted as of January 1994, it will add the patent  announcements which appear three months before a patent is  granted.</p>

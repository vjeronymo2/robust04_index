			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of 125 countries tomorrow will sign in  Marrakesh, Morocco, a trade liberation agreement that will mark  the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT talks. After seven  years of negotiations, new rules have been established to govern  world trade. The agreement sets up rules for establishing  tariffs, financial services, and the overall trade spectrum that  range from agriculture to intellectual property.    Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim, who is in  Marrakesh,  said the agreement will result in an average reduction of 40  percent in the tariffs of developed countries. In his opinion,  the agreement will benefit Brazilian exports. The agreement  also will benefit areas that had been outside the GATT  framework, such as agriculture and textiles.    [Begin Amorim recording] In the case of agriculture, this  agreement will be very important for Brazil because our exports  of some agricultural products and even agroindustrial products  such as soybean, oil soybean, and chicken were competing with  subsidized products that came primarily from the EC and the  United States. Subsidies will not be eliminated, but instead of  continuing to grow, this trend will now be reversed and  subsidies will have to decline. [end recording]    Amorim noted that the World Trade Organization, which will  be  created by the GATT member countries, will be charged with  supervising the agreement.    Today Amorim addressed the GATT general assembly and  emphasized the agreement's positive aspects and Brazil's hope  that developed countries would discontinue protectionist and  arbitrary measures.</p>

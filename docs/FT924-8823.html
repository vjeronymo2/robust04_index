			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Monday Interview: Charity's her middle name - Julia Cleverdon, chief executive of Business in the Community, talks to Michael Cassell Any executive who thinks that signing up for Business in the Community just means cucumber sandwiches on the lawn at Highgrove House is in for a nasty shock,' warns Julia Cleverdon. The chief executive of Bitc, the organisation formed 10 years ago to convince companies that broader community responsibilities go hand in hand with making an honest buck, knows that having the Prince of Wales for a president can attract the wrong sort of people. 'He is well aware that he is a bit like a fish hook, intended to catch businessmen. But once they find themselves marching behind him around a council estate, the glamour quickly wears off. We make them work hard.' So any companies preparing to enact an elaborate charade as public benefactor in the hope of effortlessly winning princely plaudits can, says Cleverdon, forget it. The executives wading through muddy construction sites or visiting inmates at Pentonville prison are all participating in Seeing is Believing, the latest Bitc programme intended to show industry leaders first-hand what they can do for their community. A decade ago, when Bitc was established after the inner-city riots in Toxteth and Brixton, the hands-on involvement of companies in regenerating the communities they served commercially was still seen primarily as a philanthropic gesture. The Bitc mission to help what the Prince has described as Britain's 'bruised communities' is based on working partnerships with national and local government, voluntary organisations, schools and colleges. According to Cleverdon: 'The more enlightened companies would let the chairman's wife decide where to direct whatever limited funds were available. Now employees at every level are getting involved. Many companies see it as a sort of corporate glue to bind together their employees.' The woman whose middle name, literally, is Charity, dismisses any suggestion that Bitc might be viewed by sceptics as little more than a bunch of well-meaning 'do-gooders'. 'The generation of executives who started the process of active community involvement are now coasting into gold-plated retirement. Their successors are leading a revolution in attitudes which sees the issue in terms of a real business benefit.' Bitc believes that, increasingly, employees expect their companies to demonstrate broader responsibilities: 'Graduate entrants are concerned about corporate ethics and want to know what a business actually does for its community. Enough companies have got the message to convince me that we are on an unstoppable train.' The theory championed by the Prince of Wales, by Cleverdon and by the band of 400 top-ranking executives who help carry the banner, is that companies which care about their community will ultimately prosper in it. In Cleverdon's words: 'Make profits on six days and reinvest some of them in your community on the seventh. If your customers think well of you, you will be rewarded.' Companies can give hard cash, equipment, staff or professional experience to help a range of initiatives targeted on local economic development, the environment and education. Some contribute at least a half per cent of pre-tax profits or one per cent of dividends to community-based projects. But Bitc's emphasis is as much on muscle-power as money. 'We expect performance from those who pledge help but it is not a matter of just throwing money around. It is cost-effective action we want', Cleverdon says. Hotel groups have given blankets to hostels for the homeless, derelict community centres have been rebuilt, and schools and colleges receive equipment and advice from future employers. The pressures of recession have recently caused a few departures by companies with more pressing priorities, such as Jaguar and Rosehaugh, the property group. But overall, participation has increased this year: 'We expected more casualties but companies clearly believe our message remains relevant, whatever their short-term prospects,' says Cleverdon. Excited by the challenge of a good campaign and fascinated by what makes business tick, she is now battling to ensure that Bitc is not cast as an exclusive club for the business top brass who started it. . 'It is not just for blue-chip companies with millions at their behest. We have a small Lincolnshire builder, for example, who got a good name locally by agreeing to provide affordable housing for first-time buyers. As a direct result, he's won more work.' While Bitc tries to encourage more small and medium-sized companies to join in, it is simultaneously trying to extend its influence in larger companies by getting more middle-managers involved. 'You can get all sorts of things done at the bottom and at the top. The challenge is galvanising the marsh-mallow layer of middle management; if you fail to achieve change in the middle, everything else is a lot of froth.' Born 42 years ago into the arty, London home of a BBC Radio third programme producer - 'Dad encouraging Dylan Thomas to write Under Milk Wood, that sort of thing' - Cleverdon's view on the key to effective management was formed early. As a Cambridge history graduate who envisaged a career in compassion, she ended up at British Leyland's Swindon assembly plant in the industrial relations department. 'There were 25,000 people on one site, 42 trade unions and absolutely no communication between men and management,' she recalls. 'I sympathised with the shop stewards.' She suggested to one lugubrious boss that some of the men could be taken to the London motor show to see the company's new models. She was told to stop trying to change things. Cleverdon changed her job instead, moving to the Industrial Society in 1973 with the encouragement of John Garnett, its director and her future husband. The marriage made her stepmother to Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary. She arrived at Bitc in 1988 to mastermind the organisation's efforts to improve links between industry and education. Two years later she became responsible for a clutch of campaigns designed to give Bitc fresh direction and momentum. Last year, Cleverdon became chief executive. The organisation she now runs will be increasingly happy to take a back seat and let companies do most of the running. 'It is not our profile which will need raising but that of the companies who do the work and who can encourage others to follow,' Cleverdon says. 'The real answer to success now lies in the amount of muscle which companies employ in improving the level of business involvement in their communities. The work does not necessarily have to be done by us. We may be the catalyst but we want people, talent and resources increasingly injected directly into the community,' she says. Despite Bitc's success in spreading the gospel, Cleverdon says that British business still has some way to go to emulate the enthusiasm and level of community involvement by US companies. 'American business thinks it is fun to be involved and the spirit is infectious. Here, secondees from companies working in schools are called 'AOTs' - adults other than teachers. In the US they are called business partners and wear little pins to prove it.' Britain is, however, being asked to advise EC officials on what member states can learn from its experiences. Bitc is also noisily banging the 'equal opportunities for women' drum, with some success. Though the Opportunity 2000 campaign, aimed at improving the position of women in the workforce, was the fruit of the organisation's own hard work, it has been publicly hijacked by Mr John Major's government. Next week will see the results of its first year's efforts. Cleverdon brushes off the government's decision to muscle in and prefers to look ahead: 'We struck a nerve in the 1980s which will be increasingly relevant in the 1990s. If the nanny state continues to be rolled back, there is a big role to play for an organisation which can help business and community think as one.' PERSONAL PROFILE 1950 Born London.

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEPATITIS DRUG SHORTAGE INTENSIFIES;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: MILITARY NEEDS, STOCKPILING CUT INTO ALREADY THIN COMMERCIAL  SUPPLIES. NEW DEPLOYMENT ADDS TO THE PRESSURE.  </P> <P> U.S. health officials voiced concern Friday that the massive deployment of  troops to the Persian Gulf will sharply worsen a nationwide shortage of  hepatitis-fighting gamma globulin in doctor's offices, hospitals and public  health clinics.  </P> <P> The shortage, which began last summer amid a hepatitis epidemic, intensified  after the Pentagon required that troops dispatched to the Middle East be  inoculated against possible exposure to the infectious disease.  </P> <P> In addition, large quantities of the antibody-rich blood serum extract have had  to be stockpiled in the event war breaks out in the Persian Gulf and the gamma  globulin is needed to treat casualties.  </P> <P> Until recently, states were able to alleviate the commercial shortage of gamma  globulin by sharing supplies, even though one of two major manufacturers  suddenly abandoned the market.  </P> <P> But new alarms went off after President Bush announced Thursday that more than  200,000 additional American troops will be sent to the Middle East.  </P> <P> "There is a sense now that we may have an absolute shortage" of gamma globulin  that cannot be cured by shifting supplies around, said Dr. Harold Margolis,  chief of the hepatitis branch at the federal Centers for Disease Control in  Atlanta.  </P> <P> Officials at the California Department of Health Services sent a memo to  counterparts in other states last month, warning of a growing shortage. Noting  that "no national guidelines have yet been issued on this matter," the  California officials suggested that local health departments plan to reserve  gamma globulin for "high-priority uses."  </P> <P> Such high priorities include people recently exposed to hepatitis-A; pregnant  women and children under 2 years old recently exposed to measles, and people  going on business to high-risk hepatitis areas abroad.  </P> <P> Those traveling on pleasure or vacation should be referred to private doctors  "to try to get" gamma globulin shots, said the memo, signed by Drs. George W.  Rutherford and Loring Dales, heads of the department's infectious disease and  immunization units.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills physician Elsie Giorgi, who every week inoculates six to 10  patients headed for trips abroad, protested that gamma globulin prices had shot  up from $10 per two-dose vial to more than $30.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Giorgi also expressed the belief that people who need  the drug to battle life-threatening immune deficiencies are especially  jeopardized by the shortage.  </P> <P> But Charles Darwall of San Francisco, a former patient of Giorgi with such a  condition, said he had determined that intravenous gamma globulin, which he and  a small number of others like him rely on, is not in short supply.  </P> <P> Instead, the shortage affects intramuscular gamma globulin, a more frequently  used type of serum that is injected into muscles to ward off hepatitis and  other diseases.  </P> <P> Federal officials said that public health authorities in Georgia, Wisconsin,  New York and other states are concerned about the possibility of dwindling  supplies and rising prices amid recent hepatitis outbreaks.  </P> <P> Alluding to the jump in gasoline prices that followed the deployment of troops  to the Persian Gulf, New York state epidemiologist Stan Kondracki said that  reports of increasing gamma globulin prices "sounds like the gas situation and  it bothers me. If there is only one company supplying most of the stuff, there  is no cost competition."  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for Armour Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., which  manufactures nearly all gamma globulin used in the United States, declined to  discuss prices. But she said the firm has begun an around-the-clock, fourfold  increase in production to deal with sharply escalating military demands and the  deepening commercial shortage.  </P> <P> "Our supply to the commercial sector has diminished by about 55%," said the  spokeswoman, Jane Green. "About 85% to 90% of our supply is going to the  military now."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Pentagon agency that is buying the drug from Armour said  the price has stayed at $2.32 per vial. One vial provides two soldiers immunity  from hepatitis for about six months.  </P> <P> As of the end of October, the Pentagon's Defense Personnel Support Center in  Philadelphia had ordered 389,686 vials for Operation Desert Shield, said Terri  White. And on Friday, officials were scurrying to order more.  </P> <P> When the gulf crisis began in early August, the Pentagon put out an urgent call  for 10,000 vials of gamma globulin. Within three days, the National Wholesale  Druggists Assn. had rounded up all the stockpiles of its members.  </P> <P> The Defense Department "was unable to locate any of the drug in its own  warehouses and had already acquired modest amounts from the two domestic  manufacturers," according to a press release issued by the trade group. "The  drug companies were making more, but it would take up to two weeks to resupply"  the Pentagon.  </P> <P> "Within 24 hours, more than 98% of NWDA's members located in excess of 23,000  multi-dose vials in their inventories and reported that at least 3,000 more  vials had already been bought by local military bases," the release said.  </P></p>

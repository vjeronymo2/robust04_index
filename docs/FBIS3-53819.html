			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 19 Jan (MENA)--Dr. Usamah al-Baz, first  Foreign Ministry under secretary and director of the President's  Office for Political Affairs, has stated that the summit between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton was very important and that the  Egyptian Government was aware of this from the beginning.    In an interview with Egyptian television on the "Good  Morning  Egypt" program today, Dr. al-Baz said that President Mubarak had  a role in convening this meeting and in pushing matters forward.  The meeting was held without delay because Egypt realized that  such a meeting could produce positive results.    He added that Egypt is working toward one comprehensive  agreement and not just agreements on some fronts. He stressed  that Syria is one of the important parties in the peace process  and that without movement on the Syrian track progress on the  other tracks could be slow.    Dr. al-Baz said that the al-Asad-Clinton summit has had a  positive impact, but this does not mean that an agreement was  reached on specific issues to which Israel and Syria would be  committed. The overall atmosphere and the assurances that could  have been made in this meeting will, in our view, result in  progress on the Syrian track. Dr. al-Baz expressed the hope  that progress will be made on the Syrian track in the next few  months.    Regarding Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat's visit to  Cairo tomorrow, Thursday, Dr. al-Baz said that this meeting is  also important because, despite the signing of the  Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles, first in Oslo on  20 August and then in Washington on 13 September, the  declaration is general and negotiations are needed to ensure its  implementation. These negotiations are extremely important.  [passage omitted]    Dr. al-Baz also discussed the domestic situation. He  emphasized that among President Mubarak's priorities is finding  solutions to economic problems, particularly unemployment and  price increases. Plans to upgrade education are also at the top  of his priorities.    Concluding his interview, Dr. al-Baz said that attention is  now being focused on internal and external issues to improve the  internal situation.</p>

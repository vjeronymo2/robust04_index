			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / Sharp rise for Rover Group car sales in Germany Car sales by Rover Group in Germany shot up by 51 per cent in the first quarter of this year, during which it became a subsidiary of BMW, the German carmaker, John Griffiths writes. Rover announced the increase at the opening of the Turin motor show, where it also reported a first-quarter sales increase of 30.6 per cent in Italy, in spite of a fall of 11.2 per cent in Italy's new-car market overall during the same period. Mr John Towers, Rover's chief executive, did not directly link the German sales rise and Rover's change of ownership, but said the surge was 'clear evidence' of increased awareness of Rover in continental Europe.</p>

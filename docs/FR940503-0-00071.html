			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Housing projects with project-based section 8 rental certificates, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Section 8 tenant-based assistance programs (rental vouchers and certificates).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Assisted Under a Contract for Assistance Under Section 8(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects have unassisted units and assisted units. These projects are often referred to as ``partially assisted projects.'' Because the statutory definition of ``covered section 8 housing'' only applies to housing that is under a contract for assistance, the subtitle D system of preferences would not apply to unassisted units in a partially assisted project. Additionally, nothing in this regulation establishes a cap on the number of unassisted units for disabled families in a partially assisted project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this regulation does not apply to the unassisted units in a partially assisted project, this regulation also does not relieve any owner of any project, including the owner of a partially assisted project from complying with the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the implementing regulations for these statutes, or any other applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, including the requirements of the National Housing Act, with respect to the assisted or unassisted units. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, owners may provide the preferences in accordance with this interim rule, with respect to the assisted units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Originally Designed Primarily for Occupancy by Elderly Families <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final statutory requirement for qualification as a ``covered section 8 housing project'' is that the project must have been originally designed for occupancy by elderly families. The statute does not define the term ``originally'' or define the phrase ``originally designed for occupancy by elderly families.'' However, the House Report offers some insight on this subject. The House Report suggests that to qualify as housing originally designed for occupancy by elderly families, the owner of the project must have expressed an intent to create housing for elderly tenants when the developer negotiated with the Department for Federal financial assistance. (H.R. Rept. No. 760, 102d Cong. 2d Sess. at 141 (1992).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the various types of housing projects covered by this interim rule were developed under several different programs, and over a period of time which spans almost two decades, there is no uniform documentation at the Department which evidences the population group to be served by a project. In many instances, the application in response to a notice of funding availability (NOFA) shows that a project was designed as an elderly housing project. However, an indication of the population group to be served by the housing project does not always appear in any one document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, because one of the previous definitions of ``elderly families'' in section 3(b) of the 1937 Act included disabled families, it is not always clear from documents that indicate a project was developed for ``elderly families'' whether the project for elderly families was intended to mean housing for the broader eligible category of families (i.e., elderly families and disabled families) or for families who qualified by virtue of age alone. Further confusion may be added by the fact that for most of the period when this housing was being developed, the Department policy required all housing for the elderly (defined by age) to incorporate certain accessible features and to design a certain percentage of the units to be accessible for persons with physical disabilities. Typically, these units were made available to eligible families with physical disabilities, regardless of age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, in establishing whether a project was originally designed primarily for occupancy by elderly families within the meaning of subtitle D, two distinctions must be drawn: (1) The project was designed primarily for elderly families (as opposed to non-elderly families); and (2) the project was designed for elderly families (i.e., seniors), and not designed for elderly families under the broader meaning of this term, which formerly included elderly families and disabled families.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / CBI hopes for Pounds 350m Ulster peace dividend Peace in Northern Ireland could release Pounds 350m a year from the security budget within five years to help economic development in the province, the Confederation of British Industry says today. A report prepared by the CBI Northern Ireland over the past six months and released two weeks into the IRA ceasefire says a permanent cessation of violence and a political settlement could have a profound impact on the local economy. The CBI calls on the British government to develop a strategy which maintains existing public-expenditure levels but gradually redirects spending on law and order into a programme of wealth creation to offset job losses among security-related activities. The CBI warns that cuts in expenditure on security could mean substantial job losses and a sharp reduction in the number of army personnel in the province. Security spending in the province was almost Pounds 1bn last year, nearly three times the per-capita level in the rest of Britain. The knock-on effect could also mean extensive job losses. But the CBI also estimates that any losses could be offset by the creation of 29,000 jobs and up to 20,000 vocational training places by 1999. It says, however, that significantly higher levels of employment growth might be feasible given a revival of the province's declining manufacturing base. The report suggests some jobs would come as a result of a rise in inward investment. In the past 20 years external corporate investors have created 500 jobs a year in Ulster and the CBI says this could now rise within two or three years to at least 2,000. Other jobs, it says, should also emerge in the tourism industry, about 3,000 in the short term and up to 10,000 in the longer term. Any rise in funding for education and training might add another 1,500 jobs by 1999 and there would also be more in transport infrastructure, housing improvement and health and environmental services. Mr Doug Riley, chairman of CBI Northern Ireland, said that Ulster's business community believed the province was 'entering a new era' which would have to be built on co-operation. The CBI says the government will have to develop clear, long-term policies for public expenditure in full partnership with the private sector if it is to reinforce the benefits of peace. Maintaining high public spending in the province will be essential. Peace - a Challenging New Era. CBI Northern Ireland, Fanum House, 108 Great Victoria St, Belfast BT2 7PD. Free.</p>

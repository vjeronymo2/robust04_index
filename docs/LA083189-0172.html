			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO-CHOICE UNIT TARGETS FOOD OUTLET  </P> <P> The battle over abortion moved Wednesday to a Los Angeles fast-food restaurant  -- a Carl's Jr. outlet -- where 100 pro-choice picketers protested the  financial support that the founder of the Orange County-based chain has given  to anti-abortion efforts.  </P> <P> The picketers described the late-afternoon action as part of a national  strategy to fight back against major funders of anti-abortion organizations,  including Carl's Jr. founder Carl Karcher and Domino's Pizza magnate Thomas S.  Monaghan.  </P> <P> Carrying placards that read, "Keep Abortion Legal" and "Carl Thinks Women Are  Meat," the picketers marched outside a Carl's Jr. restaurant at Western Avenue  and Sunset Boulevard.  </P> <P> "They are taking money from the very people that they are using the money  against," said Tammy Bruce, spokeswoman for the Fired Up for Choice abortion  rights group, which organized the rally. "We have a choice and it is not to  feed into that."  </P> <P> Motivated in part by a July U.S. Supreme Court decision that opened the way for  states to limit access to abortion, once largely reactive abortion rights  groups are intensifying their lobbying efforts and increasingly conducting  demonstrations.  </P> <P> Kathy Spillar, national coordinator of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, said  the Carl's Jr. rally "is one of the first. But you'll see this happening more  often."  </P> <P> The protesters did not disrupt business inside the restaurant but did shout  slogans and tried to persuade people not to go inside.  </P> <P> One customer, who refused to give her name, said she is pro-choice and, because  of the protest, will think twice before eating at Carl's Jr. again. But she  added, "I don't think it's a benefit to them disturbing anyone when they're  eating."  </P> <P> Spokewomen for Carl's Jr. and Domino's said Wednesday that the boycotts are  misguided, since donations made to anti-abortion groups have come from  individual executives rather than from the corporations.  </P> <P> Carl Karcher Enterprises Inc., parent firm of Carl's Jr. restaurants, issued a  three-paragraph statement Wednesday saying that allegations that "a set part of  every dollar spent at Carl's Jr. is given to the pro-life movement is simply  not true."  </P> <P> At most, said Karcher Enterprises spokeswoman Patricia Parks, the firm itself  has donated several hundred dollars to candidates and organizations associated  with the anti-abortion movement. In the last five years, she added, no such  contributions have been made directly by Karcher Enterprises to Operation  Rescue or other such organizations.  </P> <P> At the same time, Parks said, "It's true that Mr. Karcher has been very open  and public regarding his support of the pro-life philosophy.  </P> <P> "Mr. Karcher is not going to change his views, so we expect that the opposition  against him will continue," she said. " . . . (But) from the company's  perspective, we believe Mr. Karcher and the company shouldn't be punished for  exercising his right to freedom of speech."  </P> <P> Over the last two decades, anti-abortion groups have waged similar boycotts of  pharmaceutical firms that market drugs designed to induce abortions.  </P></p>

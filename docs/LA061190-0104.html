			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COURT STRIKES DOWN NEW FLAG LAW;  </P> <P> 5-4 RULING EXPECTED TO SPARK CONGRESSIONAL BATTLE ON CONSTITUTION  </P> <P> The Supreme Court today struck down a new federal law that outlaws burning the  American flag. "Punishing desecration of the flag dilutes the very freedom that  makes this emblem so revered," the court said.  </P> <P> The court's 5-4 decision in the flag case indicated the divisiveness of the  emotional issue. The ruling is certain to touch off a political battle in  Congress to pass a constitutional amendment protecting the flag from  desecration.  </P> <P> In a split identical to a ruling last year on the flag-burning issue, the  justices said the Flag Protection Act of 1989 violates freedom of expression  guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Writing for the  majority, Justice William J. Brennan called it a "bedrock" constitutional  guarantee.  </P> <P> President Bush said he would intensify his efforts to win approval of a  constitutional amendment banning flag-burning. "Some of us said ahead of time  that the legislative approach would not be upheld. Apparently, the court  decided that," he said.  </P> <P> Speaking to reporters after a Rose Garden ceremony honoring drug-free schools,  Bush said he would "continue to press for what I strongly believe is in the  public interest."  </P> <P> Congressional leaders had said that if the law were declared invalid, they  would move quickly for votes in the House and Senate on a constitutional  amendment to protect Old Glory from burning or desecration.  </P> <P> That move is expected to inject the issue into this fall's congressional and  state legislative campaigns.  </P> <P> A constitutional amendment would require approval by two-thirds of the members  of the House and Senate and then ratification by 38 state legislatures. The  First Amendment has not been altered in 199 years.  </P> <P> "We are aware that desecration of the flag is deeply offensive to many,"  Brennan wrote.  </P> <P> But, quoting from the court's earlier ruling, he said, "If there is a bedrock  principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not  prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself  offensive or disagreeable."  </P> <P> Brennan noted that the government has said there is a national consensus in  favor of banning flag burning. "Even assuming such a consensus exists, any  suggestion that the government's interest in suppressing speech becomes more  weighty as popular opposition to that speech grows is foreign to the First  Amendment," he said.  </P> <P> Justice John Paul Stevens, in a dissenting opinion, said the government has a  legitimate interest in banning flag burning.  </P> <P> "The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality and tolerance --  ideas that Americans have passionately defended and debated throughout our  history," he said. "The flag embodies the spirit of our national commitment to  those ideals."  </P> <P> In the 1989 case, the court struck down a Texas law banning flag burning. It  was that year-old opinion that prompted Congress to approve the federal law  declared unconstitutional today.  </P></p>

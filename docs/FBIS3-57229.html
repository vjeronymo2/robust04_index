The conference approved a program of actions "Ukraine's path  toward economic revival, a civil society and civilized state," a  declaration about the aims and principles of the bloc's activity  and an appeal to Ukraine's citizens. At the basis of these  documents lies the assertion of the indisputability of immediate  economic reforms in Ukraine and of normalizing economic  relations with Russia and other CIS countries. At the next  conference which is planned for the end of February in  Dnepropetrovsk, there will be a gathering of parliamentary  candidates who have been nominated and supported by the bloc.    At a news conference after the end of the assembly, people's  deputy and co-founder of the bloc Volodymyr Hrynyov, stressed:  Democratic and centrist forces do not have the right to lose the  upcoming elections; young and energetic political leaders from  the regions where, in his opinion, the state's new economic  policy will be formed, should be elected to the new parliament.</p>

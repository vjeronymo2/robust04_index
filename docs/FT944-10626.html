			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Pay-TV talks get nowhere Last-minute talks to win approval for a cable and pay-TV venture between German media group Bertelsmann, the Kirch Group and Deutsche Telekom have failed, a European Union official claimed yesterday. The official, who asked not to be named said: 'It's a clear-cut case, so . . . it will also be a clear-cut answer from the (European) Commission that this cannot go on.' Earlier, Commission officials had said that the joint venture could still win EU backing if last-minute contacts between Bertelsmann, Kirch and Deutsche Telekom yielded results. Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, has recommended that Brussels block the venture known as Media Service GmbH. Mr Van Miert argues that MSG will effectively lock other competitors out of the multimedia market. Bertelsmann is Germany's largest media company and helped launch the country's first pay-TV channel, Premiere, which boasts 800,000 subscribers. The Kirch Group holds shares in Premiere and has the largest German-language film library. Deutsche Telekom, Germany's telephone monopoly, controls the country's cable-TV market, which has 14m subscribers. AP, Brussels</p>

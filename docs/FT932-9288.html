			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television The usual undemanding Friday night schedule. It's good news for voyeurs with the return of Through the Keyhole (ITV, 7pm) in which the much caricatured David Frost and the even more caricatured Loyd Grossman join forces to take a prying camera into the homes of semi-celebrities, while nosy panellists try and guess the name of the house owner. Also a return for Rides (BBC1, 9.30pm), the tribulations of an all-female minicab firm. Am I alone in finding Have I Got News For You (BBC2, 10pm) unwatchable? The desperate attempts of the regulars to find innuendo in every item; the embarrassed silences of the guests; and the hysterical baying of the audience make it a masterpiece of artificial pretension. A surfeit of self-congratulation continues with Clive Anderson Talks Back (C4, 10.30pm). The witty barrister makes sure he has the punchlines, treating his guests as fall guys. Anyone who failed to get a ticket for Leonard Cohen's Albert Hall concerts this week can catch the lugubrious Canadian on Later with Jools Holland (BBC2, 11.15pm).</p>

			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / Dockers lose reinstatement case BRITAIN'S longest industrial tribunal case was finally resolved yesterday when the Court of Appeal ruled against the reinstatement of 12 employees of Tilbury Docks who lost their jobs with the Port of London Authority because of their union work. This overturned an industrial tribunal ruling that had ordered the reinstatement and awarded payments and costs that would have taken compensation, including redundancy pay for some of the workers, as high as Pounds 100,000. The Court of Appeal quashed the order - in effect reducing the compensation available by between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000 for the longer-serving highest earners. The court ruled that it was impractical for the Port of London Authority to re-engage the activists who were sacked in 1989. The industrial tribunal ran for a record 197 days between 1989 and 1992 before finding that an original 19 shop stewards and activists of the TGWU general union had been dismissed on the grounds of their trade union activities following the abolition of the dock labour scheme. Mr Ken Reid, TGWU regional secretary, said: 'The lads are disappointed as you would expect. 'There is nothing worse than going 4 1/2 years with expectations high and having them dashed by three judges who have never worked in a ship's hold in their life.' Since the case, he said, employers had been allowed to go back to the form of casual labour for dock work that the unions had fought to outlaw during the 1960s. Overall, he said however, the case had been a victory because it had established that employers could not dismiss staff because of their union activities. Only four of the original 19 have secured new jobs. 'The dockers won the moral and legal argument over their dismissals but most of them are still out of a job,' said Mr Reid. He added that the Port of Tilbury, now privatised, was now recruiting casual labour directly against the reassurances given at the time that the dock labour scheme was abolished. Meanwhile, two offshore drilling rig workers were yesterday awarded more than Pounds 20,000 compensation against employers who sacked them for refusing to take a pay cut. The two workers were among 40 who monitored mud content in oil and gas drills on offshore rigs around the UK for Anadrill, a subsidiary of the the French company Schlumberger. The two workers refused to accept basic pay reductions of 25 per cent, believing the cuts to be in breach of their employment contracts. Both were dismissed and took their case to industrial tribunal through their union, the MSF technical union. One was awarded compensation of Pounds 10,820 and the other received Pounds 10,410. Mr Roger Spiller, secretary of the MSF offshore section, said the case was the first to challenge the interpretation of such offshore contracts.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 8 (CNS) -- Beijing municipality has  been seeing a continuous rising of prices, arousing great  concern and becoming the focus of current discussions by the  Beijing People's Congress.    Information released by the Beijing Bureau of Statistics  showed that prices rose by over 23 percent on average in the  first quarter and the rising trend was continuing, resulting in  heavy inflationary pressures being felt by residents.  Delivering report on government work to the Congress, Mayor Li  Qiyan said that prices for daily necessities had climbed too  quickly in recent times. Representatives attending the meeting  were convinced that the current rising prices were mainly seen  in milk with a 33 percent hike last February and in fresh  vegetables which registered a price increase of 37 percent.  Prices rises in these two daily items triggered off price  increases for other items. General workers and those working  with enterprises cannot afford such prices and persons going  into retirement or on leave received the greatest impact.    Deputies to the municipal People's Congress strongly  appealed  to the municipal government for measures to bring the runaway  prices under control. They asked for a clear picture on how  much prices in Beijing would climb this year. Mr. Li and the  executive vice mayor Mr. Wang Baosen told the deputies that the  municipal government would take steps to curb prices from rising  further. The measures include the powers of responsibility held  by the mayor and heads of counties and districts. Great efforts  in the food production programme will be made including the main  agricultural by-products such as grains, oil, meat, eggs and  milk to stabilize prices.    The municipality will further open itself to the outside  world to draw on more sources of goods. With the measures for  price adjustment in place, the municipal authorities will  strictly control the number of items for price reform this year.    Prices inspection on two occasions will be carried out in  the  first half and second half of this year. The raising of prices  by capitalizing on the price rise trend, the increasing of  prices by individuals, price hikes under the pretext of  increasing taxation and profiteering by raising prices have to  be harshly punished. The enactment of laws and regulations  countering the practice of making staggering profits is in full  swing and will come into effect this year.</p>

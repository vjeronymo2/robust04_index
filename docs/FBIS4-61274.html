			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By unidentified ITAR-TASS special correspondent] </F>   [Text] Cairo, 4 May -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher expressed  serious concern over the unstable situation that still pertains  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and which contains the threat of a  flare-up of new dangerous hot-beds of conflict. During a  meeting that took place today in the Egyptian capital, the heads  of the foreign policy departments of the two countries called on  the warring sides immediately and totally to implement a  withdrawal of forces from the established zones around Gorazde  and to undertake immediate steps to reduce tension and to  prevent offensive military actions in the region of Brcko.    Kozyrev and Christopher also called for the signing, as soon  as possible, of an agreement on a total cessation of hostilities  over the whole territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina that would  envisage the disengagement of military formations, the  withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the stationing of UN forces  between them. They called for the immediate renewal of talks  without preconditions in order to work out a comprehensive  settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Russia's foreign minister and the U.S. secretary of state  are  convinced of the necessity for providing a powerful political  impulse to the process of finding a Bosnian settlement. They  call for the holding of a meeting at ministerial level with the  participation of the member countries of the contact group.  Such a meeting could take place in Geneva on 13 May.</p>

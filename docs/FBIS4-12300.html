			<p>BFN     [Text] Iran and Italy have signed a long-term financial  agreement and have thus ended their differences in this field.  The Central News Unit reports that on the basis of this  financial agreement, which was signed by a delegation of the  Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran and Italian  financial officials and the state Italian insurance organization  (SACE), an $800-million credit has been placed at the disposal  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    On the basis of this agreement, all debts by state and  private companies and by Iranian importers to their Italian  trade partners that have not been paid up until now will be paid  by this credit. All the debts of 1373 [year beginning 21 March  1994] that will mature within the coming months will also be  paid by this credit. The credit covers all purchases that are  covered by the Italian state insurance company (SACE). The  credit is for a period of six years, comprising two years of a  grace period and four years of repayment.    The Central Bank has previously signed similar financial  agreements with Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Austria, and Poland.</p>

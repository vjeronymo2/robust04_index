Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and  industry, told a regular press conference after the cabinet  meeting that it will suffice if blueprints for the scale of the  budget for the year starting April and the proposed tax reforms  are decided before the Washington meeting.    Kumagai said he hopes traditional bureaucratic procedures to  decide the budget will be streamlined compared with how it was  under the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party.    With respect to the planned additional pump-priming package,  he said the government will make a "political decision" on the  scale of a potential tax cut and how to fund it as soon as the  Diet closes its current session on Saturday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Albert Kochetkov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi June 17 TASS -- The Russian army group in  Transcaucasia is holding a tactical military exercise on a  regimental scale on a Black Sea coast near Batumi, Adjaria, on  Friday. The aim of the exercise is to improve actions to rebuff  an enemy landing party.    Marines are landing from Black Sea Fleet ships and  helicopters, simulating air and artillery strikes, while  defenders will hold out under the onslaught of superior enemy  forces and defeat them.    President Eduard Shevardnadze and Georgian brass hats  departed for the war games. Journalists interpreted this move  as a pretext for a meeting with Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze.    According to earlier reports, the latter temporarily  combined  the duties of parliament speaker (he dissolved parliament last  year by his decree) with the duties of Adjarian premier.  Reports say that this was done "at the suggestion of the heads  of ministries and departments of the autonomous republic".    This move caused anxiety in Tbilisi which is concerned that  Adjaria is increasingly disassociating itself from Georgia.    Despite the fact that the list of Russian journalists was  compiled and agreed upon in good time, they got up at early  hours and arrived at the Tbilisi airport in advance.    Nevertheless, they were removed from the plane, as ITAR-TASS  learnt, "due to overload". Therefore, journalists have to be  content with paltry reports received at the press centre of the  Russian army group in Tbilisi.</p>

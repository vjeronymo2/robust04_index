There are many wounded people, and the hospital is  in a terrible state. I really do not know how to find a way out  of all this."

Along with constant shelling of the defense  lines and civilian targets, the aggressor is trying to break  through to the free Brcko territory from several directions."  "The Serbian aggressor, who has been successfully repelled  along all the lines of the Brcko defenses over the past 10 days,  is not giving up the attacks.

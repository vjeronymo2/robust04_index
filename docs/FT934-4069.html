			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: No offer made to arbitrate Sir, You report me as being 'prompted . . . to offer (my) services as an arbitrator between the two sides' - Railtrack and BR - of a dispute about the value of Britain's rail infrastructure ('Railtrack delays pricing after row with Treasury', November 30). Please be informed I am not involved in the dispute and have not offered my services in any capacity. Like the rest of the nation, I wait to learn just how this Railtrack-based franchising lark is going to work. Alastair Morton, chief executive, Eurotunnel, Victoria Plaza, 111 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1W 0ST</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 17 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin today accepted the resignation of First Deputy  Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar, while making assurances that the  economic reforms which he had led in Russia will continue.    In a statement, Yeltsin said: "Giving tribute to the  competence, courage and the contribution which Yegor Gaydar made  to the course of economic reform, I understand the arguments and  motives which made him offer to resign."    He stressed that although Gaydar has quit, the reform policy  would continue and explained that Gaydar would work in the State  Duma in the national interest as he had previously.    37-year-old Gaydar, the architect of Russia's economic  reform, told reporters on Sunday [16 January] he had decided not  to stay in the new cabinet, the full list of which is scheduled  to be published on Tuesday.    As an explanation he said that the government had recently  taken decisions with which he disagreed and without his presence.    This is the second time that Gaydar has left the government.  In December 1992 Yeltsin had to remove him from the post of  acting prime minister after a severe conflict with the former  parliament over the course of reform.    Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy prime  minister last September when Yeltsin dissolved the former  parliament.    Gaydar, who is Yeltsin's top aide in charge of  market-oriented economic reforms, said he had discussed the  issue with the president on Thursday who understood his position.    He added that he intended to concentrate on his work in the  state duma, the lower house of the Parliament, in which his  "Russia's Choice" Party has a majority.    He said his party would try not to allow representatives of  the Liberal Democratic Party, led by the right-wing Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, onto key committees of the lower chamber, such as  defense, security and international policy committees.</p>

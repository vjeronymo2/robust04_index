			<p><P> July 7, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUROR OVER FLAG BURNING  </P> <P> Surely the Founding Fathers never had in mind the burning of the American flag  when they penned the First Amendment to the Constitution! Since when does an  act of the will (burning the flag) equal the spoken word (freedom of speech)?  </P> <P> I deplore the recent Supreme Court decision which allows anyone the freedom to  desecrate the American flag when he is disgruntled, while standing on its ashes  with raised fist against America. Bravo, President Bush; plaudits to you for  standing up for this American symbol. Patriotism has never gone out of style,  nor should it!  </P> <P> LYNNE TRUJILLO  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, Feb 3 (AFP)--China is "earnestly studying"  Britain's latest financing proposals for Hong Kong's new airport  project, Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said Thursday.    Britain formally submitted the proposals to China on  Wednesday. Progress on the 20.3 billion dollar airport project  is threatened by the lack of agreement--called for by a 1991  Sino-British pact--on how to pay for what is one of the world's  biggest public works' undertakings. "China just received the  new financial plan for airport... and is earnestly studying  it," Wu told a weekly press briefing.    Britain has been pressing for a prompt meeting of the  group's  airport committee, which last convened in April, to resolve the  financing issue.    The latest British proposal--approved Tuesday by Governor  Chris Patten's cabinet--reportedly increases to more than 60  billion Hong Kong dollars (7.76 billion U.S.) the equity to be  injected into the venture.    China wants Hong Kong to dig deeper into its growing  reserves  to pay for the airport, due to be finished in 1997 when the  colony reverts to China, while Patten's administration favours a  greater degree of debt financing. Wu also reiterated that  Patten's "intransigence and uncooperative attitude" in the row  over his proposals to extend democracy in Hong Kong prior to  1997 "will end up harming Britain's interests."    China has repeatedly warned that Sino-British trade ties  will  be affected unless Patten withdraws the package of reforms he  submitted to the territory's Legislative Council in December,  amid angry protests from Beijing.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Guinness case men pursue appeal MR ANTHONY PARNES and Mr Gerald Ronson, who were convicted of theft in the first Guinness trial, have asked Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, to refer their cases back to the Court of Appeal. Lawyers for Mr Parnes believe that evidence showing that share support operations were common City practice in the 1980s was in the hands of the Serious Fraud Office before the trial began. The evidence of indemnities being given to assist in six other takeover bids was given to the Department of Trade and Industry by directors of TWH/NV, a licensed share-dealing firm, during a separate investigation and then passed to the SFO, the lawyers believe. Mr Parnes might have conducted his defence differently had this evidence been known about during his trial, Mr Keith Oliver, his solicitor, said yesterday. 'It is our view that a serious miscarriage of justice has occurred,' he said.</p>

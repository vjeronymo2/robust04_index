			<p>BFN     [Text] Bamako, 12 May (AFP) -- Oumar Mariko, the former  leader of the Association of Malian Students and Pupils, [AEEM]  who was expatriated on 12 May from Cote d'Ivoire 24 hours after  his arrest in Abidjan, has disclosed that he was arrested by  gendarmes on his arrival in Bamako, but was then released a few  hours later. He told the Malian press that he was not  questioned at the Bamako gendarmerie, where he was taken.    Reliable police sources in Abidjan disclosed that the former  AEEM leader left Abidjan aboard an aircraft from the Air  Transport and Liaison Group, a national company.    Mr. Mariko disclosed that he was questioned in Abidjan on  his  meetings with opposition leaders and Ivorian students. No legal  action is being taken against him in Mali. He arrived in Cote  d'Ivoire on 10 May on his way from Ouagadougou, where he had  been staying for a week as part of a tour aimed at establishing  "a leftist African youth organization."    For two years now, the AEEM, which is backed by several  Malian opposition parties, has been at the root of violent  demonstrations against President Alpha Oumar Konare's  government. The association is contesting the new criteria for  the allocation of student grants, which henceforth will be based  on examination results.    AEEM has 500,000 members, and was at the root of the March  1991 demonstrations, which led to the ousting of Former Malian  President Moussa Traore.</p>

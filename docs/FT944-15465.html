			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Higher nickel prices help to lift Falconbridge Falconbridge, the Canadian metals producer which went public this year, has reported a sharp improvement in third-quarter performance, due to rising metal prices, higher sales volumes and a drop in the Canadian dollar. Earnings were CDollars 55.5m (USDollars 41.4m), or 32 cents a share, compared with a CDollars 11.4m loss, or 11 cents, a year earlier. Operating income more than quadrupled to CDollars 94.6m from CDollars 21.5m, while revenues climbed to CDollars 526.7m from CDollars 371.1m. The results were also buoyed by a reduction in debt-service expenses from CDollars 21.1m to CDollars 10.9m in the wake of the recent equity issue. Mr Frank Pickard, chief executive, predicted that nickel prices would be supported for the rest of the year by a 10 per cent rise in western steel output in 1994, and a 9 per cent increase in nickel consumption. 'Fourth-quarter fundamentals are the strongest the nickel industry has experienced in many years,' he said. Nickel output rose to 17,321 tonnes in the third quarter from 15,633 a year earlier. Ferro-nickel production was 9,068 tonnes, up from 7,021 tonnes. Average nickel prices received rose to USDollars 2.89 a lb from Dollars 2.29. Ferro-nickel prices climbed to Dollars 2.80 from Dollars 2.37, while copper prices advanced to Dollars 1.13 from 86 cents. Falconbridge also disclosed yesterday it had obtained 'particularly encouraging' exploration results from the Kidd Creek zinc and copper mine in northern Ontario. Samples from four new drill-holes have yielded an average grade of 3 per cent copper, 4.8 per cent zinc, 0.85 per cent lead and 180 grams of silver per tonne. Drilling results from the Biankouma nickel venture in the Ivory Coast indicate the ore may be suitable for ferro-nickel production, using the same process as Falconbridge's operation in the Dominican Republic.</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Record exports boost hopes for economic revival: Stronger pound increases speculation over interest rate cut ahead of Budget THE British government was yesterday given fresh heart on the economy with news of record exports in the final quarter of last year. Indications that UK exporters are continuing to find sales opportunities in a fragile world economy helped sentiment on the London stock market, where shares ended firmly higher. A strengthening of sterling against a weak D-Mark also in-creased speculation that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might find room to cut in-terest rates before the Budget on March 10 in a move which would help the government's general election chances. The developments gave Mr Lamont, who in recent weeks has been troubled by a weak pound and signs of continuing deep recession, his most heartening day on the economic front since Christmas. According to the Central Statistical Office, export volumes in the three months to December were up 0.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, and 3 per cent higher than in the same period in 1990. Last month, exports grew in value by 2 1/2 per cent compared with November to Pounds 9bn, while imports stayed little changed at Pounds 9.6bn. According to the CSO, the total deficit on the current account last month came out at Pounds 388m, as against expectations in the City of a Pounds 500m deficit. In November, the figure was Pounds 630m. The figures helped to buoy the stock market, where the FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed below the day's highs at 2,539.9, up 29.5. On currency markets, the pound climbed three-quarters of a pfennig against the D-Mark, closing in London at DM2.8725. In New York yesterday evening it was slightly up at DM2.8737. Sterling remains only about a  1/2 pfennig above its theoretical floor in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) against the peseta, the strongest currency in the system. But it is far enough away from its D-Mark 'lower floor' of DM2.78 for the government soon to start contemplating the possibility of a reduction in base rates. These have been stuck at 10.5 per cent for nearly five months, during which many politicians and industrialists have called for new cuts in borrowing costs to aid the recovery. The good performance by UK exporters during 1991 was a big factor behind a fall in the current-account deficit for the whole of 1991 to Pounds 5.8bn, from Pounds 15.2bn in 1990. In the government's Autumn Statement in November, Mr Lamont had predicted a deficit of Pounds 6.5bn. Also contributing to the cut in the overall deficit was a sharp drop in imports, caused by low demand due to the recession. Although the CSO said import volumes between the third and fourth quarters of 1991 were virtually flat - providing little evidence that faint stirrings of recovery were stoking increased demand for imports - yesterday's figures encouraged hopes that good export growth during 1992 will aid the UK economy. Despite signs of a puncturing of the general gloom about the economy over the past month, many investors remain cautious about the short-term outlook. Today's quarterly report on industrial trends by the Confederation of British Industry is expected to paint a downbeat picture of prospects over the next few months. While the Treasury said the export figures were 'quite en-couraging', the government's political opponents took the chance to highlight the size of the trade deficit, which Labour and the Liberal Democrats took as a measure of underlying economic weakness. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said Britain was still firmly stuck in recession, while the Liberal Democrats said: 'An end-of-year deficit of (nearly) Pounds 6bn during the deepest recession Britain has experienced since the war is disgraceful.'

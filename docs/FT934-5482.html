			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Second review of two counties is ordered Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, yesterday ordered another review of local government structure in Derbyshire and County Durham. The move underlines the government's determination to do away with the two-tier system of county and district councils used in rural England and replace them with all-purpose 'unitary' authorities. It also further undermines the position of the Local Government Commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, charged with advising the government on the review. Sir John had recommended continuing the two-tier system in parts of both counties, although he had suggested unitary status for Darlington, Derby, and north-east Derbyshire. His recommendations were made before Mr Gummer announced revised guidance which made it clear that he expected unitary authorities to be the norm. Uncertainty over local government in the two counties could now continue for at least another year.</p>

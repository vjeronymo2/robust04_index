			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Books: Art for rich and poorer - A highly varied crop of books on art THIS WINTER has seen the launch of two new series of decorative arts books, impressive in quite different ways. A massive 30-volume survey of the arts of Islam opens with three opulent volumes on Qur'ans, The Abbasid Tradition, The Master Scribes and After Timur, intelligently produced and sumptuously illustrated (Azimuth Editions in association with Oxford University Press, Pounds 135 each). This exceptionally ambitious, and heavily subsidised, series catalogues the entire 20,000-piece collection of Dr Nasser D. Khalili  -at a cost of Pounds 5m. At the other end of the financial scale is Walker Books' delightful new Decorative Arts Library. Bevis Hillier offers an entertaining romp through Early English Porcelain, unable to resist including the tale of the Blake family who ordered a dinner service from China decorated with their coat of arms. When the porcelain arrived they discovered that on every piece their family motto, Think and Thank, had been painstakingly rendered Stink and Stank. Laurence Whistler contributes Point Engraving on Glass, Emma Tennant Rag Rugs of England and America, and Alan Powers Modern Block Printed Textiles. These attractive small books cost Pounds 9.99 each, Anna Maria Massinelli and Filipp Tuena have achieved on paper what would be seventh heaven in an exhibition. Treasures of the Medici (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 24.95) re-unites the fabulous jewels and objets d'art amassed over 300 years by 10 generations of Medici, bankers who were the unoffical royal family of Florence. For Lorenzo the Magnificent, the 5th centenary of whose death this superbly illustrated book commemorates, his antique cameos and sardonyxes were of incomparably greater value than any painting by Fra Angelico or Botticelli. Monique Riccardi-Cubitt's compendious The Art of the Cabinet (Thames and Hudson, Pounds 36) offers a history of the cupboard or cabinet in which such precious curios were housed. Furniture plays an important role in Alexander von Vegesack's illuminating Czech Cubism (Laurence King Publishing, Pounds 40). This fascinating journey into hitherto unchartered waters reveals how a group of avant-garde architects in Prague translated the art of Braque and Picasso into a new - almost angrily animate - formal language of architecture and the applied arts, characterised by sharp angles, cut-off corners and boldly sloping planes. Five books on the 19th century focus on the forgotten and the familiar. Poul Vad presents a welcome biography, the first in English, of one of the most remarkable and individual painters of the 19th century. Vilhelm Hammershoi and Danish Art at the Turn of the Century (Yale University Press, Pounds 45) is a sensitive and scrupulously researched book, ill-served by a lamentable translation. The author has uncovered a great deal about the life of this most private of painters but perhaps devotes too much space to lengthy analyses of individual works. Janis A. Tomlinson's Goya in the Twilight of Enlightenment (Yale Pounds 29.95) is a complex and sophisticated book that attempts to cut through the Goya myths and to examine afresh a great painter's achievement against the historical background that so profoundly affected it. Far more straightforward is the handsome Degas Pastels by Jean Sutherland Boggs and Anne Maheux (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 45). Degas also takes a bow in Beyond Impressionism - the Naturalist Impulse in European Art 1860-1905 by Gabriel P Weisberg (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 38) but he plays only a bit part in this truly international resurrection of dead reputations. This is a glimpse through the looking-glass into a world where Bastien-Lepage - not Manet, Monet or Cezanne - is king. A long overdue alternative history of 19th century European art. Charlotte Gere's Nineteenth Century Interiors: An Album of Watercolours Watercolours (Thames &amp; Hudson, Pounds 28) is a record of what must have been a delightful show at the Frick Collection, presenting over 60 faithful view of European interiors, from the grandest to the most humble. Now that annus horribilis has drawn to a close, the present owner may well console herself by curling up with Christopher Lloyd's The Royal Collection (Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 25), a fuller-bodied version of what has proved to be an admirably lucid and ungimmicky television series.</p>

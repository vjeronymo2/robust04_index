			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hardy Kuehnrich on an interview with Polish </F> President Lech Walesa; place and date not given; Walesa speaks  in Polish with superimposed German translation -- recorded]    [Text] [Kuehnrich] These are Polish troops that belonged  to the Warsaw Pact until a few years ago. The alliance is no  longer in existence; and six months ago, the last Russian  soldier left Poland. Now the Polish Army is preparing for NATO  membership. Poland urgently wants to join, and the sooner the  better. For the Polish people, the situation in their neighbor  Russia is much too insecure. But the West hesitates. NATO  membership is not within easy reach. On the eve of the NATO  summit, Warsaw is being very clear.    [Walesa] By not letting us join NATO, the West is betraying  and hurting itself. After the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union  broke up, we thought that the West wanted a unified Europe, and  real security. But all this is now being jeopardized by the  West's position. This is why many people in our country feel  much worse now than they used to. In the past, we hoped that  there would be a unified Europe and equal rules. In reality,  nothing has happened. There is even a chance that the old  forces could regain their strength. What have we achieved?    [Kuehnrich] Poland's NATO membership aspirations have been  the number one topic in the country for weeks. Poland wants to  be part of the West, part of Europe. The polemics in the media  are getting sharper. The critical point being discussed is that  the West makes allowances for Yeltsin. But Russia is a country  that is not trusted in Poland. Experiences from the past have  not been forgotten: Others determined the country's future.  Poland once again feels like a buffer zone, and what is more,  it feels that it is not being granted equal rights.    [Walesa] We are looking at things that the West can see as  well, but is trying to overlook. But we will not allow Russia  to make conditions for us to meet. Russia is setting conditions  for NATO and the West. I get the impression that we no longer  have to ask NATO or Clinton, but we should go and ask Yeltsin  because he controls the West and NATO.    [Kuehnrich] How do you see Germany's position regarding  Poland's wish to join NATO? Is it a clear position?    [Walesa] The Germans are in a difficult position. One has  to understand this; and I understand the Germans. They still  have the Russian Army on their territory. They also face  problems related to unification and various other difficulties.  Germany is watched by everybody, and one, therefore, should not  be surprised about the hesitant attitude taken by the Germans.  [end recording]    Reproaches are being directed toward the West, and worried  looks go across the border into Russia. The fact is that the  majority of Poles are in favor of a quick alliance with Western  Europe and NATO.</p>

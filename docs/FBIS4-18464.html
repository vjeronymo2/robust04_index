			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "NATO: Fabbri on 45th Anniversary </F> of Alliance"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, April 2 -- Today marks the 45th  anniversary of the Atlantic Pact, the signing of which united  the nations of Western Europe and of North America in their  determination "to defend freedom and democracy from the looming  threat of a new totalitarianism", Italian Defense Minister Fabio  Fabbri wrote in a message to the Armed Forces on this occasion.    After underscoring that this Atlantic choice had created "a  community of ideals and of interests which allowed our nations  to progress in prosperity and in security", Fabbri added that  the European nations, "lacerated by war, found in NATO a  decisive element for overcoming ancient divisions and for  establishing strong mutual confidence".    For Fabbri, even in the new European geo-political context  which, he stressed, to a great extent was itself "the fruit of  Atlantic policies in the face of the totalitarianism's  challenges", NATO has confirmed its "indispensable role of  defense and as a factor of security and peace".    He recalled the fundamental contribution made by the accords  for nuclear and conventional disarmament, the stabilizing  effects of the opening to the new democracies of central and  eastern Europe, and the missions carried out in Bosnia and in  the Adriatic for the United Nations.    The Italian armed forces, which for four decades have been  an  active and dedicated part of the Atlantic military instrument,  will continue to provide their decisive contribution to NATO,  taking part in the common defense and in peace missions, Fabbri  continued in his message. Furthermore, those Atlantic values  which were at the base of Italy's choices for civilization and  peace will find themselves ever more grounded and ever more  suffused within Italian society, he concluded.</p>

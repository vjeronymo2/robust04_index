			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 17 May (NOTIMEX) -- New student  demonstrations and some incidents were reported today in Caracas  and three cities in the interior of the country protesting an  increase in public transportation fares, according to police  sources.    Metropolitan Police Chief Jose Hernandez said that the  Interior Ministry and student federations agreed at a meeting  that demonstrations must be peaceful. Despite verbal agreements  between students and the government, the conflict has not been  resolved, as the authorities have been unable to force bus  owners to charge students preferential fares, and therefore  protests are expected to continue.    Students are demanding that private bus owners comply with  the law establishing that students--more than 2 million  throughout the country--only have to pay half of the regular  fares.    High school students who took to the streets to hurl stones  and bottles to disrupt traffic near a housing complex in the "23  January" neighborhood were convinced by police to break up the  demonstration. After talking to a group of students who were  protesting at a school in the "Gran Colombia" education center,  the metropolitan police managed to discourage them from  continuing their protests. Students from two schools located at  the Fuerzas Armadas Street in downtown Caracas tried to hold up  a truck transporting mineral water, but National Guard members  who are discreetly patrolling the streets prevented them from  setting the vehicle on fire. The police also prevented students  from holding up a truck transporting paint, which was  intercepted by the demonstrators.    Today authorities arrested 20 students in the city of Los  Teques in western Venezuela. On 16 May there were incidents  between riot police and demonstrators in three cities in the  interior of the country, during which one vehicle was set on  fire.    Meanwhile, teachers in Caracas marched peacefully through  the  main streets downtown demanding payment of wage increases  granted in January which have not been honored by the government  of President Rafael Caldera.    In addition, hundreds of journalists demonstrated in front  of  Congress defending their association rights and demanding the  prompt approval by Congress of amendments to the journalism law.  At the demonstration called by the National Association of  Journalists (CNP) the participants protested a campaign promoted  by the Press Association (which groups the media owners) against  the journalism law.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Tables on schools to grow next year Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, said yesterday that the government wanted to publish extra data about schools next year. She said that this year's league tables of schools' exam performance, published yesterday, were 'never intended to provide a complete picture of everything that schools do', and they would be 'flawed if they had been presented as giving a comprehensive picture'. Her comments followed criticism from teachers' associations, who said the tables did not take account of schools' intakes, and so could not measure the improvement of individual pupils. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, the quango chaired by Sir Ron Dearing, is expected to publish next week recommendations for measuring progress at school. Mrs Shephard said that next year's planned introduction of national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds 'will give secondary schools the chance to demonstrate what they have achieved in that five years of secondary education'. Mr David Blunkett, shadow education secretary, had already pledged that a future Labour government would publish value-added tables. Mr Don Foster, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, was more critical. He said: 'The current school league tables are fundamentally flawed and should be abolished. They are crude and simplistic and don't compare like with like.' Mr Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, described the tables as 'worse than useless', and 'a cruel con-trick'. But he added: 'The league tables will be worth serious consideration when everyone agrees what should be added to the raw information to take account of the many factors affecting results.'</p>

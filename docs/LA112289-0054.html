			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> ZELMAN TO QUIT, RUN FOR INSURANCE POST  </P> <P> Walter A. Zelman, executive director of California Common Cause for 13 years,  announced in Sacramento that he will resign as head of the public interest  lobbying group on Dec. 1 and seek the Democratic nomination for state insurance  commissioner. Zelman, 45, of Los Angeles, said he will not accept campaign  contributions from the insurance industry or from law firms specializing in  personal injury cases. He also challenged his Democratic opponents to agree to  a voluntary spending limit of $750,000 for the primary. "You can't be an  independent consumer advocate with $100,000 from the trial lawyers in your  pocket," Zelman said. But the longtime proponent of spending limits and public  financing of campaigns said he will not limit his own spending unless other  candidates agree to follow suit.  </P></p>

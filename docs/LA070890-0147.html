			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: NURSING SCHOOL A MOM-DAUGHTER EFFORT  </P> <P> Patricia Beck, a top nursing student at Santa Monica College, worked well with  her co-workers and classmates at the hospital where they trained.  </P> <P> Her only problem was with one student, who insisted on calling her "Pattie." It  wasn't the nickname Beck objected to, but the classmate who was using it:  Beck's daughter Lori Fitzwilliams.  </P> <P> "I hate kids who call their parents by their first names," said Beck, a West  Los Angeles resident who decided to return to school after a recent divorce.  "She would call me 'Pat' and 'Pattie,' and I would just ignore her."  </P> <P> Fitzwilliams, who lives in Culver City with her husband and two young children,  said she wasn't trying to be disrespectful to her mother, but merely to be  professional. "In a hospital setting I wasn't about to go call her, 'Hey, Mom.'  "  </P> <P> Beck, 45, and Fitzwilliams, 25, spent 2 1/2 years together in the nursing  program and recently graduated with honors.  </P> <P> Despite the disagreement on what Beck should be called, they say being students  together strengthened their relationship.  </P> <P> Although they never studied together, Fitzwilliams said they called on each  other for emotional support throughout the rigorous period of studies and  hospital work.  </P> <P> "She was the only one who understood what I was going through," she said. "She  knows my whole history, what's going on with my personal life, so we could  communicate with saying very little."  </P> <P> Two Westside volunteers were bestowed the highest honor of the Los Angeles YMCA  when they were cited to the Golden Book of Distinguished Service at a meeting  in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Terry R. White, a volunteer at the Westside Family YMCA, and Everett Maguire, a  volunteer at the Palisades-Malibu YMCA, joined the 241 people similarly honored  since the association established the award in 1934.  </P> <P> Lessing E. Gold, managing partner for the Century City law firm Gold, Marks,  Ring &amp; Pepper, has been appointed to the board of directors of the  Shakespeare Festival of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> This July, the festival, a nonprofit, professional theater company dedicated to  preserving and illuminating Shakespeare's work, will present "Much Ado About  Nothing."  </P> <P> For the second year in a row, high school senior Asher Hung has been one of 20  students nationwide to be named a winner in the Scholastic Magazine art  competition.  </P> <P> Hung, a Westwood resident who attends Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, will have  his entry displayed in the magazine's gallery exhibit in New York.  </P> <P> UCLA sociology professor Jeffrey Alexander was named the winner of the $25,000  1990 Gold Shield Faculty Prize for Academic Excellence.  </P> <P> The award recognized Alexander as "a teacher who transforms the mass scale of a  large state university into the intensive education usually associated with a  small liberal arts college."  </P> <P> Alexander, a Pacific Palisades resident who is chairman of the Department of  Sociology, is known for his four-volume work titled "Theoretical Logic in  Sociology."  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills High School Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. installed Evy  Rappaport for a second term as president.  </P> <P> Other officers elected for the 1990-91 school year were: Sandra Bayrd, first  vice president; Rivka Seiden, second vice president; Fran Behrstock,  corresponding secretary; Robin Benedetti, recording secretary; and Gail  Lowenstein, treasurer.  </P> <P> The National Women's Political Caucus-L.A. Westside has elected Susan Romeo as  its chairwoman for the 1990-91 year.  </P> <P> In addition, the caucus elected Joanne Parker as its administrative vice  chairwoman; Deborah Reich Castleman as its vice chairwoman, political action;  Morgan Lynn, treasurer; Michelle Melone, recorder, and Diane Paris and Mary  Rapoport, county coordinating committee representatives.

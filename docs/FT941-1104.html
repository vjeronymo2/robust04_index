			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Return to value With the FT-SE 100 index now 11 per cent below the peak reached in early February, equities no longer look overvalued judged on their own merits. A market multiple of around 14 times this year's forecast earnings, and a prospective yield comfortably above 4 per cent, might start to tempt fund managers with an eye to value. Many UK institutions certainly remained aloof as equities scaled dizzy heights through the winter. Thus pension funds sold equities to the tune of Pounds 1.7bn in the fourth quarter of last year, reinvesting the proceeds in short-term bonds and cash. Since there is little joy in holding cash at current interest rates, some of that might now seep back into shares. The market's steady slide in February did nothing to halt the flight of private investors from the dwindling returns on cash. Unit trust sales of Pounds 722m were notably higher than the previous month. If that pattern continues, and the flow of new funds into institutional coffers this year does not disappoint, UK equities should be able to count on a solid base of support. Yet the punishment meted out this week to companies which disappointed on earnings - the 8 per cent fall in Wellcome's shares on Thursday was a case in point - suggests institutions are still reluctant to commit themselves. The nervous state of world bond markets might be to blame. While the fundamentals point to some upside for equities, it is hard to see how the market can flourish until equilibrium is restored in bonds.</p>

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Japanese demand for aluminium to fall JAPANESE demand for aluminium this year will fall by 8 per cent before the stimulation of the economy next year will result in growth of 3 per cent, Marubeni UK said, Reuter reports. Demand growth this year will be restricted to aluminium can sheets, Marubeni predicted. Other areas such as extrusions, general purpose sheets and coils, and the car industry will register demand falls. Marubeni estimated that the CIS will export around 750,000 tonnes of primary ingot to the West as well as significant tonnages of 'off-grade' metal. Recent Chinese buying has amounted to 150,000/200,000 tonnes, although China is not expected to be as consistent a purchaser from now on, it said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by EL TIEMPO Economic Editorial Staff: "Economy, </F> Better Than Businesses"]    [Text] For most businessmen, 1993 was definitely not the  best of years. Although the growth of the economy as a whole was  good, the manufacturing sector's profits were impaired, and low  demand hurt the productive sector's performance significantly.    At the beginning of the year, the expectations were  optimistic. After all, the country had emerged from one of the  most severe electric power rationings of recent history.    Nevertheless, the businessmen's forecasts were not  completely  fulfilled; and this was demonstrated by the results of EL  TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll (EOE) that, during the four  quarters of 1993, sought the opinion of 300 businessmen from the  economy's principal categories.    The latest poll, which assessed business performance between  October and December of last year, indicates that the year's end  maintained the tendency of the previous quarters.    Although the manufacturing industry's production and the  services sector's sales increased more than during the third  quarter, this was not reflected in earnings: According to 57  percent of the 300 businessmen queried, profits after taxes  declined or remained stable.    The traditional increase in demand during the Christmas  season did not salvage the year, as many businessmen in the  industrial sector were expecting. The apparent explanation for  this is the competition generated by the "apertura" [economic  liberalization] process.    In fact, apertura has been increasingly indicated as a  problem of the economy and of business firms in the EOE results.  During the first quarter, manufacturers and merchants were not  expressing very marked concern over the deregulation of imports.    Nevertheless, in the second quarter fear began to be sensed;  and, in the latest EOE poll, it became obvious that the  competition generated by foreign products has become the main  problem hurting businesses.  <H5>  Growth and Predictions </H5>   If the results for industry, agriculture, and commerce were  not as satisfactory as had been expected, how does one explain  the fact that the economy grew 5.16 percent last year, according  to the latest estimates from the National Department of Planning  (DNP)?    Much of the performance of the gross domestic product (GDP)  is explained by construction, which grew 9.3 percent in 1993;  the machinery and equipment industry, which dynamized the  manufacturing sector's results; and public spending which,  according to the Finance Ministry, contributed nearly 25 percent  of the final results.    This means that the prosperity of other sectors managed to  offset the problems of demand and reduced profits faced by  businessmen in the agricultural sector and certain branches of  industry.    Moreover, the poll for the last quarter showed that no one  would have wagered on a 5.16 percent growth in the product. They  began the year predicting a 3.21 variation; and, in the final  quarter, not one of the 300 businessmen queried dared to mention  over 4.32 percent.    On the other hand, they were correct in the prediction of  cost of living, because, on the average, the businessmen queried  by the EOE mentioned 22.6 percent inflation for last year. In  1994, they expect the price index to be reduced to 21.6 percent.    And what about rating the management of the economy?  Apparently, manufacturers and merchants have not changed their  views in this regard, and believe that the direction of the  economy is not the best. The government's economic team received  a rating of 3.2 out of five during the first quarter, and that  figure rose to only 3.49 in December of last year.  <H5>  Eighth Economic Opinion Poll </H5>   The eighth Economic Opinion Poll sought the opinions of 300  businessmen regarding the performance of production, sales, and  employment in seven major industrial and services activities  during the final quarter of last year.    The EOE, which has been taken since March 1992, also gauges  businessmen' expectations for the performance of the cost of  living and the growth of the gross domestic product. On this  occasion, factors such as workers' productivity and their wage  level were evaluated as well.

Although, during the Christmas season, production rose for  44.9 percent of businessmen, this rate is far removed from the  one attained between October and December 1992, when 68 percent  of businessmen posted gains.    Despite this decline, the outlook for businessmen improved  substantially, considering the fact that, in the second quarter  of last year, only 29.2 percent of those interviewed in the  Economic Opinion Poll claimed that their production had risen.    Another indicator that there are winds of recovery (albeit  mild) relates to the performance of profits, which declined in  that period for 55 percent of businessmen; whereas, during the  Christmas season, they were lower for only 32 percent. However,  it is still disturbing that profits should be declining for that  percentage of manufacturers.    One of the sectors hardest hit by the drop in profits is the  textile industry. According to calculations made by the  Colombian Textile Producers Association (Ascoltex), 80 percent  of the companies had a negative balance last year.    The textile firms, like other industries, have been hurt by  contraband, underbilling, and the importing of products at  prices below cost.    Moreover, apertura has helped to foster the most intense  specter hovering over the industry last year: low demand.    The complaint from businessmen all year long was over the  decline in the volume of orders, and the substitution of  national products with imports.  <H5>  Painful Apertura </H5>   Although the apertura program has enabled businessmen to  reduce their modernization costs, owing to the lower taxes on  machinery imports, it has been a headache for income and profits.    The competition from imports has forced businessmen to  moderate the increases in prices of their products, so as to be  able to remain on the market.    Since this belt-tightening is done by force on many  occasions, and not because of a drop in production costs,  earnings and income are being impaired.    According to 54.4 percent of businessmen, apertura has had  an  unfavorable effect on their profits; and only 20.5 percent claim  that it has had a beneficial effect on their earnings.    As for income levels, 44.1 percent of those interviewed  think  that it has had a negative effect on them, whereas only 20  percent consider its effect positive.    Where the opinions are divided is on the effect of apertura  on employment. Half of the businessmen think that it has had no  effect, whereas 31.5 percent attribute an unfavorable effect to  it.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry [figures are percentages]                                         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Production        |Sales             |Profits           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increased         |44.9              |51.2              |37.0              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Remained stable   |33.9              |26.0              |28.3              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined          |13.4              |21.3              |32.0              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no ans-|7.9               |1.6               |2.4               |  |wer               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Stable Employment Except for Farming Areas </H5>   With the exception of the agricultural sector, Colombian  businesses did not have any traumatic experiences on the  employment level during the final quarter of last year.    Based on the responses from half the businessmen queried by  EL TIEMPO, between October and December the numbers of jobs  remained stable, as had occurred during the previous quarters.    The situation is explained by the absorption of new workers  on the part of sectors such as construction and services, which  compensated for the predicament in the farming areas.    In fact, during the quarter that has just ended, the boom in  building activity continued, generating an increased demand for  labor.    Medium-sized business had a particularly dynamic performance  with respect to the generation of jobs, as did exporters.    Nevertheless, the fact that 44 percent of the farmers  questioned claimed that their personnel rosters were cut  corroborates, once again, the evidence of a crisis in the sector.    The decline in production in the farming areas, combined  with  the elimination of certain crops, the insecurity, and the low  investment by businessmen, sustained the recession.    Despite this, the government's data and that of the farmers  themselves warrant the prediction of a recovery beginning this  year.  <H5>  Transportation Boom </H5>   Nevertheless, and contrary to what might be expected, the  farmers joined with the majority of economic sectors in agreeing  on the slight effect of the apertura program on employment.    A total of 57 percent of the businessmen polled claimed that  the process undertaken by the government has not generated a  crisis in their personnel rosters.    The results appear to confirm the latest figure from the  National Administrative Department of Statistics (DANE), showing  that the unemployment rate dropped to 7.9 percent in 1993.  Therefore, the fear of a massive layoff generated by the  internationalization of the economy has been precluded.    In cases such as that of the transportation firms, the  effect  of apertura on employment was particularly favorable. This  performance may be explained if one considers the boom in  imports and, hence, the greater movement of freight from port  terminals.    On the other hand, some manufacturers claimed that the  process had a negative effect on their companies' payroll. The  sector hardest hit was medium-sized industry, while the effect  on large industry was slighter.    This is explained by the desire to cut production costs, so  that an exaggerated price increase will not occur.    What Happened to Employment?

Nevertheless, during the final quarter of last year, the  sector slowed down, owing to the problems of raw material  shortages.    According to the builders, the sector's main problem is the  formalities required with the planning authorities, which are  making it increasingly difficult to obtain a permit.    Moreover, insecurity has become the second factor upsetting  the construction industry. Based on the results of EL TIEMPO's  Economic Opinion Poll, 26 percent of those polled consider the  sector's main problem to be insecurity.  <H5>  Sales Stagnant </H5>   The slowdown in the construction industry is reflected by  the  stagnation in sales recorded during the past three months.    A total of 66 percent of the builders polled claimed that  the  final quarter sales remained stable in comparison with the  previous period; while 26 percent reported growth, and 6.7  percent noted that sales had declined.    Similarly, 53 percent of the construction firms froze their  personnel rosters; while 33 percent expanded them, and only 6.7  percent reduced their employee payroll.    The construction companies are relatively optimistic  regarding Colombia's economic growth in 1994: 53 percent think  that the GDP will rise between 4 and 5 percent; while a quarter  of those polled expect the economy to grow between 5 and 6  percent.    According to the construction businessmen, the apertura  process has been favorable, or has had no effect on the sector.  Only 6.7 percent think that the internationalization of the  economy has been detrimental to the construction industry.    With regard to inflation, two-thirds of the businessmen  queried believe that the 19 percent goal will not be met this  year; on the other hand, they think that the CPI [Consumer Price  Index] will be more or less the same as that of last year.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction (Profits) (figures are percentages)                             |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increased                             |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Remained stable                       |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined                              |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Insecurity Less Disturbing </H5>   Although insecurity is still the chief problem of the  Colombian economy, its effect has begun to wane, according to  many businessmen.    This is inferred from the Economic Opinion Poll taken by EL  TIEMPO, in which 26 percent of those interviewed considered it  the most disturbing factor during 1993.    Nevertheless, it is less so when that figure is compared  with  the 46 percent of persons polled who cited it as the main  problem during the third quarter of 1993, and the 59 percent of  businessmen who regarded it as the most disturbing factor during  the period October-December 1992.    The insecurity reflected in the guerrilla attacks, terrorist  assaults, kidnappings, ticket selling, and common crime has been  an obstacle in recent years to the strengthening of the economy  and to increased foreign investment.    For a long time, Colombia has been considered abroad as a  nation in which investment is not advisable, owing to the risks  that businessmen and foreign capital might run.    Nevertheless, during the past few months the public order  atmosphere has improved. With the death of the Medellin Cartel  chief, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, and the possible surrender of the  Cali Cartel chiefs, hopes of a new climate of peace in the  national territory have been reinforced.    The transportation sector appears to be one of those most  damaged by insecurity. This was the view of 50 percent of those  interviewed.  <H5>  Revaluation a Worry </H5>   Another problem that is still besetting the improved  performance of the Colombian economy is the apertura process,  which has been translated into greater competition for national  products.    The economy's nationalization, in effect for four years, has  proven unfavorable for the agricultural-livestock sector, which  has complained of unfair competition from the subsidies applied  by other nations to their products.    Yet another very disturbing factor is the policy of  revaluation, or strengthening of the peso with respect to the  dollar. It was promoted last year for the purpose of preventing  a greater rise in the cost of living.    The uncertainty surrounding the economic management, which  had been a highly disturbing factor, moved to a secondary level.  Only 10 percent of those polled claimed it to be the principal  economic problem. Apparently, there is greater confidence  regarding the goals proposed by the government and the direction  of the monetary, exchange, and credit policies.    Oddly enough, contraband appears to be a lesser problem,  despite the constant complaints from businessmen of its damaging  repercussions on the economy.    When the problems of Colombian business firms are analyzed,  the fears become reversed. Insecurity is not so important, while  apertura and revaluation definitely are.    The effects of revaluation are especially disturbing to the  agricultural and industrial sectors. This is understandable when  one considers the fact that they are receiving less income from  the exports of their products.    On repeated occasions, producers, and especially exporters,  have insisted that the devaluation rate should be higher. In  1993, the devaluation was 13 percent, and a similar trend is  anticipated for this year.    Their argument is that, despite the efforts that they are  making to compete, their profitability will not improve unless  there is a shift in the exchange policy.

Although  there have been no terrorist attacks on buses and trucks during  recent months, kidnapping and ticket selling are still a  disturbing factor for transportation businessmen. Proof of this  is the fact that a high proportion of company owners queried  refused to answer the question about the performance of their  profits.    According to EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll, although  apertura increased the supply of freight, it also facilitated  the entry of imported vehicles, which have flooded the market  and caused a decline in the sector's profitability.    Of the total number polled, 40 percent claimed that sales  had  risen during the final quarter of last year, while 25 percent  maintained that the demand for their services had been reduced  considerably. A small proportion reported stability in their  sales.    A similar situation occurred in the case of profits. Whereas  40 percent of the businessmen indicated that they remained  stable between October and December of last year, a quarter of  those queried claimed to have had losses in their operations.  Nevertheless, 20 percent noted that their profits had risen  during the quarter.  <H5>  Personnel Rosters Frozen </H5>   Despite the difficulties confronting the sector, during the  final quarter of 1993 there were no massive layoffs of workers.  Half of the companies questioned froze the personnel payroll,  while 25 percent expanded it, and only 15 percent reduced the  employee roster.    In the opinion of most transportation businessmen, the  government's economic management deserves a rating of 3.5; while  30 percent of the businessmen polled even gave it a grade of 4.0  on a scale of one to five.    Based on the inquiries made in the EOE, the transportation  sector approves of the government's target for economic growth  this year: 40 percent of them believe that the GDP will grow 5  percent during 1994. However, a quarter of the businessmen  indicated that this year's GDP would fluctuate between 3 and 4  percent.    The same thing holds true of inflation: 35 percent of the  transportation businessmen polled believe that this year's CPI  will stand between 19 and 20 percent.    Nevertheless, a quarter of the businessmen queried claim  that  the government's inflation target will not be met, because it  will exceed 22 percent. Others think that the CPI will exceed  its bounds in 1994, reaching levels of over 25 percent.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transportation (Profits, final quarter/93) (figures are percentages)         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Stable                                |40                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rose                                  |25                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined                              |25                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |15                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Exporters Improve Profits </H5>   Despite the peso revaluation, the economic stagnation in the  developed countries, and the decline in certain international  prices, exporters ended the year better off than expected.    During the last quarter of 1993, sales increased for half of  the businessmen, and remained stable for 22.9 percent. This was  converted into the year's best performance, with the exception  of the first quarter.    During the 1992 Christmas season, the sector registered a  slight recovery, because on that occasion sales increased for  only 46 percent of businessmen, according to the results of EL  TIEMPO's Economic Opinion Poll.    Although profits improved, they are still the main source of  concern to a third of the businessmen polled.    During the Christmas season, according to 30.5 percent of  those interviewed, their profits increased; whereas 33.9 percent  thought that they had declined.    This performance shows a substantial improvement over the  results for the July-September quarter, when 55.3 percent of the  businessmen posted reductions in their profits.    The revaluation that coexisted with exporters throughout the  year became one of the main factors depressing the sector's  profits.    The slower rate of currency devaluation caused businessmen  to  receive fewer pesos for their sales abroad, while this proved to  be a good deal for importers.    Last year, the devaluation was 13 percent, whereas in 1992  it  stood at 14.84 percent.    The other two problems hurting the exporting sector were  insecurity and apertura.    The most negative effect of apertura was concentrated on  profits: 47.5 percent of those polled thought that it had an  unfavorable influence on their earnings.    This is due to the fact that most business firms combine  their export labor with internal sales. Hence, the competition  from imported products and unfair commercial practices that  caused anxiety for industry also harmed this sector.    The effort expended by exporters to improve their  productivity is noteworthy. By the year's end, 60 percent had  achieved gains in this respect, and only 6.8 percent registered  declines.    The government estimates that the increase in foreign sales  will be 5.6 percent at the end of 1993.    However, judging from the performance of exports between  January and September, this goal does not appear readily  attainable.    The latest report from the National Administrative  Department  of Statistics showed a 13.5 percent rise in nontraditional  exports as of September.    This increase managed to offset the decline in sales of  coffee, oil, fuels, and other banner products, and prevented the  occurrence of a drop in total sales, which rose 2.0 percent.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exporting Sector (figures are percentages)                                 |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                  |Production        |Sales             |Profits           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increased         |44.1              |50.0              |30.5              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Remained stable   |28.8              |24.6              |31.4              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined          |11.9              |22.9              |33.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no ans-|15.3              |2.5               |4.2               |  |wer               |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Finance Ministry                                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Skepticism Regarding 1994 Inflation </H5>   Colombian businessmen remain skeptical concerning the 19  percent inflation target set for 1994, but are optimistic about  the growth of the Colombian economy.    Although the government and the Bank of the Republic's board  of directors have claimed that they will do everything in their  power to meet that goal, only 17 percent of those polled expect  inflation to stand between 19 and 20 percent. The remaining 50  percent, on the other hand, claim that it will be higher.    The uncertainty regarding the performance of the cost of  living continues, because many sectors expect food prices to  start rebounding.    Nevertheless, with the latest measures adopted, the  government took the first steps toward meeting its goal. It  readjusted prices of fuel and public services, with the  exception of electric power, based on the anticipated inflation.  And, for the first time, it raised the salaries of public  workers and the legal minimum wage below the inflation rate of  the immediately previous year.    As for the rise of inflation in 1993, precisely, half of  those polled agreed on a figure, indicating that it would stand  between 22 and 23 percent. Another 30 percent predicted that it  would be higher.    At the end of 1993, the cost of living stood at 22.6  percent,  according to data furnished by the National Administrative  Department of Statistics.  <H5>  Economy Will Grow </H5>   Regarding the growth in the gross domestic product, 31  percent of the businessmen claim that, by the end of this year,  the increase in goods and services produced in the country will  range between 4.0 and 5.0 percent. The government maintains that  it will be 5.0 percent.    This index is similar to that for the growth registered in  1993 that, according to the preliminary figures submitted by the  National Department of Planning, was 5.16 percent.    A remaining 22 percent are more optimistic, expecting the  growth in the economy to exceed 5.0 percent.    The uncertainty over a greater increase is associated with  the change that might occur in public spending, which was one of  the main driving forces of the economy last year.    However, sectors such as construction and transportation,  which contributed much to the increase, could begin to show a  decline.    Nevertheless, the government claims that it will compensate  for these possible reductions with an impetus to infrastructure,  primarily to road construction and rehabilitation.    With respect to the growth in the GDP for 1993, 48 percent  of  the businessmen interviewed were more cautious, indicating that  it would stand between 3.0 and 4.0 percent. On the other hand,  26 percent thought that it could reach 4.0 or 5.0 percent; and  only 11 percent estimated that the figure might prove higher.    In general, manufacturers believe that the economic picture  in 1994 will be quite similar to that during the immediately  previous year.  <H5>  Workers: Fair in Productivity </H5>   If it were finally decided to adjust the minimum wage based  on the workers' productivity, Colombians would not come out so  badly. However, they would not have excellent results either.    According to the rating given by 300 businessmen queried in  the Economic Opinion Poll, white collar workers would receive  7.3 points out of 10 on the productivity scale.    Although it is a medium grade, the businessmen claimed it to  be higher than the rating that the workers would have received  before apertura.    In fact, 54 percent of those polled reported that the  efficiency of their labor increased throughout the year; whereas  only seven percent cited any decline.    And there is every indication that the rating rose as a  result of the competition generated by apertura. Both  businessmen and workers had to adjust to the standards of their  international competitors, so as not be excluded from the market.    The progress was especially significant in agroindustrial,  manufacturing, and commercial firms.  <H5>  Without Purchasing Power </H5>   Nevertheless, the improvement was not reflected in the  monthly salaries of operative workers in companies: 52.3 percent  are earning between the minimum wage and 200,000 pesos.    This means that the majority of white-collar workers cannot  purchase the basic family shopping basket which, according to  October data from the National Administrative Department of  Statistics, costs 195,418 pesos.    Only 31 percent of the workers have the necessary purchasing  power to buy the items included in the basket for one month.    They will be even less able to purchase the products in  1994.  If the 19 percent inflation target is met, the price of the  basket for laborers and the lower stratum will reach 232,547  pesos by the year's end.    The sector in which wages are most depressed is agriculture:  something explained by the decline in that industry's  profitability. The majority of workers in the farming areas, on  the medium and low levels, earn even less than 150,000 pesos.    The income level for most of the laborers working in  construction also fails to suffice for the purchase of the DANE  shopping basket. In fact, 66 percent of the operative white  collar workers in that sector earn between 150,000 and 200,000  pesos.    The average salaries among administrative workers are  better:  39 percent are earning between 350,000 and 450,000 pesos per  month. This means that they can only purchase the items in the  basic shopping basket twice.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Workers' Productivity (scale of 0-10)                                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agriculture                           |7.47                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Industry                              |7.29                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Construction                          |7.47                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commerce                              |7.36                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Transportation                        |7.30                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Services                              |7.33                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Exporters                             |7.30                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average total                         |7.36                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Commerce: Christmas Did Not Meet Expectations </H5>   Although half of the merchants had increased sales between  October and December 1993, the results were very poor compared  with those of the same period in 1992, when they rose to 86  percent.    But, low blow and all, the last quarter was the best of the  year, as is traditional.    Commerce is one of the sectors benefiting most from the  reactivation prompted by the Christmas celebrations, even more  than industry, because it distributes both national and imported  products.    It is not without reason that EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion  Poll shows only 10.8 percent of those interviewed reporting  declines in their sales.    Furthermore, the earnings of merchants rebounded during the  final quarter: 40.5 percent showed increases in their profits,  while 27.0 percent claimed that they remained stable compared  with the previous quarter.    Although apertura has been beneficial for the sector,  facilitating imports of goods, it has also allowed contraband to  remain protected by legal imports.    A total of 43.2 percent of those interviewed think that  apertura has had a favorable influence on their imports; and  40.5 percent say that it has been beneficial to their income.    As for the effect on profits, the opinions are divided: 32.4  percent indicate that it was positive, and 29.7 percent, that it  was negative.    The dismantling of customs' controls, which occurred after  the merger of the Tax Directorate and the National Customs, was  also decisive in converting contraband into one of the sector's  principal problems.    The other major bottleneck for commerce was insecurity,  which  surrounded all economic activities.    Merchants, who began 1993 rating the government very harshly  (they gave it a passing grade with three "reprimands"), granted  it a 3.5 rating at the year's end.    According to the EOE, the services sector (excluding the  financial system) showed a good performance during the final  quarter of 1993.    A total of 54.8 percent of those interviewed reported  increases in their sales, while 21 percent cited stability.    Included in this sector are restaurants, travel agencies,  and  consulting firms, among others.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Business Sector (Sales) (figures are percentages)                            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increased                             |51.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Remained stable                       |32.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined                              |10.8                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |5.4                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Agroindustry Did Not Fare So Badly in 1993 </H5>   Amid the skepticism that has surrounded rural production, a  considerable portion of agroindustry achieved gains in its  principal indicators.    According to the results of EL TIEMPO's Economic Opinion  Poll, 32.7 percent of those polled estimated that there was an  increase in agroindustrial production. In the view of 23  percent, it remained stable, while another 11.3 percent claimed  that it had declined.    The sector has no confidence in the 19 percent inflation  target for 1994. Nearly 80 percent of the businessmen queried  assert that this year's consumer price index will exceed 20  percent.    Contrary to the farmers' opinions, the processors of  agricultural raw materials claim that apertura has been  beneficial.    Of the businessmen polled, 31 percent did not think that the  apertura process hurt their profits; and 23 percent stated that  the economy's internationalization had proven favorable.    Similarly, 36 percent claimed that apertura did not hurt  their sales during the last quarter of 1993; whereas 25 percent  blamed it for the reduction in their income.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Agroindustry (Production) (figures are percentages)                          |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Increased                             |32.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Remained stable                       |23.0                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Declined                              |11.3                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Don't know/no answer                  |33                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Methodology of Public Opinion Poll </H5>   The Public Opinion Poll sought the opinions of 300  businessmen from the seven principal sectors comprising the  gross domestic product.    To collect the information, the firm Yankelovich Innova de  Colombia used the list of 370,000 business firms throughout the  country produced by the Confederation of Chambers of Commerce  (Confecamaras).    The surveys were answered directly by representatives on the  management level of the organizations selected.    The analysis of the data and writing of the texts were  performed by the journalists Luis Alberto Lopera (economic  editor), Jaime Mejia Mazuera, Marcela Escobar Ramirez,  Jacqueline Guevara, Clara Ines Rueda, Edmer Tovar, Jaime  Cristancho, and Carlos Fernando Gaitan.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Wool industry 'emerging from crisis' Australia's wool industry is just pulling out of a crisis that lasted for the past three years, according to Mr Barry Jackson, managing director of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. A collapse in price led the country's 70,000 growers to run up debts of ADollars 2.8bn. In 1991, following the withdrawal of a reserve price scheme by the Australian government, prices dropped to 348 cents a kilogram but have since climbed back to 600 cents. Production declined because of the downturn in price, bringing the market closer to equilibrium. In a talk to the Australian Business in Europe forum, Mr Jackson said that last year was the fourth in which sales had exceeded output, which meant that the government's stockpile of 4.5m bales of wool was being eroded. He said the stockpile and producers' debts which now stood at ADollars 1.2bn should be eliminated in three to four years. 'We've gone from being a very conservative, producer-orientated industry to being much more market and consumer- related,' Mr Jackson said. Australia's wool organisation co-ordinates research and development work for growers. It has also recently taken over the direction of the International Wool Secretariat which is based in Ilkley in Yorkshire but for which Australia provides 85 per cent of the funds. The secretariat will be moved to Melbourne, where Mr Jackson plans to rebuild reserves and start advertising wool to consumers again. 'Competition is against cotton and synthetics, not wool from other countries,' he said. Wool accounts for between 7 and 10 per cent of Australia's exports at a value of ADollars 3 to ADollars 4bn a year. Mr Jackson is keen to pitch wool as a quality product and not just a commodity. Wool accounts for just 4 per cent of world fibre output which is dominated by cotton and synthetic fibres and although world demand is growing, production is constrained by limitation of space for keeping sheep.</p>

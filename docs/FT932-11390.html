			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / Major faces retreat on Maastricht amendment: Speaker's ruling paves way for vote on treaty's social chapter MR JOHN MAJOR was facing the prospect of a damaging climbdown over the Maastricht treaty last night after the speaker of the House of Commons ruled that MPs should be given another chance to vote on its social chapter. The ruling by Miss Betty Boothroyd, reversing an earlier decision by Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, precipitated a confrontation on the eve of tomorrow's Newbury by-election and of nationwide county council polls. It gave Tory Euro-sceptics and opposition parties the chance they had been seeking for months - to use the social chapter to overturn the government's majority on the treaty. Amid conflicting legal opinions on the significance of the proposed amendment to the Maastricht bill, victory for the government's opponents would set the stage for a protracted legal battle over ratification. The signs at Westminster last night were that, left with the unpalatable choice of defeat or retreat in the House of Commons, the prime minister will prefer the latter. That would mean acceptance of a Labour amendment, supported for different reasons by the Liberal Democrats and by hard-line Tory Euro-sceptics, designed to dilute Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social provisions. Liberal Democrats last night voted with the government to allow debate on Maastricht to continue until early this morning, allowing for a clash over the amendment later today. Mr Major's aides insisted that the amendment would not in the end affect British ratification. Advice given to the prime minister by the attorney-general suggests that the amendment would be a legal irritant rather than a substantive obstacle. The official line from Downing Street was: 'The government does not take the view that the amendment if passed would prevent ratification of the Maastricht treaty.' Aides added that the opt-out from the social chapter would also remain intact if the amendment, known as amendment 2, was passed. That assessment was fiercely rejected by the Tory Euro-sceptics who insisted that the amendment would effectively wreck ratification by preventing the operation of the treaty's social dimension. If the government presses ahead regardless, the sceptics will challenge it in the High Court through the procedure known as judicial review. By contrast, the Labour party insisted that if the government accepted the amendment, or was defeated in a vote, it would have little alternative but to join the other 11 Community states in implementing the treaty's social provisions. All three interpretations of the potential impact of the amendment are plausible because of the obscure wording needed to conform with the procedures of the House of Commons. The amendment calls for the entire protocol on the social chapter - including the opt-out - to be deleted from the version of the treaty which will be enshrined in British law.

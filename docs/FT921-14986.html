			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Labour acts to counter Tory tax campaign THE Labour leadership yesterday unveiled a strategy to claim the moral high ground in the forthcoming general election campaign as a counter to the Conservative onslaught on its plans for higher taxes. Mr Neil Kinnock led a succession of speakers at a party rally in York warning that voters would not be 'bribed' by a cut in the basic rate of income tax in the Budget. He was speaking on a platform emblazoned with the union flag and bearing the slogan Made in Britain. Mr Kinnock argued that the electorate would make a clear choice in favour of more resources for the health service, for pensions, for education, and for child benefit. 'The British people do not want a Tory 'save our skins' Budget. They want a 'save our country' Budget,' he said. He insisted that voters would put fairness and community ahead of tax cuts. Conservative ministers continued to warn that Labour's tax and spending plans would mean large increases in the bills of the vast majority of taxpayers. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour wanted higher taxes 'for no better reason than socialist spite'. Senior Tories believe they drove Labour on to the defensive last week and hope for similar success in this week's planned offensive on Labour's defence policy. Mr John Major, meanwhile, will resume his meetings with cabinet ministers on the Tory manifesto. Ministers are deliberately controlling the release of detailed information on its contents for maximum impact. Shadow cabinet ministers emphasised yesterday that only the wealthy would be hit by the party's plans. They claimed that Labour's proposals for increased public spending would mark the start of a moral crusade. Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy leader, said higher taxes on the rich to pay for increased pensions and child benefit would be a major milestone on the road to a more equal society. Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said the party would respond to Conservative selfishness by proclaiming the enduring socialist values of justice and co-operation. Despite a five-point lead for Labour over the Conservatives in the latest opinion poll, speakers at the rally acknowledged implicitly Labour's concern to sharpen its positive appeal to voters. Mr Hattersley referred to the need for conviction rather than caution in the election campaign. Mr Brown said that the rally marked the start of a moral crusade to turn sympathisers into supporters and the half-hearted into the wholly committed. Private Labour unease about the threat posed by a Conservative focus on its tax plans was marked by an admission by shadow cabinet members. They do not plan to reverse Budget tax cuts which focus on raising thresholds rather than on the basic rate. The rally marked the start of what Labour promises will be the most intensive campaign ever launched in the run-up to a general election. Attended by more than 1,000 supporters and characterised by the glitz which has become the party's campaign trademark it will be repeated throughout the country in the next few months. Confidence among UK companies about the business outlook has fallen in the past three months, according to a Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey published today. It found that six out of 10 companies saw no immediate improvement in the outlook for sales or new orders. Page 6 Ashdown hardens coalition terms Page 6</p>

			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Fashion: For women who wear the trousers - Lucia van der Post greets a collection that is soft, appealing and well-priced There are, as any woman will tell you, trouser suits and trouser suits. There are those that are deliberately, primarily even, ambiguous. These are worn when a woman is at her most supremely confident, when she feels assertive, mean, moody, able to take on the world. They have a hint of cross-dressing, a whisper of the decadent. This is the trouser suit that Yves Saint Laurent so memorably brought to life when he became the first designer (way back in 1969) to show us all the sexual punch that a woman dressed in a sharply-cut, mannish suit could wield. This is the sort that every woman who seeks to be at the edge of fashion will want to have in her wardrobe this season. Then there are the trouser suits that purvey a different message - soft, feminine, slightly waifish. Here is a woman vulnerable in a man's world, no hint of androgeny or sexual power. Unstructured, with easy trousers and accommodating waistlines, these are suits that whisper gently, that hint at curves instead of silhouetting them. These are the trouser suits a woman dons when she wants above all to be comfortable, to be able to run for a bus or a tube, when she wants practical clothing for sitting in an office or travelling in an aeroplane. Trousers, as a regular acceptable part of the female wardrobe, have arrived only recently. As Alison Lurie points out in The Language of Clothes it was not until the late 1960s that 'trouser suits finally became elegant as well as respectable, and underwear vanished or mutated into harmless forms. Even before the second wave of women's liberation got underway, the long struggle for comfort and freedom in female dress seem to have been won at last'. Today, many working women like nothing more than to indulge in a bit of role-playing - ambiguously, sharply-suited by night, relaxed, comfortable, easy by day. For those looking for the unashamedly practical trouser suit, the sort that is smart enough to go the office (and today there are fewer and fewer offices where trouser suits are still not allowed) and comfortable enough for easy striding out, a newish name on the scene to look out for is Sahza The label is the un-camel-like product of design by committee. The collection was created by the vast Italian clothing manufacturer, GFT Donna. It is carefully targeted at the modern, probably working, woman. The brief to the design team was that the look should above all be soft and practical and that prices should be middle of the road. With almost no publicity it has already become hugely successful. At Fenwick of New Bond Street, London W1 it was only introduced last autumn and was such a success that this autumn it has been given twice the space on the very prominent first floor. According to Mary Flack of Fenwick: 'It is exactly right for the working woman. It is a clever combination of separates with jackets that work with trousers or skirts. There are lots of pieces that can mix together, though perfect for the office it isn't boring and its prices are way below designer labels.' At Harvey Nichols, too, where it was first sold in the spring / summer of 1993, it has proved a wow and has been given a whole wall to itself. Sahza does equally soft and easy to wear skirts and jackets. There is a whole collection of knitwear which can be teamed with the trousers and skirts. Sketched here are three of its suits for the coming winter. The Sahza label is widely available but probably the biggest selection is at Harvey Nichols of Knightsbridge, London SW1, and Fenwick of New Bond Street, London W1. Other stockists are Flannels of Manchester and Jenners of Edinburgh. For a local stockist tel: 071-629 5592.</p>

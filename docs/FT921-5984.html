			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Books: When 'Matador' missed the bus MALAYA 1941: THE FALL OF A FIGHTING EMPIRE by Andrew Gilchrist Robert Hale Pounds 15.95, 185 pages JUST 50 years ago this month the British imperial garrison at Singapore surrendered to Japanese forces, after a mere two months during which Malaya had been invaded and Churchill's 'fortress' besieged. Although these tragic events may pale by comparison with 'the day of infamy' at Pearl Harbour on December 7 1941, they should, after half a century, be remembered and studied by anyone who wishes to know why the British Empire of the East utterly collapsed. The consequences of that collapse (and somewhat illusory post-war recovery) are with us today. Sir Andrew Gilchrist was an experienced eye-witness of Japan's preparations for war. He was in Singapore as Nemesis approached. He is a careful student of the British Government's hapless search for appeasement or deterrent. Now he has written an account of the all but insoluble strategic problems, confusion at the command level and, above all, collapse of morale - indeed, often sheer absence of it - which is to be commended for lucidity and for that rare ability to see events as they overwhelmed participants at the time, not as they appear by the light of retrospective wisdom. The fundamental causes of British defeat at the hands of a race which even quite enlightened Englishmen regarded as inferior - and certainly unable to handle ships and aircraft with the skill of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force - were not only the absence of strategic resources in the Far East but a lack of will to fight intelligently, boldly, or stubbornly with those which were available or had been sent reluctantly, and belatedly, by the War Cabinet in mid-October 1941. By this date two stark factors could no longer be ignored in London: Japan was bent on war; Roosevelt would not keep 'that Japanese dog quiet' - as Churchill had asked him to do in May 1940 - and would certainly not help defend British Asiatic interests until the balloon actually went up. Impaled on the horns of these dilemmas, the British commanders - of whom the most senior, air vice marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham was an elderly dugout, intelligent but indecisive - advocated a pre-emptive operation (MATADOR) into Thailand at one moment, rescinded it the next, then finally abandoned it but then concocted a provisional warning order for moving forces to the Thai border on December 6. That day Japanese forces were sighted at sea, clearly bent on invasion. MATADOR had missed the bus; immediate defeat was followed by collapse, redeemed by much gallantry, sometimes by the least experienced troops, but leading to an inevitable, humiliating fate. Sir Andrew describes this melancholy affair in language which evokes Somerset Maugham: Britain's Asiatic empire was not much to be proud of, and when the yellow peril finally struck, headlong flight (for 'Whites only') became a dominating emotion. Such cruel revelation of imperial decay was however redeemed not only by those who fought on, but by two acts which deserve a salute today: Prince of Wales and Repulse, sailing to their inevitable doom thanks to lack of air cover, and Sir Shenton Thomas, governor of the Straits Settlements. He, with his wife, stayed at his post to endure with those who didn't get away 'four years of miserable captivity'. Sir Andrew cannot match Arthur Marder's Homeric narrative of the last voyage and heroic death of Prince of Wales and Repulse, but he does remind any reader with sensibility and imagination that, futile and horrible although war always is, courage survives to sustain even forlorn hopes. By the same token Sir Shenton, quiet, stolid, resolute, ensured that those left behind in Singapore shared their captivity with a Governor moulded in an older, honourable tradition.</p>

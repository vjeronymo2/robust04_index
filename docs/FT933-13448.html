			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: Arlen to seek Pounds 7m via rights ARLEN, maker of fluorescent control gear and accessories, is raising substantial funds for development and reduction of indebtedness with the backing of Fortress Trust. Fortress will underwrite a significant part of 1-for-1 rights issue by Arlen at 21p per share to raise some Pounds 7m gross. If Fortress does not acquire 29.9 per cent of the capital through rights renounced or underwriting of shares not taken up, then it will subscribe directly for shares at 23.5p as will equate to a 29.9 per cent shareholding. That could raise up to a further Pounds 2.4m. The directors of Arlen have noted the recent movement in the share price - on Friday it rose 7p to 35p. They say the rights at 21p was agreed against the background of the quote of 14p when discussions commenced in March until early May, when the share price began to increase. Mr Greville Howard, chairman of Fortress, and three of his non-executive colleagues, will become directors of Arlen.</p>

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Council Tax: Changes to be adapted to Scottish needs - Scotland/Wales The outcome of the next general election will be influenced by the electorate's acceptance or rejection of the new council tax announced yesterday. Plans have also been published for streamlining local government by introducing a single tier of authorities in place of many county and district councils. FT writers report on the proposals and their implications IN SCOTLAND the new council tax will operate in the same way as planned for England and Wales, Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, announced yesterday. However, while the discount, rebate and transitional arrangements would be the same, some details of the tax might be varied to meet Scottish circumstances. Most households in Scotland were in the lowest three bands, where the average bill for a two-person household would be Pounds 380 and Pounds 280 for a one-person household, Mr Lang said. To prevent the new tax from reaching unacceptable levels, he said he was making his capping powers - not exercised in Scotland under the poll tax - equal with those of the Environment and Welsh secretaries. A new system for the payment of water and sewerage charges would also be introduced. Mr David Hunt, the Welsh secretary, told the Commons that detailed arrangements to replace the poll tax in Wales might need to differ to meet local circumstances. The taxing of second homes was one area where different provisions might be needed. 'The proposal I have brought forward today looks at Wales as a country in itself,' he said. 'There is no transposition of values from England to Wales.' Mr Donald Dewar, opposition spokesman for Scotland, said the system had been rigged to protect the better-off. 'Can it be right that the most expensive property in Newton Mearns or Morningside pays at the most only two and a half times the most battered council house in Easterhouse or Pilton?' he asked. The move to a single-tier tax was 'riding on Labour's coat-tails', according to Mr Barry Jones, the party's Welsh spokesman, who also accused the government of giving 'special treatment' to the wealthiest people in Wales.</p>

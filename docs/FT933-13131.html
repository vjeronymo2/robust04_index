			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Police launch campaign against Sheehy changes POLICE OFFICERS staged the biggest demonstration in their history last night in protest against the Sheehy committee's recommendations for radical changes in pay and conditions. More than 20,000 officers from throughout the UK filled London's Wembley Arena and overflow halls. They launched a campaign to force the government to abandon the recommendations, which include fixed-term contracts and performance-related pay. Police officers are banned by law from taking strike action, and last night's exceptional demonstration was the most dramatic form of public opposition to the proposals open to them. But Mr Alan Eastwood, chairman of the Police Federation, warned that the rally was 'only the very small beginning of our struggle' to defeat Sheehy. It marked the start of a 'campaign to save the service from the disaster of this report'. The rally was organised by the federation, which represents officers up to the rank of chief inspector, and the Superintendents' Association. Mr Richard Wells, chief constable of South Yorkshire, said that the Sheehy committee had viewed the police service through 'tight, prejudiced, narrow fiscal windows'. Officers felt sick with worry over their own futures and that of the service, he added. Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, is holding consultations on the recommendations until September, and has stressed that he has not yet reached conclusions on any of them. Police reform and the fight against crime have become high-profile political questions for the government. It is due to legislate on proposals to make police authorities more businesslike and on those aspects of Sheehy accepted by the government in the next parliamentary session. Last night's rally was addressed by Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, and Mr Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman. Mr Maclennan received a standing ovation for a speech in which he described the Sheehy report as a malevolent exercise whose primary purpose was to cut the cost of policing rather than improve it. Mr Blair said the test of police reforms must be whether they helped cut crime rather than help the Treasury to cut corners.</p>

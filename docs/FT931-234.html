			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Terrorist insurance criticism THE ASSOCIATION of Risk Managers in Industry and Commerce yesterday criticised the Association of British Insurers and the Department of Trade and Industry for their response to providing cover for terrorist damage. Speaking at the risk managers' annual conference, Ms Liz Taylor, who chairs the risk managers, said Pool Re, the terrorist damage insurance pool, had been devised without consultation with clients or brokers. 'Pool Re has been hastily conceived with considerable government strictures,' she said. She added that the managing director had few resources to assist his work. But she called on her members to support Pool Re and warned that if they did not there would be a serious risk it would founder. She warned that the costs of the scheme might be excessive, and a number of important issues about it remained unresolved.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Aylwin snubs Chilean health strikers THE CHILEAN government has refused to negotiate with striking health workers, whose national stoppage today enters its third week. Most hospitals yesterday continued to turn away all non-emergency cases, a situation that has persisted since the 55,000-strong Federation of National Health Workers called a national strike on October 6. President Patricio Aylwin recently told the federation, which comprises mainly low-paid auxiliary hospital staff: 'This strike is pointless. The position of the government is very clear: we will not negotiate while strike action continues'. Last week the president's phrase 'not a peso more' was splashed over the front pages. The governing centre-left coalition, the Concertacion, is determined not to appear weak in the face of popular demands, many of which have festered since the end of Chile's 17-year military rule in 1990. Many middle class and semi-skilled workers saw their real wages drop substantially during the 1980s. The Concertacion has insisted that its policy of fiscal restraint, maintained throughout four years in office, will not be slackened in the run-up to this December's general election. Its determination to resist high wage demands, many of which it regards as politically motivated, is all the more difficult given the economy's average growth rate of 6.5 per cent since 1990. The government has characterised as electioneering the guarded support for health workers from Mr Arturo Alessandri, presidential candidate of the right-wing electoral pact, Union for Chilean Progress.</p>

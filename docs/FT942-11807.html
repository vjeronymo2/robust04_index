			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: More a kind of insurance policy Sir, I suspect that the 'naive faith' on the part of some senior Whitehall decision-takers ('Value for money', April 26) has far less to do with perceived need for outside, objective endorsement for significant projects than with a desire to have someone to blame and to get access to an indemnity insurance policy in the event of a failure. More is the pity, for, as you say, management consultancy properly and positively employed can prove excellent value for money. David Taylor, chartered accountant, 31 Sion Hill, Bath BA1 2UW</p>

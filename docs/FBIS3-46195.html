The reform will focus on the more than 40-year-old free  health service and the labor insurance medical care system.    Informed sources said that the aim of the reform is to let  the government, enterprises and individuals all rationally share  part of the medical expenses.    They disclosed that the changes will include establishing a  medical insurance fund for medical expenses of serious diseases  and setting up individual medical care accounts which will pool  the money from part of the raised salaries of workers.    The reform, which will be tested in some key cities across  the country, will not lower the health care levels of urban  dwellers, said an official from the National Center of Medical  Insurance (NCMI).    Started in 1952, the free medical service system covered  almost all the urban citizens working in government  institutions, some disabled armymen and all the university  students in China. Medical expenses of the 29 million people  covered by the system were borne by the governments at different  levels.    The labor insurance medical care system, started in 1951,  covered the staff and workers of state-owned enterprises and  their close relatives. More than 144 million people in China  were covered by the system and their medical expenses were paid  by their enterprises.    The free and the labor insurance medical care system has  played an important role in protecting public health, promoting  economic development and maintaining social stability in China  during the past four decades, said Liu Xiufeng, vice-director of  the NCMI.    However, Liu said, the disadvantages of the system are also  obvious: The excessive use of expensive medicines, and the  indiscriminate waste of money.    Statistics showed that in the latter half of the 1980s, the  annual growth rate of medical expenditure in China in the free  medical care sector was greater than the growth rate of the  national financial income.    The free and the labor insurance medical system has made the  government and enterprises undertake too much, while individuals  basically did not pay any medical expenses. "Such a system goes  beyond China's present social and economic development levels,"  said Liu.    In March, 1989, four cities -- Siping in Jilin Province,  Dandong in Liaoning Province, Huangshi in Hubei Province and  Zhuzhou in Hunan Province -- all medium-sized, were selected for  testing the medical insurance system.    Meanwhile, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and in  Hainan Province, wider reforms, covering insurance systems and  free medical care, have achieved initial success.    Now, many places in China also practise the method of  "individuals sharing part of their medical expenses."  individuals cover 10 to 15 percent of their medical costs. The  total paid by individuals every year to cover their medical  expenses at most is no more than an average monthly salary.    "Such a method has helped people become aware of their  medical expenses and control the waste of money and medicines,"  said Liu, adding that the practice has been used among 90  percent of the people who used to enjoy free medical care and 80  percent of the middle and small-sized enterprises which carry  out the labor insurance medical care system.    Public Health Minister Chen Minzhang said the reform of  China's medical care system aims to "fully use the limited  resources, and enhance the consciousness of individuals and  families over medical investment."    It is hoped that through the reform China could establish a  multi-level social medical insurance system which is expected to  make all the people acquire medical security and improve health.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (1): Diversification points the way to greater stability - Although Coventry has large swathes of unused industrial capacity, the city continues to seek an infusion of new economic vitality from outside COVENTRY is the epitome of the UK's industrial cities: a mix of wealth and poverty, of pockets of grace in a suit of drabness, a dependence on the industries which inspired its growth but an increasing reliance on recent diversification, a population in overall decline, but including an enlarging ethnic minority. Smaller than Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool or Manchester, Coventry is, nonetheless, like them in that it has been badly served by the first years of the decade. First the recession of the 1980s, a few brief years of recovery, and then headlong into another recession which has stunted aspiration. There are now, it is true, glimpses of recovery. Since the beginning of the year, most order books have stopped shrinking, but business surveys show that not only in Coventry but in the West Midlands region as a whole, there are large swathes of unused industrial capacity. The latest unemployment figures, and the news that car production in April was still running at a lower level than April 1991, show that the city is far from putting its problems behind it. Coventry is no longer 'car city' in the sense that it was in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, its industrial base cracked in the 1980s recession. Its fortunes, however, are still tied to the motor industry, and not only the industry on a national scale. The success of the industry in carving out export markets has only emphasised the way in which Coventry is borne along on the waves of both the national and international economies. Jaguar's problems in the US markets are a source of worry, and Peugeot Talbot's growing share of the UK market a harbinger of future prosperity, but both are controlled from outside the region. Although the proportion of jobs in the manufacturing sector, dominated by engineering and particularly vehicle assembly, fell during the 1980s from 46 per cent to 34 per cent, and has continued to fall since, large industrial employers still are the main influence on the labour market. But that diminution in the importance of manufacturing is the key to the city's economic future. During the 1980s, Coventry started to change its spots. Creation of more small businesses, the appearance of high technology research companies around the edge of the city and a spate of inward investment were the start of a move towards a more balanced economy. Although headquarters offices were few and far between, Coventry won its share of back-office operations and, in effect, latched on to the industrial economy a new, but relatively low level, office economy. This movement, in turn, has allowed Coventry to weather the present recession in better shape than, otherwise, it might have done. Indeed, the major job losses of the last two years have not been in the services sector; they have been in manufacturing. It is an indication of the greater stability which springs from a larger basket of economic activity that home repossessions in Coventry have been running at 15 per cent below the national average. IT is a moot point whether Coventry will again recapture the importance it enjoyed as a manufacturing centre a generation ago, when the demand for its products seemed everlasting and abundant. Building a new city economy is not easy at the best of times, especially when there is a wider tendency of decentralisation. The drift from the country to the towns which started in the nineteenth century has gone firmly into reverse. Coventry's population began to grow sharply in the second half of that century and reached a peak of about 340,000 during the 1960s, the decade when manufacturing activity peaked. Since the 1970s it has been drifting downwards: manufacturing does not provide the work, the services sector has not fully made up the slack. The outlook for Coventry then is not one of major expansion, but rather to be a medium-sized city with, if the trends which became evident in the 1980s hold firm, a relatively prosperous but varied economy. There are both plus and minus signs. On the plus side is the re-invigoration of the motor industry, Jaguar's problems notwithstanding. This has been stimulated by the presence in the UK of Japanese carmakers and the gradual introduction of Japanese practices to enhance productivity. It has been emphasised by the increasing integration of British-based car makers and component manufacturers into international motor trade. But if the underlying factors needed to secure Coventry's continuing role in the motor industry are in place, the growing number of small high technology companies also offers the hope of industrial diversification into high value-added products. This is the significance of, for example, the University of Warwick science park. At the same time, the geographical position of Coventry, the relative cheapness of its property and land, should ensure that, once there are more solid signs of national economic revival, there will be a steady trickle of corporate refugees from south-east England. What happened in the 1980s should happen again in the 1990s. The challenge will be to have available an adequately trained labour force. The minus signs include the perception that Coventry is not one of the most attractive UK cities. The image of Coventry is of its inspiring cathedral and the gentleness of some its immediate environs. But a wider reality is the drabness of its 1960s architecture. While more jobs may come from inward investment, the vigour of the city will not be assured if the new arrivals want to live outside in the countryside. The future vigour of the city is, of course, dependent on factors other than that. Not least is the task of ensuring that its ethnic minority, largely Asian in origin and now accounting for around 30 per cent of the population, is not left out on a social and economic limb. THERE is the need, too, to banish the industrial detritus of the past, although, in this connection, Coventry does not have, like some of its industrial city peers, huge tracts of derelict land. These two sets of problems come together in the wards of St Michael's and Foleshill. Here, the ethnic minority is concentrated and male unemployment runs up to nearly 35 per cent. Housing in parts of the locality is the worst in Coventry, the industrial infrastructure is decayed, and crime rates are high. Health levels are low relative to the rest of the city, but the funds to make physical improvements, to train the lowly skilled and to provide jobs are in short supply. The city council does not have them and that is why it has made these two wards the subject of a bid for government funding through City Challenge 1992. But housing and unemployment problems spread to the estates in the outer suburbs. Indeed, the events of mid-May, when police clashed with youths on Wood End estate, one of the city's problem areas, were a blunt reminder of the consequences when the cocktail of idle hands, recalcitrant minds and warm weather is shaken too hard. For a city seeking inward investment, the clashes were not the most obvious advertisement.</p>

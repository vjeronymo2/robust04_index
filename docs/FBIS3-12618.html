Mr. Besharati announced this news in an interview with our  correspondent. He added: The good relations between Iran and  Turkey have resulted in the two countries witnessing complete  security on their common borders. He stressed that no country  can bring about security on its borders by itself. He added:  We currently have no problems on our eastern borders either.    Referring to the exceptional situation in northern, central  and southern Iraq, Besharati stressed: The situation in various  parts of Iraq has brought about special conditions on Iranian  borders. Thanks to the alertness of border-dwellers,  particularly the self-sacrificing people of Kordestan, the  security situation in that area, among our country's border  regions, is becoming more favorable.    Referring to the presence of 2.5 to 3 million Afghan  refugees, and also other refugees, in Iran, the interior  minister said: So long as the countries of origin of the  refugees are not calm their presence in Iran is feasible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- A Ministry of Finance [MOF]  report on tax reform was not an attempt to control debate on  planned tax hikes and cuts, and the ministry will provide  additional estimates on the planned tax reform if requested, a  top ministry official said Monday [30 May].    Vice Finance Minister Jiro Saito told a news conference that  the ministry report, issued last Friday, on revenue estimates  for tax cuts and hikes had "no policy implications."    "We will consider positively (on revising the estimates) if  requested," Saito said in brushing off criticism that his  ministry is again trying to steer debate on the tax reform,  particularly in regards to the tax hike rate, maturity of  stopgap bonds and fiscal streamlining.    Saito said the report was just a "mechanical calculation" to  serve as a basis for further discussions by a government tax  panel and the ruling coalition parties.    Pressed by reporters to explain why estimates for a tax hike  of below 7 percent was not included in the report, Saito said,  "there's no reason for us to reject if requested to calculate  estimates on the basis of a 6 percent tax rate."    The report, submitted upon request to the tax commission and  the ruling parties, estimates net revenues in fiscal 2000 after  tax cuts of 6.2 percent are extended and the current 3 percent  consumption tax is raised to between 7 percent and 10 percent in  April 1997.    The ministry was criticized for its failure to include  estimates on a tax hike of below 7 percent, a "natural" tax  revenue increase and possible effects from fiscal and  administrative overhauls.    It was also criticized for setting conditions of redeeming  stopgap bonds to 10 years and financing expected increases in  welfare spending wholly with the tax hike. The stopgap bonds  would fund the three-year time lag between tax cuts and hike.    After reviewing the report Friday, the ruling coalition  asked  the ministry for estimates that include a consumption tax hike  of between 4 percent and 6 percent, "natural" revenue increases  and a 20-year maturity for the stopgap bonds, a ministry  official said.    Saito said the ministry has not decided on conditions for  redeeming stopgap bonds in 10 years but said, "we want to redeem  them as early as possible."    He said fiscal and administrative reforms were "yet unclear  with discussions still under way."</p>

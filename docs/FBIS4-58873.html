			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 9 May (MENA)--In their editorials today,  AL-AHRAM and AL-JUMHURIYAH express deep regret at the escalation  in Yemen, where there is a strong possibility of a long-term war  in which many innocent people will be killed and the country's  economic resources will be destroyed.    AL-AHRAM says the military escalation was accompanied by a  political one as Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  rejected any Arab or non-Arab mediation or entry of Arab troops  to disengage the warring sons of Yemen in the north and south.  Salih, the paper notes, justified this by saying these events  are a Yemeni internal affair.    The paper expresses the fear that secret foreign  intervention  may take place by providing the two sides, or one of them, with  enough weapons to prolong the armed struggle, especially since  some quarters do not wish well to Yemen or the Arabs in general.    The paper recalls the tragedy Lebanon suffered for 16  continuous years.    AL-JUMHURIYAH says no one imagined that the unity between  the  two parts of Yemen would collapse so soon and turn into a war  between the two sides.    The door is now open to all opponents of Yemeni unity to  show  their opposition by taking sides and providing either side with  money and weapons, the paper says.    AL-JUMHURIYAH expresses astonishment that the Yemeni people  should be divided by bloody wars as they face terrible problems,  such as the country's inability to meet its people's basic needs  for food and shelter. Indeed, the paper adds, many schools and  educational facilities were built by grants from Egypt, some  Gulf states, and other fraternal countries.</p>

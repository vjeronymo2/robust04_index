			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Confidence shown on sales growth The owners of small and medium-sized companies believe their sales will grow an average 7.2 per cent during 1994, says a survey published today by the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young. The figure is almost three times as much as the growth forecast for the whole economy by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, in his November Budget. Questioning 480 chief executives of owner-managed businesses, Ernst &amp; Young found that 58 per cent were confident that the economy would improve in the next 12 months, compared with 64 per cent six months ago and 32 per cent a year ago. This confidence must be tempered with caution, says the firm, because 43 per cent of those surveyed had not yet seen signs of recovery themselves. Yet 43 per cent planned to take on staff during 1994 and only 9 per cent expected to make cuts. Overall, the executives planned to employ an average of 3 per cent more staff in 1994. The findings come ahead of Wednesday's official unemployment figures, which could continue the falls of recent months. Within industries, the construction sector expects output to increase by 8 per cent during the year. This compares with an expectation of zero growth in a similar survey a year ago. On a regional analysis, Scotland showed the sharpest improvement, with 53 per cent expecting more orders and inquiries compared with 33 per cent six months ago. In the south-east, however, just 35 per cent expected more orders - a fall from 53 per cent. 'There are good signs of increased confidence particularly in the construction sector and in regions outside of London and the south-east.' says Ernst &amp; Young. The survey was carried out by MORI. Three-quarters of those surveyed owned businesses with turnovers of less than Pounds 10m a year.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Thorn issues Rent-a-Center denial Thorn EMI yesterday issued a statement through the Stock Exchange accusing the Wall Street Journal of publishing a 'seriously misleading' article about the group's US rental business. The article, which appeared last week, alleged that staff at Thorn's Rent-a-Center subsidiary employed strong-arm tactics in dealing with customers whose payments were late. Thorn said: 'The article relied heavily on anecdotes from former employees, a number of whom were dismissed for serious breach of company regulations; all these anecdotes are being investigated. 'It also appears that the views of current management and employees were either discounted or misrepresented in the article.' Thorn said Rent-A-Center's goal was continuously to improve relations with customers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, first vice  minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, has praised the  contribution made by the 35th Anniversary of the Triumph of the  Revolution unit in the tomato harvest in Pinar del Rio. Rosales  pointed out that the harvest this year was larger than last  year, but that this is no reason to feel smug because there is  still room to improve production.    Rosales del Toro added that the experience attained by the  Youth Labor Army and several farms of Los Palacios Rice  Agroindustrial Complex ought be implemented to achieve higher  efficiency with students from the military schools.    This year, the 35th Anniversary of the Triumph of the  Revolution unit harvested over 193,000 quintals of tomatoes, as  well as 50,000 quintals of tubers and vegetables.</p>

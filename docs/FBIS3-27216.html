			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 21 (XINHUA) -- The year 1993  witnessed redoubled efforts by the country's legislature, the  National People's Congress (NPC), in making laws to facilitate  the establishment of a socialist market economy.    The NPC Standing Committee passed 20 laws and 13 provisional  regulations, and deliberated eight other draft laws, last year  -- all record figures in its history.    A package of economic laws to regulate market forces,  maintain market order and strengthen macro-economic control were  promulgated to safeguard, enhance and guide the healthy  development of the socialist market economy.    The Corporate Law, published last December 20, was the first  law regulating the activities of the numerous existing companies  in the country.    It is seen to have great importance in promoting a "modern  enterprise system" in line with international practices.    The NPC Standing Committee also passed the Law Against  Unethical Competition, the Consumers' Rights Law, the Law of  Registered Accountants, the Amendment to Laws Against Producing  and Selling Fake and Shoddy Goods, and the provisional  regulations on value-added tax, consumption tax and business tax  for overseas enterprises.    Both inside and outside China, these moves aroused  widespread  interest.    Economic experts said these laws and regulations will  effectively curb unfair competition, cut down crimes in  producing and selling fake and shoddy goods, and protect the  legal rights of all those involved.    The legislature also revised the Economic Contract Law, the  Individual Income Tax Law and the Accountants Law to cater to  the demands of the market economy.    The Budget Law is aimed to improve the country's financial  system and strengthen macro-economic control. It was  deliberated by the NPC Standing Committee last year and will be  submitted to the Eighth NPC's Second Plenary Session to be held  from March 10 in Beijing.    The lawmakers also passed the Agriculture Law, the Law of  Science and Technology Development, the Education Law and the  Red Cross Law in 1993.    They deliberated the draft securities law, the draft foreign  trade law, the draft law to protect investments by Taiwanese,  the draft state reimbursement law, the draft law on state medals  and state honors.    All the laws and the draft laws are based on China's  realities and commensurate with norms of international conduct.  The legislative experiences of other market economies were  "boldly" imbibed and learned from, experts said.</p>

Pursuant to paragraph (e) of Section 430.27 of the Code of Federal Regulations Part 430, the following letter granting the Application for Interim Waiver to York was issued. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to paragraph (b) of 10 CFR Part 430.27, DOE is hereby publishing the ``Petition for Waiver'' in its entirety.

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Salary restraint hits top earners THE CHAIRMEN of Britain's largest companies received more modest pay rises last year according to data from Pensions Investment Research Consultants, a private research service. PIRC, in reviewing the salaries of the highest-paid directors of the FTSE-100 companies, found an average pay rise of 2 per cent was awarded. The average salary last year was Pounds 398,667. UK companies are not required to disclose the remuneration package of their chairman but must do so for the highest paid director - who in most cases is the chairman. The survey of 94 of the FTSE-100 companies found that 39 paid their highest paid director above average last year. The highest-paid director of an FTSE-100 company was Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson. Second was Mr Bob Bauman of SmithKline Beecham. PIRC noted that the aggregate figures highlight some of the intricacies associated with detailing chairmen's remuneration packages. For example, the remuneration package of Sir Ian MacLaurin, chairman of Tesco, fell by nearly 27 per cent to Pounds 1,084,000. But this represented a decline in his performance pay - his basic salary rose by 55 per cent to Pounds 606,000, PIRC said. There are also some distortions in the data. At Argyll the 87.8 per cent increase awarded to Sir Alistair Grant, the chairman, largely reflected the disbursement of a Pounds 444,000 long-term bonus which is payable only on a three-year cycle. While next year's package is expected to be considerably lower, PIRC noted that he also received a 14 per cent increase in basic salary to Pounds 416,000. Among the lowest paid directors at Britain's largest companies are the heads of the water companies. Anglian Water's highest paid director earned Pounds 107,000, the lowest of any in the FTSE-100 group - 11.5 per cent more than 1990. The Pounds 203,192 payment to the highest paid director of Scottish Power represents a 94.9 per cent pay rise over 1990. Legal and General awarded its highest paid director remuneration of Pounds 215,871, a 17.3 per cent cut from the year before. Intelligence.

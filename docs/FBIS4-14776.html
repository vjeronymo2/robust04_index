			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tigran Liloyan and Sergey </F> Ostanin]    [Text] Yerevan, 2 Apr -- Ambassador at Large Vladimir  Kazimirov, personal envoy of the president of Russia, told the  ITAR-TASS correspondents at the meeting that took place in  Yerevan on Friday evening that "the CIS Interparliamentary  Assembly delegation discussed the state of affairs in the  Nagorno-Karabakh settlement process and some concrete practical  questions connected with the continuation of work on the basis  of the Russian project -- the agreement on ending the conflict  and on eliminating its consequences."    Can one suppose that the Russian initiative has become the  dominant one in settling the situation in Karabakh? In reply to  this question, Ambassador V. Kazimirov said that there should be  no rivalry between the peacekeeping initiatives. What has been  done is much more important than who did what.    The diplomat said that "the agreement plan proposed by  Russia  provides first of all, for a cease-fire and for a halt to combat  actions, a mechanism guaranteeing that the possibility of them  resuming is reduced to a minimum. This is to be followed by the  transition to the next phase -- the elimination of the main  consequences of the armed conflict. That is the withdrawal of  forces from the territories captured during battles, the  resumption of the operation of transport and energy  communications in the conflict region, and the return of  refugees to rayons and populated areas that they have left, and  also the continuation of the talks' process."    The Russian diplomat explained further the mechanism of the  settlement initiative. "First of all," he said, "it is  reinforcing the end of combat actions -- the separation of  troops by a large distance, especially of heavy armaments,  beyond the reach of fire." The ambassador noted that  disengagement forces may be in the region but this requires the  agreement of all the warring sides and most importantly, the  readiness of states to allocate forces for disengaging the  opposing sides. There are no such states yet. Russia is ready  to take part in such a multilateral operation provided that it  is acceptable for all the warring sides without exception.</p>

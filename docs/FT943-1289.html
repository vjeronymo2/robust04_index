			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Books: Crisis in the Caribbean backyard - Intervention, ambivalence and recriminations on the island of Haiti THE HAITI FILES: DECODING THE CRISIS edited by James Ridgeway Latin American Bureau Pounds 9.99, 243 pages Haiti's first leader, Jean-Jacques Dessalines, said: 'Pluck the chicken as long as it does not squawk.' His successors have been enthusiastically following his advice for 190 years. That the chicken is now hardly worth plucking is not the achievement of Haiti's corrupt leadership alone, however. As US troops once more land on Haitian soil, it is worth remembering that almost every foreign intervention in this nation's history has ended in recrimination - for both sides. For the US, which sent gunboats into Haitian waters two dozen times between 1849 and 1913 and occupied the country for 19 years this century, Haiti has been one of the most troublesome countries in its Caribbean backyard. This book, fortuitously published as the US prepared its invasion force, suggests it will continue to be. For those confused by last week's developments, this eclectic collection of essays, documents and chronology is full of insight. Its editor, James Ridgeway, is a columnist on New York's Village Voice. He provides two chapters: on Haiti's ruling families and the extension of Haitian government terror tactics to New York. The book's viewpoint is predictably politically correct, but the targets at which it takes aim - the country's mulatto oligarchy, its drug-running army and police, the Duvaliers and the US government and its agencies - are legitimate. While some may want to discard the more egregious conspiracy theories, what comes through strongly is the ambivalence at the heart of the US government about Haiti policy. It is an ambivalence that continues even with US troops on the ground. Here is current commerce secretary Ron Brown, who as partner in a Washington law firm represented the Haitian government of Jean-Claude 'Baby Doc' Duvalier in the US for the four years until just before Baby Doc was kicked out of the country in 1986. The US military's preference for their brothers in uniform - led by West Point graduate Lt Gen Raoul Cedras - over the poor illiterate people who make up the majority of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's support, is also clear. Last year, when lightly-armed US troops were heading to Haiti to back an accord to return Aristide to the island, a Pentagon spokesman helpfully said: 'One shot and we're out of there.' Unsurprisingly, the government organised a riot by armed thugs in Port-au-Prince as the US army was to arrive, and the troop carriers turned back. Now as US generals emphasise the patriotism of Cedras and the Haitian military leaders, US troops are fanning out through Haiti with the help of the Haitian military. Yet were not these the people the US was determined to oust only a week ago? If it is the biggest part of the problem, how can the Haitian army be part of the solution? In one chapter, a supporter of the Haitian military government argues that the man the US has to fear most is not Cedras, but police chief Michel Francois who runs the so-called attaches - thugs attached to the police - and is cited as being linked to Colombian cocaine barons. 'Michel Francois is sworn not to let Aristide come back. You're not going to work a deal with him . . . They (the US intervention force) are going to have to kill Francois.' For a US administration anxious not to repeat the mistakes of its intervention in Somalia - when a witch hunt for clan leader Mohamed Farah Aideed ended disastrously - this must be a chilling thought.</p>

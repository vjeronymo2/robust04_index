			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Nikos Mouzelis, London School of </F> Economics: "Who Benefits From the Demonstrations?"]    [Text] There is no doubt that last Thursday's demonstration  in Salonica was a great success. However, who benefits from this  kind of mobilization? Answer: the prime minister, the three  major parties, and the church. But, according to no logic does  the country benefit at this time. With this note I will attempt,  as briefly as possible, to support this position.    First of all, the demonstrations on the Skopje problem  benefit the leader [Andreas Papandreou] of the Panhellenic  Socialist Movement [PASOK]. Although he can see that making  absolutely paramount the issue of the name [Macedonia], and  insisting (in spite of intraparty pressures) on not accepting a  hybrid name [Vardar Macedonia], has driven the country to  unprecedented international isolation, he does not desire to  finish his prime ministership in the same way as he began it:  with a 180-degree turn similar to that which he made on the  issue of the EEC and NATO. Seen from this vantage point, the  mobilization in Salonica both reinforces his position in PASOK,  and affords him yet another opportunity to avoid the bitter  medicine of changing policy on the name issue--a change which  must necessarily take place for us to get out of the dead end  into which [Political Spring Party leader] Andonis Samaras and  the leaders of the other two parties have lead our country, for  clearly vote-getting reasons.    Second, the three largest parties, which actively support  this kind of populist mobilization, benefit by the  demonstrations (in the short run, of course). Even if they do  not manage to turn a popular upsurge into political capital for  themselves, they at least avoid the possibility of being left  outside the vote redistribution game at a time when, because of  the nationalist upsurge, all things are in flux and everything  is on the line.    Thirdly, in an attempt to alter its marginal, almost  exclusively ceremonial role in Greek society today, the church  benefits by mass mobilizations through its active participation  in the "national uprising." The church, which had already lost  its autonomy from the middle of the last century (for reasons  that I cannot explain here[.sup]1[/]) and was rendered an  extension of public administration, finds in the Skopje question  a unique opportunity to demonstrate that it is not just suited  for baptisms, weddings, and funerals; that, its politicization  aside (which has intesified in pace from the time of the  dictatorship and afterward), it has a fundamental nonpartisan,  patriotic role to play.    So the prime minister, the three parties, and the church are  the gainers--at least in the short run. The Greek people,  however, who have never been apprised of the Skopje problem by  means of an open, democratic dialog, are the big losers. They  not only lost a unique opportunity to become the connecting link  between the European Union and the Balkans, but were lead to  unprecedented international isolation which, with mathematical  precision, harms them economically and politically, because it  eliminates the possibility for northern Greece in general, and  Salonica specifically, to become the main pole for the  development of the Balkans (something that would of course  become the most substantive means of controlling the chauvinism  of Skopje), and which pushes Skopje, especially after the  embargo, into the embraces of Bulgaria and Turkey. Thus, we give  Turkey a unique opportunity to increase its clout in the Balkans  and in West Europe at a time when we have managed to be without  any friends (except for Serbia, of course!).    And while Turkey furiously strengthens its position, we  expend all our energies, and divert all our attention to the  clearly imaginary dangers contained in a "hybrid name" (which is  the only democratic solution[.sup]2[/]). In other words we  are concentrating on the Skopje flea, and ignoring the Turkish  elephant--or rather, we are doing what we can to reinforce  Turkey's position, and undermine our own, in an arena where  Greece's interests and borders are truely at risk. Conclusion:  the prime minister, the three largest parties, and the  church--if they really desire what is good for the land--will  have to do the following:    a. The prime minister will make another 180-degree turn on  the issue of the name, and will clearly declare that a hybrid  name is a negotiable matter (e.g. we will accept a hybrid name  in exchange for the three well-known conditions).    b. The parties will cease putting, at such a critical  moment,  their party interests above the national interest.    c. The church will fight for its autonomy from the system of  state and party politics--something that will allow it to devote  itself more to the cultural and religious problems of the modern  Greeks, and less to the formation of the country's foreign  policy.

The "maximalist" position (that is, our insistence on not  allowing Skopje to use the term "Macedonia" and its  "derivatives") is not possible, beneficial for the country, or  democratic.

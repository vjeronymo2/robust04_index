			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / Observer: Naked ambition So what can you deduce about a politician from the clothes he wears? Too much, one of the opposition socialists standing in Germany's October general election has obviously decided. Accordingly, the bearded and well-upholstered Thomas Kruger has decorated most of Berlin with his own life-size image, unmodified by a stitch of clothing. Behind the bulging flesh is 'an honest politician with nothing to hide'. Funny, looks to the untrained eye more like another politico with an over-developed ego . . .</p>

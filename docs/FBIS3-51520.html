			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Global TV News" newscast] </F>   [Excerpt] President Alberto Fujimori has met in private and  for almost two hours at the presidential palace's Grau Room with  U.S. Undersecretary Alexander Watson. The U.S. official arrived  at Pizarro's home [presidential palace] at 1025 with U.S.  Ambassador Alvin Adams. Three important issues were discussed  during the meeting: the consolidation of democracy, the  strengthening of human rights, and cooperation in the struggle  against drug trafficking. After labelling as positive the  meeting with Watson, the president reiterated that the 5 April  [1992] measures had been necessary to prevent Peru from being  totally undermined. Here is what President Fujimori said:    [Begin recording] On the democracy issue we have clearly  pointed out that the Peru that existed before 5 April 1992, had  no future. There was a need to take emergency measures to  prevent Peru from being totally undermined. I have mentioned  previously that this was a process that subsequently took place  in Russia; unfortunately, as we all well know, there were many  victims. Here, one-year plus, I would say instead that we have  rescued democracy. This is an issue that has been widely  discussed.    The second issue was in regard to the strengthening the  defense of human rights. On this we have been categorical, I  have made myself very clear here. What human rights are we  talking about when terrorist violence overwhelmed the whole  community and life was not worth one cent here? True, there are  some isolated cases [of human rights violations], but now there  is true respect for human rights. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

The State implemented a program that the Department of the Interior previously found to be consistent with ANILCA. However, in December 1989, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> McDowell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> State of Alaska <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that the rural preference in the State subsistence statute violated the Alaska Constitution. The Court's ruling in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> McDowell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  required the State to delete the rural preference from the subsistence statute, and therefore, negated State compliance with ANILCA. The Court stayed the effect of the decision until July 1, 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> McDowell <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture (Departments) assumed, on July 1, 1990, responsibility for implementation of Title VIII of ANILCA on public lands. On June 29, 1990, the Temporary Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (55 FR 27114&hyph;27170). Consistent with subparts A, B, and C of these regulations, a Federal Subsistence Board (Board) was established to administer the Federal subsistence management program. The Board's composition includes a Chair appointed by the Secretary of the Interior with concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; the Alaska Regional Director, U.S. National Park Service; the Alaska State Director, U.S. Bureau of Land Management; the Alaska Area Director, U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs; and the Alaska Regional Forester, USDA Forest Service. Through the Board, these agencies have participated in development of regulations for subparts A, B, and C, and the annual subpart D regulations. All Board members have reviewed this final rule and agree with its substance. Because this final rule relates to public lands managed by an agency or agencies in both the Departments of Agriculture and the Interior, identical text will be incorporated into 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On June 1, 1993, the 1993&hyph;1994 Seasons and Bag Limits for Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 31252&hyph;31295). That rulemaking amended subpart D of 36 CFR part 242 and 50 CFR part 100. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over the course of the 1993&hyph;1994 regulatory year, the Board executed 6 special actions on the 1993&hyph;1994 subpart D regulations. Two of those actions were emergency or temporary closures enacted to protect the continued viability of particular wildlife populations or herds. The Board also established season dates for Federal subsistence hunts for moose in Unit 18, caribou in Unit 12, and muskox in Unit 26. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed subpart D regulations for the 1994&hyph;1995 seasons and bag limits, and methods and means were published on September 2, 1993, in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (58 FR 46678&hyph;46706). A 60-day comment period providing for public review of the proposed rule was advertised by mail, radio, and newspaper. Subsequent to that 60-day review period, the Board prepared a booklet describing all proposals for change to subpart D. The public then had an additional 60 days in which to comment on the proposals for changes to the regulations. The Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) met in regional centers, received public comments, and formulated recommendations to the Board on proposals for their respective regions. These final regulations reflect Board review and consideration of Regional Council recommendations and public comments submitted to the Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the Record of Decision, Subsistence Management for Federal Public Lands in Alaska, April 6, 1992, and the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 36 CFR 242.11 (1992) and 50 CFR 100.11 (1992), and for the purposes identified therein, Alaska has been divided into ten subsistence resource regions, each of which is represented by a Regional Council. The Regional Councils provide a forum for rural residents with personal knowledge of local conditions and resource requirements to have a meaningful role in the subsistence management of fish and wildlife on Alaska public lands. Presently, the Councils are composed of no fewer than seven and no more than thirteen members who are residents of the region and are knowledgeable of local subsistence concerns. Charters for these councils were approved and signed by former Secretary of the Interior Lujan on January 19, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Regional Council appointments were made with due consideration of adequate geographical, cultural, and user diversity within each region. As specified in the Council charters, initial appointments were staggered from one to three years. Subsequent appointments will carry 3-year terms. Appointment terms expire on December 2 of the appropriate year. Secretary of the Interior Babbitt made the appointments to the Regional Councils on August 11, 1993. The Regional Councils have a substantial role in helping residents of the region review the proposed rule and make comments on it. Following publication of the proposed rule, each Council conducted public meetings to develop regulation proposals. The Regional Councils also conducted a second round of meetings to develop their recommendations on the proposals. The Council Chairs or Vice-Chairs then represented their Council at the Board meeting in April 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicability of Subparts A, B, and C <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Subparts A, B, and C of the Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, 50 CFR 100.1 to 100.24 and 36 CFR 100.1 to 100.24, remain effective and apply to this proposed rule for subpart D. Therefore, all definitions located at 50 CFR 100.4 and 36 CFR 100.4 apply to regulations found in this subpart. The identified sections include definitions for the following terms: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal lands <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which ``means lands and waters and interests therein title to which is in the United States''; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> public land <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> public lands <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  which ``mean lands situated in Alaska which are Federal lands, except_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) land selections of the State of Alaska which have been tentatively approved or validly selected under the Alaska Statehood Act and lands which have been confirmed to, validly selected by, or granted to the Territory of Alaska or the State under any other provision of Federal Law; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) land selections of a Native Corporation made under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act which have not been conveyed to a Native Corporation, unless any such selection is determined to be invalid or is relinquished; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

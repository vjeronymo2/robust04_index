			<p>940927 FT  27 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Camas makes Dollars 15.1m purchase in US Camas, the building materials group demerged from English China Clays in June, is paying Dollars 15.1m (Pounds 9.5m) for the majority assets of C&amp;M Ready Mix Concrete of Boulder, Colorado. The assets comprise about 12m tons of proven aggregate reserves, which are situated north-east of Denver, five ready mixed plants and a fleet of concrete delivery trucks. In addition, Camas will receive Dollars 3m of income from trade contracts already undertaken. Mr Christopher Bailey, Camas finance director, said the deal would probably push the group into first position in the Denver ready mix market ahead of Redland. C&amp;M reported operating profits of Dollars 1.5m in 1993.</p>

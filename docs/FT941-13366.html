			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Portillo at the centre of latest Tory infighting Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday emerged at the centre of the latest ministerial infighting after the public relations debacle over the government's 'back to basics' initiative. Whitehall officials disclosed that Mr Portillo, the cabinet standard-bearer of the Conservative right, had been defeated in his attempt to halt the London CrossRail project in spite of a plea to Mr John Major. With ministers suggesting that the defeat reflected a conscious effort by the prime minister to reassert his authority, officials said Mr Portillo had written to Mr Major 24 hours before the decision demanding that the rail project be scrapped or, at worst, be delayed indefinitely. He opposed it on grounds of cost and economic viability. Mr Major instead took the advice of Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, that cancellation or delay would damage confidence in the future of the City of London. Officials also confirmed yesterday that Downing Street had blocked a move by the chief secretary to follow up his attack on critics of Britain's institutions with a speech last weekend emphasising his Euro-sceptic credentials. A draft of the proposed speech - for a weekend conference of the Conservative Political Centre - ran into objections from Downing Street before the conference. Officials said Mr Portillo decided not to release an amended version to the press. By contrast the prime minister's office approved release of a speech by Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, which attacked some of Mr Portillo's earlier remarks. Mr Dorrell, the rising star of the Tory centre-left, challenged the chief secretary's view both on the need to defend Britain's institutions and on the threat posed to those institutions by the development of the European Union. In more tranquil times such differences between ministers would be seen as part of the normal cut and thrust of debate in the government. But after the struggle between the right and left of the Tory party over back to basics, the latest incidents are being viewed in Whitehall as symptomatic of the confusion clouding Mr Major's political agenda.</p>

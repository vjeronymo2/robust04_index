			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Car sales recover in January West European new car sales rose by 6.3 per cent to 1.029m in January compared with the same month in 1993, according to provisional figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association, writes Kevin Done. The increase ends 12 successive monthly declines, but the scale of recovery remains modest since sales in January 1993 were very depressed, having fallen 23 per cent from the previous year. Sales fell by an estimated 15.2 per cent in the whole of 1993 to 11.45m. Most industry forecasts suggest a 1-2 per cent recovery this year.</p>

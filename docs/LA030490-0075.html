			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DREXEL STILL HAS A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY TO MILKEN  </P> <P> I hope (Drexel Burnham Lambert Chief Executive) Fred Joseph intends to fulfill  his moral responsibility to Michael Milken by at least personally footing his  legal bills. After all, it was Joseph who made the decision to buckle under to  the government's demands, shutting out Milken, far and away the company's most  productive and valuable employee.  </P> <P> One didn't have to be blessed with second sight to know that when the Drexel  doors closed on Milken, it was only a matter of time before the doors would  close on Drexel itself.  </P> <P> The awful twist is that Joseph got to where he did -- to a position of power  and wealth -- because of Milken, and Milken has ended up where he is --  fighting for his life -- because of Joseph.  </P> <P> HILLARI KOPPELMAN  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

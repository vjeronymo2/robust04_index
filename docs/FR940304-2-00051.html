			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> c. Respondents shall maintain the viability and marketability of ARMC and shall not sell, transfer, encumber (other than in the normal course of business), or otherwise impair its marketability or viability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Except for the single respondent director, officer, employee, or agent serving on the ``New Board'' or ``Management Committee'' (as defined in subparagraph 3..h), respondents shall not permit any director, officer, employee, or agent of respondents to also be a director, officer or employee of ARMC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Except as required by law, and except to the extent that necessary information is exchanged in the course of evaluating the Acquisition, defending investigations or litigation, or negotiating agreements to dispose of assets, respondents shall not receive or have access to, or use or continue to use, any ``material confidential information'' of ARMC not in the public domain. Any such information that is obtained pursuant to this subparagraph shall only be used for the purpose set out in this subparagraph. (``Material confidential information,'' as used herein, means competitively sensitive or proprietary information not independently known to respondents from sources other than ARMC, and includes but is not limited to customer lists, price lists, marketing methods, patents, technologies, processes, or other trade secrets.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Respondents shall not change the composition of the management of ARMC except that the directors or members serving on the New Board or Management Committee of ARMC (as defined in subparagraph 3.h) shall have the power to remove employees for cause.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. All material transactions, out of the ordinary course of business and not precluded by subparagraphs 3.a&hyph;3.f hereof, shall be subject to a majority vote of the New Board or Management Committee (as defined in subparagraphs 3.h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Respondents shall either separately incorporate ARMC and adopt new Articles of Incorporation and By-laws that are not inconsistent with other provisions of this Agreement or establish separate business ventures with articles of agreement covering the conduct of ARMC in accordance with this Agreement. Respondents shall also elect a new three person board of directors (``New Board'') or Management Committee (``Management Commenttee'') of ARMC. Respondents may elect the directors to the New Board or select the members of the Management Committee; provided, however, that such New Board or Management Committee shall include no more than one respondent director, officer, employee, or agent. Except as permitted by this Agreement, the director of the New Board or member of the Management Committee who is also a respondent director, officer, employee or agent, shall not receive in his or her capacity as a New Board director or Management Committee member material confidential information and shall not disclose any such information received under this Agreement to respondents or use it to obtain any advantage for respondents. Said director of the New Board or member of the Management Committee who is also a respondent director, officer, employee or agent, shall enter a confidentiality agreement prohibiting disclosure of material confidential information (as that term is defined in subparagraph 3.e). Such New Board director or Management Committee member shall participate in matters which come before the New Board or Management Committee only for the limited purpose of considering a capital investment or other transaction exceeding $1,000,000 and carrying out respondents' responsibility to assure that ARMC is maintained in such manner as will permit its divestiture as an ongoing, viable acute care hospital. Except as permitted by this Agreement, such New Board director or Management Committee member shall not participate in any matter, or attempt to influence the votes of the other directors or Management Committee members with respect to matters, that would involve a conflict of interest if respondents and ARMC were separate and independent entities. Meetings of the New Board or Management Committee during the term of this Agreement shall be stenographically transcribed and the transcripts retained for two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. All earnings and profits of ARMC shall be retained separately in ARMC. If necessary, respondents shall provide ARMC with sufficient working capital to operate at its current rate of operation, and to carry out any capital improvement plans for ARMC which have already been approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> j. Should the Federal Trade Commission seek in any proceeding to compel respondents (meaning here and hereinafter respondents including ARMC) to divest ARMC, or to seek any other injunctive or equitable relief, respondents shall not raise any objection based upon the expiration of the applicable Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act waiting period or the fact that the Commission has permitted the Acquisition. Respondents also waive all rights to contest the validity of this Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. For the purpose of determining or securing compliance with this Agreement, subject to any legally recognized privilege, and upon written request with reasonable notice to respondents made to their principal officer, respondents shall permit any duly authorized representative or representatives of the Commission: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

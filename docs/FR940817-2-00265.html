			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The notion of threshold may be useful in explaining mechanisms associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific types of toxicity. What little is known about mechanisms of neurotoxicity suggests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that both threshold and nonthreshold scenarios are possible (Silbergeld, 1990). However, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of the most studied neurotoxicants, lead, there has been a steady decline in exposure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels shown to have effects, suggesting to some that no threshold dose is apparent (Bondy,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1985). Sette and MacPhail (1992) also consider the threshold as a mathematical assumption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and as a population sensitivity and conclude that ``the idea of no threshold seems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experimentally untestable.&blank;.&blank;.&blank;.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The RfD approach relies on single experimental observations (the NOAEL or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LOAEL) instead of complete dose-response curve data to calculate risk estimations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical interactions with biological systems are often specific, stereoselective, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saturable. Examples include enzyme-substrate binding leading to substrate metabolism,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transport, and receptor-binding, any or all of which may be a requirement of an agent's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect or toxicity. Therefore, a chemical's dose-response curve may not be linear. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certainty of low-dose extrapolation has been determined to be markedly affected by the shape  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the dose-response curve (Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee on Protocols  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Safety Evaluation, 1971). Therefore, the appropriate use of dose-response curve data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should enhance the certainty of risk estimations when thresholds are not assumed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dose-response models have generated considerable interest as more appropriate and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantitative alternatives to the safety-factor approach in risk assessment. Rather than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> routinely applying a ``fixed'' safety factor to the NOAEL (based on a single dose) to obtain a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``safe'' dose, another approach uses data from the entire dose-response curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two fundamentally different approaches in the use of dose-response data to estimate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk have been developed. Dews and coworkers (Dews, 1986; Glowa and Dews, 1987;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Glowa et al., 1983) and Crump (1984) demonstrated an approach in which they used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the shape of the dose-response curve to estimate levels of exposure associated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with relatively small effects (i.e., a 1, 5, or 10 percent change in a biological endpoint).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Both Dews and Crump fit a mathematical function to the data and provided an estimate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variability in exposure levels associated with a relatively small effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative approach developed by Gaylor and Slikker (1990) first establishes a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mathematical relationship between a biological effect and the dose of a given chemical. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second step determines the distribution (variability) of individual measurements of biological  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects about the dose-response curve. The third step statistically defines an adverse or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``abnormal'' level of a biological effect in an untreated population. The fourth step estimates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the probability of an adverse or abnormal level as a function of dose utilizing the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the first three steps. The advantages of these dose-response models are that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage the generation and use of data needed to define a complete dose-response curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although more quantitative dose-response assessment models have emerged in recent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years, uncertainty remains as to what biological endpoints from which species with what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dosing regimen should be analyzed. Within a species, a given agent may produce a variety  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of effects, including neurochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral effects. In other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances, a chemical may produce alterations of one endpoint but not others (Slikker et al.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1989). Species selection may also dramatically affect the outcome of risk assessments. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Parkinson-like syndrome produced by single doses of MPTP in the human or nonhuman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primate is not observed in rats given comparable MPTP doses (Kopin and Markey, 1988).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although endpoint and species selection appear to have a tremendous effect on the outcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an assessment, only a few studies have systematically investigated the effect on assessment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome of varying either the species or the endpoint within a species (McMillan, 1987;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hattis and Shapiro, 1990; Gaylor and Slikker, 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

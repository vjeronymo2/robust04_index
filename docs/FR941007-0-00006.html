			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 6, 1993, FDA published final rules (58 FR 2079) requiring use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PDCAAS method as the method for determining protein quality for food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intended for children over 1 year of age and adults. While this method is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended for all children above 1 year of age, it is not recommended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infants, and therefore FDA's final rule (58 FR 2079 at 2102) retained the PER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for assessing protein quality and retained casein as the standard in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressing the percentage of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for protein in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foods represented and purported to be for use by infants. This rule became  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective on May 8, 1994. In recognition of these scientific advances and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adoption by FDA of PDCAAS as the only method for determining protein quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for children above one year of age, this rule amends the NSLP regulations at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix A of Part 210 to require PDCAAS as the only method for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein quality for enriched macaroni. However, in order to provide affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties an implementation period, the amended paragraph 2 further provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that for 30 days after publication of the rule either the PER or the PDCAAS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a new paragraph 1(c) is added to Appendix A to make clear that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enriched macaroni may not be used for infants under 1 year of age in the NSLP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, FNS will no longer approve enriched macaroni products purported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for use by infants regardless of what method their protein quality has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tested. It was never the Department's intention that enriched macaroni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products be served to infants and this amendment is meant to make clear that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturers of enriched macaroni with fortified protein, currently approved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by FNS, will not be affected by the change to an alternate method unless the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional composition of their approved product changes. Should the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nutritional composition of an approved product previously tested under PER  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method change after the 30 day implementation period, data obtained by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PDCAAS method will be required for re-approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FDA Standard of Identity (21 CFR 139.117), referenced and quoted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A and upon which the FNS final regulation was based, was stayed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> March 21, 1978, pending a determination of whether a public hearing was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to resolve issues raised by objections (43 FR 11695). At that time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA stated that ``during the period of the stay, the (enriched macaroni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with fortified protein) may be introduced into interstate commerce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with appropriate labeling as a nonstandardized food.'' (43 FR 11695).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this rule deletes all references to that Standard in Appendix A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the requirements for processing and labeling of enriched macaroni  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products with fortified protein prescribed by FDA in the stayed Standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Identity were previously incorporated in the FNS final rule and will remain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same, with some technical changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, this final rule amends the current regulation to correct a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statement which has caused confusion and which was recently brought to our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attention by analytical laboratories. The current regulation states that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein quality is to be determined on the cooked food. However, determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein quality on the cooked food is not feasible in practice, because when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilizing the PER method the moisture content prevents laboratory rodents from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eating test foods in sufficient quantities to accurately determine protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quality. Likewise, the moisture content in the cooked food may affect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test results under the PDCAAS method. Therefore, FAO/WHO suggests a moisture  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> content in the cooked food of less than ten percent for viable testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Determinations made on a dry basis has been the procedure commonly employed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial laboratories in the past. Thus, this rule requires determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of protein quality on a dry basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule makes a typographical correction and, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metric Conversion Act of 1975, adds, side by side, the metric equivalent for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all weights and measurements contained in the rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule also includes a clarification that all manufacturers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including those with currently accepted macaroni products, must notify FNS if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there is a change in the protein portion of their product since the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data submission and product approval. FNS will assume the protein content  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remains the same unless otherwise notified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Observer: Frontiersmen Oh, the perils of those otherwise seductive emerging markets. The Dollars 50m Vietnam Frontier Fund, which has Bangkok merchant bank Finansa Thai controlling 70 per cent of its management company, was minded to throw a big bash for the opening of its Hanoi office. Out went the invitations to the great and the good, whereupon the Vietnamese authorities churlishly pointed out that the office itself had yet to gain approval. The whole affair has had to be postponed. If that were not enough, a Frontier Fund director has simultaneously been delivering an object lesson in the hazards of decorating letterheads with trophy names. When one William Colby applied for his Vietnamese visa, the powers that be had not forgotten the former head of the CIA, who had spent most of his war in Vietnam, orchestrating efforts to overthrow the Hanoi regime of the day. The application was politely rejected - demonstrating that the country's enthusiasm for US investment dollars clearly has its limits.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias in an interview  this morning [not further specified] launched an offensive on  all fronts while warning Albania about the violation of the  Greek minority's rights. Papoulias warned Tirana that Athens  could stop the attacks against the Greek minority and described  as unacceptable the position adopted by some U.S. officials that  there is insufficient evidence of the violation of the Greek  minority's rights.    The foreign minister did not rule out that [Albanian  President] Sali Berisha is supported by circles outside Albania.  He also expressed concern over, but called for calm regarding,  the recent Turkish provocations in Istanbul. Mr. Papoulias  announced an initiative by the European Union [EU] at the troika  level in the case of Albania and pointed out that Greece has  lodged representations at all the international forums. He said  that he has sent a letter to UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and to U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  on the latest Albanian provocations.    Mr. Papoulias stressed that we are carefully guarding our  borders and linked the problem to the economic support we render  Tirana by tolerating the 400,000 illegal immigrants. He did not  rule out that the Greek Government, using legal measures, might  stop accepting illegal immigrants from Albania and increase the  policing of the borders.    Greece's moderate stance should not be interpreted as  weakness or retreat. We are moderate, but certain issues are  not raised for negotiation, they are self-evident, such as the  rights of the Greek Albanians. This statement was made by  government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos when asked about the  government's view of the latest developments in Greek-Albanian  relations. Mr. Venizelos stressed that representations are  continuing. He said that if Albanian provocations do not stop,  our country is ready to adopt measures to guard the borders;  these measures involve using police and customs guards, not the  military.    Asked if the government intends to expel Albanian illegal  immigrants following recent developments, the government  spokesman stressed: The Greek Government would not hold illegal  immigrants hostage to exercise its foreign policy because it is  a country of justice. However, it is determined to exhaust all  legal means.</p>

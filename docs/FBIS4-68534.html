			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Valeriy Zorkin: "Farewell to Myths"] </F>   [Text] This vast nation is suffocating in the grip of a  severe crisis. Millions of people are living in an epidemic and  humiliating state of poverty after being robbed so ruthlessly by  the "radical reformers" for the sake of yet another "bright  future." Science is dying, and centuries-old spiritual  traditions are being stifled by the pressure of the vulgar mass  culture. The Russian people, who spent a thousand years building  the greatest state in the world, have been separated by absurd  boundaries and have regressed 400 years in their geopolitical  development. The democratic values that are essential to healthy  and civilized development in today's world have been distorted  and deliberately discredited in the public mind. Industry is  being ruined, and the unique Russian national economic complex,  which was built by the heroic labor of several generations, is  deteriorating. The society is on the verge of a social eruption.  These are the pitiful results of the irresponsible and  undemocratic policy line the ruling regime was pursuing when it  managed to ruin one of the wealthiest countries and destroy its  powerful state in just two years.    "Our life has become unbelievably morbid, senseless, and  false, all order has disappeared, there is no consistency in our  development, and all of our mental, emotional, and moral  discipline has grown weak. An immense set of lies, permeating  all of our relationships, has accumulated in our society and has  contaminated the very air that we breathe, the surroundings in  which we move and act, the ideas directing our actions, and the  words with which we express our thoughts. In the midst of all  these lies, what can we expect but a puny existence and puny  acts? Our very ideas about life and its purpose are false, our  relationships are confused, and our life is devoid of the  consistency that is necessary for peaceful development and  normal activity."    These are the words of one of the most prominent  conservative  Russian thinkers of the 19th century, Chief Procurator of the  Holy Synod Konstantin Petrovich Pobedonostsev. Although he said  these words just before the terrible revolutionary outburst many  decades ago, they are just as relevant today, which forces us to  realize that the ulcers of hypocrisy, cynical deception, and  malicious lies, the infinite egotism, greed, and thirst for  power that are tormenting us have reached such a frightening  point of crisis that the ominous question--"Is Russia to be or  not to be?"--has become a terrifying reality of our daily  social, governmental, and political life!  <H5>  Between `Those' and `These' </H5>   In the last few years, for several reasons, primarily my  position as chairman of the Constitutional Court, I had the  broadest opportunities to observe the development of events up  close--or "from within," so to speak--because I received  detailed reports on the state of the country and the processes  occurring in the upper echelons of government. Because I was  fully aware of the dangerous tendencies that were becoming more  and more distinct on the Russian political stage with the  passage of time, I tried--to the best of my ability--to keep our  ship of state far from the whirlpools of the political  adventurism that was threatening (and is still threatening)  Russia with the chaos of turmoil and deterioration, the tragedy  of governmental collapse, and the horrors of fratricide.    Whenever I could, I refrained from intervening in political  arguments and the struggle for power by Moscow "court" groups  and clans. No conscientious critic could accuse me of any  affiliation with "those" or "these": I was equally repelled by  the greedy corruption of the most odious members of the  president's team and by the obsessive and maniacal efforts of  some of the "people's representatives" to conquer Russia's  political Olympus at any cost. No one wanted to call attention  to the constantly growing wave of irreconcilable differences  between the "branches" of government. The results are  well-known: The massacre in the center of Moscow, which cost the  lives of hundreds of people--a crime that was monstrously  cynical and senseless, because it is absolutely clear today that  this did not solve a single one of Russia's acute problems. On  the contrary, the tight bloody knot of fatal confrontations in  "Black October" compounded the already critical state of the  country.    God knows that I did everything within my power to prevent  the conflict and reconcile the opposing sides. This is probably  why I was not trusted completely by either side, which was  manifested in a particularly malicious and distinct manner when  the "victors" decided in the hour of their triumph to get even  with the "inconvenient" witness to their unprincipled and  unethical actions.    Nevertheless, I did not betray my own convictions. I am  still  categorically opposed to political extremism in any form,  regardless of its origin, regardless of the demagogic clothing  it wears as a disguise, and regardless of the high ideals and  noble goals it uses to conceal its own contempt for the law and  the standards of common human decency. I still believe that  unless we restrain the opportunists and political plotters who  are willing to involve the public in fratricidal conflicts for  the sake of their own excessive ambition, until we curb the  excesses of arbitrary behavior within the strong confines of  legality and legal stability, we will not move a single step  forward in the revitalization of our long-suffering Motherland.  I still believe that national reconciliation and civic accord  are not topics for populist speculation, but absolutely  essential conditions for Russia's survival.    Nevertheless, I do have some regrets, something to repent,  and some serious lessons to learn. Sometimes I was too naive and  indecisive, too trusting and too inclined to agree to  compromises that had not been subjected to sufficient analysis  and consideration. The burden of power is a heavy load to carry,  and I frankly admit that, looking back, I cannot say that I was  completely prepared to do this. Sometimes I overestimated my own  ability to influence events, and sometimes I underestimated the  danger of the situation and the growing strength of destructive  processes in the country. I never, however, lost my conviction  that we have a single motherland, that gambling with its future  for the sake of personal advantage is criminal and base, that we  are one people, one family with a common history and future, and  that no one but us can revive Great Russia.    Today I feel sick and ashamed when I see what we have done  to  the country and to each other. It is immoral and impermissible  to remain silent, hiding behind the official pretext of  "nonintervention in political affairs," when you are watching  your country die under the strain of hatred, enmity, political  intrigues, and cynicism.  <H5>  The Big Lie of Our Era </H5>   Pablo Picasso once made the following remark in an attempt  to  underscore the value of art and his ability to create  "autonomous" worlds, parallels to the real world: "I draw what I  see with my mind, and not with my eyes." Today it appears that  some politicians want to use this artistic method of creating  "parallel realities" within the framework of social technology  to turn our sick society into a "zombie."    Any independent and unbiased analyst can see that the  current  political regime is resting on a lie. Today, after its crushing  defeat in the elections to the State Duma proved that people  knew that its earlier policies were leading us into a blind  alley, we are witnessing something amazing: The regime is  changing like a chameleon, adapting itself to the changes in the  society. This has been accompanied by its persistent, constant,  and deliberate attempts to plant several myths in the public  mind to help it keep the situation under its own control and  continue its manipulation of public opinion.    Here are just a few of the most significant of these myths:    --The myth that the present leaders of the country endorse  the values of the contemporary civilized society (democracy, the  rule-of-law state, the market economy, the separation of powers,  human rights, and so forth).    --The myth that the "totalitarian," "communist" past has  been  surmounted in the political, social, and governmental life of  present-day Russia.    --The myth of the irreproachable legitimacy of existing  government institutions based on the "nationwide" mandate of  confidence in the president and the Constitution (which is  directly related to the myth of the supra-class nature of the  present regime, whose members come from all social strata).    --The myth of its contribution to the end of the "cold war"  and ability to guarantee Russia a fitting place in the system of  international relations on the basis of partnership with the  leading nations of the world.    --The myth that the regime is devoted to the national-state  interests of our country and that it is evolving in the  direction of "enlightened patriotism" and "national  construction."    Let us take a look at all of these in the proper sequence:    The myth of the "civilized," "democratic" nature of the  present regime. This is probably the favorite offspring and  main concern of the reptilian news media. It was precisely their  ruthless exploitation of this myth, their shameless attempts to  foist it on public opinion within the country and abroad, that  created the "smoke screen" behind which the outrageous political  cynicism and monstrous corruption of our ruling elite were  safely concealed from outsiders for several years.    Every element of this myth is a shameless lie. When people  who routed two parliaments in two years and put their leaders  behind bars, first causing the collapse of a great world power  and then driving the country to the verge of civil war, talk  about democracy and the "separation of powers," it is difficult  to see this as anything but a travesty. When the terms "law,"  "rule-of-law state," and "legitimacy" are used by politicians  who literally wiped their feet on one Constitution and  immediately composed another (which I am bound to uphold in the  performance of my professional duties, just as I upheld the  earlier one), enacting it with the approval of only one-fourth  of the voters, it is frightening to contemplate what might  happen in the future.    How can we listen seriously to the discussions of a genuine  market economy in Russia when the behavior of officials is  becoming more and more arbitrary, bribes are the only reliable  way of solving any problem, domestic industry is dying, peasants  will soon have trouble even feeding themselves, and a handful of  nouveaux riches, bloated with fraudulent privatization and  financial intrigues, are getting richer and richer in a  destitute and almost starving nation? How can anyone talk about  the preeminence of human rights when the pervasive turmoil has  dramatically undermined such fundamental rights as the rights to  education, health care, and security for the elderly? I will not  even mention the fact that even the right to life in our  "civilized" country is frequently meaningless because of the  unprecedented rise in the rate of crime and racketeering. As far  as political rights are concerned, the last year and a half  clearly demonstrated the value of the widely publicized  declarations of their immutability--the "Lefortovo inmates," the  editors of opposition newspapers, and the relatives of those who  died in defense of the "White House" are the best judges of  their value....    The myth of the victory over the totalitarian communist  past. This myth and the preceding "democratic" myth are two  sides of the same coin, and the anticommunist rhetoric serves  two purposes in this case. First of all, it once served as a  strong propaganda weapon, securing the rise of the present upper  echelon to power on the wave of the constant and intrusive  exposures of the horrors of Leninism, Stalinism, and the "era of  stagnation." It may be difficult to imagine, but--Horrors!--this  loud campaign had nothing in common with genuine concern about  the future of the country and about the tragic decades that were  full of infinite trials and grief and left indelible scars,  which will keep them alive in our memory forever. Human  suffering has become nothing more than a bargaining chip in the  big political game of the governing bigwigs who were fighting  for bureaucratic privileges and Kremlin offices.    Second, the fueling of anticommunist hysteria was supposed  to  send the West a signal of the new Russian leadership's  uncompromising rejection of the expansionist geopolitical  practices of the USSR and guarantee the regime strong  international support and the sympathy of the foreign public. In  the race for these cherished goals, no one cared that the "baby  had been thrown out with the bath water"--that the thoughtless  campaign denigrating our recent past had turned into a fiendish  dance "on the graves of our fathers" and had hurt the feelings  of millions of honest people, was crippling our youth, and was  warping the already distorted historical memory of our people.    At the same time, it was clear that the political practices  of the regime, in contrast to its propagandistic rhetoric, were  still typically Bolshevik practices, distinguished by poorly  concealed irritation with "inconvenient" legal standards, the  cult of "political expediency," and the open reliance on  confrontation and its resolution by force. Today's increasingly  severe crisis is largely a direct result of this adventuristic  Bolshevik mentality, in which class hatred has given way only to  a hatred of political opponents, and legal nihilism is still  easily justified by "special circumstances" and the "lack of an  alternative"!    The myth of the irreproachable legitimacy of present  government institutions. I must stipulate that because I am  still a Constitutional Court justice, I am absolutely loyal to  existing legislation in all areas in the performance of my  duties, but I can still see the outrageously unsatisfactory  state of affairs in this sphere of such great importance in the  life of society and the state.    The Russian legal mind has traditionally had a keen and  acute  reaction to the moral and ethical aspects of an issue. The  curious combination of the infinite Russian tolerance and  respect for the law with the people's constant suspicion of the  legal standards regulating the life of society, which was an  enigma to foreign researchers in every century, is due precisely  to the willingness to suffer deprivations and make sacrifices  "for the sake of justice" on the one hand, and the rejection of  legal scholasticism on the other. With a view to these features  of our national identity, the Bolsheviks and their successors in  the Kremlin today always obscured their political games with a  smoke screen of demagogic slogans. The only difference is that  the appeals for "the world brotherhood of workers" and "the  bright future of social justice" have been replaced by  incantations about the desire for the "triumph of freedom and  democracy" and the ritualistic verbal offerings to the "ideals  of democracy, civilization, and progress."    The problem now is that the confusing reality is so vastly  different from the official rhetoric that the regime has lost  all credibility and the last vestiges of its earlier authority.  This means that not one of the existing institutions of  government is legal in the public mind. The constant  manipulation of the mechanisms of the democratic state with  referendums, elections, parties, and the news media and the  total contempt for any "rules of play" the authorities displayed  during the October crisis did their job: The people understood  that "the lords are fighting again, and the serfs are getting a  splitting headache." No law professor or legal scholar can  change the people's mind now, because the legal nihilism of the  state hopelessly undermined the public belief in its own  legitimate roots. Is there any need to discuss the possible  implications, especially now that the "class" nature of the  regime, as the chief patron of the comprador bourgeoisie, is  becoming increasingly evident in a society experiencing rapid  social stratification.    The myth of the end of the "cold war" and of friendship  with the West. The socialist obsession of the Soviet Union,  which made every effort to turn the whole world community into a  single "socialist camp," was one of the main reasons for its  overexertion and largely predetermined the sad results of 1991.  The lower level of global armed confrontation and the end of the  "cold war," the effort to move from confrontation and enmity to  cooperation and partnership, constitute an indisputably positive  development of recent years. All of this is true, but the main  thing is that the present regime had nothing to do with  these positive changes.    As a matter of fact, the most important advances in  surmounting the confrontational legacy of the "cold war" were  made within the framework of the USSR long before the levers of  governmental power fell into the hands of the country's present  leaders. The success of those first moves was guaranteed,  incidentally, largely by the fact that the Soviet delegations at  all of the talks were backed up by the colossal combined  strength of the single union superpower. Now the notorious  "partnership" is often secured by the submission of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by unconcealed disregard for our  national-state interests. In essence, a shameful trading session  is going on in the sphere of foreign policy, during which the  present regime is selling Russia's long-range strategic  interests in exchange for immediate political support from  abroad.    Furthermore, it is no secret that extremely influential  groups in the West are openly striving for the maximum  debilitation of Russia, seeing it as their perennial  geopolitical rival. That is why it is probably premature to  start shouting the news that the era of confrontation is  "finally and completely" over, and that the era of boundless  peace and exhilarating unanimity has arrived. There should be no  doubt that we want to be good neighbors and to cooperate with  the leading world powers, but we still have to face the facts:  It will be a long and arduous journey to this goal.    Furthermore, the average Russian citizen finds himself  wondering with increasing frequency whether we won or lost when  we paid for the friendship with the West and the end of the  "cold war" with the collapse of the USSR, and received in  exchange a "hot" war along almost the whole perimeter of  Russia's new borders. Will we be able to hold on to this  friendship (which is quite necessary in itself) under the  conditions of growing instability and the obvious threat to all  Eurasia from the "hot spots" in the post-Soviet territory? Will  the final result of the current regime's foreign policy  "achievements" be a new escalation of international tension?    The myth of the "enlightened patriotism" of the Russian  leadership. Like a rabbit from a magician's hat, it made  its appearance and is growing before the eyes of the "esteemed  public," watching in shock as the belligerent cosmopolitans turn  into national patriots in the middle of a sentence, and as the  political lexicon of the Kremlin's inhabitants acquires more and  more exotic phrases like "national interest," "the national  traditions of the centuries of Russian history," "the defense of  fellow countrymen abroad," and so forth. There has even been a  rumor that some members of the president's team are secretly  learning how to make speeches about Russian patriotism in the  tones of "Pamyat" and "Russian National Unity."    This sad sight looks even more pitiful when we can see  clearly that the principal players in the quasi-patriotic  performance are the politicians who played a decisive role in  the collapse of the USSR, abandoning 25 million Russians to the  mercy of fate when these were suddenly living "across the  border" without their consent, and who scattered handfuls of  "sovereignties" within Russia itself. But the most unpleasant  thing is that all of this commotion actually has nothing to do  with Russia's true and genuine interests.    These interests consist primarily in the complete and final  cessation of the exhausting domestic political confrontations,  which could lead to new outbreaks of violence, the restoration  of the single integrated economy of the post-Soviet territory in  accordance with actual conditions, the reconstitution of the  dismembered body of the Russian people, and the reinstatement of  the thousand-year-old Russian state as a responsible and  predictable member of the international community and a major  guarantor of geopolitical equilibrium on the planet. It is  important to realize that the objective progression of events is  moving in this direction, and that anyone who dares to ignore  this will soon be swept off the political stage.    What should we do? How should we begin releasing ourselves  from the obtrusive and harmful myths in which Russia has become  entangled, distorting the truth, misleading the public, and  delaying the recovery of our national identity? Should we look  at our own history?    "However colossal the power of the state might be,"  Pobedonostsev warned at the beginning of the century, "it rests  on nothing other than the unity of the spiritual consciousness  of the people and the government, on the trust of the people.  Power begins to be undermined when this consciousness based on  trust starts to split into two separate entities." Today no one  trusts anyone in Russia. The government exists on its own, and  the people exist on their own. That is why we should start by  using all of the democratic institutions and mechanisms of  government remaining at our disposal and find ways of uniting  the public, restoring mutual trust, and resolutely ridding  ourselves of those who will interfere with the normalization of  the situation.    We are not entitled to any more mistakes. Russia has reached  its limit for social cataclysms. The continuation of  irresponsible experimentation will be fatal for the country. We  have had enough of destruction, and now it is finally time to  start creating!</p>

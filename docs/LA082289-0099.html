			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE CONTINUES ON FUTURE OF BESIEGED TRAUMA SYSTEM  </P> <P> When the Los Angeles County trauma system was set up in 1983, private hospitals  battled hard and even sued to be included in the prestigious network, regarded  as the crown jewel of the county's emergency services program.  </P> <P> This month, the 10th trauma center of the original 23 permanently bowed out of  the system. On busy nights, half a dozen of the remaining ones are full and  temporarily closed. As a result, millions of people living in wide swaths of  the county are served by no trauma center at all or by one that may well have  no space when they need care.  </P> <P> Like trauma systems in many other parts of the country, the one here -- what is  left of it -- is fighting for its life.  </P> <P> Several more hospitals may yet bail out. Temporary closures due to overload are  way up over last year -- "more than 1,000%" at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, for  example, according to statistics compiled by Alan Cowen, chief of paramedics  for the Los Angeles Fire Department.  </P> <P> Some critics say that now is the time to evaluate the efficiency and  effectiveness of the local trauma network before allocating more money to  revive it. Some favor redrawing the boundaries for hospital trauma service  areas or setting new medical criteria for which patients are taken to the  centers.  </P> <P> But the chairman of the Los Angeles County Emergency Medical Services  Commission, Dr. Stephen L. Michel, warned that any tinkering "is fraught with  danger and may gut the whole system." He and many others maintain that the  trauma system's only salvation lies in increased public funding. The commission  is expected to present its recommendations today to the county Board of  Supervisors.  </P> <P> In the meantime, growing numbers of trauma patients are not getting to a trauma  center at all. Or they are making it just in the nick of time due to increased  used of helicopters or because "paramedics are busting their little wheels to  make it all the way across town to an open trauma center," said Virginia  Price-Hastings, the county health official in charge of emergency services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Children Hit by Car  </P> <P> For example, when two children were mowed down by a drunk driver in  South-Central Los Angeles one day last month, the trauma center less than 10  minutes away was already full and closed to new patients. After waiting 15  minutes for an ambulance, the children -- one with tire marks across his chest  and plummeting blood pressure -- had to wait again for a helicopter to be  summoned to fly them to a pediatric trauma center at Childrens Hospital in  Hollywood, recounted Los Angeles city paramedic Becky Hegwar.  </P> <P> "They probably made it within the hour, but barely," Hegwar said.  </P> <P> Dr. Brian Johnston, an emergency physician at White Memorial Medical Center in  East Los Angeles, pointed to the case of a young motorcyclist who had crashed  into an automobile at a speed upward of 100 m.p.h. It was a classic trauma  case, he said, but for lack of a nearby trauma bed, the patient was brought to  White's emergency room where, fortunately, a surgeon was on hand to quickly  operate, saving the patient.  </P> <P> Unlike a trauma center, emergency rooms are not required to have a surgeon and  anesthesiologist on the premises ready to operate, as well as a battery of  other specialists like orthopedists and neurosurgeons available within 20  minutes.  </P> <P> This special staffing requirement at trauma centers is designed to ensure quick  surgical capability for those patients who are bleeding from injuries to their  vital organs like the brain, lungs, heart and the accompanying vascular system.  </P> <P> Overall, about 60% of the county's serious trauma injuries are caused by  traffic accidents, health officials say. The rest stem from violent crimes such  as stab or gunshot wounds or from work-related injuries such as falls from  great heights on construction sites or entanglements with factory machinery.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately, trauma patients bleed. They bleed into their heads, into their  chests, into their abdomens," according to Paula Woo, former trauma coordinator  for Presbyterian InterCommunity Hospital in Whittier which closed its trauma  center Aug. 7.  </P> <P> "The emergency department can provide high-tech equipment, specialized  emergency physicians, qualified nurses who can figure out what the problem  probably is," she continued. But, "they can't fix it." Trauma centers are  designed to do that.  </P> <P> When the trauma system was established in Los Angeles County, it was designed  so that no point in the county would be more than 20 minutes' distance from one  of 23 trauma centers.  </P> <P> The system was very popular. As Price-Hastings from the county Health Service  Department pointed out: "People that drive Jaguars bleed at the same rate as  people that walk. So, it is a health care impact on every single one of us."  </P> <P> Hospital officials leaped at what they thought would be a prime opportunity.  </P> <P> "Everybody wanted to be a trauma center for the same reason everybody wants to  do everything else -- money," Dr. Mike Vitullo, chief of emergency room  physicians at Midway Hospital Medical Center, recently recalled during  testimony before the county Emergency Medical Services Commission. "Everybody  thought it was going to be a lot of money coming into the hospital. All these  paid patients."  </P> <P> But as it turned out, most trauma centers lost money at a time when hospitals  were increasingly unwilling to absorb the losses because they were being  squeezed by new government and insurance health care cost controls. Worse, many  surgeons and other specialists who staffed the trauma centers revolted when  they discovered that so many patients could not pay their doctor bills.  </P> <P> "Now, nobody wants to be a trauma center," Vitullo concluded.  </P> <P> With all the holes in the network, Los Angles County no longer has an  integrated trauma system, Price-Hastings said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Served by Centers  </P> <P> Most of the San Gabriel Valley, a large section of the East San Fernando Valley  and the beach cities and inland area surrounding Los Angeles International  Airport are no longer served by trauma centers.  </P> <P> At most times of the day, Price-Hastings said, there is no hope -- barring a  helicopter -- that these people will be able to get one of the remaining trauma  centers within the county-mandated 20-minute transport time.  </P> <P> "Naturally, if it is 2 o'clock in the morning -- if you can plan your trauma --  you will be able to get there," she said.  </P> <P> It is not that the system needs all 23 trauma centers to be effective,  Price-Hastings added. In fact, she said it is generally agreed that Los Angeles  County designated too many trauma centers in the first place.  </P> <P> Thirteen would be enough, she said, if they were properly distributed. But as  it stands, she said, they are in the "wrong places."  </P> <P> Cowen of the city Fire Department said the trauma system might actually be  better off without the private hospitals, which, he said, continually hold the  county "hostage" to their demands by threatening to pull out. He suggested  relying upon the county's four public hospitals and UCLA Medical Center for all  trauma care and using helicopters much more extensively for patient  transportation.  </P> <P> The president of the United Paramedics of Los Angeles, Fred Hurtado, has urged  that the county review its medical guidelines that dictate what symptoms  require trauma treatment. He said the guidelines are so loose that they have  allowed the public to use scarce ambulances as a "taxi service" in  non-emergencies.  </P> <P> Dr. Joseph Morales, an emergency physician at County-USC Medical Center, has  challenged the fundamental idea that trauma centers are more effective than  well-equipped emergency rooms in saving lives. He has co-authored a report that  studied automobile accident death rates statewide and concluded that trauma  centers in Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties do not appear to have  reduced motor vehicle mortality, compared to the rest of the state where there  are no trauma systems.  </P> <P> "We had expected our death rates in these three counties would be lower,  coincident with the trauma centers," he said. He questioned whether trauma  centers are not built on a foundation of "fluff" and pointed out that Los  Angeles County has done no outcome studies to assess the effectiveness of the  local trauma system to date.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Let's Get Some Data'  </P> <P> "I think it's time to say, 'Whoa, let's get some data,' " Morales said.  </P> <P> Price-Hastings acknowledged that there have been no trauma outcome studies done  in Los Angeles so far but that attempts are under way.  </P> <P> Orange and San Diego counties have conducted comprehensive outcome studies  showing trauma centers there have substantially reduced deaths, according to a  nationwide review of trauma centers in 1988 by the Dade County Trauma Task  Force in Miami.  </P> <P> Dr. Howard Champion, a leading proponent of trauma care and chief of trauma  services at Washington Center Hospital in the nation's capital, said that in  San Diego and elsewhere across the country, good data has been collected  documenting how trauma centers have dramatically reduced the number of patients  who, before the advent of trauma centers, died as a result of delayed or  inappropriate care.  </P> <P> However, despite this "strong documentation" and the fact that trauma is the  leading cause of death for people under the age of 38, Champion said "trauma  systems are in trouble" across the country.  </P> <P> "Trauma tends to claim as its victims a young, (medically) uninsured  population, and nobody is picking up the bill," he said.  </P> <P> One health care economist, Greg Bishop with the Trauma Resource Project in  Irvine, has pointed out that in California a major part of the financial  dilemma for trauma centers is that while automobile accidents are responsible  for about two-thirds of all patients sent to trauma centers, less than 10% of  trauma center costs are reimbursed by automobile insurance companies.  </P> <P> Unlike many other states, he said there is no requirement in California that a  motorist carry medical insurance as part of his auto policy. New York requires  motorists to carry a minimum $50,000 in medical insurance and Colorado requires  $135,000, Bishop said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Automobile Insurance Changes  </P> <P> Bishop said he is hopeful that changes in automobile insurance under way in  Sacramento will ultimately provide a greater source of funding to the state's  trauma centers.  </P> <P> Public subsidies of the trauma network would probably provide the quickest  salvation, but in California there is fierce competition among health care  programs for money.  </P> <P> Earlier this summer, Gov. George Deukmejian blue-penciled $100 million  earmarked in the Legislature's budget for trauma and emergency services  statewide. Health officials are hopeful that money raised through the recent  passage of Proposition 99, which boosted taxes on tobacco products, will  eventually be released to the counties.  </P> <P> But even so, there are many other health care programs, including local mental  health services, that can be expected to stake a claim to the money. David  Langness, vice president of the Hospital Council of Southern California, said  he expects that there will be no subsidies for private trauma centers without a  big battle.  </P> <P> A survey by the council of about 10 hospitals in 1987 showed the average loss  per trauma patient was $4,386 among those classified as having no insurance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Los Angeles County's Trauma Centers  </P> <P> More than 1 million county residents live farther than 20 minutes from a trauma  center, according to county health officials.

			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Eggar rules out single regulator for the utilities Mr Tim Eggar, industry and energy minister, yesterday ruled out for several years at least the creation of a single energy regulator and other significant reforms to utility regulation. He said the UK had 'got the balance between bureaucracy and accountability just about right' in regulation. Mr Eggar's comments follow criticism of recent regulatory decisions and calls from within the regulated industries for reform. Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power, has been among those pressing for reform, saying that regulators should be brought together in a single organisation and their deliberations made more open. Ms Clare Spottiswoode, gas regulator, has suggested a need for a single energy regulator in the long term. Mr Eggar said at a conference organised by the Institute of Economic Affairs that the essence of UK policy was that industries and their problems were different. He said: 'Each needs a different regulatory approach. There are some issues where fine judgments of fairness and public interest need to be made and where a commission is precisely what is needed. That is why our regulatory arrangements already have one, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.' Mr Eggar said a specialist regulator could develop the depth of understanding of each industry. 'The changes which are coming in the gas and electricity industries are sufficiently complex to require the undivided attention of a specialist before the case for a single energy regulator could be properly considered,' he said. He added: 'The fact that both sides complain at most regulatory decisions may well mean that most of the time the regulators are getting it just about right. 'Certainly the dramatic efficiency improvements of the past few years suggest that the new structures we have created are delivering our overall objectives.' Mr Eggar said rules for good regulatory practice included 'consistency and predictability, transparency, and speed and efficiency.'</p>

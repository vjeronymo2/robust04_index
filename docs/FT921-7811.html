			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / WWF warns of threat to ecosystems posed by global warming PLANT and animal life in half the world's national parks and protected areas is at risk due to global warming, according to a World Wide Fund for Nature report, writes John Hunt, Environment Correspondent. The report says there is conclusive evidence that glaciers are receding because of climate change; rising sea levels are killing mangroves; and coral reefs are dying in warmer oceans. Ms Tessa Robertson, WWF pollution and energy officer, said: 'Such events are ominous indicators of the effects of climate change. If we continue to emit greenhouse gases at the current rate, more and more ecosystems and species will be in grave danger.' Mountainous areas, coastal wetlands, tundra and northern and temperate forests were particularly threatened. Animals most at risk included the walrus, polar bear and gazelles. More than 150 species of European alpine flower, including the edelweiss, could decline or become extinct. The report is being considered at the World Congress on National Parks and Protected Areas being held in Caracas, Venezuela. The congress will report to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. The findings are based on the effects of a 1 degree Centigrade rise in global temperature by the year 2025 and 3 degrees Centigrade increase by the end of the next century. These levels have been predicted by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, if greenhouse gases are not reduced. They could result in a severe reduction in the overall biological productivity of the Arctic seas. Many of Britain's coastal reserves would risk losing plants and animals as sea levels rose. Migratory routes and breeding and feeding grounds for fish and birds were likely to be affected. Snow and ice-covered parts of the European alpine landscape could be reduced by a quarter by a temperature rise of 3.8 degrees Centigrade. Land use would be radically altered and there would be major changes to lowland rivers and forests with risk of flooding. Can Nature Survive Global Warming?

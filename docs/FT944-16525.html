			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / US pays to make superhighway fair The US Commerce Department yesterday took steps to ensure that the US information superhighway reaches schools, hospitals, libraries, government agencies and minority communities which might otherwise be left out of the communications revolution. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, announced 92 grants worth Dollars 24.4m for programmes in 45 states this year. Matching funds from private and other public sources brings the total information spending dedicated to public institutions and under-served communities to Dollars 67.6m. In 1995, the administration will hand out Dollars 64m, a large increase but still well below demand. This year applicants raised Dollars 800m in matching funds and requested Dollars 560m in grants. Only one in 10 bids was accepted. The department's National Institute of Standards and Technology runs a larger grant programme to help industries research and develop new technology for the information superhighway. Commerce officials said that, while the private sector would develop the information infrastructure which US companies need to remain competitive, the government's role is to help under-served communities. 'These are public institutions which are integral to the fabric of this nation,' said Mr Larry Irvine, assistant commerce secretary for communications and information. In the atmosphere of cynicism among the US electorate, grant programmes like these are easily labelled 'pork barrel' by anti-government conservatives. Commerce officials insisted there were no politics involved in the awarding of only one grant to Texas - increasingly Republican territory - and 10 to California, a key state for the president's 1996 re-election campaign. Many of the grants read like a roll-call of traditional Democrat constituencies in minority and low-income communities. This was deliberate, said department officials, to avoid creating 'a society of information haves and have nots'. Harlem, the black community in New York City where Mr Brown grew up, received one of the larger grants - Dollars 450,000 - for a Dollars 1.1m project to plug six schools into an environmental learning programme. A Dollars 156,000 grant will support a Dollars 300,000 plan for linking more than 500 American Indian tribal governments and developing 'telemedicine', child care, education, economic development and cultural preservation programmes. A Dollars 100,000 grant will go to a Korean Youth and Community Centre in Los Angeles to develop training for community workers.</p>

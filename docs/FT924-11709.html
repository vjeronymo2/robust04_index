			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dorling Kindersley gets Pounds 102m flotation tag SHARES in Dorling Kindersley Holdings, the international publishing group, were yesterday priced at 165p, giving the group a value at flotation of Pounds 101.7m. Strong demand for the shares has caused the proportion of the 19.15m shares on offer, which will be firmly placed with financial institutions, to be reduced from 75 per cent to 63.4 per cent. The remaining 36.6 per cent will be provisionally placed, subject to clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private clients. The price puts the shares on an historic multiple of 18.1 and a notional historic gross dividend yield of 2.4 per cent. The closing date for application forms from intermediaries is next Wednesday and dealing is expected to begin on Friday. The issue is being sponsored by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, with Cazenove acting as broker. The flotation will raise Pounds 31.6m, of which Pounds 25m will be new money for the company.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 18 Mar (INA)--Two Iraqi papers have  denounced the U.S. Administration's attitude concerning the  lifting of the blockade that is still imposed on the Iraqi  people even after Iraq has fully complied with all UN  resolutions.    In their analyses today, AL-'IRAQ and AL-THAWRAH say that  Washington is working on employing the economic embargo as a  political framework to serve its imperialist goals in the region.    AL-'IRAQ draws the world's attention to the dangers of the  U.S. exploitation of world organizations. It says: The  Security Council's failure to assert its independence and its  submission to the desires of a policy that is unrelated to the  international legitimacy or the UN Security Council's  resolutions will turn the Council into a tool for mass murder  against the Iraqi people.    AL-IRAQ questions the usefulness of the Iraqi people's and  leadership's continued adherence to and compliance with the  resolutions of the Security Council, which does not respect its  own obligations and resolutions. It urges the peace and freedom  loving nations to stress the independence of their positions and  adopt positive steps that would end the U.S. hegemony over the  UN resolutions and the power to issue UN resolutions.    AL-THAWRAH says fairness must dominate relations between  Iraq  and world organizations after the exacerbation of the state of  injustice and unfairness that has afflicted Iraq as a result of  the economic embargo imposed against it.    The paper, mouthpiece of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  says: It has become clear that those who oppose the lifting of  the embargo now have nothing to justify their opposition. If  the logic of brute force, deception, and extortion is all they  have to rely on, their position is now more exposed than ever  before.    The paper stresses that the U.S. Administration is losing  much of its power and influence in the world by insisting on  entrenching this despicable, hostile action, represented by the  blockade. The paper urges the U.S. Administration to benefit  from the lessons of the past three years with their major  events. It stresses that these events have not been able to  harm the substance of the Iraqi steadfastness despite the  significant size of the scheme and despite what was offered by  the agents and the regional traitors and mercenaries.</p>

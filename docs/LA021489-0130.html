			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO:;  </P> <P> COLLEGE DISTRICT TRUSTEES OPPOSE LOAN PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Trustees of Saddleback Community College District have sent a resolution to the  U.S. Department of Education objecting to a proposed crackdown on student  loans.  </P> <P> Last year, then-Education Secretary William Bennett proposed a ban on most  federally backed loans to students if the students attend a college that has a  high default rate on paying back the federal Guaranteed Student Loans.  </P> <P> But that proposal unfairly penalizes colleges, which neither make the loans nor  collect them, trustees said.  </P> <P> Bennett's proposal, which is still pending before the U.S. Education  Department, called for a cutoff of all federally backed loans to a college that  has a default rate of 20% or higher. Most California community colleges,  including Saddleback College and Irvine Valley College, have default rates  higher than 20% for that type of student loan.  </P> <P> The Saddleback trustees, in their resolution, noted that "the colleges do not  award or collect on (federal) loans to students yet are held accountable for  student defaults."  </P> <P> They added that all student loans to a college should not be threatened because  of "perceived inadequacies" of one type of student loan.  </P> <P> And current and future students should not be penalized because of non-payment  mistakes made by past students, the resolution said.  </P></p>

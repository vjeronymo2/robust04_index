			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 19 (BERNAMA) -- Malaysia and New  Zealand agreed that the move to impose a minimum wage rate for  the whole world will obstruct free trade and place the third  world countries at a disadvantage, Foreign Minister Abdullah  Ahmad Badawi said Thursday.    He said the visiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jim Bolger  felt that the move, initiated by several industrialised  countries, would adversely affect the competitive edge of  developing countries. Without the advantage of cheap labour,  the developing countries would not be able to progress well.    Abdullah was speaking to reporters after attending a meeting  between Prime Minister Dr. Mahathir Mohammed and Bolger at the  Prime Ministers Department here.    The New Zealand premier and his wife, Joan, arrived here  Wednesday for a three-day official visit. Both the prime  ministers agreed that the move to link the trade issue with  matters relating to humanity will affect free trade and open  market system, Abdullah said. He also said that Kuala Lumpur  and Wellington had agreed to create as many forums as necessary  to discuss matters relating to bilateral relations and regional  problems.    The forums which might have the same objective as  joint-commission but in different forms, could be established  when necessary, he added.    Abdullah said Dr. Mahathir and Bolger also agreed that the  forums need not have any definite dialogue framework but should  be in the form of free discussions.    New Zealand had also suggested that there should be exchange  visits in the form of working holiday between the youths of both  countries to help strengthen relations between the peoples of  the two countries, Abdullah said.    New Zealand now has a similar programme with Japan.</p>

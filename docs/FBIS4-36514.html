			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salwa al-Ustuwani: "Damascus Renews Its </F> Rejection of `Majdal Shams First' Plan"]    [Excerpts] Damascus, Cairo, Amman, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT --  Damascus has informed Washington of its rejection of the Israeli  peace plan conveyed by U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher during his recent shuttle tour of the region, known  as the "Majdal Shams First" peace plan.    Well-informed sources in Cairo have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that the Israeli plan includes a three-phase Israeli withdrawal  from the Golan Heights; the first phase includes a withdrawal  from three out of five villages on the Heights. [passage  omitted]    The sources pointed out that Israel does not want to  implement an integrated peace process at once on all  Arab-Israeli tracks. It is seeking to conduct partial and  phased implementation on each track individually, with a  transitional phase after the implementation of each peace plan.    Well-informed Syrian sources have told AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT  that  Washington held meetings the evening of the day before yesterday  with Syria, Lebanon, and Israel in preparation, the sources  believe, for a discussion of the issue of Christopher's return  to the region to continue his efforts regarding the peace  process. [passage omitted]    In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT a Syrian official held  Israel responsible for increasing tension in the region and  pushing the peace process toward collapse.    The official said that "Israel continues to deliberately  escalate the situation and work to create a climate and  conditions for continuing the war and exposing the Lebanese  people's lives to danger and annihilation -- which threatens to  destroy the peace process." The Syrian official stressed "the  resoluteness of the Lebanese and Syrian position in the  negotiation process, and no one can separate the two tracks."    The official added that "Israel's aggressive practices  against Lebanon have exceeded all limits. No one can remain  silent about them, they must be confronted. Israeli aggression  must be confronted." The official urged the international  community to put an end to the policy of murder and destruction  which has become an integral part of Israel's strategy for the  occupation of southern Lebanon.    The official described Israel's practices in southern  Lebanon  as terrorist actions, pointing out that this puts the region as  a whole in a troubled and serious atmosphere and brings to mind  the atmosphere of the war Israel is once again seeking. The  official said: "Thus a prompt move is needed to stop Israeli  practices, provocations, and the positions adopted by Yitzhaq  Rabin's government," adding that Israel would be very mistaken  if it believes that it can continue to have a free hand to  strike as it wishes. It must realize well that Lebanese  resistance is stronger than Israeli aggression, because it is a  legitimate right and supported by international legitimacy."  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey static at Pounds 66m - Rapid growth in EC catalytic converter market helps maintain profits JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals company, yesterday surprised the market with a small increase in profits as the European catalytic converter market began to grow rapidly. The company's rationalisation programme, which stripped Pounds 13m of costs out last year, also helped pre-tax profits to rise from Pounds 66.1m to Pounds 66.3m on sales marginally higher at Pounds 1.73bn. Earnings per share rose 0.1p to 24p, but the company said that because of the strong balance sheet and good prospects, it would pay a final dividend of 6.65p, giving a total of 9.65p, up 4.3 per cent on the year. Mr Richard Wakeling, chief executive, said that recession would have hit the company much harder without the rationalisation programme, which was fully provided for and had almost finished after two years. Despite poor auto sales in the US and Europe, the catalytic systems division increased operating profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 22.5m and is now the largest contributor in the group. Demand from European car makers in the last quarter was particularly strong in the run up to the 1993 European Community emissions legislation that will affect all cars. The European market, where only 50 per cent of new cars are currently fitted with catalytic converters, doubled last year and would almost double again during Johnson Matthey's current financial year, Mr Wakeling said. Furthermore, Johnson Matthey had increased its market share to about 35 per cent. Profits in the colour and print division rose 41 per cent to Pounds 11.1m, as benefits of a rationalisation programme fed through rapidly. But precious metals fell 23 per cent, as the prices of platinum and rhodium fell 13 per cent and 24 per cent respectively during the year. Likewise profits in the materials technology division fell 11 per cent to Pounds 17.7m, with much of that profit coming from the biomedical area. The company continued to reduce the amount of precious metal work in progress, thereby releasing an exceptional gain of Pounds 6.4m, more than covering the Pounds 5m exceptional cost of redundancies and rationalisation. It also took a Pounds 4.4m extraordinary profit on the sale of 25 per cent of Tanaka Matthey in Japan and a Pounds 4.8m extraordinary profit as a tax credit on payments it made to Johnson Matthey Bankers seven years ago. COMMENT Finally Johnson Matthey is beginning to mine the rich seam deriving from European Community vehicle emission controls. The sudden increase in European demand for catalytic converters combines with JM's increasing market share to suggest that growth and cash flow from this division could be exciting over the next couple of years. Such rosy prospects are less apparent elsewhere in the group. Colour and print, though more efficient, is relatively mature and unlikely to change the group's direction; precious metals continue to dance like a puppet in tune with the platinum price; and with the exception of biomedical products, the materials technology division is still in need of management attention. Catalytic converters will, therefore, do the bulk of the work for shareholders and should help produce pre-tax profits of Pounds 72m this year, or 26p of earnings, and a prospective multiple at a justifiable 16.</p>

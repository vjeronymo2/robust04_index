			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan may ease rules on shelf registration JAPAN's Ministry of Finance may ease the regulations on shelf registration for domestic bond issuers, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The MoF is considering making credit ratings a criterion, allowing companies with a single-A rating or better to make a shelf registration. It may also lower quantitative hurdles for other borrowers, the official said. Securities companies last November urged the MoF to take such moves because the Tokyo stock market slump has slashed the pool of firms eligible to make shelf registrations, a brokerage official said. The MoF introduced the shelf registration system in October 1988, shortening the period between initial registration and bond issuance to less than a week from several weeks. Brokerage officials said the MoF's decision on the deregulation is likely to be made as early as July, but the MoF official declined to comment on the timing.</p>

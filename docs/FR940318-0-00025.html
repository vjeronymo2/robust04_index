			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 207 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2820, amended section 8(a)(1) of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 637(a)(1), to authorize SBA to award a competitive 8(a) contract to a concern whose term of participation in the 8(a) program has expired if the concern was an eligible Program Participant on the date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation. This final rule incorporates this provision into the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, a second, contract-specific waiver to SBA's nonmanufacturer rule (the requirement that, for a supply contract, a small business concern that is not itself the manufacturer must provide the product of a small business manufacturer) is added to the substantive size regulations for both 8(a) and small business set-aside contracts. This change incorporates the statutory change to the Small Business Act made by Section 210 of Public Law 101&hyph;574, 104 Stat. 2821. While the procedures for requesting and receiving such a waiver were published as a proposed rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48981, a change is also needed to the substantive size rules recognizing this type of waiver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these changes (necessitated by Public Law 101&hyph;574), Section 10 of the Alaska Land Status Technical Corrections Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;415, 106 Stat. 2112, 2115, eliminated the need for SBA to determine whether a specific Alaska Native Corporation (ANC) is economically disadvantaged in determining the eligibility of an ANC-owned business entity for the 8(a) program. This final rule deletes SBA's regulatory provision requiring SBA to determine the economic disadvantage of an ANC prior to determining eligibility of an ANC-owned business entity. SBA's regulations concerning eligibility determinations in competitive 8(a) acquisitions are not consistent with the FAR regarding the same subject. The FAR authorize procuring agency contracting officers, in negotiated competitive 8(a) acquisitions, to submit to SBA for an eligibility determination only the 8(a) offeror determined by the procuring agency to be the apparent successful offeror. 48 CFR 19.805&hyph;2(c)(2). SBA's regulations have permitted a procuring agency contracting officer to submit all 8(a) offerors determined to be in the competitive range for eligibility determinations. The conflict in the two regulations has caused confusion and friction between SBA and procuring agencies. SBA believes that the FAR approach to eligibility determinations in negotiated competitive 8(a) acquisitions is the better approach and adopts it in this final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule corrects a typographical error in the 8(a) regulations which, in a cross reference, inadvertently refers to the ``developmental'' stage of program participation instead of the ``transitional'' stage of program participation. It also changes references to the ``Office of Program Eligibility'' or ``OPE'' to the ``Division of Program Certification and Eligibility'' or ``DPCE.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

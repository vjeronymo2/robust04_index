			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 31 Jan (INA) -- AL-THAWRAH newspaper says  the decisionmaking process in the United States reveals the  extent of the Zionist lobby's control of U.S. policy.    In an article today, the paper, speaking for the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party, notes the U.S. Senate decision  prohibiting U.S. arms sales to any Arab state that adheres to  the boycott of "Israel." The Senate's unanimous decision shows  very clearly to what degree U.S. decisionmakers are under the  control of the Zionist octopus at the expense of legitimate U.S.  interests and U.S. taxpayers.    The paper also highlights the U.S. Administration's attitude  toward the Zionist lobby's domination, saying that the tentacles  of the Zionist octopus are all over the White House and that the  Presidential Office is not safe from Zionist influence. In this  regard, the paper notes what happened when another nominee was  appointed to replace the former Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who  reportedly resigned for personal reasons. The Zionist lobby  forced President Clinton to withdraw his nomination of the  retired General Bobby Inman in favor of the Zionist candidate  William Perry, Aspin's deputy who is known for his intelligence  activities.    The ban on arms sales and the withdrawal of Inman's  nomination show that U.S. decisions are purely Zionist in terms  of their substance, endorsement, and aims. No one can now dare  to differentiate between U.S. national interests and those of  world Zionism and its usurping entity in occupied Palestine.    The paper says the Zionist octopus is ruling the United  States through U.S. tools. It is enough here to note that four  senior officials of the U.S. Administration, led by Vice  President Al Gore, are well-known Zionists.    The paper also reviews the effects of this situation on  developments in the Arab arena. The Arab rulers who have tied  their decisions to U.S. decisions are, in reality, carrying out  the orders and decisions of Zionism. They should expect more  humiliating and disgraceful decisions.    The paper highlights the attempts of some Arab regimes to  break and end the Arab boycott of the Zionist entity, saying  that, in light of this, the U.S. Administration is in no need of  such a Zionist decision to ban arms sales to countries that  boycott "Israel".    The paper cites Republican Senator Brown as saying that most  Arab countries do not oppose such a measure, and that some of  them have indeed dropped the boycott. In fact, there are some  people in the region who are more eager than Brown to end the  Arab boycott of the Zionist entity and tighten the Iraq embargo.</p>

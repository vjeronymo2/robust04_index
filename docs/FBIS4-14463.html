The law envisages that the court  may begin proceedings to establish whether an act is  constitutional on the initiative of the president, parliament, a  permanent parliamentary commission, a group of no less than 70  lawmakers, the Supreme Court, the highest economical court and  the prosecutor general of the Republic.    The Constitutional Court shall be elected by the parliament.  The Constitutional Court is entitled to adopt resolutions and  begin its activities only if no less than seven judges have been  elected. Chairman of a parliamentary commission of the  Belarusian parliament assured that elections of the judges of  the Constitutional Court may be held no sooner than the  Belarusian parliament meets in its spring session scheduled  approximately on 17 May.    Dmitriy Bulakhov, chairman of the parliamentary commission  for legislature, said that 1 July 1994 is a realistic date when  the Constitutional Court is expected to begin its work.</p>

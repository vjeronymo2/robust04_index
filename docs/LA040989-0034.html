			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTERCULTURAL ETIQUETTE  </P> <P> Three marks for poor taste in the photographs selected to accompany Itabari  Njeri's well-written article. Showing a modicum of sensibility with selection  of a beautiful woman of Indian descent, the subsequent photographic panels were  quite offensive, including the English dandy.  </P> <P> You could not find one photograph in your archives of an African-American  female with braided hair? Or must Bo Derek continue to represent the ASP (Anglo  Saxon Protestant -- the W is redundant) view of the appropriate image of  African hair styling.  </P> <P> Asian-American females too must be wondering why they are caricatured in 1989  with a photograph of a female wearing heavy pancake makeup with a Betty Boop  coiffure, vintage 1940.  </P> <P> OSCAR STREETER JR.  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

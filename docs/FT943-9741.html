			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vegetable farms take root in Guatemala - Edward Orlebar writes on a co-operative approach that has spurred an export market Marcelino Chiroy, a 51-year-old farmer from Santiago Sacatepequez, has never looked back from the day a Swiss aid worker persuaded him to switch from growing maize and vegetables for the local market to growing cauliflower for export. He used to own 8 cuerdas, or just over an acre. There were 3 cuerdas of maize to feed his family, and five to grow coriander, beetroot, lettuce and maize which he would sell at the bus terminal in Guatemala City, about an hour away. That was more than 10 years ago. Since joining the co-operative Cuatro Pinos in Santiago Sacatepequez, he has acquired 6 manzanas - about 5 acres - through prudent saving, and put all five of his children through school. Mr Chiroy, who is a Mayan Indian, still tills his 3 cuerdas of corn, the basic diet of his culture for thousands of years. On the rest of his land he grows broccoli, mange-tout - a type of sugar-pea - and has recently introduced radiccio. 'I did my sums and I realised I could earn about five times as much,' he says. The co-operative was the brain-child of Swiss aid workers who came to Santiago Sacatepequez, a village in the highlands west of Guatemala City, after a devastating earthquake in 1976 killed 25,000 people, mostly in and around the capital. It provides technical assistance, health care, literacy teachers and cheap credit to its members, from whom it buys export quality vegetables. The co-operative has grown from a membership of 20 to nearly 2,000, says Mr Esteban Saz, the deputy general manager, who was among the original members. In its first year of exports in 1982 the co-operative sent about 100,000lbs of mange-tous to the US. By last year exports had grown to more than 9.5m lbs of produce: principally mange-tout, but also peas, french beans, a range of baby vegetables, radiccio and raspberries. About 85 per cent of exports goes to the US, air-freighted to Miami, and about 10 per cent to Europe, mostly to the UK. It was not difficult to persuade the apparently conservative farmers to switch to producing vegetables for export, which they remain ambivalent about consuming, from their traditional crops of maize and beans. 'The incentive has been watching your neighbour buy a television, or even a pick-up,' says Mr Luis Caniz, of the chamber of non-traditional exports. Mr Caniz believes the co-operative model has been crucial in developing the burgeoning non-traditional agricultural sector, because it hired agronomists to teach the farmers new techniques, provided credit and encouraged reinvestment of profits by its members. Many of the non-traditional export crops such as mange-tout and broccoli are labour intensive and lend themselves to being produced by small farmers, which has allowed Guatemala's highland Indians to be competitive, says Mr Caniz. He estimates that about 80,000 indigenous people in the extremely poor and formerly war-ravaged western highlands derive their principal source of income from export vegetables, having switched from the traditional staples. Export revenue from vegetables has boomed in recent years from Dollars 10.3m in 1986 to Dollars 53m in 1993. Mange-tout cultivation is expanding at around 3,000 manzanas a year, according to the Chamber of Exporters, and it believes vegetable exports could double during the next 10 years.</p>

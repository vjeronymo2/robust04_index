			<p>CSO     [Excerpt] Tomorrow, Monday, the Chilean Air Force expects  to receive the first two CASA [Spanish Aircraft Manufacturing,  Inc.] 212 light transport planes purchased recently from Spain.  The transfer will take place during a ceremony at which Minister  of Defense Patricio Rojas and Air Force General Ramon Vega,  commander in chief of the Chilean Air Force, will preside.    These aircraft were purchased in accordance with a general  agreement signed between this service branch and Aeronautic  Constructions, S.A. (CASA), a Spanish aircraft factory,  following the construction in Chile of the CASA 101 jet reactor  aircraft that Group No. 1 currently has in service.    Thanks to its special STOL [short takeoff and landing]  characteristics, its usefulness on unprepared terrain, and the  rear ramp designed for the handling of large cargo volume, these  planes are an excellent tool for providing transport and aid  when catastrophes occur in our country.    These planes are destined for use by the Third Air Brigade  based in Puerto Montt as replacements for the old Twin Otters.  They will provide support services to the isolated localities in  continental Chiloe and Regions XI and XII, as well as for the  missions to the Antarctic.    The CASA 212 aircraft have excellent navigation equipment  and  computers, a flight range of 2,000 kilometers, a maximum speed  of 350 kilometers per hour, and a capacity of three tons of  cargo, 26 passengers, or 12 patients on litters.    Pedro Bermejo Marin, the Spanish ambassador to Chile, as  well  as representatives of the CASA enterprise, will attend the  acceptance ceremony as special guests.    As to the possible purchase of airplanes of the Mirage line  announced by Minister of Defense Patricio Rojas, they are  expected to be entirely operational by the end of this year, or  at the beginning of next year at the latest.    These planes would be Belgian Mirage 5 BR's, which the air  force in that country is now replacing with U.S.-manufactured  F-16's. These fighter-bombers were modified in accordance with  the special Mirage System Improvement Program (MIRSIP), and have  been equipped with new electronic and weapons systems. The SABCA  [Belgian Company for Aircraft Manufacturing], an affiliate of  Dassault, participated in this reequipment process.    The MIRSIP Mirage 5 is equipped with modern electronic  detection and attack systems. It has an Atar engine manufactured  by the SNECMA [National Aircraft Engine Research and  Manufacturing Company], which enables it to exceed double the  speed of sound. It can transport up to four tons of bombs and  air-to-air missiles. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Arts: Today's Television Two of BBC2's current Top 3 are Friday night repeats: the mid-sixties puppet series Thunderbirds (6.00) and Victoria Wood - As Seen On TV (9.00). Both are getting more than five million viewers whereas series such as '40 Minutes' and 'The Money Programme' are now languishing below the two million mark. BBC2's social affairs series, Public Eye (8.00) has also failed to set the Thames on fire, though its subjects are often significant. Today it investigates the police disciplinary system, asking whether it deals effectively with officers who break the law, or protects them from the consequences of their actions; last year barely one in 20 complaints against the police was upheld. As usual on Fridays there are several movies. Slither (11.20 BBC1) is a bit like much modern art: you need to know a lot about other pictures before you can really appreciate all its jokes, influences and references. Mainly it is a pastiche road movie. Astonishingly, A Strange Place To Meet (12.05 BBC2) is also a parody of a road movie, this time French ('Slither' is American) and much slower. Abba The Movie (12.05 C4) is like a 90-minute video for the group, made in 1977.</p>

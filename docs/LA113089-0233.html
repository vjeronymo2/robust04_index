			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> GUEST: 'LET CARSON COME TO ME'  </P> <P> A woman who says she might slap Johnny Carson if she ever went on his show is  playing hard to get with the host of "The Tonight Show."  </P> <P> Clara Hoover attracted the attention of Carson's talent coordinator because she  has forecast the weather for years by observing things like wooly worms,  persimmon seeds and the wind.  </P> <P> But Hoover turned down an invitation to appear on the show, taped in Burbank.  She told the coordinator that if they wanted her they could come to Sheridan,  about 20 miles north of Indianapolis, to tape the show.  </P> <P> "I have no desire to go out there," Hoover responded. "And when he gets someone  on his show, he makes funny faces and all that. I might slap him."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEWISH LEADERS MARK PLOTTING OF HOLOCAUST;  </P> <P> WORLD WAR II: THEIR MEETING WHERE THE KILLING WAS MAPPED IS INTENDED TO PREVENT  ANY REPETITION.  </P> <P> On a warm spring morning Tuesday, 45 years to the day after the collapse of  Nazism, the Holocaust came full circle.  </P> <P> It happened outside the three-story stuccoed villa in the picturesque Berlin  suburb of Wannsee where on Jan. 20, 1942, a handful of Nazi government  officials gathered for just a few hours and clinically planned the  extermination of European Jewry.  </P> <P> After a protracted, controversial debate in the Judaic world, a small group of  Jewish leaders gathered on the villa's grounds Tuesday with the stated aim of  keeping the memory of what happened there alive so that it might never happen  again.  </P> <P> A declaration written by Nobel Peace laureate and Holocaust survivor Elie  Wiesel said in part:  </P> <P> " . . . when we Jews visit and listen to the somber and dark echoes at Wannsee,  we aim at preventing future generations from inheriting our past as their  future."  </P> <P> Wiesel was absent because of an earlier commitment, but his brief statement was  read in Hebrew, English and German. The ceremony was attended by several dozen  Jews and a small group of German dignitaries. Many could not hold back their  tears, unable to heed Wiesel's injunction: "Cry? One must not cry here! If you  begin, you will not stop. How many tears does one shed for thousands of  communities?"  </P> <P> The commemoration came on the final day of the first formal gathering of world  Jewish leaders in Germany since the rise of Nazism nearly 60 years ago. The  gathering is part of a highly visible attempt by Jewish leaders to establish a  new relationship with Germany as the process of reunification begins.  </P> <P> World Jewish Congress officials have praised the success of West Germany's  democracy, but there is apprehension as unity proceeds.  </P> <P> "My heart says stay away, but my mind says there is a new Germany here," said  World Jewish Congress Vice President Isi Leibler, explaining in an interview  after the ceremony why he decided to attend. "With hope for the future, we must  ensure that this new Germany will make a commitment that their children and the  children of those children will understand (the Holocaust). Only then can we  survive."  </P> <P> Leibler referred to the powerful differences among Jews about the visit but  said it was a matter of personal conscience. He said those who first supported  the decision for the Wannsee ceremony were mainly concentration camp survivors.  </P> <P> "It's not a good feeling to be here," said Samuel Pastarnak, 67, an Auschwitz  survivor who now lives in Nuremberg. "But it is something that must be done."  </P> <P> The Wannsee ceremony occurred exactly 45 years after Adolf Hitler's Third Reich  surrendered unconditionally to the United States and its allies, ending World  War II in Europe. The day was commemorated in several German cities.  </P> <P> Above all, Jewish leaders meeting here have repeated a single plea to German  leaders and opinion makers: Don't let the memory of the Holocaust die, don't  let it be falsified.  </P> <P> Tuesday's trip to Wannsee was in that spirit, conference organizers said.  </P> <P> "I won't pray here, for I personally believe God has turned his face away from  this place, as he did at Auschwitz," World Jewish Congress President Edgar M.  Bronfman told the gathering.  </P> <P> For many, the horror of that meeting captured the horror of the Holocaust  itself -- that ordinary men, when told of the plan, never questioned it but  instead planned the extermination of an entire race with a bureaucratic  precision that made it seem simply one more routine task.  </P> <P> The exact number of those who attended the Jan. 20, 1942, meeting that sealed  the fate of about 6 million Jews is unclear. Some accounts talk of 12, others  13 and still others 15.  </P> <P> One of Hitler's top lieutenants, Reinhard Heydrich, presided, while a  middle-ranking SS officer named Adolf Eichmann took the minutes. The rest were  anonymous government and security functionaries.  </P> <P> The villa, then a little-used retreat for senior SS (elite force) officers,  lies in a particularly leafy and tranquil district of what is now southwestern  West Berlin, taking its name from a nearby lake that serves as a playground for  the city's residents. It was selected because of the sensitivity of the subject  to be discussed.  </P> <P> According to Ekkehard Klausa, who administers memorial sites for the West  Berlin government, historical accounts show that both Eichmann and Heydrich  were extremely apprehensive that some of the meeting's participants might  protest what became known as the "Final Solution."  </P> <P> They did not, and Eichmann and Heydrich celebrated that lack of dissent  afterward with cigars and brandy.  </P> <P> While the decision to murder the Jews had been taken earlier by Hitler, those  at the Wannsee meeting carefully defined who was a Jew, where the Jewish  populations were located and how they would be transported from their homes to  the death camps.  </P> <P> "Here, in the chamber rooms of this villa, regulations were determined that  then went through the inevitable and proper bureaucratic procedure across  hundreds of tidy desks to take the form of the cattle cars eastward, of  barracks behind barbed wire and finally the gas chambers and crematoria," the  head of the German Jewish Council, Heinz Galinski, told the Tuesday gathering.  "The horror that we connect with the names Auschwitz, Treblinka . . . they have  their origins here in Wannsee."  </P> <P> Tuesday's ceremony concluded with the Israeli anthem.  </P> <P> The villa, which was a youth hostel for much of the postwar period, is being  turned into a museum and seminar center on the Holocaust and Nazi period.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, the East German Parliament marked the day with a moment of silence  and, for the second time in less than a month, admitted that East Germans share  responsibility for the Holocaust.  </P> <P> "No one should forget guilt and no one should deny responsibility,"  parliamentary Speaker Sabine Bergman-Pohl said in a ceremony.  </P> <P> Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere asked Jews for forgiveness.  </P> <P> "We extend our hand in reconciliation and to work together for a common  future," he later said in a luncheon address to a joint meeting of the World  Jewish Congress and the European Jewish Congress.  </P> <P> "A Germany without Jews never existed and it cannot exist without Jews. . . . A  German unification cannot be a revival of 1933. We request you to have  confidence in us," he said.  </P> <P> De Maiziere also promised to fight a revival of anti-Semitic feeling among  German youth.  </P> <P> "It fills us with concern. No people can get rid of the dark side of its past,"  he said.  </P> <P> The Communists, who ruled East Germany for 40 years until last fall's  revolutions swept through the region, had always denied that their country had  any responsibility for the Holocaust, claiming instead that, because Hitler  also persecuted Communists, East Germany shared a common legacy with the  victims of Nazism.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Yu. N. Rodionov, deputy of </F> the State Duma, by unidentified correspondent; place and date  not given; from the "Aty-Baty" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Rodionov] All members of  the committee understand the aims and tasks of the committee.  Insofar as the army is above politics and has no factions or  party groupings within it, the committee likewise must reflect  the armed forces since in practice it works for the needs of the  armed forces by drawing up legislation necessary to them.  [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Do you think there is a need to criticize  the armed forces, and how should it be done? Do people have the  right to participate in its reform? Should reform be through  public control, the press, or the State Duma?    [Rodionov] Everyone can be criticized, the armed forces  included, as long as the criticism is based on fact and not on  malignant attitudes or personal resentment. The life and  activities of the armed forces should be widely publicized in  the press, radio, and television--that is, in all mass media.    [Correspondent] Don't you presently receive sufficient  publicity?    [Rodionov] No, it is insufficient. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] What is the relationship with the Defense  Ministry of those servicemen currently serving as deputies? Has  their status been determined yet? Will they be discharged from  the armed forces? What relationship do they have with the  Defense Ministry?    [Rodionov] To reply to the first part of your question, I  will say all of us servicemen elected as deputies to the State  Duma of the Federal Assembly are, how can I put it, the flesh  and blood of our armed forces. For instance, I am in my 39th  year of service with the armed forces, so how can I speak of  having some kind of relationship with the Defense Ministry. I  am part of the armed forces and do not think of myself in any  other terms. Those servicemen who are State Duma deputies think  of themselves in exactly the same way.    Unfortunately, our present legal status has not been  defined.  Article 44 of the Law on Military Responsibility and Military  Service provides that a soldier's service is suspended for the  period of his full-time work in an elected body. This article  was abolished by the presidential edict of 24 December 1993,  creating a legal vacuum. So now, if a serviceman is to be  discharged, then which article should apply? The article on  staff reductions cannot apply, since our jobs have not been  reduced. The article on bad conduct cannot be applied either,  since we have not done anything illegal, and so on. There is no  article in accordance with which we could discharge  servicemen-deputies. The one remaining article which can be  applied is the one which permits us to attach these people to a  government body--which the State Duma is--and leave them on  active service. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] Are you satisfied with the way the situation  is currently shaping up in the State Duma as regards military  issues? Does something need to be done or strengthened? Do we  need to change something before it's too late, or to say  something to the deputies and officers?    [Rodionov] The Duma is the reflection of the situation in  our country and armed forces. Now is a complicated period for  the country, as well as for the armed forces and the State Duma.  The country and the armed forces will survive this period.  There must be progress. I believe our country will come out of  the situation in which it finds itself.    [Correspondent] Where will this progress come from, and what  is the basis for it?    [Rodionov] It is the lawmaking work of the Duma. There must  be precise legislation, and precise demands must be made on the  executive power to implement the legislation adopted by the  Duma. Until we start implementing the existing legislation, we  will not make any sense from any of the vital activities  happening in our country.    Independent deputies--those elected from single-mandate  districts--will form the basis of the center in the Duma. As a  matter of fact, the idea of consolidating all forces to  implement the tasks facing the Duma, and on which practically  all independent deputies are working, has been enunciated within  the new regional policy party grouping. Namely, it is the  independent deputies who are not members of any party who must  undertake and head this work of consolidation, because the main  task facing the Duma is not the clarification of relationships  between parties, but the difficult and exacting work of drafting  laws.</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Government Bonds: German money supply figures lower European prices Higher-than-expected German money supply figures disappointed many of the European government bond markets yesterday, fuelling fears that the next cut in key German interest rates could still be some way off. However, the biggest movement came in the Italian market where the municipal election results prompted a two-point tumble in Italian government debt prices. German government bonds lost half a point as the Bundesbank reported that M3 expanded by a seasonally adjusted annualised 6.8 per cent, unchanged on September and outside the central bank's target range of 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Many market participants were disappointed as they had expected M3 to show signs of slowing down in October. Six-month bank lending jumped to a 9.2 per cent annualised rate. 'The news of a 9.2 per cent increase in bank lending to the non-bank private sector was especially bad', said Mr Julian Callow, European economist at Kleinwort Benson. While the market had hoped that the Bundesbank would cut its official interest rates in December, yesterday's money supply news is forcing some market players to contemplate a delay in the cuts. However, some dealers pointed out that if the November cost-of-living figures for the various states - due to be released later this weak - show a fall, the Bundesbank would still have scope to ease sooner rather than later. The December bund futures contract traded at 99.77 by late afternoon, down 0.50 point from Friday's close. Italian government bonds fell nearly two points before regaining some of the lost ground as the mainstream political parties suffered a crushing defeat in municipal elections at the weekend. Foreign investors and domestic institutions were heavy sellers of Italian paper, and by afternoon, rumours were circulating that the Italian authorities were buying paper to support the market and stem a further fall. The Liffe BTP futures contract settled at 112.64, down 189 basis points. Dealers said the Italian bloodbath was prompted by fears that the municipal election results would weaken the central government and jeopardise its economic plans, creating uncertainty over the budget legislation. Spanish government bonds lost nearly half a point in line with other European markets on the back of disappointing German M3 figures and the turmoil in Italy. However, some dealers are hoping to see a quarter point easing at today's repo, taking the rate from 9.25 per cent to 9.00 per cent. Weakness in the continental European fixed income markets and pre-Budget jitters pushed UK government bond prices lower by as much as  7/8 point at the long end, in spite of the good inflation background revealed by last week's economic data which had raised hopes of a base rate cut. The 7 1/4 per cent gilt due 1998 slipped  5/32 to 104 1/2 by late afternoon while the 8 3/4 per cent gilt due 2017 dropped  7/8 to 118 1/2 . US government securities fell at the long end of the maturity range yesterday in the wake of a mildly disappointing Treasury auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at 98 1/4 , yielding 6.376 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 11/32 , to yield 4.213 per cent. Prices opened slightly firmer in the wake of some dealer short-covering, but with sentiment fragile in the wake of upbeat economic reports, the market was unable to hold on to its early gains. By mid-morning, prices had slipped into negative territory along the yield curve as dealers sold securities to prepare for the sale of Dollars 17bn in two-year notes. The auction was not a disaster, but demand from retail accounts was thinner than expected. Concern about the prospects for the five-year auction, due later today, weakened prices at the long end of the market. The yield curve for Japanese government bonds steepened as stock market falls and lower money market rates lifted short-dated paper. Fear of supply in the 10-year area held back prices at the long end.</p>

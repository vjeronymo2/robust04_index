			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Kanebo chiefs step down after losses rise Both the president and chairman of Kanebo, the Japanese cosmetics-to-textiles company, are to resign their posts following a much larger pre-tax loss and lower sales in the 1993-94 year compared with a year earlier. The company said the two were taking responsibility for the company's poor performance last year and its decision to pass its dividend. The moves were aimed at winning employee co-operation for wide-ranging restructuring plans the company is likely to adopt in an effort to return to profitability. Both men will stay with the company. Mr Masao Nagata, president, replaces Mr Kazutomo Ishizawa as chairman. Mr Ishizawa becomes honorary adviser. The senior managing director, Mr Soichi Ishihara, becomes president. Kanebo suffered an 18 per cent drop in unconsolidated sales to Y418.9bn (Dollars 4bn), from a previous Y510.1bn, in the year to March 1994. Pre-tax losses ballooned to Y6.7bn from Y4.5bn, and the company fell into a net loss of Y3.7bn compared with a net profit of Y1.6bn in the previous year. Sales had been depressed by the weakness of the Japanese economy with sales of textiles particularly hard hit by slow consumer demand for clothing since the Japanese economy plunged into recession. Sales of textiles, which make up about 45 per cent of overall sales, dropped 22 per cent as the company was also hit by cheaper imports from Asian countries such as Pakistan, Korea, China. The pharmaceuticals and new materials businesses held up but cosmetics, which accounts for 37 per cent of sales, made a loss. Foods, a smaller business for Kanebo, fell 57 per cent. Efforts to restructure the business area under way. The company has introduced cost reductions, is keeping a lid on new recruitment and moving production overseas in a bid to improve profitability. Kanebo forecasts higher sales in the current year at Y420bn, and larger pre-tax and net losses of Y9.8bn and Y7.8bn respectively.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / US disarray over policy on sanctions for N Korea US diplomatic efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear dispute were in confusion last night after indications of a breakthrough during talks in Pyongyang were disavowed by President Clinton. Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president seeking to broker a solution on a private visit to Pyongyang, told Mr Kim Il-sung, the North Korean dictator: 'I would like to inform you that they have stopped the sanctions activity in the United Nations.' Cable News Network, the US television channel, showed him making the remark and reported that he told Mr Kim he was doing so after consultations with the White House. However, Mr Clinton denied in Chicago there had been any change in US policy, which he had outlined on Thursday, to seek UN sanctions to punish North Korea for its failure to open its nuclear facilities to international inspection. He had said the US would continue to seek sanctions while it explored the credibility of the latest North Korean offers. Mr Clinton said: 'I don't know what he (Mr Carter) said, and I don't know that you know what he said. All I know is what I said, and what I said is the policy of United States.' The denial appeared to undermine the efforts of Mr Carter, who is scheduled to end his three-day visit to North Korea today. Though acting in a private capacity, he had been fully briefed by the White House before setting off. During his talks, North Korea indicated it was willing to remain a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), and Mr Kim said two inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency could remain at the North's nuclear complex in Yongbyon. North Korea withdrew from the IAEA this week. Mr Carter told the 82-year-old dictator that the Clinton administration had 'provisionally agreed' to a new round of talks with Pyongyang if it returned to the International Atomic Energy Agency and agreed to freeze its nuclear programme. He suggested the US was ready to issue a declaration banning the use of nuclear weapons against North Korea if negotiations proceeded smoothly. North Korea has long sought such a guarantee. In a goodwill gesture, Mr Kim said he was ordering the activation of joint North Korean-US search teams to look for the remains of US soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war. Although yesterday's talks may ease tensions on the Korean peninsula, they did not directly address the issue of full nuclear inspections that lies at the heart of the 15-month dispute. The IAEA wants to examine the nuclear facilities to determine whether plutonium was diverted in 1989 to build atomic bombs. North Korea has blocked IAEA access to two suspected nuclear waste dumps and may have destroyed evidence of activity by withdrawing spent fuel rods from the reactor without allowing the IAEA to analyse them. Mr Kim told Mr Carter he would allow full inspections if the US granted diplomatic recognition and economic aid. Government officials in Seoul noted previous attempts to arrange talks had collapsed because of Pyongyang's refusal to accept IAEA inspections.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Waigel foresees 'inner EC circle' EUROPEAN countries with stable economies and currencies could make up a joint currency zone that would be the nucleus of a future Europe, according to Germany's finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, Reuter reports from Bonn. In an interview with the newspaper Nordkurier, he spelt out a vision of a Europe of 'concentric circles', with Germany, France and some other countries at the centre. This appeared at odds with recent official denials that Bonn now envisaged a possible two-tier, or two-speed, Europe in the wake of last month's currency turmoil and doubts in some countries about aspects of the Maastricht treaty. His remarks appeared to reflect a vigorous debate inside the German government about how European integration should proceed. Mr Waigel said he would not describe his view as a two-speed development, but rather a Europe of concentric circles. He mentioned Germany, France, the Benelux countries and Denmark as countries that could make up the nucleus currency zone. It would have the D-Mark as anchor and develop into a joint currency, which he termed the Europa-Mark. Mr Waigel said he would not limit this inner circle of European countries to the French franc and the mark. 'There are no barriers against including the Benelux countries and Denmark,' he said, adding that such a Europe would also be possible with Austria and Switzerland. 'The only determinants are economic, financial and stability criteria,' he said. 'Around this circle a Europe will develop that consists of countries that either belong to the European Community or want to belong. These countries do not fulfil the criteria, but undertake efforts toward convergence.' Last week Mr Waigel was quoted by members of his Christian Social Union party as saying the Community would have to consider developing at different speeds in the future because of the varying economic performance in member countries. However, at the party meeting Mr Waigel did not call for a two-speed Europe. The meeting followed newspaper reports that Germany was seeking a 'mini-Europe' of its strongest economies or a currency merger with France. Such plans were flatly denied by the government in Bonn.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / World Trade News: Westinghouse in Czech N-deal WESTINGHOUSE Electric of the US has clinched two contracts, worth a total of Dollars 350m-Dollars 400m (Pounds 228m-Pounds 260m), to supply technology, equipment and services to the partially completed Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech republic. The signing this week of the contracts ends a 2 1/2 -year saga that has turned into one of the most important for western suppliers seeking orders to upgrade nuclear plants in eastern Europe. Westinghouse said the contracts were the largest yet awarded for safety and performance related upgrades of Soviet-designed nuclear reactors. The customers are the plant owner, Ceske Energeticke Zavody, and the primary plant supplier, Skoda Prague. They are also the first such orders for a western company for the VVER1000 type of reactors, widely viewed as the Soviet design that approximates most closely to western safety standards. Overall costs for upgrading the 81 Soviet-designed nuclear stations in Russia, Ukraine and eastern Europe have been estimated at Dollars 10bn. There are 38 VVER1000s in operation or under construction. Westinghouse was told in September it had been selected to supply a Dollars 220m instrumentation and control (I&amp;C) system to the Temelin plant, which has two units each of 1,000MW, and a month later that it would supply the first core and four reloads of fuel. But the Czech government only formally announced in March that it would continue construction of the plant. The I&amp;C system will be manufactured at Westinghouse factories in Pittsburgh and Brussels, with participation of companies in the Czech republic. The fuel will be made in the US but Skoda Plzen, the reactor vessel supplier for the two Temelin units, will join Westinghouse in fuel testing and development programmes. Equipment suppliers have been pushing western governments and supranational bodies to step up financing for nuclear safety work in eastern Europe. In this case, 85 per cent of financing has come from the US Exim Bank and Belgian export credits, the balance provided by European banks. The Czech government is guaranteeing the loans.</p>

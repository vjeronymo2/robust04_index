			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Citroen to axe 1,600 jobs CITROEN is to lose more than 1,600 jobs this year, 5 per cent of its national workforce, as part of its campaign to reduce capacity in line with falling demand and to lift productivity closer to that of Japanese competitors. This is the third round of job losses in the French car industry in recent months, following state-owned Renault's announcement that it is to shed 2,249 workers, and 2,597 job losses at Peugeot, part of the same group as Citroen. It comes at a politically sensitive time, when the government is trying to curb industrial job losses, as shown by the outcry over the closure of a Hoover plant near Dijon. Citroen has prepared alternative work plans for those losing their jobs, in line with a recent law obliging companies to produce plans for alternative employment for surplus workers. Unusually, most of the Citroen job losses will be among engineers, technicians, and executives, rather than factory floor workers as in the past. Among the options to be offered are early retirement, phased retirement, other jobs in or out of the company, training and job creation incentives, part time working and a subsidised return home for immigrant workers. 'We aim to avoid redundancies if possible,' said an official. Citroen's comprehensive efforts to soften the blow contrast with previous job losses in the Peugeot group, the terms of which which have caused conflict between the chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, and Mrs Martine Aubry, the labour minister and backer of the tough new job rules. Outline plans were presented yesterday to Citroen unions, who immediately published them for discussion at a works council on February 12.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Property: An Italian renaissance - With prices low, now might be a good time to buy a second home in Florence The dire predictions that were made about the Italian property market in 1993 have come true in Florence this year, and worst estimates say the market has fallen by between 20 and 30 per cent. PRIcoa Relocation Management (the acronym comes from Prudential Insurance Company of America), a company that has handled relocations in the UK and Europe for 25 years, says: 'The weak economy and political uncertainty have taken their toll. 'In a town that relies on small industry and tourism, the residential market falls have been serious.' So now could be a good time to buy. However, PRIcoa says buyers have been cautious, while sellers have often refused to accept that the market has fallen so far. Some agents are now saying the market has 'stabilised', but others are using the word 'stagnated'. Both buyers and sellers are awaiting a miracle solution, from the government. The company notes that many foreign purchasers have chosen to live in the city centre, around the Duomo and Santa Croce areas. For a new or renovated apartment there, prices are about Pounds 325,000 to Pounds 350,000 (L750m to L800m). Older properties could be a third cheaper. Be wary of neighbourhoods that could be noisy, of the ever-present parking problem, and of places that attract the city's annual 2.5m tourists. The revival of demand for second homes abroad among British buyers has been slower than expected. Brian A French &amp; Associates, a UK agent specialising in Italian property, believes it is now up to the agencies to rekindle the public's interest in the overseas market. The company's view is: 'We can lead it along.' French has gathered a broad mix of properties in and around Florence, which it hopes will entice second-home buyers to the area. Accessibility is one of the selling points. Florence is served by air, road and rail, and is a good base for business or relaxation. Nearly all visitors leave the city regretting that they could not see everything they wanted to of its arts and architecture, the handicrafts produced in the 5,000 craft workshops in its network of lanes, and its celebrated high-fashion boutiques. With so much to do, life in Florence need never be dull, although it could certainly be expensive. A currency that soon takes you into figures that run off the end of your calculator can be daunting to the foreign home-buyer. Take heart from the fact that Florence is a great place for haggling, especially in the present financial climate. The hill-encircled city, with a population of 397,450, straddles the River Arno. From its high vantage points, it forms a pattern of faded red roofs and mellow walls. At ground level there are narrow streets with ornate iron window grilles, avenues well-shaded with trees and businesslike, tall, flat-fronted apartment blocks. So where should one look for a second home? Up-and-coming areas are to the south at Campo di Marte. The lettings market is more buoyant than sales. In the medium-price bracket two-bedroom apartments range from Pounds 475 to Pounds 713 a month, depending on whether furnished or unfurnished. For something more pricey, look in the Piazzale Michelangelo and Viale Michelangelo districts, says Dr Paolo Spagnoli, a property consultant with offices in Florence and London. A beginning-of-the-century semi-detached house, set back behind a screen of trees has space for six cars in the forecourt. The basement would make a sizeable garden flat. There are high-ceilinged ground-floor rooms; various upper rooms and bathrooms. It is not much cared-for at present, but the basics are there. Its Italian industrialist owner had been wanting about Pounds 1.5m, but is now asking Pounds 1.2m, negotiable. In San Domenico, on the city fringe, is a property in a different style: a 1930s detached house. This is slotted among individual homes on a hillside with more than two acres of garden and there is a possibility of buying more. Although it looks almost like a bungalow, it has five bedrooms, a sitting room, study, dining room, paved terrace and double garage. It is modernised, has a highly sophisticated security system and is ready to move into. This is also priced at Pounds 1.2m, negotiable. If you are not in the market at this sort of price, a short drive north of Florence takes you into the Mugello region. This expanse of open country seems to have escaped publicity because it has little to attract tourists except the occasional castle. It has that Italian trademark: groups of slender cypress trees, and is surrounded by folds of hills shading from pale green to purple in the evening light. Many Italians from Florence head in this direction, either for second homes or as commuters. They find they can pick their price among old villas and rural buildings. There are no parking worries and it is cooler in summer. Brian A French &amp; Associates has built up a collection of possible second homes. It is working in conjunction with Spagnoli Engineering, a Florence construction company that is renovating old villas and manor houses, often dividing them into more manageable units for sale. The company also does conversion work for individual buyers. It is building 40 houses and flats in a development in the Rufina district, 30 minutes by car or train from Florence. The properties will be in short terraces, with the local-style red roofs and ochre-coloured walls. Prices are from Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 170,000. If you want an older property, a 15th-century manor house in parkland, in a hill-village 20 minutes from Florence, is being made into 13 units of between 683sq ft to 2,750sq ft. They will sell from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 400,000. A farm estate in another Mugello area has been split to make a three-bedroom apartment in a tower, for sale at Pounds 75,000; and a ground-floor four-room flat with a bathroom and family room, priced at at Pounds 39,000. Both will need refurbishment. A four-bedroom section of a farmhouse, on two floors, at Dicomano, also needs renovation, but comes with 25 acres, at Pounds 160,000. A long, low ruin of a stone-walled farmhouse at Barberino di Mugello needs complete refurbishment, in spite of its Pounds 70,000 price. Yet it has the makings of an appealing home. For the person who wants a simple property, on its own, with the conversion work long done, the choice could be a former mill at Londa. This has three bedrooms, dining and sitting rooms and a small three-room apartment. It has a double garage and nestles in its sheltered, well-cultivated garden, with a stream running through it. It also has a large swimming pool, a luxury in a region where permission for a pool may be hard to get. The price is Pounds 327,000. Abbey National, the British bank, has recently opened 13 bank branches across Italy, including one in Florence. It offers a range of lire mortgages for both first and holiday-homes in mainland Italy. According to Pietro Bertollo, of Abbey National's Milan head office, the bank now has a significant presence on the Italian financial services scene lending to 'thousands of contented Italian borrowers' and an increasing number of UK buyers. It has an English-speaking customer-service department in Milan. More information: PRIcoa Relocation, 071-629 8222; Dr Paolo Spagnoli, 071-403 9768; Brian A French &amp; Associates, 071-284 0114.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Flextech in European TCI deal - Company will be vehicle for future programme expansion Flextech, the cable and satellite television group, is on the verge of completing the purchase of the European programming interests of Tele-Communications, the largest US cable operator. Under the deal Flextech, a former oil services company which sold its oil interests last year to concentrate on the media, will take managerial control and a variety of stakes in a range of satellite and cable channels. The purchase will make Flextech the second largest channel operator in the cable and satellite market behind British Sky Broadcasting, the consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. In return TCI, in the process of being taken over by Bell Atlantic, the US telephone company, will take a 60 per cent stake in Flextech, at the moment a company quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market. The aim is that Flextech will become the vehicle for future TCI programme expansion in the UK and the rest of Europe. Under the agreement, which could be announced before Christmas, Flextech is expected to get from TCI 100 per cent of Bravo, the classic movies channel, a 25 per cent stake in Children's Channel to add to the 50 per cent it already holds, 25 per cent in UK Gold, the channel featuring programmes from the BBC and Thames Television library and 31 per cent in UK Living, the channel aimed mainly at women. In addition Flextech will take over United Artists Programming and with it managerial control of Wire TV and the Parliamentary Channel, two cable only channels. The company run by Mr Roger Luard will also have management responsibility for Discovery, the factual programmes channel and management and distribution of the Country Music Channel. As part of the deal Flextech is expected to get more than Pounds 20m in cash and loans and be able to call on a further sum of around Pounds 15m if required. Flextech is emerging as a significant player in the market for cable and satellite channels although it is at the moment a lossmaker. In the six months to June 30 the company incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.2m, compared with Pounds 2.91m last year. In October when Flextech announced it was in talks with TCI its share price jumped by 49p to 224p. It now stands at 315p with a capitalisation of more than Pounds 100m, an indication of the current interest in communications companies. At the time the company indicated that the deal would put a value of around Pounds 100m on the assets being acquired. Once the current deal is formally completed Flextech, an unsuccessful bidder for an ITV franchise last time, is likely to start looking around for an investment in ITV. At the moment it could own no more than 20 per cent because of its satellite channels although the government is in the process of setting up an inter-departmental review of the present cross media ownership rules.</p>

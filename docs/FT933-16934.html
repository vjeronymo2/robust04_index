			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: A student musical; and LIFT goes Chinese Any musical that contains the song 'Oh] You Beautiful Doll]' has a lot going for it. You may have forgotten (I never knew) that it comes in Madame Sherry by Otto Hauerbach and Karl Hoschna which appeared in Bloomington, Illinois, in 1910. Actually, the 'Beautiful Doll' song was added slightly later and the original version of Madame Sherry was French, being first performed in Berlin around the turn of the century. A new adaptation by Martin Connor surfaced in Connecticut in 1989. Such a cosmopolitan history makes it entirely appropriate for the summer musical at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, though the obvious question is whether it could stand a longer run on a bigger stage. The answer is just possibly 'yes'. The Guildhall performance opens nervously, but gains confidence as it goes on. Here is a mixture of all the cliches of the musical: corny plot, shaky dialogue, sentimentality, set pieces and a happy ending. On the other hand, those are the ingredients that can make a musical work. And if you like good bad jokes, Madame Sherry has its stack of them: for example. 'My uncle's so rich, he keeps Swiss money in American banks.' The bad puns are a lot worse than that, but still appealing. Of course, it is on the music and the lyrics that a musical stands or falls. Madame Sherry stands. Not only 'Beautiful Doll', but also 'Put Your Arms Around Me, Honey' and 'Every Little Movement', all of which have been taken up by later stars. In the Guildhall production, where Martin Connor directs his own adaptation, there is lovely chorus work, and some attractive staging, notably in the yacht in New York Harbour. The costumes are elegant throughout: it is a tribute to the cast that they know how to wear them. There are good parts galore. I liked Alison Burrows's Yvonne, the girl who arrives on the New York scene having been brought up in a French convent, and her immensely tall father Theophilus, played by David Axel. Why Judy Browne's Catherine has an Irish accent is beyond me, but it adds to the teasing fun in a thoroughly enjoyable evening. The orchestra is excellent with some fine violin playing by Sonya Fairbairn. Meanwhile, the London International Festival of Theatre (LIFT/93) continues across the capital until July 12. Catch it where you can. I am told by those who have seen them that the itinerant Hanoi Water Puppets are sheer delight. For myself, I enjoyed without understanding the Chengdu Theatre Company's Ripples Across Stagnant Water at the Riverside Studio. The play has elements of a Chinese Madame Bovary and is set, around 1900, against a background of civil strife. I cannot comment on the dialogue, but the acting, setting and musical interventions are of a very high order. One point that struck me is how easily the Chinese move from great courtesy to violence: almost in the same effortless physical movement. Madame Sherry is at the Guildhall School Theatre until July 7. (071) 638 8891</p>

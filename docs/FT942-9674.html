			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Harrods fails to stop name use Harrods, the London department store, failed yesterday in a High Court attempt to ban a prep school from calling itself 'The Harrodian School'. Mr Justice Harman rejected a claim that the private 400-pupil school, opened last September in the old Harrods staff club building in south-west London, was trying to cash in on Harrods' reputation. Harrods said it would appeal.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / South leads rise in house prices The pace of the housing market remains very mixed, with the biggest price rises in the south, according to a survey published yesterday by Halifax building society. Its quarterly survey shows that prices across northern England and Wales have fallen on average by as much as 2.1 per cent during the past year. The survey, which compared prices in the three months to the end of June with those for the same period last year, showed prices had risen in seven regions and had fallen in five. Prices increased overall by 0.6 per cent. Halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, said: 'The underlying trend in house prices in the UK is still broadly flat. 'While the market should become more buoyant as general perceptions of economic recovery become more widespread, we do not expect annual house price inflation to rise above 2 per cent to 3 per cent this year.' According to the survey, prices in Northern Ireland, traditionally the lowest in the UK, have risen 6.6 per cent in the past year. Prices in Scotland have risen 0.4 per cent. Halifax said that overall there was little change from last year in the number of people searching for a new home, although there were marked differences between regions. Demand for properties was outstripping supply in much of southern England. The second largest increase was in the south-east, where the average price of a home rose 2.2 per cent to Pounds 77,360, according to the society. It added: 'The upper end of the market, particularly in rural areas, is reported as being the best for some time, with quick sales being achieved on competitively priced properties.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------- REGIONAL PRICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                             Price*    Annual                             Pounds    % rise                                       (fall)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- UK:                         63,124       0.6 Greater London              77,952       1.6 South-east                  77,360       2.2 South-west                  62,210       0.8 West Midlands               61,785     (0.6) East Anglia                 59,455       1.6 Scotland                    57,897       0.4 East Midlands               55,352       1.1 North-west                  55,345     (2.1) Wales                       53,525     (0.6) Yorkshire Humberside                  52,907     (0.5) North                       52,036     (1.3) Northern Ireland            40,557       6.6  --------------------------------------------------------------------- *Standard weighted price Source: Halifax  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: UK insurance The commission earned by banks and building societies for selling household insurance policies has been a useful source of income through recession. But with competition from direct insurers starting to erode such payments - from anything up to 30 per cent of premium at the peak  - they must choose between dwindling commission income and stepping into the ring as insurers themselves. It would be strange if Abbey National was alone in opting for the latter route, especially once building societies are free to spread their wings in insurance as well. If others get the Abbey habit and form joint ventures with established insurance companies, there could be a swift redistribution of market share in these lines of business. The insurers would then face their own choice: either supplying underwriting muscle to joint ventures or losing the business altogether. Writing policies which are branded, administered and distributed by another company clearly carries risks. Commercial Union could find itself squeezed out, for example, if Abbey decides to shoulder the underwriting risk itself. Even if that happens once its initial five-year agreement with Abbey has expired, CU's decision to participate looks like the lesser of two evils.</p>

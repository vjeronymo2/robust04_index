			<p>BFN     [Text] Ah well, Americans, you have now imposed your FRAPH  [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of Haiti] on  us. You have found your submissive Army too small for us.  Americans, you fear that someday we could be furious, that we  could defeat your Army, and then (?take another direction). You  are afraid, are you not? You have seen what we can do when we  are furious.    But let me tell you, Americans: Neither your shitty Army nor  your farting FRAPH will be able to catch us and they will not  (?try to) catch us because our roots are deeply embedded in the  soil.    (?Our misery has reached its limit; we have reached the  deadline). If nothing is done, we will act as did Dessalines, we  will act as did Dessalines, we will act as did Dessalines.</p>

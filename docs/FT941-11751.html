			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / S African right may win poll changes: African National Congress seeks to avert boycott of April's election The African National Congress, in a last-minute attempt to avert a violent right-wing boycott of April's all-race elections, appears ready to make important concessions to the right-wing Freedom Alliance when constitutional talks resume today. The ANC's policy-making body, the national executive committee, met until late on Tuesday night trying to find a formula for constitutional changes which would entice the Freedom Alliance to participate in the poll. The NEC is understood to have decided on a package of measures which include changes to the voting system to include separate national and regional ballots, rather than one ballot to elect representatives to both national and regional assemblies. This is an important concession to the Inkatha Freedom party, which would have been prejudiced by the one-ballot system. However, it is unclear whether other elements of the package - especially provisions for the autonomy of regional governments - will meet Inkatha's demands. ANC officials said the organisation had improved its offer in this area, and further changes could be made. The Tuesday meeting appears to mark a significant shift in the position of the ANC, which has so far failed to demonstrate the political will to accommodate Inkatha. It is uncertain whether this will carry the two sides over the main hurdle which separates them - the gulf between the strong central state which the ANC wants and the federal system which Inkatha demands. ANC officials said a strong central state could not be compromised, adding that talks could drag on for a further 10 days until the expiry of the last legal deadline for political parties to register for elections. This deadline was set last night when President FW de Klerk proclaimed the date of the first all-race elections.</p>

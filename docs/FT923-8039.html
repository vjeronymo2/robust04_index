			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Elf and Amerada swap gas assets ELF Exploration UK, a sub-sidiary of the French state-owned oil company Elf Aquitaine, has swapped North Sea assets with Amerada Hess, the US oil company. Elf, the fourth largest North Sea operator, said the deal would help it to strengthen its position in the North Sea, and demonstrated its long-term commitment to the area. The deal gives Elf a 12.5 per cent interest in the Franklin discovery, thought to be a potentially large gas field. Franklin, in Block 29/5b, is very close to Elf's Elgin gas field, which is under appraisal, and the company plans to develop the two together. Elf said the deal would allow it to swap present for future production and to consolidate its interests in the North Sea. If the appraisal is positive, Elf will seek government approval to develop the fields in 1994, hoping for first gas by 1998. Amerada Hess will get Elf's 16.45 per cent interest in the Anglia gas field, raising its total interest to 29.29 per cent. Anglia is producing 50m cu ft of gas a day. Amerada Hess said the deal strengthened its position in the southern gas basin of the North Sea.</p>

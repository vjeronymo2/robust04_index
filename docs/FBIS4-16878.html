			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages in quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] President of Latvia Guntis Ulmanis spoke  on national radio and television on Tuesday evening. First of  all Guntis Ulmanis once more emphasized the prerogatives of his  action as state president:    [Ulmanis] "This evening I will speak about our country's  foreign policy. A person thinks little about it every day, and  still less tries to associate himself directly with the  settlement of foreign policy issues. Right after being elected  to the post of president, I said that the priorities of my work  in foreign policy are linked with Baltic unity and relations  with Russia, although even at that time, half a year ago, I  understood that they would not be easy priorities, especially  where Russia is concerned. Yet today we have come to confront  problems from which we cannot retreat, but forward movement  demands certain sacrifices."    [Announcer] Continuing his address, the president stated his  attitude to the agreements initialled on 15 March by Russia and  Latvia.    [Ulmanis] "I would like to express my stance on the issues  all the more because, as our philosopher Vilnis Zarins said in  his letter to me, when a decision is taken, one must stick to it  strictly and unflichingly, knowing that one will be cursed  anyway. At this moment I defend the creation of active and  energetic relations with Russia. I mean here to their full  extent, in both political and economic relations, because  obviously, as a result of a passive foreign policy, we will be  the losers, just as this would also create economic  impoverishment for our nation. In relations between countries,  especially if their border is long and their forces unequal, the  only way is to draw closer, to understand, to be farsighted, to  seek compromise, at length, patiently, both gaining and losing."    [Announcer] Speaking about the possible meeting of the two  countries' leaders, which may take place on 21 April, Guntis  Ulmanis said:    [Ulmanis] "I call on the Russian president to seek ways to  make it possible for the Latvian and Russian presidents to meet.  This morning I invited Aleksandr Rannikh, ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Russia to Latvia, for a  conversation, and I put to him a proposal to meet the Russian  president. I also received the same kind of proposal from  Yeltsin's side. Perhaps a coincidence? I think not. It is  necessary to openly state one's views, about the possible  signing or non-signing of the initialled agreements; to achieve  clarity about the announced creation of a military base in  Latvia, at Skrunda; and to try to draw a line over the heavy  injustices of history relating to the occupation of independent  Latvia in 1940 and communist genocide in 1941 and later years.  I will call on President Yeltsin to seek opportunities to  settle our mutual relations as equal sovereign neighbors, and to  cease putting forward pretexts for not talking to us, or for  talking on from positions of power."    [Announcer] The president also expressed his prognosis on  how  the possible meeting of the two presidents will go.    [Ulmanis] "I will speak in favor of signing three  agreements,  at the same time creating a group of experts to specify the  basis of the fourth agreement, on the social guarantees for the  remaining military personnel and their families. In the form  that this agreement currently takes, in my opinion it is not  acceptable to the majority of the people, not acceptable to me  personally either. In my opinion Latvia and Russia must  continue to seek the way of mutual understanding, so as to  achieve at government level agreement on the future destiny of  retired military personnel, in the next 10 days."    [Announcer] Concluding his speech, the Latvian president  once  more commented on his recent visit to three western European  countries in the context of the initialled interstate agreements:    [Ulmanis] "I will not be able to understand my people if I  do  not regularly meet people in towns and in the country in Latvia.  But in turn the world will not recognise Latvia, its people, if  we do not talk about it in other countries, if we are unable to  show Europe the force of the spirit of the Latvian people, its  love of work, and its enterprise. Within the Latvian  constitution, this is first the president's duty, and I will  fulfill it too.    "The important issues we spoke about with politicians in  three foreign countries: The guarantees that Europe can give  Latvia, and to what extent Latvia for its part is able to fulfil  the demands put by Europe; the creation of a repatriation fund,  to promote the departure of retired military personnel from  Latvia; the status of the Skrunda radar station, and the  negative effects of its operation on people and nature in  Kurzeme; and the last thing we talked about: What are really the  opportunities for the Latvian people and prospects for  strengthening Latvian statehood.    "On all these issues, in my opinion, a certain understanding  was reached. Security is to the greatest extent dependent on  how we strengthen the unity of the three Baltic countries and  create relations with Russia. By signing agreements with  Russia, an opportunity will open up to put Latvian-Russian  relations in order, in the first place making them subject to  international controls. I am fully aware of my responsibility  for what happens to the Latvian nation tomorrow. I said that  when meeting in Europe, seeking the support and understanding of  Denmark, France, and Britain. And everywhere I received an  unequivocal response: Europe will not abandon the Baltic lands  any more. 1939 must not be repeated."    [Announcer] As Latvian radio has already reported, on  Tuesday  when the president met with leaders of factions in the Saeima,  Guntis Ulamnis received support for talks with Russian President  Boris Yeltsin. However, a final decision on the status of this  meeting -- whether it will only be talks or whether there will  be a signing of agreement -- will be taken by deputies at the  extraordinary plenary sitting of the Saeima on Wednesday.</p>

Waters contaminated with black  carbon, which were a threat to the environment, are now being  processed into superconductive channel black. This is a product  with outstanding absorption characteristics, which has become an  export item. Among other uses, the material can be used in the  elimination of oil disasters and in the purification of  wastewaters. Its advantage is that it is more effective than  other sorbents and costs less. It has a smaller mass, which  reduces the cost of transportation. Currently, it is being  tested in the United States, South America, Norway, France, and  other countries. Maritime interests in the United States have  used it to wash out the holds of tankers.    The Chemopetrol Enterprise has shown flexibility in  developing new sorbents. In one month, it changed the  consistency of the material from a powder to granules. It thus  eliminated dustiness, which was bothering potential users.  Furthermore, the enterprise introduced packaging in smaller  quantities, which facilitates manipulation and use.    Work on the project was participated in by a Swiss  commercial  firm that was instrumental in expanding the circle of customers.  In Argentina, sorbents are being readied to eliminate the  lagoons that accompany petroleum drilling. Ivory Coast has also  indicated an interest in the product. The cost of using the  material in individual countries is being defrayed by the Swiss  firm, without requiring financial participation on the part of  Chemopetrol.    Along with superconductive channel black, Chemopetrol  introduced a new wastewater purification plant onto the market.  Thanks to the new sorbents, the efficiency of this plant is  exceedingly high. The first customer for this plant was the  largest Swiss liquid waste incinerator near Geneva. With the aid  of the technology from Litvinov, this facility will be able to  do away with two-phase cleaning and will be able to release  wastewater into the river following the first passage through  the purification facility. After introduction into series  production, the purification facility will cost 400,000 korunas,  which is approximately one-third of the cost of existing devices  with a similar capacity.</p>

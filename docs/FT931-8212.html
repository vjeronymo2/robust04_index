			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Singapore growth prospects up Singapore's growth projections for this year are likely to be revised upwards following a sharp increase in exports, Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister said. In November Singapore's non-oil domestic exports grew by 29 per cent. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Goh said he was confident that recovery in the US would be sustained but expressed concern about the possibility of Washington introducing selective protectionist measures which could lead to a trade war.</p>

The goal was to improve relations between the two  neighboring  countries. This has certainly been achieved.    Concerning the civil war between the Islam-dominated north  and the Christian minority in the south of Sudan, which has been  smoldering since 1955 and broke out again in 1983, the Muslim  head of state said that the government has brought large parts  of the southern regions under its control. Only in some border  areas is there still some fighting.    The fact that the leadership in Khartoum is serious about  pacifying the country is shown by the acceptance of the  recommendations that were given in the course of the large  conference in 1989, such as a "just distribution of power," as  well as the "establishment of a federal system" into the  government program. Thus, there are also representatives of the  Christian minority among the cabinet members and high-ranking  officers.    The junta chief rejected accusations that the Christian  minority is being suppressed massively as a "negative campaign  in international media" against the "image of Sudan."</p>

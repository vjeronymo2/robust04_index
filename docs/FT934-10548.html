			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Early falls recouped but volume flags AN UNEASY, drifting session left UK share prices little changed yesterday from the previous close. The spotlight turned back to the UK company front and food retailing stocks gave ground as the market responded to trading reports from J. Sainsbury and Marks and Spencer, two of Britain's high street retailing monarchs. London's worries over Wall Street eased as the Dow built on Tuesday's gain to edge higher at the beginning of the new session. The FT-SE 100 Index rallied from an early decline of 8.6 points to finish only 1.8 off at 3,162.3. Traders sounded marginally satisfied with the overall performance from a stock market still lacking direction ahead of the Budget, due at the end of this month, from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer. Firmness in UK government bonds provided support for the stock market's satisfaction with the Bank of England's cautiously favourable comments on the inflation outlook. But it was left to the newly recovered pharmaceutical sector to provide the backing for the broad range of the blue chip market. Across the wider spectrum of the second line issues, sheer lack of interest left the FT-SE Mid 250 Index to drift down 5 points to 3,517.3. The institutions took on board a Pounds 184m rights issue from Siebe without strain. Hints that further equity fund raisings could be on the way also failed to disturb fund managers who regard these as a convenient way of putting funds into the stock market. While half-time profits from Sainsbury were up to expectations, the group's disclosure of widespread price-cutting plans increased nervousness among analysts towards the outlook for the food retailing sector, as well as prompting a general downgrading of profits forecasts for Sainsbury itself. Good trading figures from Marks and Spencer were well received, but BAT Industries gained no benefit from third-quarter figures. However, the market's caution regarding recovery in UK company profits remains a restraining factor, and strategists have already switched their attention to prospects for final quarter profits. The renewed firmness in bonds was seen as an important plus factor for the UK stock market, which resumed its upward trend last month largely on the back of falls in bond yields throughout Europe. A cut in UK base rates around the time of the Budget, at the end of November, remains a key component of stock market optimism. Seaq volume fell to 614.3m shares, bearing out the general view that yesterday's market lacked real direction. Non-Footsie business made up around 54 per cent of the day's deals, a return to more average daily levels. On Tuesday, Seaq volume of 660.6m shares brought a retail worth of Pounds 1.59bn, well up to the improvement in genuine investment activity which has featured the stock market over the past three months. With little news on the domestic economic side in prospect for the rest of the week, London market analysts are focusing on the data pending from across the Atlantic. Factory orders and housing starts from the US, due today, will provide a curtain-raiser for the federal unemployment data to be announced on Friday.</p>

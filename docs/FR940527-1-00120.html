			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address this problem in FY 1994, we began using a cost inflation factor rather than a charge inflation factor to update billed charges for purposes of estimating outlier payments. We believed that this refinement would improve our estimation methodology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the September 1, 1993 final rule, we set the outlier thresholds so that estimated operating outlier payments were equal to 5.1 percent of estimated total estimated operating prospective payments. We currently estimate that FY 1994 outlier payments will be 4.0 percent of total DRG payments. This figure is based on a computer simulation of payments in FY 1994 using FY 1993 bill data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We believe that actual outlier payments as a percentage of actual total DRG payments may be lower than estimated because actual hospital costs may be lower than reflected in the estimation methodology. Our most recent data on hospital costs show a significant trend in declining rates of increase. Thus, the cost inflation factor of 8.3 percent used to estimate FY 1994 outlier payments (based on the best available data) appears to have been overstated. Based on more recent data, we are using a cost inflation factor of 4.7 percent to set outlier payments for FY 1995. Also, although we estimate that FY 1994 outlier payments will approximate 4.0 percent of total DRG payments, we note that the estimate of the market basket rate of increase used to set the FY 1994 rates was 4.3 percentage points, while the latest FY 1994 market basket rate of increase forecast is 2.8 percent. Thus, the net effect is that hospitals are receiving higher FY 1994 payments than would have been established based on a more recent forecast of the market basket rate of increase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Adjustments for Area Wage Levels and Cost of Living <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section contains an explanation of the application of two types of adjustments to the adjusted standardized amounts that would be made by the intermediaries in determining the prospective payment rates as described in this addendum. For discussion purposes, it is necessary to present the adjusted standardized amounts divided into labor and nonlabor portions. Tables 1a, 1b, and 1c, as set forth in this addendum, contain the actual labor-related and nonlabor-related shares that will be used to calculate the prospective payment rates for hospitals located in the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Adjustment for Area Wage Levels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 1886(d)(3)(E) and 1886(d)(9)(C)(iv) of the Act require that an adjustment be made to the labor-related portion of the prospective payment rates to account for area differences in hospital wage levels. This adjustment is made by multiplying the labor-related portion of the adjusted standardized amounts by the appropriate wage index for the area in which the hospital is located. In section III of the preamble, we discuss certain revisions we are making to the wage index. This index is set forth in Tables 4a through 4e of this addendum. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Adjustment for Cost of Living in Alaska and Hawaii <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(5)(H) of the Act authorizes an adjustment to take into account the unique circumstances of hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii. Higher labor-related costs for these two States are taken into account in the adjustment for area wages described above. For FY 1995, the adjustment necessary for nonlabor-related costs for hospitals in Alaska and Hawaii would be made by the intermediaries by multiplying the nonlabor portion of the standardized amounts by the appropriate adjustment factor contained in the table below. If the Office of Personnel Management releases revised cost-of-living adjustment factors before August 1, 1994, we will publish them in the final rule and use them in determining FY 1995 payments. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L1(0,,),p0,8/9,i1,s50,7 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table of Cost-of-Living Adjustment Factors, Alaska and Hawaii Hospitals <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> Alaska_All areas <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.25 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Hawaii: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=03 g=1 f=4 --> Oahu <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.225 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Kauai <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.175 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maui <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Molokai <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lanai <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.20 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hawaii <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1.15 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> (The above factors are based on data obtained from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

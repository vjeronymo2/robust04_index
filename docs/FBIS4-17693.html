			<p>BFN     [Text] Minsk 25 April BELINFORM-TASS -- The Byelorussian  (Belarusian) Government announced on Monday [25 April] a  programme of state support for the producers of basic  necessities in the Republic.    The move has been prompted by the worsening financial status  of enterprises making consumer goods, especially in the light  industry.    Rampant inflation, unstable money circulation, decline in  the  buying power of the population and insolvency of partners have  caused a decrease in the production of key goods and negatively  affected their competitiveness on the domestic market.  Additionally, enterprises have been using their industrial  potential and personnel resources by only 50 per cent.    The resolution adopted by the Byelorussian Government  envisages a number of measures aimed at stabilising and  increasing the production of basic goods, improving the  situation in the domestic market and boosting exports of  consumer goods.    The Government has requested the National Bank of  Byelorussia  to allocate 150 billion roubles to the light industry at a  discount interest rate to buy wool, cotton and fur in 1994 and  another 50 billion roubles to offset mutual debts with its  partners.</p>

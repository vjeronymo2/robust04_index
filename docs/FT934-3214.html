			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (9): The going is getting tougher - Fund Managers Competition is getting tougher for custodians as fund managers become more aggressive and a range of new pressures sweeps over the industry. 'In three years' time, we are going to see a move towards independent custodians and fewer players in the UK market,' says Mr Nigel O'Sullivan, a partner with Bacon &amp; Woodrow, consulting actuaries, who scrutinises custodians. 'Previously custody has been an area neglected by pension trustees,' he says. 'People spent all their time considering fund managers. Now they are taking a far more detailed look at custody.' But he describes a number of 'nightmares' which have illustrated the need for greater attention to the back-office functions, such as custodians who have failed to collect dividends. More generally, he says the industry is becoming more alert to 'rip-offs' such as tardy income collection, and ambiguous cash management policies which provide low rates of interest. Mr O'Sullivan also highlights the lack of transparency in charges. He says custody fees have often in the past bundled up opaquely with fund management fees. Now that is beginning to change. So is the level of fee-cutting. He says: 'The US banks have come over and where you used to be quoted 10 to 12 basis points for custody, now it is probably 3 to 4. We're sceptical. 'The ideal custodian is ideally like the Victorian housekeeper: someone you don't see much of,' he says. Among the factors he looks for are assurances on the safekeeping of the assets; that settlement is contractual; that there is adequate redress if things go wrong; and that there is sufficient scrutiny of sub-custodians overseas. 'If an agent defaults, we would like the custodian to make up the difference,' he says. 'We are very much against the idea of limited liability, and are increasingly asking custodians to get their parent company to countersign agreements.' He is not opposed to fund managers offering custody services, but recommends separate contracts with the custodians. Mr Markus Ruetimann, director of client and business services at UBS Asset Management in London, is not afraid to take action when he is not satisfied with custodians. 'We got rid of two agents this year,' he says. 'That is part of our continuous review seeking improvement in quality.' He propagates what he calls 'the seven Cs' he developed in helping to determine the right custodian to work as partners with his company: Cash management: including stocks invested in interest-bearing accounts with the interest passed on to the client. Curtailment of risks: ensuring that potential custodians have appropriate systems, controls and insurance. Competitiveness of fees: to be offset against quality of service provided. Credit-rating: examining the net assets and ensuring the balance sheet of the agent is healthy. Communication and technology: how easy it is to communicate with agents and maintain links with them. Customisation capabilities: now that custody is becoming more commoditised. Commitment and comfort: with regular checking of compliance backed up by personal visits. Mr Ruetimann stresses several particular priorities at present: 'Helping us to reduce the risks; making sure their creditworthiness is up to standard; and continuously monitoring performance.' He says custodians are now having to take a more active role to market themselves. 'Before they would say this is the service we will provide, take it or leave it,' he says. 'Now they are having to accommodate technical changes.' UBS Asset Management presents a threat to independent custodians, because it believes that fund management and custody go hand-in-hand and need not be separated. Mr Ruetimann argues that lobbying by custodians and the trade press in the wake of the Maxwell scandal - and echoed in the recent Goode Report which it triggered - has unfairly tilted the balance towards custodians independent of fund managers. He says there are strong advantages to providing both services, since combined providers can share information, pool cash and eliminate the errors that can be introduced when a third party is involved. As evidence that the market appreciates this approach, he says his company now has more than Pounds 31bn under management, including Pounds 25bn of assets in custody. On the other hand, UBS Asset Management does still offer business to other custodians, since it believes in local and regional custodians rather than handing out all custody work to a single global contract. It only uses its own custody service for domestic equities in the UK, and on its home territory in Switzerland. Elsewhere, it sub-contracts the work to some 20 local custodians around the world, and to two regional custodians: one for the Pacific Rim and the other for North America. His company has undertaken a costly exercise this year, examining and overhauling its custody agreements to ensure that the services required are spelt out, and that details are provided of insurance cover, control procedures and audited financial information. Other pressures changing the demands of fund managers for custodial services include the growing range of financial instruments. 'We are having to demonstrate more sweeping abilities in more esoteric areas such as collateralised mortgage obligations and futures and options,' says Mr Ross Whitehill of Morgan Stanley. At the same time, there is a growing move towards overseas investment in emerging markets, which is increasing the emphasis on sub-custodians. 'It is up to us to pioneer services in these regions,' he says. 'We must be there in Vietnam or Peru when markets open up.' But the next few years will not be easy. Mr O'Sullivan warns: 'There is a price war on at the moment. You have to spend a lot of money on technology. Those without deep pockets are going to be left behind.'</p>

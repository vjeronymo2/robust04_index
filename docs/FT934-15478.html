			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Textiles jobs 'put at risk by US' JOBS in clothing and textiles are being threatened by US reluctance to compromise in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, says a report from the industry's trade body. The Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance wants proposals agreed in July to cut tariffs by up to 50 per cent to be adopted. It says the US is 'resisting' full application of the proposals. Mr Colin Purvis, the alliance's secretary general, said a large reduction in 'these grotesquely high trade barriers' was essential. He said: 'Last year the UK apparel and textile industry exported Pounds 1.8bn to countries outside the EC. Doubling these exports in real terms could safeguard 35,000 jobs that would otherwise be at risk.' The UK and other EC countries have much lower tariffs than the US. The maximum EC duty is 17 per cent. In the US, the world's biggest market, it is more than 40 per cent. On wool cloth, one of the UK's main export products, the rate is 36 per cent. Countries with high rates other than the US include Australia (50 per cent to 60 per cent) and many Asian countries such as India, Pakistan, China and Thailand. The alliance calls for an agreement based on rules proposed at the G7 meeting in Tokyo in July. These say that peak tariffs, over 15 per cent, would be halved and others cut by one third.</p>

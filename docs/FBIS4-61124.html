			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Bushev: "Qadi Appointed To Be </F> Responsible for Religious Affairs"]    [Text] Ashgabad -- Just four years ago, there were only 16  mosques functioning on Turkmenia's [Turkmenistan's] huge  territory; now 180 have been built, and around another 100 are  in the completion stage. What is going on? After all, everyone  -- from the famous Arminiy Vamberi to the travelers of our  century -- has unfailingly talked of the Turkmens as one of the  peoples least disposed to religious dogmatism?    Fears are idle -- fundamentalism will not cross into  Turkmenia. The policy of building a secular society proclaimed  by President S. Niyazov recently received further confirmation.    Gathering a large number of believers around a banquet table  on a small strip of grass outside the city, the Turkmen  President announced his model for relations between the people  and the religious aristocracy.    "There are people who want religious rites and customs to be  inculcated in everyone on a compulsory basis," Turkmenbashi  complained. "This is heard especially frequently from the  clergy. But Turkmens have never allowed anyone to force them to  do anything."    Formerly, leadership of religion in the republic has been  exercised by the Council for Religious Affairs under the Cabinet  of Ministers, retained from Soviet times. S. Niyazov announced  the decision to create a new structure. Henceforth, there will  be something like a committee or ministry for religion, but this  time under the country's president. It will be headed by the  supreme religious official -- the qadi of all Turkmenia. His  deputy will be the leader of the Turkmenistan Orthodox churches.  Both are to be assigned a ministerial salary of 1,000 manats,  and, like all Turkmen ministers, they will travel in state  "Volvos."    At the conclusion of the meeting religious figures appealed  to the Almighty to bless the Turkmen leader.</p>

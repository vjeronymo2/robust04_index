			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Growth in exports behind 50% improvement at Denby A strong rise in exports helped Denby Group, the pottery tableware maker which floated in May, to meet forecasts with a 50 per cent jump in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 4.13m. Mr Stephen Riley, managing director, said the results were 'excellent. But it is not the first time they have been this good'. Sales for the year to September 30 rose 25 per cent from Pounds 17.6m to Pounds 21.9m. Exports surged by 82 per cent, offsetting what had been a disappointing second half in the UK, said Mr Riley. The tax increases in April had had a definite effect on the UK economy. However, 'we are delighted to see that all the effort we put into the overseas business came through even more strongly than we had hoped for', he added. Exports now accounted for 24 per cent of sales, against 16 per cent last year. Denby still had considerable potential abroad in an industry where exports on average represented 63 per cent of sales. Turnover more than doubled in the US, where Denby had about 1,000 outlets through department stores and independent retailers. Denby is to double its marketing expenditure in the US from about Dollars 300,000 to Dollars 600,000 this year. The group's UK sales grew by 14 per cent, helped by higher prices and increased impulse buying of products such as mugs and cookware. Operating margins rose from 18.5 per cent to 20.8 per cent. Since 1991, when the management buy-out from Coloroll was completed, Denby's margins had benefited from price increases above the rate of inflation, which the group had been able to make because of improved design and service, said Mr Riley. Last year Denby increased prices by 4.5 per cent. Mr Riley warned, however, that it would be increasingly difficult to push through higher price increases. A 1.4p dividend is proposed. If the group had been quoted for the full year, it would have paid a notional 3.1p. Earnings rose from 6.5p to 9.2p. The shares, which were 130p at flotation, fell 6p to 155p.</p>

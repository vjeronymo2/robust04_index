			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Names seek EGM at Lloyd's THE LLOYD'S of London insurance market may be forced to hold an extraordinary general meeting of its 22,400 Names - individuals whose assets support underwriting. Mr Richard Astor, acting on behalf of the Names' Fraud Action group, has accused Lloyd's of not doing enough to prevent the financial ruin of hundreds of Names. Mr Astor needs 100 signatures to force Lloyd's to call an extraordinary meeting, which must be held it has to hold within 42 days of receiving a requisition. Lloyd's said yesterday that the call for a meeting was 'a curious thing to do'. An annual general meeting is planned for June, when Lloyd's will announce results for the 1989 underwriting year. An extraordinary meeting would 'entail considerable extra expense,' Lloyd's said. Meanwhile, a leading analyst of the London insurance market said yesterday that Lloyd's might be jeopardising its long-term future by short-term and unco-ordinated responses to its present difficulties. Ms Julianne Jessup, director of De Lisle Jessup Scott, mergers and acquisitions specialists for the insurance sector, said at a conference that Lloyd's agents were shifting the focus of their business away from high-risk areas because that was superficially more attractive to Names. Ms Jessup also said it was difficult to see how corporate capital - which the Rowland task force recommended should be introduced to the market - could co-exist with Names' underwriting on an unlimited basis. Reliance on corporate capital would almost inevitably change the structure of Lloyd's and erode its ability to be innovative and flexible.</p>

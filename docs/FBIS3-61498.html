			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by N. F. Dementyev, Hydrometeorological Scientific </F> Research Center, Russian Federation; UDC 504.3.062.2(262.83)]    [Abstract] The influence of water management activity in  the Amudarya and Syrdarya basins on the increase in  anthropogenic withdrawals of river runoff and the decrease in  level of the Aral Sea is analyzed. The total water withdrawals  in the Syrdarya and Amudarya basins increased threefold between  1950 and 1978, from 30 to 103 km[.sup]3[/], with the greatest  withdrawal in 1985 (109 km[.sup]3[/]. The irrigated area  during this same period approximately doubled. During the last  decade of the studied period virtually the entire volume of  annual water resources was withdrawn for irrigation. The  increase in total withdrawals beginning in 1956 did not  immediately exert an influence on the decrease in sea volume and  decrease in its level because the five-year period 1956-1960 was  a period of high waters. As a result the sea received an  additional water inflow which stabilized the sea level and  caused some increase which continued until 1960. After 1961 the  sea level constantly dropped with a brief interruption in  1969-1970 due to the high waters of 1969. The research revealed  the quantitative relations between the decrease in the volume  (level) of the Aral Sea and the increase in water withdrawals  and unreturned expenditures of river runoff in the sea basin.  The relative constancy of the natural level and the volume of  the Aral Sea persisted under conditions of a relative constancy  of the total withdrawals of river runoff in the range 30-40  km[.sup]3[/] as long as the water consumption in the basin  did not exceed 40 km[.sup]3[/]. A further increase in water  consumption in the basin caused a continuing increase in the  unreturned expenditures of river runoff, resulting in a  corresponding decrease in volume and a drop in sea level. The  threat of an ecological catastrophe in the Aral Sea basin is  entirely evident. Figures 3; references: 10 Russian.</p>

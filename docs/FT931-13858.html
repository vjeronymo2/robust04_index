			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Selling short Try as one might, it is difficult to avoid drawing negative conclusions from the December retail figures. This is not so much because there was a monthly fall of 0.7 per cent when the market was expecting a small rise. The overall movement masked a significant difference between gains for large store chains and smaller, specialist shops which suffered a sharp fall-off in business. It is the probable explanation for this trend which gives rise to the underlying disappointment. Not only do there appear to be specific areas of weakness such as music and, given Ratners' position in the market, jewellery. The fall in sales at smaller shops would be consistent with anecdotal evidence of a rush emerging only at the end of the Christmas shopping period. Smaller shops do not have the stock-carrying capacity to cope with that. The benefits would more likely accrue to larger stores who also have the muscle to discount aggressively. Consumers thus appear still reluctant to part with their money unless offered a good deal on price, a conclusion which can also be drawn from CBI figures this week. Whether that will prompt a fresh cut in interest rates, as the market seemed to assume yesterday, is another matter. The government does not have much room left to cut. It would be natural to wait if possible till the budget. Besides, it is a moot point whether another rate cut would do much to excite consumers who have other things on their minds: fear of unemployment, tax rises and low income growth for those in work. Unless the government can find a way out of this vicious circle, the danger remains that lack of confidence could lead business to cut capacity further. The trend line of UK economic growth would then fall and the budget deficit would become chronic.</p>

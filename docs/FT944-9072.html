			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Hurd to review overseas aid plans Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, has ordered a review of Britain's overseas aid programme in the light of the High Court ruling that he acted unlawfully in earmarking Pounds 234m for Malaysia's Pergau Dam project. He has told officials at the Overseas Development Administration to check whether any of the dozens of projects in other countries financed by the Pounds 100m a year provided under the government's Aid and Trade Provision scheme might also be deemed illegal. Last week the High Court said that the aid grant to the Pergau dam was unlawful because it was 'economically unsound'. Mr Hurd has rejected the basis of that argument as illogical because projects requiring aid necessarily cannot be judged on the same basis as those for which market finance would be readily available. A final decision on whether to take the issue to the Court of Appeal will depend on the outcome of Mr Hurd's review of other aid projects which might be caught by the judgment. However the foreign secretary, who is still awaiting the detailed written judgment from the court, has told colleagues that his instincts are against appealing against the ruling. Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, has made clear that he will fight a separate court defeat for the government last week over compensation for victims of crime. But Mr Hurd believes that high-profile battles with the courts risk prolonging the political damage inflicted on the government. Mr Hurd, who will face Labour fire over the affair during today's Commons debate on foreign affairs, plans to assure MPs that during his five-year tenure at the Foreign Office, no aid decisions have been linked to sales of military equipment. He will reject charges that substantial aid projects in Indonesia have been linked to large exports of military equipment.</p>

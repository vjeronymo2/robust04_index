			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 20 KYODO -- Japan was urged by other  Group of Seven (G-7) industrial powers over the weekend to boost  its domestic demand, Japanese Government sources said Monday [20  June].    The prompting came at a gathering of personal  representatives, called sherpas, of top G-7 leaders, held in  Naples for three days from Friday, the sources said.    The meeting aimed to lay the groundwork for the Naples  summit  of G-7 nations on July 8-10.    The United States and other countries urged that Japan be  mentioned by name in an economic declaration to be adopted at  the Naples summit as a country which needs to take strong fiscal  and monetary measures to increase domestic demand, the sources  said.    During the preparatory talks, the participants agreed on the  need to press ahead on the reform of labor markets to ensure the  creation of job opportunities, the sources said.    In this connection, the U.S. and some European countries  suggested that region-by-region macroeconomic steps be taken to  promote employment, they said.    Japanese representatives balked at the demand but these  countries maintained their tough stance toward Japan, according  to the sources.    The Naples summit brings together top leaders of Britain,  Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.</p>

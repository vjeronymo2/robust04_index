			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> &bull;The ``60 percent point in time'' should be based on scheduled time in the program, not on actual attendance. [Kansas City, San Francisco, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In the absence of formal withdrawal by the student, it is up to the institution to devise a mechanism to determine the last date of attendance. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. How should the term ``student who is attending the institution for the first time'' be defined? Should this mean the first time ever or the first time at the institution?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Only first year, first-time students should be considered ``first time.'' [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``A student who is attending such institution for the first time'' should be defined as the first time ever rather than the first time at an institution. Some attendees favored defining ``first time'' as the first time at the institution. Pro ration should continue until the student finishes his or her first period of enrollment for which they have been charged, or until the student has withdrawn from that term, class, or program for which they have been charged. If the student re-enters the institution, they would not be considered a first time student. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``First-time student'' is a student at that particular institution in their first scheduled period of enrollment for which the student has been charged. [New York, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``First-time student'' should be defined as a student enrolled for the first time at the institution in an eligible program. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The regulations should not determine a minimum program length to consider a student as attending at a prior institution or current institution. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;If a student enrolls for any period of time, drops out, then returns, they are not considered enrolled for the first time for the second enrollment period. If standard terms of enrollment are used, the student should be considered first time for the first term of enrollment for which they were charged. If standard terms are not used, the lesser of 60 percent of the first academic year or 60 percent of the program should be used. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. How should the term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' be defined?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The term ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be left to the institution to define based on scheduled time. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined based on full charges for the increment of the enrollment period defined by the institution as the ``period for charges.'' [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length of time for which the student was initially charged. For example, for an institution that charges by semester, the first semester the student was charged is the relevant period of enrollment. [Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as a minimum of one academic term, quarter, or semester or, for clock hour institutions, as a minimum of one-third of an academic year. If the institution charges for a full program, the length of the program should be defined as an academic period. [Kansas City]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The ``period of enrollment for which the student has been charged'' should be defined as the length for which a student would be eligible to receive Title IV assistance. [San Francisco]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Should the regulations address specific requirements regarding the treatment of equipment or book costs to be included in pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  refund calculations?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Books and supplies should be excluded from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  calculation. Only fees for services rendered over time, e.g., lab fees, should be included. Exclude ``up front'' fees (application) and books, supplies, and equipment up to a certain dollar amount. There is a difference between a service fee and a purchase of supplies, equipment, and books. Purchases should be excluded. [New York]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The regulations should state that equipment, books supplies, telephone charges, parking fines, etc. should not be included with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  requirements. [Kansas City, Atlanta]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Charges for equipment, instructional materials, etc. should not be included in the calculation for refund purposes if separately charged by the institution.

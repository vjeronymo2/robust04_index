			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / International Company News: Canberra revises plans for sell-off THE Australian government has been forced to redraw its privatisation programme. The change will delay the flotation of Qantas, the Australian airline, and see the flotation of a ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1bn) tranche of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by September or October this year. Mr Ralph Willis, finance minister, said the flotation of 75 per cent of Qantas has been deferred to late 1994. Mr Willis said the decision on Qantas followed advice from the government's financial consultants and Mr Gary Pemberton, Qantas chairman. Late last year British Airways topped offers from several international competitors and paid ADollars 665m for a 25 per cent stake in the air-line. Qantas is also still digesting the acquisition of Australian Airlines, its domestic carrier subsidiary, and is carrying a debt ratio in the order of 70:30. To replace proceeds from the Qantas sale the government will offer a further 19 per cent stake in the Commonwealth Bank to the market in the current June year, rather than next year as earlier planned. The bank is already 30 per cent publicly owned following the ADollars 1.3bn flotation in 1991 which effectively began the government's privatisation programme. Government policy limits private ownership of the bank to 49 per cent, although the opposition favours a 100 per cent sale. Analysts said the government was likely to move ahead with the float soon after the bank announces its next annual results in September. The bank's shares reacted positively to the news on Australian share markets yesterday, reaching a record high of ADollars 8.76, valuing a 19 per cent stake at about ADollars 1.45b. Because of the size of the proposed flotation, analysts believe it is likely to be broken into components, probably including an entitlement issue to existing shareholders. The changed timetable for the privatisations confirms recent speculation that the Qantas flotation would be delayed, mainly because of the poor state of the world airline industry. The new privatisation timetable will increase the government's task in reducing its growing budget deficit. Privatisations have begun to assume a more important place in government budgeting, although the Labor Party still favours a much slower pace than the opposition Liberal National coalition. Other government-owned assets such as the Australian National Line, the shipping company, and Australian Defence Industries, the defence contractor, are also under consideration for sale. Mr Willis said the Qantas postponement meant the budget deficit starting point for 1993/94 would rise by between ADollars 500m and ADollars 750m. He said the government had estimated that the Qantas float would contribute about ADollars 2bn to receipts. The treasurer, Mr John Dawkins, has previously indicated that without policy changes the starting point for the budget deficit for 1993/94 would be about ADollars 18bn. Lex, Page 22</p>

Finance Minister  Muhammad Khalid al-Mahayini and the secretary of the Libyan  Relations Bureau in Damascus attended.    During the meeting, Bayt-al-Mal conveyed the greetings of  'Abd-al-Majid al-Qu'ud, secretary of the General People's  Congress, to Mahmud al-Zu'bi, who also asked the LIbyan official  to convey his greetings to al-Qu'ud. Talks dealt with relations  between the two fraternal countries.    Al-Zu'bi then received Jack Dyuf, director general of the  Food and Agriculture organization [FAO] and the delegation  accompanying him. The meeting was attended by As'ad Mustafa,  minister of agriculture and agrarian reform. During the  meeting, they discussed the FAO's role and activities in Syria.    Dr. Jack Dyuf arrived in Damascus this morning on a two-day  visit to Syria. He was received at Damascus International  Airport by As'ad Mustafa, minister of agriculture and agrarian  reform, the minister's assistant, senior ministry officials, and  the FAO representative in Damascus.    In a statement to SANA correspondent, Dyuf expressed his  happiness over visiting Damascus. He said: I am sure you know  that our organization's council will meet at the end of this  month to discuss changes in the organization and its working  program, as well as some new proposals. Therefore, it was  necessary for me to pay cordial visits to several friendly  countries, like Syria, which are playing an important role and  to contact these countries' governments to discuss the final  proposals to be made during the organization's upcoming meetings.    This is my first visit to this country after I assumed my  position in the organization, and I hope the visit will give me  a chance to meet with officials in the Syrian Government to  thank them for their contributions to the organization.</p>

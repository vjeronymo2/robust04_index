			<p><P> June 5, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHERN PUSH FUELS GATEWAY;  </P> <P> EXPANSION: THE BURBANK TITLE COMPANY IS AMONG THOSE EXPANDING BEYOND LOS  ANGELES TO INCREASE BUSINESS.  </P> <P> Title insurance -- now there's an unsexy business. Even Norman (Spike)  Burlingame, who with Martin S. Evans runs Gateway Title Co. in Burbank,  concedes that most customers view title insurance "as a necessary evil."  </P> <P> But Evans and Burlingame aren't after glamour, they're after growth. And in the  nine years since they bought a then-dormant Gateway, they've managed to keep  the company growing in a hotly competitive title industry that serves Southern  California's enormous real estate market.  </P> <P> The revenue of privately held Gateway, which the pair bought with $450,000  after both left Safeco Title Insurance Co., reached $38.5 million last year and  should climb to $50 million in 1990, they said. They also are shooting for $100  million in revenue by 1995.  </P> <P> Gateway, in fact, is one of several local title companies that are expanding  beyond their back yards. A Gateway neighbor, World Title Co. in Burbank, now  operates 11 offices in seven counties, expects $40 million in revenue this year  and plans to move into the Antelope and San Joaquin valleys, said World  President Michael Lowther.  </P> <P> "Gateway reflects the emergence of a more aggressive style" of title companies  "by virtue of expanding into new markets," said Lawrence Green, executive vice  president of the California Land Title Assn., the industry's statewide trade  group.  </P> <P> For a fee, title companies such as Gateway guarantee titles to real estate when  the property changes hands, or when someone borrows money using the property as  collateral. When someone buys a house, for instance, the title company makes  sure that no one else has any right to the property, such as a lien or right of  way.  </P> <P> If later it turns out that the title company erred, and someone does have a  right to the property, the title company is liable for reimbursing the person  to whom it originally sold the title insurance. The exact amount is usually  negotiated, and most policies have a cap that limits the dollar amount of  claims, Evans said.  </P> <P> Banks and other lenders in California, to protect their investment, almost  always require title insurance before funding a mortgage loan, he said. There  are about a dozen major title insurers that operate nationwide, and thousands  of title agencies, such as Gateway, that sell and service policies actually  underwritten by the insurers. Gateway's main underwriter, for example, is  Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Co., a unit of financier Saul Steinberg's  Reliance Group Holdings Inc.  </P> <P> Some title companies are focusing their expansion on such burgeoning real  estate markets as the Antelope Valley, the Riverside/San Bernardino area and  north San Diego, where they can fight for business with fewer rivals than in  Los Angeles County, where nearly 30 competitors vie for market share.  </P> <P> A good part of Gateway's expansion will come from its planned march into  Northern California, a move that will include acquisitions. Currently pending  is Gateway's purchase of American Title Insurance Co. in Santa Clara County,  and once completed, Gateway will have 770 employees spread over 16 offices in  seven counties.  </P> <P> There are other reasons for Gateway's growth: the area's strong real estate  market and inflation, both of which keep lifting property values and hence  Gateway's fees, which generally are set as a percentage of value of the  property involved. California alone accounts for about a quarter of the  nation's $4-billion title business.  </P> <P> And there's another factor that doesn't hurt Gateway. Fred Sands, whose Fred  Sands Realtors is one of the biggest real estate agencies in Los Angeles, is  one of Gateway's two outside stockholders and naturally a customer, although  Sands said his firm accounts for less than 5% of Gateway's business. (Evans,  58, and Burlingame, 49, together own the controlling stake in Gateway.)  </P> <P> Still, Sands asserted that Gateway "is the best title company in L.A." because  of its service. "We've had occasions where agents have called them at night and  end up talking to the president because they have a problem," he said.  </P> <P> Burlingame said Gateway wants to expand because "there's a vibrancy created  with growth that translates to people's attitudes in the company. The monetary  rewards speak for themselves," he said without disclosing specific earnings  figures. "If you can make 5% or 10% profit on $100 million versus 5% or 10% on  $10 million, it's better for the stockholders, too."  </P> <P> Title executives agree there's not much difference between companies in terms  of prices, which must be approved by state insurance regulators and typically  are set as a percentage of the value of the property involved.  </P> <P> "It's a pretty narrow spectrum" of prices between companies, Burlingame said.  </P> <P> The trick in generating business, he and Evans said, is in having top-rate  personnel, client relationships and service -- as mundane as that sounds.  Gateway salespeople hound real estate agents, escrow companies, lenders and  real estate lawyers trying to get Gateway involved in their deals.  </P> <P> "We're not a product that's differentiated from our competitors', except  insofar as the people we have are better," Evans said.  </P> <P> Sands, the real estate chief, agreed. "That's all a title company can offer is  service," he said.  </P> <P> Gateway's service has its competitors taking notice. Lawrence White, executive  vice president of First American Title Insurance, a unit of First American  Financial Corp. in Santa Ana and one of the nation's biggest title insurers,  said Gateway has "good people and they know the markets they're in."  </P> <P> But like all title companies, Gateway must watch the kind of business it  writes. Along with California's swelling real estate market has come an  increase in title fraud and forgery, which can increase a title company's  losses. Evans estimated that Gateway pays out about $7.50 in claims for every  $100 that its title policies generate in revenue. The California Land Title  Assn. said the average in the state is $10 or more.  </P> <P> Gateway's record also has attracted potential suitors. Evans said the company  gets about a phone call per month from would-be buyers, but that Gateway turns  them away. However, the company does plan to consider issuing its first stock  to the public during the next year, to raise cash for -- what else --  expansion.  </P> <P> Said Evans: "The major counties in the north would all be possible targets for  us down the line."  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> GREEK BANK WORKERS ON STRIKE  </P> <P> Bank employees went on strike today throughout Greece to press demands for a  new collective agreement to include salary raises linked to inflation.  </P> <P> The 24-hour walkout at private and state-controlled banks was called by the  50,000-member Greek Federation of Bank Employees after the socialist government  declined to discuss its demands.  </P> <P> "The walkout was a complete success. We haven't had such participation in  years," said union President Theocharis Papamargaris.  </P> <P> The union demands that wage increases linked to the inflation rate be  calculated on an employee's overall salary, which includes fringe benefits, and  not on their base pay. Inflation last year reached 14%.  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Industrial output on the rise West German industrial production gathered pace again in September after falling during August, according to provisional data from the economics ministry. Although preliminary calculations showed output fell a seasonally adjusted 0.2 per cent during the month, after a revised 2.6 per cent month-on-month drop in August, the ministry said it expected the latest figures to be revised upwards by 'a good two percentage points'. This implied production increased by more than 3 per cent in comparison with September last year, according to independent analysts. James Capel in London said gross domestic product in the region appeared to have grown only 0.6 per cent in the third quarter after 1 per cent in the second. However, other data on business confidence and economic developments in export markets elsewhere in Europe suggested the apparent weakening was merely a lull within a strong underlying growth trend. The Greek unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in September against 6.7 per cent the previous month and 5.9 per cent a year earlier. Romania's trade surplus fell to Dollars 75.9m in September from Dollars 92.6m in August. Unemployment rose to 10.8 per cent.</p>

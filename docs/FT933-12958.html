			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Utilities strong Utilities were seized as a port in the storm as nervous investors grew increasingly concerned about prospects for economic recovery and retreated into defensive stocks. The regional electricity companies made the most powerful gains, with the stocks boasting attractive yields and trading on the back of a strong per-formance on the previous day when 10 of them went ex-dividend. Such a strong showing increased interest in 'recs' and fuelled a squeeze on the stocks. One analyst forecast the recs' fortunes to ride the wave for a little while to come, stressing that their popularity is underpinned by sound finances. 'There is certainly no reason to be selling them.' Eastern Electricity moved up 9 to 484p, East Midlands made the same gain and ended at 466p and London put on 11 at 494p, while Northern advanced 13 to 523p, South Wales 12 to 553p and Yorkshire 14 to 522p. Water utilities bounced against the market trend in more modest fashion. Anglian rose 4 to 475p, North West gained 4 at 467p, Southern moved up 7 to 490p and Yorkshire ended 5 higher at 491p.</p>

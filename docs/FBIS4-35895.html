			<p>BFN     [Text] Nicosia, 16 May -- The specialized economic magazine  MIDDLE EAST ECONOMIC SURVEY (MEES) which is published in Nicosia  reported today, Monday, that an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation  will visit Italy and the Ukraine at the end of this month.    The magazine explained that the visit of this delegation,  which will be headed by Oil Ministry Under Secretary Taha Humud,  to Rome falls within the framework of the contacts which began  several months ago between Agip and the Iraqi authorities in  order to reach agreements on sharing the productions of  al-Nasiriyah, al-Halfayah, and Dujaylah oilfields in southern  Iraq.    The magazine added that the delegation's visit to the  Ukraine  will center on the possibility of importing oil industry  machinery from that country in exchange for Iraqi oil following  the lifting of the blockade on Iraq.    The magazine pointed out that the talks with the Ukrainian  oil authorities will also deal with the possibility of Ukrainian  companies sharing production in and developing al-Yamamah region  in the vast western al-Qurnah oilfield.    Last April, an Iraqi Oil Ministry delegation left for Moscow  to discuss the development of Mushrif region which is also  situated in the western al-Qurnah Oilfield.    Iraq held contacts with a number of European countries  several weeks ago in preparation for the period which will  follow the oil embargo imposed by the United Nations.    An iraqi Oil Ministry delegation also visited Paris early  last March in response to an invitation by the two major French  petroleum companies Elf-Aquitane and Total.</p>

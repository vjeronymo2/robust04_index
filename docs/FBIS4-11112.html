			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Buenos Aires, 20 Apr (NA) -- Despite strong  opposition, the fishing treaty with the EEC was ratified this  evening in the Chamber of Deputies. According to the ruling  party, the fishing agreement will be instrumental in boosting  our country's export revenues by $121 million.    This and other arguments brandished from the floor by Deputy  Florencio Acenolaza (PJ) [Justicialist deputy for Tucuman  Province] were vigorously refuted by speakers representing the  other blocs, during a heated debate that went beyond the  framework of the said agreement.    The blocs opposing the ratification of the agreement  insisted  that it be returned to the committee for further study, but the  ruling majority managed to defeat this motion.    The treaty, which was signed in 1992, was ratified with the  opposition of the Radical Civic Union, the Socialist Party, the  Grand Front, the Movement for Independence and Dignity, and the  Democratic Progressive Party. Justicialist Deputy Rafael Flores  said that "this agreement is not a panacea for the fishing  industry, and its benefits will depend on the controls we manage  to implement." [passage omitted]    The ratification was carried by 119 votes in favor, 65  against, and two abstentions. The ruling party welcomed the  result with applause.</p>

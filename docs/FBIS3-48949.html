			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee  considers that the Russian Zhirinovskiy phenomenon does not  represent a danger for Hungary. The chairman of the committee,  who is a member of the Socialist Party [HSP], evaluated the  deputies' work of the year at a news conference. Levente Sukosd  reports:    [Sukosd] In the past year the committee operated as a forum  for creating political consensus and with good result, said  Laszlo Kovacs of the HSP, chairman of the committee. [passage  omitted]    In reply to a question, Laszlo Kovacs said that the  committee  analyzed the Russian situation not long ago, but no joint stand  was formulated. The chairman said that in his view, the  Zhirinovskiy phenomenon did not mean danger for Hungary at  present, for a strong presidential power prevails in Russia.  However, we cannot be optimistic in the long term he added, for  it is not only the grave economic condition which caused the  present situation but also the increasing nostalgia in the  Russian army and the population for Russia's former superpower  role.    As for the Hungarians living beyond the border and Hungarian  foreign policy in general, the committee chairman said that more  Hungarian initiatives and gestures will be necessary in the  future and better care will have to be taken also that  statements, which could be misunderstood, should not be uttered  by members of the government in connection with the Hungarian  minority beyond the border. Finally, Laszlo Kovacs also  considered it harmful that, according to the decision of the  present legislature, the Hungarian minorities will not have  direct parliamentary representation.</p>

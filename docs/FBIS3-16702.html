Among the  priorities are broad involvement of the population in the  process of reforms by means of developing the securities market,  creating public joint-stock companies with a reduction in the  proportion of shares belonging to the state, and forming markets  for real estate and means of production.    Another priority is the demonopolization of production and  control structures and the attraction of foreign investments by  holding tenders, auctions, investment auctions, and direct sale  of property. The decree stresses the need for state support for  privatized enterprises.    For public joint-stock companies in which the state retains  its share, it is envisioned to have blocs of shares belonging to  the state, to the work force, to foreign partners, and free  selling on stock exchanges and securities markets, including  those abroad.</p>

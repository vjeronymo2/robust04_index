			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Council members offer resignations to Patten THE non-government members of Hong Kong's executive council, or cabinet, have offered their resignations to Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, writes Simon Holberton. Mr Patten said yesterday that Baroness Dunn, the senior non-official member of the cabinet, had written to him on July 13 saying that she and other non-official members would be happy to put their offices at his disposal. There are currently 10 unofficial and four official members of the executive council. The 'unofficials' include Baroness Dunn, a leading conservative, Mr William Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, and Mr Andrew Wong, a university professor and the only directly-elected member of the cabinet. Mr Patten said he had taken no decision on the offer, other than to welcome the 'generosity of spirit' in which it was made. But he is widely expected to reshape his cabinet around the time that he opens the autumn session of colony's legislature on October 7. Since his arrival Mr Patten has stressed that his government will be 'executive-led' and that he expects to take the initiative in winning support for his policies among local legislators.</p>

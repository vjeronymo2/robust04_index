			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / International Company News: Novo Nordisk falls 6% despite sales growth Pre-tax profits at Novo Nordisk, the Danish pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes producer, fell by 6 per cent to DKr1.24bn (Dollars 211m) from DKr1.32bn in the first nine months of the year. The group's net profits fell 7 per cent to DKr 934m from DKr1bn. Earnings per share were reduced to DKr24.50 from DKr26.66 last year. But the group forecast that pre-tax earnings for the full year will be DKr1.92bn-DKr1.97bn, compared with DKr1.86bn last year. A 12 per cent increase in sales so far this year was eclipsed by a faster growth in costs, which reflected expansion in production capacity, the group said. Sales were up to DKr9.94bn from DKr8.84bn, including a rise of 13 per cent by the insulin-producing healthcare division to DKr6.69bn and by 11 per cent to DKr2.64bn in the industrial enzymes. Costs rose 16 per cent to DKr9.09bn, including tax and net financial items, with the latter increasing DKr31m to DKr135m. Novo said the rise in costs was caused primarily by the expansion of its international production and sales facilities, with five new factories either starting up shortly or not yet contributing significantly to sales. The group said it had problems meeting demand for some types of insulin, used for diabetic care, in the US as a result of a temporary closure of a Danish plant. In addition, there had been delays in bringing a new plant in the US on stream due to US Food and Drug Administration requirements. Novo Nordisk said the Danish plant was producing again and the problems at the US plant, which is subject of a routine inspection by the FDA, have been solved.</p>

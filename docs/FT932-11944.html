			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: Survival of the Travelcard after bus deregulation Sir, Your transport correspondent recently reported on the proceedings of the cross-party Commons transport committee indicating that the London Travelcard was likely to disappear after the planned deregulation of London bus services. This disappointing prospect compares unfavourably with the position in Tyne and Wear where the Travelcard scheme has survived and developed since bus services were de-regulated in 1986. The Travelcard scheme in Tyne and Wear is open to all 30 or so public transport operators (bus, rail, metro and ferry) and a revenue sharing arrangement is in place. The key features of the Travelcard scheme in Tyne and Wear are that it has a commercially sound basis of sharing and that it is operated by a company owned by the local public transport operators. G E Hutchinson, chairman and managing director, Busways Travel Services, Manors, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE1 2EL</p>

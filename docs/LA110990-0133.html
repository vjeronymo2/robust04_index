			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> PASSING THE BUCKS: The grand jury testimony released last week reveals a new  side to the way Charles Keating handled money. . . . An employee testified that  soon after Keating bought now-defunct Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, he gathered  employees at the Irvine office to present bonuses. Keating walked in with about  $30,000 in $100 and $50 bills and threw the cash into the air. . . . "It was  later divided up, and each was given $100," the employee testified. . . .  Keating's lawyers are back in court today to ask that securities fraud charges  against him be dismissed. Laura Michaelis and Dallas M. Jackson  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The provincial federation of the General Union of  Algerian Workers [UGTA] in Biskra held its fifth congress at the  university center at the end of this week with the attendance of  the UGTA secretary general Abdelhak Benhamouda and members of  the national secretariat. The congress is being held with a  view to appointing the provincial executive committee and the  secretariat of the federation. Abdelkarim Benmoufaq reports:    [Benmoufaq] The congress was opened by UGTA secretary  general  Abdelhak Benhamouda. He delivered a lengthy speech on the  occasion, in which he dealt with workers' difficulties in light  of the fall in purchasing power. Soaring prices and a  deterioration in the country's general situation, he said, has  negatively effected workers and is a threat to their future.    In another development, he pointed out the plots hatched to  harm the UGTA because it had worried many people because UGTA  had been able to absorb and bring together workers and bring  about a qualitative development on many issues that concerned  the workers' stratum. He also stressed UGTA's determination to  continue a real and effective trade union struggle now to try to  protect workers' interests and defend their rights. [passage  omitted]</p>

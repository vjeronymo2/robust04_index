			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / IG Metall moves closer to strikes EASTERN Germany's steel and electrical sectors yesterday moved closer to an all-out strike after IG Metall, the country's powerful engineering union, decided to hold ballots in support of higher pay claims. The ballots, to be held between April 26 and 28, will take place throughout the region's steel industry. However, ballots for the metal and electrical sector will be restricted to the northern state of Mecklenberg-Western Pomerania, which specialises in shipbuilding, and the eastern state of Saxony, the core of eastern Germany's heavy industry. 'These ballots are a first step,' said Ms Dagmar Opoczynski, a spokesperson for IG Metall. She added: 'We will have to see if we obtain 75 per cent of the vote of all IG Metall members in these factories. If we do, we could hold strikes on May 3.' IG Metall's membership in eastern Germany has fallen sharply to 400,000 from 760,000 in 1991. Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, president of Gesamtmetall, the national electrical and metal employers' association, claimed IG Metall was committing 'economic suicide' by balloting for an all-out strike in eastern Germany. The threatened strike is intended to put pressure on the employers to rescind their decision to end a contract aimed at equalising eastern and western wages by April 1994. Wages in eastern Germany's metal, electrical and steel industry are about 70 per cent of western German levels, but productivity in the eastern states is only 30 per cent of that in the west. Under the March 1991 contract, wages in the steel sector were due to rise by 21 per cent, beginning April 1, and for the electrical and metal sectors by 26 per cent. This would have brought eastern German wages up to between 80 and 82 per cent of western German levels respectively. But Gesamtmetall and Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, its steel counterpart, last month legally invoked a special 'revision clause' in the contract, signed by the employers, IG Metall, and eastern German factory managers. That enabled either side in the agreement to challenge the contract because of changed economic expectations. The employers have since recommended wage increases of 9 per cent, in line with the rate of inflation in eastern Germany. But IG Metall, desperate to boost its support in eastern Germany, say workers there have the right to income parity next year as they are already paying western German prices for most goods. Union officials also believe that the employers want to use the economic climate in eastern Germany as a means to break the collective bargaining system in the region and later in western Germany. Gesamtmetall yesterday again denied any hidden agenda. 'The collective bargaining system in the west will not be changed,' the association's president said. Economists have also warned that eastern German industry has little chance of becoming competitive if it fails to widen the gap between output per head and labour costs. Union officials, however, are increasingly aware of the economic consequences of such a strike. 'We do not want to harm the Mittelstand, or small and medium-sized private enterprises,' said Mr Michael Bohm, IG Metall's spokesman in Berlin. 'But we must fight for the basic wage in the east,' he said.</p>

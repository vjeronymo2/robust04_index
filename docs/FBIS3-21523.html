Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"]    [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have  been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip  out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers  [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is  what the draft first stage of the state program for the  destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local  residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long  time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new  installations with this kind of specialism.    Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993.  According to the Convention, the first installation for the  destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years  at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still  has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical  weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances  from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the  arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast.    The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225  tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are  stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that  have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad  tankers, pose a potential danger.    The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a  factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out  at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive  matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the  top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology  [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is  located.    Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's  director, said that several technologies have been developed for  the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy.  Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas,  a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and  its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most  preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be  recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in  microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals.  In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only  expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also  considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents  into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently  produce.    This technology can also be used to recycle  arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent  produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany  from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000  tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing  range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian  adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public  but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the  possible environmental contamination from these stocks.    It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular  problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is  only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal  and recycling installations that are holding things up.  However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical  weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas  right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for  the residents of the area since the environmental background  here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for  instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow  flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times  in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to  three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which  contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.  People's disquiet is intensified by the constant rumors about  the danger of radiological contamination of the area from the  Balakovo nuclear electric power station 50 km from Volsk. Add to  that atmospheric discharges by Balakovo's big chemical giants  and you will understand the public concern, which is threatening  to develop into an organized protest against the siting of  chemical weapons destruction facilities bin these areas.    This disquiet is intensified by conjecture and speculation  due to the utter secrecy surrounding the facilities at Shikhany.  I visited them, spoke with scientists, and saw that there is no  intention of building any more production units here, the former  technology used for the synthesis of chemical agents has merely  been reversed. According to the findings of a special  environmental and medical monitoring laboratory, the air in  Shikhany is considerably cleaner than in Volsk, people live  longer and have fewer illnesses.    Choosing the technology is only part of the problem and by  no  means the most important part. Social and environmental  questions are the main thing. Mikhail Yakovlev, Saratov Oblast  Administration department head, briefed me on a Russian  Government draft decree that the residents of the oblast have  prepared on their own initiative. It enshrines their immediate  demands without whose fulfillment the chemical weapons  destruction process cannot be started. During the first quarter  of this year the Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical  and Biological Weapons under the Russian President and the  Ministry of Defense, in conjunction with other departments, are  asked to define a concept, prepare drafts of a basic law and a  number of other legislative acts designed to form the legal base  for the practical implementation of the Paris Convention, and  guarantee safety, health, and social protection. According to  civilized norms, the facilities for the storage and destruction  of chemical weapons and the population centers around them  should be given special status with all the concomitant  guarantees, as is the case in the United States for instance.    The demand for regular environmental and medical monitoring  is also natural. During the first stage, before the  experimental installations begin work, the intention is to study  the state of the environment and carry out a comprehensive  screening process involving residents in Volskiy and  Krasnopartizanskiy Rayons, which include Shikhany and Gornyy, in  order to determine the consequences of the storage and testing  of chemical weapons on the environment and the population's  health.    The importance of the social and environmental aspects can  be  judged from the funding structure, where expenditure on  monitoring and the social everyday sphere in Shikhany, Volsk,  and Gornyy amounts to 67 billion rubles [R] of the R72 billion  that the oblast administration deems it necessary to allocate  for the entire first phase of the program, a phase culminating  in the construction and testing of the experimental-industrial  facility for the destruction and recycling of chemical agents  and the creation of the requisite support infrastructure.    Nadezhda Saratovtseva, head of administration of the  settlement of Shikhany, has a better knowledge of the whole set  of problems than anyone else. She takes part without fail in  all the meetings and talks on this topic and has even addressed  parliamentary hearings.    "The state program for the destruction of chemical weapons  has been in the process of being written and draft laws have  been in the process of being harmonized since 1989," she said.  "Presidents, governments, and parliaments have come and gone,  but still there are no laws and no program. There is no concept  and no funding. The SIOST has not been paid for three months  and that unique institution is on the verge of stoppages. The  social sphere -- the burden of which is borne entirely by the  institute -- is going to pieces."    Judging by the center's unhurried approach, one can  confidently assume today that the schedule proposed by the  Saratov administration in its draft government decree will also  be disrupted.    "You produced the chemical weapons, you destroy them,"  Saratovtseva was told by one highly-placed Moscow official.    Meanwhile the chemical bomb planted almost on the very banks  of the Volga may spring its surprise at any minute. In that  case it would not only be the residents of Saratov on the Volga  who would suffer.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Stock market tail wags vigorously: The achievements of Liffe, 10 years old today As dealers in the trading pits of Liffe celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of futures and options on the FT-SE 100 stock market index today, they may find it hard to believe that these instruments, which now dominate UK equities trading, were once considered mere curiosities. When they were introduced they were the first stock index futures in Europe. These days, such derivative instruments are found not only in Europe but also in the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America. The value of shares traded every day through these contracts on Liffe, London's futures exchange, now represents 250 per cent of turnover on the London Stock Exchange. Average daily volume in the first quarter of this year reached more than 43,000 contracts, representing a daily turnover of almost Pounds 3bn. Price changes in the stock market are frequently led by the futures market. For some observers, this is a clear sign that the tail is wagging the dog. Indeed, regulators have become increasingly concerned that the growing use of derivatives is contributing to market volatility. However, there is little concrete evidence to show that derivatives destabilise markets. Indeed a study in December by Mr Gary Robinson of the Bank of England of the effect of derivatives on the London stock market concluded that 'futures trading has been associated with a significant reduction in volatility - around 17 per cent'. Mr Nick Durlacher, Liffe's chairman, argues that the fact that almost all significant changes of direction in share prices are now signalled in stock index futures is a reflection of the greater speed and efficiency of the futures market. Certainly, lower dealing - as much as 20 times lower than on the London Stock Exchange - has helped to attract a broad range of market participants. In addition, the past 10 years have brought a shift in the approach of fund managers towards picking the right market, rather than the right stock. They have found that the quickest and safest way to change the weightings of their investment portfolios was by buying or selling stock index futures. Mr John Millers, of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull's derivatives desk, believes that the growth of the futures market is also a function of the electronic revolution in the financial markets. The FT-SE index has been closely followed by traders since it began to be calculated electronically in 1986, and the advent of increasingly powerful computers has given rise to more sophisticated trading techniques, using complex models to value derivative instruments. The strong growth in FT-SE futures volume may be far from over. There are still many potential users - such as the funds run by UK charities  - that are barred from the market by their trustees. Moreover, the growth of FT-SE futures volume has actually trailed the increases in volume recorded by Liffe's bond futures. In the US stock market, futures turnover is now 10 times - rather than 2 1/2 times - the size of the cash market.</p>

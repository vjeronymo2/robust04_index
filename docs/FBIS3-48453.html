Mady Ndao who had visited Korea in the capacity of special  envoy of the Senegalese president said he keenly felt that His  Excellency Kim Chong-il is the greatest thinker and theoretician  of the present era and ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant  commander with literary and military accomplishments.    "His Excellency Kim Chong-il has steadily developed and  enriched the immortal chuche idea and strengthened and developed  the Korean People's Army into steel-like Armed Forces that can  defeat any aggressors at one blow," he noted.    Alhaji Adam Bukhari Ziblim, general secretary of the  National  Convention Party of Ghana, had this to say:    "The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great man  possessed of courage, tested organising ability and iron will.  I am struck with admiration at his precious feats and  energetic guidance in strengthening the Korean People's Army  into matchless ranks and building many monumental edifices.    "The looks of the Korean people who are marching forward in  soaring spirits, full of confidence in victory, convinced me  that no one on earth is a match for this people."    Toyohide Araki who led a delegation of the Japan Society for  the Study of Kimilsongism is quoted as saying:    "Dear Comrade Kim Chong-il is a great man of the great men  with both literary and military accomplishments.    "The world is unstinting in praising him for humbling the  U.S. imperialists."    P. Mabiti, an MP of Tanzania, said he was struck with wonder  at the phenomenal development of Korea.    "The proud achievements gained by Korea are all a shining  fruition of the independent politics of the great leader Comrade  Kim Il-song and the tested, veteran leadership of the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with literary and military  accomplishments and loyalty and filial piety, who is leading the  revolutionary cause to victory with his matchless grit and  rock-firm faith," he stressed.</p>

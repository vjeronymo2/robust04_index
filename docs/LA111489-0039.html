			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS, ANGELS PLAN TALKS WITH FREE AGENT LANGSTON  </P> <P> Set to battle over free agents Mark Langston and Robin Yount in what may become  a Freeway Series of a different nature, the Dodgers and Angels begin the  process today, when Fred Claire, the Dodgers executive vice president, meets  with left-handed pitcher Langston and his agent, Arn Tellem.  </P> <P> The Angels, according to a source, have a Wednesday meeting with Langston and  Tellem.  </P> <P> Langston is believed to favor the Dodgers, Angels and San Diego Padres on the  basis of location, but bidding is expected to stretch from coast to coast, and  began Monday when the 90 players who filed for free agency were eligible to  accept offers from clubs other than their own.  </P> <P> Langston heard from only the Seattle Mariners, under new ownership since  Langston, who spent five-plus seasons there, was traded to the Montreal Expos.  </P> <P> Yount, as a center fielder who can bat leadoff, represents the solution to the  Dodgers' two most pressing needs.  </P> <P> Yount is vacationing in Hawaii. The speculation is that, at 34, he is reluctant  to leave the American League and may be interested in the Angels.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Tony DeMarco, the agent for free agent pitcher Fernando Valenzuela,  said the Dodgers have increased their offer from one year to one year and an  option for 1991, but the money in both years is still less than the $1.85  million that Valenzuela received in 1989 and far less than the three-year,  $6-million package that Valenzuela is believed to be seeking.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Bill Plaschke and Helene Elliott contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: SHE HAD LUCK OF THE IRISH -- AND PATIENCE OF A SAINT  </P> <P> The first woman named as grand marshal of New York's famed St. Patrick's Day  parade credits her selection to the luck of the Irish. "I was lucky, just  lucky. God was with me," said an ecstatic Dorothy Hayden Cudahy, who won the  post after being turned down for three straight years. Cudahy bears no ill will  toward those who, for 226 years, allowed New York's biggest parade to march  down 5th Avenue without a colleen at the helm. But she is less forgiving about  another event unfolding in New York, the arrival of Princess Diana for a  three-day visit to promote British business. Cudahy vowed to be among those  protesting British policy in Northern Ireland at a demonstration outside the  Brooklyn Academy, where Princess Diana was to attend a concert. "We would like  to inform the princess that not everybody is very happy with the royal family .  . . maybe she will go over to the North and see why we want the soldiers out of  Northern Ireland," said Cudahy, 66, known in New York as the first lady of  Irish radio for the "Irish Memories" program she has hosted on local stations  for more than 45 years.  </P> <P>  -- Over at the Statehouse in Massachusetts, a beaming Gov. Michael S. Dukakis  was handing out the cigars and accepting congratulations on the birth of his  first grandchild. Alexandra Jane Dukakis was delivered safely after a difficult  pregnancy that forced her mother, Lisa Dukakis, 33, to remain in bed for months  and abandon the presidential campaign that occupied the rest of the family for  most of 1988. The new father, John Dukakis, 30, Kitty Dukakis' son from her  first marriage, managed the Southern primaries for the Dukakis campaign.  </P> <P>  -- The New York City Corrections Department, learning that it had an  electrical engineer in its midst with the incarceration of subway gunman  Bernhard H. Goetz, has put his training to work repairing walkie-talkies and  radios used by the department. Officials report that Goetz, serving a one-year  sentence for carrying an unlicensed gun in the shooting of four teen-agers he  said were planning to rob him, is doing an excellent job. His skills reportedly  led the officials to draft Goetz for a job not normally turned over to an  inmate. His wages? Fifty cents an hour. ANN CONNORS  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 29 March (MTI) -- On March 29, the  Hungarian Foreign Ministry passed a verbal request to the Slovak  embassy in Budapest.    The Hungarian Government -- in accord with European Union  recommendations for water division, which were rejected by  Slovakia -- calls upon the Slovak Government to open bilateral  talks on a temporary water management regime immediately, the  ministry's press department informed MTI on Wednesday [30 March].    The Slovak side unilaterally diverted the Danube in 1992, to  operate the Gabcikovo power station. Since then, the main  riverbed has been supplied with much less water than before,  endangering the ecological balance of the Szigetkoz region.    The negotiations are urgent because the vegetation growth  period has already begun. The talks are also justified by  obligations which the two sides assumed in a Separate Treaty  concluded in connection with The Hague trial.    Hungary's government stressed in the communique that it is  indispensable to guarantee a considerable increase in the water  discharge to the main riverbed.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Another stumbling block for Chelsea FULHAM Football Club's announcement on Saturday that it expects to stay at its Craven Cottage ground for another season represents an awkward back pass for Chelsea Football Club, its potential landlord at Stamford Bridge in west London. Fulham's agreement to move to Stamford Bridge is regarded as crucial to Chelsea's purchase of its ground from Cabra Estates, the quoted property company. The deal involves Chelsea paying Pounds 13m cash and taking on a liability to Fulham which would have cost Cabra Pounds 8.25m. Cabra, which has about Pounds 52m debt, is anxious to have vacant possession of Craven Cottage. Fulham's directors seem willing to exchange Pounds 5m of the amount owed to them for a 125-year lease at Stamford Bridge at a peppercorn rent. But they would like the rest in cash and are concerned that the third division club will be a poor relation at Stamford Bridge, which helps to explain the flexing of negotiating muscles. With Chelsea having to find Pounds 13m to buy the ground, further cash outlay would add to the strain. This level of debt would be exceptionally high for a football club. As the plan is for Chelsea to become the mortgagee at Stamford Bridge, the value of the ground with such a lease is also an issue. The main lender is the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is carrying out a new valuation. Cabra had considered winding up Chelsea after the club failed to come up with Pounds 22.85m cash to buy the ground. Legal proceedings have been halted while the new deal is negotiated. Fulham's departure from Craven Cottage could only be delayed for one more season because of the lease. It would have to spend up to Pounds 300,000 on essential safety work to stay on even for that short period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yasuhiro Tase, editorial staff of Tokyo NIHON </F> KEIZAI SHIMBUN: "Cross-Purposes Behind Political Confusion"]    [Text] The "friends of yesterday" instantly become the  "enemies of today," when the political situation changes  dramatically.    At 1400 on 25 April, Chairman Keigo Ouchi of the Democratic  Socialist Party [DSP] was facing Masayoshi Takemura,  representative of Sakigake [Harbinger], whom he had invited by  phone to meet at "an inconspicuous place."  <H5>  Ouchi Is Becoming a Different Man </H5>   Ouchi said: "I want to cut off the Ichi-Ichi [Ichiro Ozawa,  coleader of Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party), and Yuichi  Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito] line at any cost. To do  that we must form a powerful parliamentary group that excludes  Komeito. Takashi Yonezawa, secretary general of the DSP, is  definitely leaning toward Shinseito. The only way the party can  reunite is through cooperation with Shinseito."    Takemura retorted: "Have you not cooperated with us so far  in the struggle against Shinseito? Despite this..."    To all appearances, the key mover behind the united group  called "Kaishin" [Innovation] is Ouchi. However Ouchi, together  with Chairman Tomiichi Murayama of the Social Democratic Party  of Japan [SDPJ] and Takemura, had been resolutely opposed to the  "Kaikakunokai" [Reform Group], proposed by Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa immediately following the announcement that he  intended to resign.    What was behind Ouchi's change of mind? Those close to the  DSP testify that it was a result of the struggle he had with  Yonezawa for leadership of the party. It was said Yonezawa, who  had a pivotal role in the "Ichi-Ichi line," was more influential  within the party than Ouchi, who leaned toward the SDPJ and  Sakigake.    Furthermore, Ouchi's strategy went very wrong because  Sakigake decided "to cooperate from outside the cabinet." The  DSP has a sentiment similar to hatred for the closely related  SDPJ because both were born of the same original party. As a  result, the DSP cannot work with the SDPJ.    On the evening of 22 April, Ouchi assembled Yonezawa, Kansei  Nakano, chairman of party's policy board; Hiroshi Nakai, deputy  secretary general; and Atsushi Kanda, DSP floor leader, and  revealed his idea for the formation of a "united parliamentary  group."    Immediately before the meeting and again the following day,  Ouchi had talks with Ozawa. And on 23 April, former Prime  Minister Hosokawa had a strictly confidential meeting with Ouchi.  <H5>  Resourceful Strategy of Hosokawa </H5>   It seems that Hosokawa was the star player behind the  scenes,  not the "Ichi-Ichi line." The action was taken, without doubt,  in line with what Ozawa had in mind. He wanted to form a  another new political party capable of defeating the Liberal  Democratic Party [LDP]. He seemed to recover the resourceful  wisdom traditionally inherited by members of the Hosokawa family  after he decided to step down from the premiership. Those close  to the Japan New Party [JNP] explain that the capital "H" at the  beginning of Hosokawa's name can be formed by writing in Arabic  numerals the figure 1's from "Ichi-Ichi" and then joining them  in the middle.    If the "Kaishin" concept were Ozawa's strategy, it would be  unlikely that neither Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata nor leaders of  Shinseito were unaware of it. Furthermore, Komeito, with the  exception of Ichikawa, was not told of the "Ouchi idea," from  which it was excluded.    After stepping down Hosokawa was reduced to no more than  leader of a small and shrinking political party which is  struggling to survive. Now that Hata has become prime minister,  it is no wonder Hosokawa thinks he should be at the head when a  big new group was formed.    Men who know Hosokawa well say that he is thinking of  reentering the political scene in much the same way as his  maternal grandfather, former Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe.  Hosokawa once described Hata as a man without the faintest idea  of what a state is and should be, and he is assumed to believe  that Hata cannot remain in government for very long.    Just as in the old saying, "even a worm will turn," the SDPJ  was furious. Even former SDPJ Secretary General Hirotaka  Akamatsu, reputed to be comparatively close to Ozawa, did not  conceal his anger when he said: "This is a matter of faith and  I cannot associate with him any more in ordinary war."    At any rate, a clear impression has been left that things  were pushed through too hastily. Former Prime Minister Noboru  Takeshita, who now watches transitional politics from the  opposition side, expressed his view: "After his illness, Mr.  Ozawa's personality has changed."    As expected, though, the politicking that took place was  guided by the hand of Ozawa. Judging from various events, the  basis of Ozawa's strategy seems to be 1) to induce the LDP and  the SDPJ each to split to bring about political realignment and  2) to organize a large political party with future amendments to  the Constitution in mind.    To achieve this scenario he first planned to "win over  Michio  Watanabe by promising him the post of minister of finance with  the rank of deputy prime minister, to push through budget  deliberations in the Diet, and to let the Hosokawa cabinet step  down to be succeeded by a Watanabe cabinet after the budget bill  was passed." Ozawa conveyed this idea directly to Watanabe at  several of their meetings.    This scenario went wrong because Hosokawa threw his cabinet  away. Despite this, Watanabe believed that the exit of the  Hosokawa cabinet would accelerate the scenario -- in other words  -- would lead to the birth of the "Watanabe cabinet." However,  Watanabe only became confused by the turn of events, first  announcing he was "seceding from the LDP" and then "retracting  his intention to leave the LDP."  <H5>  Yamaguchi's Role as Director </H5>   It was Toshio Yamaguchi who, from the wings, directed the ad  lib performance of the whole cast of leading and supporting  actors. "Kaikaku" and "Kaishin" are the names of groups  mentioned in a proposal drawn up by Yamaguchi to form a unified  group.    The leading actors, however, had never considered the  possibility of the SDPJ dropping out of the coalition  government. They must have held the SDPJ in very low regard to  think it would have no choice but to follow the other partners.  People close to the SDPJ say the party finds the thought of  being ranked "below" the DSP as unbearable. Akamatsu points out  that the erstwhile partners failed because "they had too little  knowledge of the SDPJ."    It was said that Ouchi, in the course of launching the idea  of a unified group, succeeded in getting commitments from Ozawa  and his colleagues that "the DSP will get two ministerial posts,  one major and one minor." It was presumed he wanted to regain  power by accomplishing what Yonezawa had been unable to do.    It was a mixture of strategy and Machiavellianism aimed at  achieving survival. Nobody knows who to blame, the deceivers or  the deceived. The confused political scene is becoming more  complicated as rainbow-colored expectations are woven into the  space between the warp of ideals and the woof of party lines.</p>

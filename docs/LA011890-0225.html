			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> LOTTERY SWEETENS THE POT, ADDS $10 MILLION FOR SATURDAY'S DRAW  </P> <P> A surprise bonus prize will push Saturday's jackpot in the California Lottery's  Lotto 6-49 game to a guaranteed $30 million, lottery officials said today.  </P> <P> "This is the new decade kickoff -- off with a bang," said lottery spokeswoman  Joanne McNabb.  </P> <P> No one correctly guessed all six numbers in Wednesday's drawing, leaving the  $7.6-million grand prize unclaimed. Typically, the jackpot in the next drawing  would have jumped to about $15 million.  </P> <P> Lottery officials announced earlier this month that they would augment the  grand prize by $10 million some time in January.  </P> <P> "This is it," McNabb said. "This is a surprise. . . . This is the first time  we've had a special lotto jackpot bonus. It may not be the last."  </P> <P> Lottery statisticians expect increased sales to boost the jackpot another $5  million to the $30-million total.  </P></p>

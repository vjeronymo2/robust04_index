			<p>BFN     [Text] The Guizhou Provincial CPC Committee held a  Standing Committee meeting yesterday morning to listen to a  report on the implementation of the comprehensive plan for the  opening up to the outside world of the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong  Nationalities Autonomous Prefecture. Standing Committee members  of the provincial party committee, such as [provincial party  Secretary ] Liu Fangren, Wang Siqi, (Wang Guanxian), Yuan  Ronggui, (Li Wanru), (Wang Shouqi), Xia Guohua, (Huang Yao), and  (Hu Jiansheng) attended the meeting. Attending the meeting as  nonvoting delegates were Long Zhiyi, chairman of the provincial  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, Yu Zhonggui, political commissar of the provincial  military command, Vice Governors (Gong Xianrong) and (Mo  Shiren), and persons in charge of the provincial planning  commission, the provincial nationalities affairs commission, the  provincial science and technology commission, the provincial  commission for restructuring the economy, and other departments  for overall management.    In January, approved by the State Nationalities Affairs  Commission and the State Commission for Restructuring Economy,  the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Nationalities Autonomous  Prefecture was slated as the nation's first national autonomous  region experimental zone for reform and opening up to the  outside world to probe the path of accelerating national  autonomous region reform, opening up to the outside world, and  economic development, and of being the first to establish a  socialist market economic structure.    Prefectural Chief (Yao Maosen) briefed the meeting on the  guiding ideology, line of thinking, goal, steps, and substance  of the construction of the experimental zone for reform and  opening up, on the short-term breakthroughs and long-term reform  and development of zone's construction, and on the organization  of plan for implementation centering on state policy. After the  report, Wang Siqi, (Wang Guangxian), Long Zhiyi, and persons in  charge of the provincial planning commission, the provincial  education commission, the provincial department of  communications, and the provincial department of forestry  offered many good opinions and suggestions for the zone's plan  of implementation. They expressed willingness to actively  support the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture in running the  experimental zone well. The meeting adopted the experimental  zone's plan of implementation.    Liu Fangren, secretary of the provincial party committee,  said: The national autonomous region's experimental zone for  reform and opening up of the Qiandongnan Autonomous Prefecture  was the outcome of everybody's hard work. Departments concerned  should give energetic support to the zone and make concerted  efforts to run it well. The zone's plan of implementation is  feasible as I see it. However, its specific measures should be  further improved. He urged the prefecture to seize this  opportunity, universally mobilize the broad masses of cadres and  people, further emancipate the mind, pluck up confidence, rely  on its own efforts, do solid work, and accelerate its own  development.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jerzy Krajewski and INA: "Will the Situation Be </F> That Good?; `Strategy for Poland' Is Being Criticized--Many  Economists Have Doubts Whether Inflation and Unemployment Can Be  Reduced at the Same Time"]    [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko admits that  "Strategy for Poland" is "a bit optimistic." He does not expect  taxes on stock market transactions to result in substantial  revenue for the state budget. He is not sure whether it will be  possible to lower income tax rates in 1995.    Today, Sejm deputies will make a decision on whether Deputy  Prime Minister/Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko is to present  in the Sejm a governmental economic program for the years  1994-97 called "Strategy for Poland." Last night, opposition  representatives in the Sejm Leadership [Konwent Seniorow] spoke  out against a suggestion coming from the Sejm speaker for the  program to be presented without a parliamentary debate on it.  The governing coalition wanted to postpone the debate by two  weeks, meaning until after the self-governmental elections.  Kolodko announced his Sejm speech a few hours earlier, during a  meeting with some economists in Warsaw.  <H5>  10 Main Points </H5>   According to Kolodko, the main feature of "Strategy" is an  "extension of the economic time frame." The program includes 10  main theses, followed by 10 main programs [programy wezlowe]  that elaborate on the theses. Kolodko regards the need to lower  the social cost of the reforms as one of the more important  issues. This will require concentrating, among other things, on  achieving rapid economic growth. Other important issues  include: negotiation principles of the distribution of the  results of labor, improvement in living conditions, reforms of  the center, and increasing the Polish economy's competitiveness.  <H5>  Important Figures </H5>   Each main program contains criteria of execution. "Strategy"  envisages achieving 22-percent growth of the GDP over four  years. "This means that the GDP will increase by $365 per  resident, reaching the level of $3,500 in 1997," Kolodko said.  Over the same time period, consumption will rise by 16 percent  and investments by about 32 percent. Unemployment is to go down  from 16 to 14 percent. In 1997, inflation should not exceed 10  percent.  <H5>  Economists' Doubts </H5>   According to the economists taking part in the meeting, it  will be hard to achieve the goals set forth in "Strategy." A  few of them pointed to the need to conduct a restructuring of  state-owned enterprises soon. Professor Pawel Glikman said  that, in Poland, capital intensity of production in state-owned  industry is four times that of privately owned industry and  that, when it comes to the construction industry, it is even  seven times higher. Professor Urszula Plowiec warned that  Polish enterprises may not meet the challenge of foreign  competition once customs duties are decreased by 20 percent next  year. The possibility of lowering the unemployment rate was  subject to particular skepticism during the meeting. That is  because restructuring and increasing the competitiveness of  Polish enterprises will require employment cuts. A majority of  economists are also leaning toward the view that measures aimed  at lowering inflation result in increased unemployment.  <H5>  What Taxes Will Be Like </H5>   Deputy Prime Minister Kolodko said he is aware that the  program is a bit optimistic but that, if a concerted effort is  made, it is implementable. When asked about a possible  amendment to this year's budget, Kolodko said that, so far,  revenue surpluses are not big enough to be able to carry out  such an amendment of the budget law. He confirmed that he would  like to lower personal income tax rates as early as next year,  but he does not know where to get the 3.5-4 trillion zlotys [Z]  to cover the decreased budget revenue that would result from  such a measure. He was trying to convince his listeners that  taxing stock market transactions will not endanger the stability  of the Polish capital market, nor will it improve the lot of  senior citizens. He expects Z1 trillion from the stock market  tax next year, whereas the valorization of retirement pensions  by 12 percent to be carried out in June will cost the state  budget Z2.5 trillion.  <H5>  President Approved </H5>   "Generally speaking, I mean in terms of the main directions,  Lech Walesa approved the `Strategy for Poland,'" Kolodko stated  after a meeting with the president. Kolodko said that the  president received the "Strategy" with enormous interest: "He  asked me a whole list of specific questions that were geared to  making sure that his earlier proposals and suggestions were  included in the plan. I think to a large extent they were,"  said Kolodko.</p>

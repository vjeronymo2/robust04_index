			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Steering committee averted rule changes Sir, The successful efforts to prevent damaging rule changes at the Conservative central council meeting in Plymouth were led not by the Charter Movement, as you reported ('Charter Movement defeats three voting motions', March 26), but by the Party Reform Steering Committee. This committee represents nearly 60 constituency associations, whose interests were directly threatened by the two rules which failed to receive sufficient support. The requisition of a special central council meeting in 1992, to which the article also referred, was made by 50 of those associations and co-ordinated by this committee, not by the Charter Movement as you stated. It is not, and never has been, our aim to give anyone a 'bloody nose'. We merely seek to institute democratic accountability for the running of Conservative Central Office, a reform from which the whole party will benefit. Eric Chalker, secretary to the committee, Party Reform Steering Committee, 21 Ingleside Close, Beckenham, Kent BR3 1QU</p>

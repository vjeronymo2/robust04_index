			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Brittan's roles - Ballot Box Sir Leon Brittan, Britain's senior commissioner to the European Community, was in Edinburgh yesterday to support the Tories. His main task was to use his position to warn that if Scotland became independent, it would not automatically become a member of the EC, which is what the Scottish National party claims. Echoing the words of Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, Sir Leon suggested that an independent Scotland would have to negotiate membership rather than obtaining it on a plate. The process could take several years. 'For better or for worse, the EC is quite good at delay at times,' he said. Sir Leon explained that he was giving his independent personal view as a Tory who happened to be a member of the Commission. 'All my Commission colleagues take an interest in political developments in their own countries,' he said. Sir Leon went on to canvass for Paul Martin, Tory candidate in the Labour-held seat of Edinburgh Central. However, little has been heard from Bruce Millan, his Labour counterpart in Brussels who was once Scottish secretary. Unlike Sir Leon, Millan has almost certainly given up the idea of a return to Westminster.</p>

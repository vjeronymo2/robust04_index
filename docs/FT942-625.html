			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Gold producers to form new group International institutional investors are being asked to provide Dollars 75m to facilitate a merger of four small gold companies into a widely-held, intermediate-sized North American gold producer, Atlas Gold Corporation, listed in New York and Toronto. Next year the new Atlas group was likely to be producing at an annual rate of more than 300,000 troy ounces, said Mr Steve Manz, president and chief financial officer, yesterday. This would qualify the group for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold Mines Index. Mr Manz and two colleagues - Mr David Birkenshaw, now chairman, and Mr Michael Gross, chief operating officer - moved into Atlas last September when the company was close to bankruptcy. They had previously been officers of Royal Oak Mines, the Canadian group being quickly built into a significant gold producer under the guidance of Ms Peggy Witte, its president. They now expect to raise Dollars 75m, about half from US investors and the rest split about equally between institutions in Canada and the UK. This will be used: to buy 37.2 per cent of Granges, a Canadian precious metals producer, for CDollars 50.7m (USDollars 36.4m) from MIM, the Australian resources group; to acquire about 20 per cent of Dakota Mining, a Denver-based company formerly known as MinVen Gold, for between Dollars 15.3m and Dollars 18.4m. Atlas then hopes to use these stakes to acquire the rest of Granges and Dakota as well as the remaining half of Granges' 50 per cent-owned Hycroft Resources before the end of 1994. At a presentation to institutions in London, Mr Manz said that the merged group would start out with Dollars 86m cash (mostly coming from the sale by Granges of its Trout Lake mine to Hudson Bay, the Minorco subsidiary) and other working capital of Dollars 2m and long-term debt of about Dollars 2m. Exercise of outstanding Atlas and Dakota warrants would add another Dollars 18m cash. The merged group would have annual gold production between 200,000 and 300,000 ounces a year at cash cost of between Dollars 260 and Dollars 270 an ounce (and total costs of Dollars 296) and reserves of 2.4m ounces.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 6 Apr (INA) -- An official spokesman in  Baghdad said today the accusation made by U.S. State Department  spokesman Mike McCurry yesterday --that the Iraqi Government is  behind the killing of several foreigners in the Kurdistan region  -- is an absurd accusation. It shows to what extent the U.S.  State Department is deliberately seeking to mislead public  opinion and not tell it the truth about the deteriorating  security situation in that region.    The Iraqi spokesman said the Kurdistan region, which is  under  U.S. protection and control, is rife with thugs, armed men, and  thieves. The people there do not dare go out at night or travel  between cities and villages. Incidents of killing and robbery  by highwaymen in Kurdistan occur almost daily.    The spokesman added that the newspapers run by the armed  cliques in the Kurdistan region are full of complaints and  criticism about the deteriorating security situation. The  newspapers daily accuse the Kurdish authority of being unable to  control its armed men and from time to time publish reports  about armed robberies and holdups committed by those armed men.  Sometimes, those armed groups fight over spoils. They also  trade accusations in public about who is responsible for the  deterioration of security in the region from the warlords in the  region, Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabani and other leaders of  the armed cliques who were armed by the Americans.    The Iraqi spokesman added that the U.S. State Department's  accusation of the Iraqi Government is clear disinformation and  political deception. It is part of the U.S. blind hostility to  Iraq.</p>

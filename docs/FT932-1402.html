			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Milan's mayor in threat to immigrants MILAN'S new mayor, Mr Marco Formentini, has threatened to expel illegal immigrants from the city if national immigration rules are not tightened. Milan, which has a severe housing shortage, is a magnet for illegal immigrants, mainly from north Africa. The recently-elected Mr Formentini is a leading member of the populist Lombard League. He said that, in the interim, Milan could apply special rules for companies wanting to employ immigrants. Those rules would require workers from countries outside the European Community to have formal employment contracts and would require employers to take responsibility for housing them for up to six months. Mr Formentini, a member of the lower house of the Italian parliament, has recently appeared more moderate on sensitive issues, such as immigration, than Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader. However, his remarks, in his first newspaper interview since becoming mayor, suggest immigration will be at the top of the agenda for League mayors, who scored a string of victories across northern Italy in last weekend's second round of local elections. He dismissed claims by Ms Margherita Boniver, a former immigration minister, that enforcing tough entry rules for non-EC citizens was virtually impossible because of Italy's long coastline and proximity to north Africa. 'The problem isn't the long coast but short brains,' he said. Citing his own experience in north African countries, he said: 'In front of the consulates of other EC countries there were no queues. But there was a queue in front of the Italian consulate. Visas were issued because Italian politicians had private business dealings with the local authorities, in exchange for offering the chance to emigrate.' On the economy, Mr Formentini accused previous local administrations of contributing to the current weakness of Italian industry. Corporate competitiveness had been eroded by the existence of a 'perfect oligopoly' among companies making rigged bids for big infrastructure contracts which had 'degraded the whole system', he said. Mr Formentini gave as examples recent tenders for foreign contracts by the city's metro authority which had been about twice as expensive as those of competitors. The reason was that 'half the money was due to go in bribes'. The election of Mr Formentini, sworn in as mayor yesterday, ended six months of urban administration by a special interior ministry commissioner after the collapse of the previous council.</p>

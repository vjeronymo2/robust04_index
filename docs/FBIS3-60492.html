It gave one a strange feeling to walk into  Sabbatsberg, Stockholm's main emergency clinic, on a Tuesday  afternoon and find the personnel gathered in the coffee room. A  box of chocolates--a gift from a grateful patient--was being  passed around.    "Things used to be hopping around here, but now we jump if  the telephone rings," head nurse Soren Carlsson joked.    Humor was mixed with bitterness and anger. Because lying  around everywhere were yellow slips of paper confirming that the  end was near: The emergency clinic will shut down on Friday.  When that happens, the telephones will stop ringing for good,  and the empty ambulance garage, where the personnel have set up  a temporary "therapy corner" with good and bad papier-mache  figures (one of the bad figures has been christened Ralph  Ledel), will be demolished.    People commonly referred to as the victims of society's dark  side--knifing victims, traffic victims, and heroin abusers--will  be taken to other emergency rooms: at St. Goran, Caroline, and  Huddinge Hospitals. It is not just Sabbatsberg's emergency room  that will disappear: The entire hospital will be closed on 15  December and reopened after the first of the year as a local  hospital operated by M&amp;M Medical, Inc., with from 40 to 50  employees. Sabbatsberg's 1,600 employees are being scattered  around among various places. The building contractor is already  busy making alterations to the former alcohol detox unit.    "We were not supposed to close before the end of November,  but everything is being speeded up. Even though it is not  possible to close down a hospital in two months," said an  indignant Carlsson.  <H5>  Politicians in the Toilet </H5>   He was not alone in his feelings--or his humiliation over  the  politicians' decision, which seems to be anything but well  founded economically. Among other things, the brand-new  operating rooms are being put "in mothballs."    "We have a palace that we have to leave. Everything works  perfectly--it is easy to operate," said a nurse in the operating  unit. She laughed when SVENSKA DAGBLADET's photographer Jurek  Holzer caught sight of a little monument on the wall: a chamber  pot the bottom of which was decorated with two pictures of  politicians responsible for the change.    "That was put up when feelings were at their peak," said the  nurse, who was unwilling to have her name printed in the  newspaper.    To some extent, anger has given way to resignation. Several  gaps can be seen in the list of scheduled operations. The number  of patients has fallen off, and so has the number of personnel.  Most of the employees know where they will go after the end of  the year, but there is still anger over the way the assignments  were made.    "We received notices to indicate our interests last spring,  but then the answers were a long time coming. And when they did,  we had only one week in which to answer or become unemployed.  For mothers of small children, that was tremendously difficult."    Sabbatsberg has a specialist clinic for jaw operations.  Surgeon Hans Bystedt will perform his final operation on 8  December. The decision as to where the clinic will move to will  be made the following day. That decision has already been  postponed once, and Bystedt does not seem fully convinced that  it will be made on 9 December either.  <H5>  Want To Go to Soder Hospital </H5>   "We will probably be relegated to some shack," he said with  a  laugh. Then he became serious and talked about finances and  cooperation with the plastic surgeons and ear, nose, and throat  specialists at Soder Hospital.    "We want to go there, but the administration wants to move  us  to Caroline Hospital. The most important thing is to keep the  waiting list from growing longer. Most of our patients are  young, and for them, a six-month wait is an eternity."    There was an atmosphere of leave-taking in the air, even  though work was proceeding as usual.    In the newly renovated X-ray department--the city's best,  said department head Anders Tyden proudly--one could hear a  statement that is common at Sabbatsberg these days:    "So long! I'm off to take a look at my new job."    And in the emergency unit's coffee room, Asa, Maj-Britt, and  Soren were already talking about memories of the years at  Sabbatsberg.    "I'll never forget the guy who escaped and smashed up the  cars in the parking lot."    "Do you remember the meadow just outside? And the cafe  across  the street where we used to buy pastry?"</p>

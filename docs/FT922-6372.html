			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / World News in Brief: European Monetary System The Italian lira had a bad week in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, slipping back two places and ending second from bottom. Italy's political uncertainties have drained confidence in the lira, and there is speculation about an Italian devaluation. The French franc remained the star performer, nudging its central rate against the D-Mark to FFr3.3539. Sterling dropped to third from bottom of the grid on the back of mixed UK economic indicators  -but dealers believe the pound's steady uptrend against the D-Mark is intact, and that it could breach DM2.94 again this week.</p>

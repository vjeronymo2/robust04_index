			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: TOMMY AND THE BOYS OF SUMMER  </P> <P> Tommy Miller stood near the pitcher's mound of Dodger Stadium on an evening as  warm and sweet as honey in tea, observing home plate with a lopsided grin.  </P> <P> Even when the catcher was ready for him he hesitated, treasuring a moment that  would never come again, wanting it to last forever.  </P> <P> All eyes were on him, the p.a. system was saying his name and he, Tommy Miller,  was about to pitch.  </P> <P> Fantasies come true on nights like this, aglow with the kind of shimmery half  light that brightens dreams and fairy tales.  </P> <P> And this was a fantasy coming true.  </P> <P> Tommy Miller, age 34, peered forward just like Sandy Koufax used to do, went  into a windup and threw.  </P> <P> The ball seemed to hang in midair between the mound and home plate, suspended  by the same magic that builds castles out of stardust and causes time to freeze  on the ghosts of our ambitions.  </P> <P> For those distracted by the anticipation of a real baseball game, Tommy  Miller's moment was over before they had a chance to understand his ebullience  or empathize with his joy.  </P> <P> The ball fell into the catcher's mitt with a muffled thwump, the crowd cheered,  Tommy Miller took a bow and the fantasy glimmered off like a child's dream,  over the emerald field and into the coming night.  </P> <P> But, man, what a moment.  </P> <P> I sing today of those fantasies we create on the empty stages of our daydreams,  climbing mountains of towering proportion, swimming oceans of endless expanse.  </P> <P> Tommy Miller, the ultimate fan, was able to leap from what Wordsworth saw as  the bliss of reverie's solitude into the reality of Dodger Stadium to realize  his fantasy before 45,000 spectators.  </P> <P> The rest of us should be so lucky.  </P> <P> His presence was part of a promotional gimmick called Think Blue Week, in which  fans were invited to nominate someone to participate in a baseball fantasy.  </P> <P> Tommy's wife nominated him to throw that ceremonial first pitch of the game  between the Dodgers and the Houston Astros, because her Tommy is such a Dodger  nut.  </P> <P> He is one of those guys who, if he scratches his head while watching his team  on TV and Eddie Murray hits a home run just at that moment, will scratch his  head every time Murray comes to bat, even if it wears a hole in his skull.  </P> <P> That will last until Murray strikes out during a head-scratch or hits into a  double play, at which time Miller will be alert to other forms of sorcery  intended to propel his team into a championship.  </P> <P> He traces his amiable superstitions back to the time his mother was ironing  clothes while watching the Dodgers play the hated New York Yankees during the  first game of the 1963 World Series. The Dodgers won.  </P> <P> Miller was 8 at the time and recalls his mom, also a fan, saying they won  because she was ironing. Not wanting to tamper with luck, she also ironed while  watching game two, and the Dodgers won again.  </P> <P> This was too mystical to be coincidence, so naturally she continued ironing  during the third and fourth games, and the Boys in Blue swept the series.  </P> <P> "We believed, of course, that mom was responsible," Miller says with a laugh.  But then he thinks about it for a moment and I notice he isn't laughing.  </P> <P> Baseball is a game of fantasy and superstition, and Tommy Miller seems to  symbolize them both.  </P> <P> He will not watch the Dodgers on big-screen TV because they do not win on a big  screen, and he will eat any kind of chicken during a game because the Dodgers  win when he eats chicken.  </P> <P> They lose during pizza.  </P> <P> I discussed this with Miller on the morning of his Big Pitch. He was excited  about the prospect of pitching, but, as an advertising executive, also  understood the gossamer nature of fantasy.  </P> <P> Still, there is a compulsion to his Dodger loyalty he will not deny.  </P> <P> Take his memorabilia.  </P> <P> The man has got hats, pins, pennants and programs in such numbers to satisfy  any fan, but even that isn't enough.  </P> <P> He similarly possesses videotapes of Dodger games, record albums of Dodger  highlights and a 45 r.p.m. of Vin Scully calling the last inning of Bill  Singer's 1970 no-hitter.  </P> <P> There are also boxes of newspapers that chronicle glorious moments in Dodger  history on the sports page, while the front pages of the same journals thunder  social calamity.  </P> <P> "It's kind of dumb, I suppose," Miller says, "but it's fun. Everybody ought to  be a fan of something."  </P> <P> That night, he stood on the mound in the perfect stillness of a spring dream,  grinned at the crowd and threw his single pitch.  </P> <P> That night, he was Don Drysdale and Fernando Valenzuela. That night, he was a  star. And that night, the Dodgers won 5-1.  </P> <P> There's nothing wrong with that.  </P></p>

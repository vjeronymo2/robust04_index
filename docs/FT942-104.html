			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Tring Intl scores 56% rise Tring International, the music group which was floated in February, yesterday ann-ounced a 56 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.2m. The figure for the year to March 31 compared with Pounds 5.1m forecast in the flotation prospectus and a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.3m in 1992-93. The group said it was negotiating with several supermarket chains to stock its low-priced compact discs. The arrangement with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra had also been expanded and the RPO would now record 125 albums on the Tring label, rather than the 50 originally agreed. The group said it had reached an agreement with JVC, the Japanese electronics company, to distribute its products in China. Mr Mark Frey, joint chief executive, said legal action against Tring by music companies PolyGram, MCA and K-Tel International was continuing. The three companies are suing Tring for alleged copyright violations. Mr Frey said settlements of previous disputes had shown that any damages were likely to be small. Tring had indemnities, allowing it to claim any damages and costs awarded against it from the licensors of the music concerned. Mr Frey said he believed there would continue to be a significant price difference between CDs sold by large companies and by Tring. Tring's CDs retail at Pounds 3.99 or less. Turnover in the 12 months rose by 35 per cent to Pounds 22.2m (Pounds 16.5m). Earnings increased to 8.46p (5.47p). As flotation only took place in February, no dividend is declared. The first dividend will be an interim for the first half of the current year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 6 ITAR-TASS -- The national press does  not concentrate on any single subject on Friday.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI leads with a report about the signing of  the treaty of civic peace and concord by a large group of  representatives of the country's public organisations and  business community. More than 100 public and entrepreneurial  organizations and banking structures signed the treaty in St.  Vladimir's Hall of the Grand Kremlin Palace on Thursday.    "The participation in the signing of representatives of the  business circles signals that the nascent entrepreneurial  community sees its interest in the stable development of society  and is ready to shoulder its share of responsibility for  stability," the newspaper writes.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA comments on Tajik Leader Emomali  Rakhmonov's visit to Moscow: "There is no doubt in principle  that Russia is ready to feed Tajikistan as long as it remains in  the sphere of Russian influence. The time for the visit is not  quite good: judging by all appearances, the opposition has  finally rejected any dialogue with (Tajikistan's) government and  is planning to settle the problem by military means. In this  situation the powers to be in Dushanbe are forced not to discuss  with Moscow economic problems but to plead for a further  increase of the already sizable military assistance".    The same newspaper reports from the Crimea that "President  Yuriy Meshkov (of the peninsular republic) is planning to  address the newly-elected parliament with a package of five  bills, which form the conceptual framework of the state and  legal system of the peninsula. The bills, which Yuriy Meshkov  will submit to the Crimean parliament, cover such matters as  citizenship of the Crimean republic, its relations with Russia  and Ukraine and reform of its executive power so as to create "a  strong presidential republic".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an article by Professor Valentin  Larionov, entitled "Pluses and Minuses of Partnership for  Peace", which says: "It is no time to demonstrate  unpredictability in foreign policy. It looks like the period of  excited romantic relations between Russia and the West is coming  to an end, or probably has ended already. Time is now coming  for mature partnership with every subsequent step carefully  weighed at home with due consideration of all pros and cons".    The newspaper TRUD publishes an interview with Austrian  Ambassador to the Russian Federation Friedrich Bauer under the  title "Russia Must Regain Confidence in Herself". The  ambassador says: "I think Russia's revival will begin in its  component parts, in the provinces, in the countryside but not in  the cities and not among the intellectuals. And it will proceed  on the basis of a balance of interests".    PRAVDA carried an article by academic Valentin Koptyug who  says that "the insane policy of privatisation has dealt a  stunning blow to the country's national economy and continues to  shower such blows". Koptyug says he has only one description  for the privatisation drive underway in the country -- "A  fantastic affair on the state level".    The same newspaper reports that "Karelia (Russia's  northwestern autonomy) is looking forwards to the arrival from  Boston, New York and other cities of America of several tens of  high-class policemen, who, jointly with Russian militiamen, will  patrol the streets, hunt criminals and investigate crimes from  May 16-26. They will also teach Russians the art of using  rubber sticks which they will give them as presents. The  American police force that will land on Karelia will include  experts in self-defence, preventing sexual abuse of minors,  combatting drug-addiction and crime in schools and controlling  infectious diseases.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Home-buyers' costs fall: TSB index says owners need to spend less than ever on a mortgage POTENTIAL first-time house buyers need to spend less than ever on a mortgage, says research which suggests that the affordability of homes is improving twice as quickly as other measures suggest. The TSB's quarterly Affordability Index, launched yesterday, shows that would-be home owners need to spend an average of 26 per cent of their take-home pay on a mortgage. This is down from 38 per cent a year ago and 67 per cent in the first quarter of 1990, when interest rates were at a peak. Evidence that first-time buyers have 'never had it so good' is important. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at stockbrokers UBS, said: 'It is the key to recovery and possibly to ending the negative equity nightmare further up the chain.' The TSB said that simple house price-to-earnings ratios suggested an improvement of just one-third since 1989. Yet the new index, compiled by Mr John Stewart, a housing consultant, showed an improvement of nearly two-thirds. The survey gives some examples of how the housing market has changed. In spring 1989, it says, a single woman in her 20s in the south-east would have needed 116 per cent of her take-home pay to buy a typical first-time property. Now she would need 38 per cent. The TSB index's average first-time buyer earns Pounds 15,100 a year, has monthly take-home pay of Pounds 915 and spends Pounds 242 on a mortgage for an average Pounds 48,800 first-time buyer property. The bank said that, in spite of price rises in the past year, affordability had improved because interest rates had fallen. Mr Stewart said: 'It's clear that during the false dawn early last year, when the market looked like it was going to recover, affordability was still poor . . . but now property prices do not need to fall further on grounds of affordability.' The Lord Chancellor's Department yesterday announced a 6.5 per cent fall in mortgage possession actions in county courts - from 34,535 in the third quarter of 1992 to 32,276 in July-September this year.</p>

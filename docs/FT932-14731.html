			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Hopes rise of early end to rail dispute HOPES ROSE last night that the rail dispute might be resolved early next week after union officials said British Rail appeared to be shifting its attitude toward compulsory redundancies and the use of contract labour. The executive of the RMT union meets on Monday to decide its next move after yesterday's second 24-hour strike, with an early resumption of negotiations with British Rail now probable. Union officials said last night that BR seemed to be 'edging forward' and there was 'the basis for a restart of talks'. The optimism came after Sir Bob Reid, BR chairman, wrote to Mr John Prescott, Labour's transport spokesman, stating: 'The board has no plans currently for any compulsory redundancies. 'No employer can give such an unqualified guarantee on job security as no compulsory redundancies, although BR's record here is good with relocation and retraining resulting in almost all displaced staff who wished to stay in the industry being able to do so.' Sir Bob added that the board could not give any unconditional guarantee to limit contracting of services 'where this can be done safely and efficiently'. But he pointed out to Mr Prescott that: 'We have no plans for a major extension of the use of contractors in the area of track maintenance during the next couple of years. 'The board is continuing to seek to resume discussions and to dissuade the union from taking further damaging industrial action.' Last night Mr Prescott said the letter indicated 'a change in BR's attitude'. He called for the intervention of conciliation service Acas to help resolve the conflict. 'There is no reason why an agreement should not now be reached to bring this dispute to a conclusion,' he said. Yesterday's 24-hour rail strike did not prevent thousands of railway commuters reaching work while others took the day off or worked from home. In London, the Stock Exchange and Lloyd's said they were not affected. Mr Peter Stillwell, vice-president of London's Oxford Street Association and manager of Marks and Spencer at Marble Arch, said the strike had 'a very considerable effect' on the central London retail trade.

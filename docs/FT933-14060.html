			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Bomb suspects plead innocent Ten suspects accused of plotting to bomb the United Nations headquarters and other targets around New York pleaded innocent yesterday at their arraignment in a federal court, AP reports from New York. Assistant US Attorney Andrew C. McCarthy said another indictment would be filed in the case within three weeks. He also said the government had more than 150 hours of audio and video tapes  -obtained through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act - on which, so it is alleged, the defendants discuss the bomb plot. On Wednesday, federal authorities disclosed that the government informant who helped foil the alleged bomb plot last month had infiltrated the suspected terrorist ring as early as 1991.</p>

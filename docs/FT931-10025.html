			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Storehouse A 10 per cent fall in Storehouse's shares over the past two days seems a rather extreme response to its chief executive's departure. Shareholders presumably took the view that if Mr David Dworkin had decided to take the money and run they should perhaps do likewise. Their nervousness is understandable. Since Storehouse had previously been trading on a prospective multiple in the high 20s, there was little room for any trading wobbles. Although there is no hint of any boardroom rancour, Mr Dworkin's departure is abrupt and leaves a considerable void. As the inspirational force behind BhS's renaissance, Mr Dworkin was as much the symbol of change as its architect. The fear is Storehouse will lose momentum unless an energetic successor is appointed quickly. Storehouse has no financial worries after disposing of Habitat and Richards. Its two main trading companies are operationally sound. BhS has decisively turned the corner and Mothercare appears to be on the mend. Ms Ann Iverson, who followed Mr Dworkin from Bonwit Teller to BhS and now has a critical role in rejuvenating Mothercare, has signalled her determination to stick with the challenge. Even so, Storehouse's shares seem likely to drift until the top slot is filled. Worryingly, there are no obvious candidates in sight. The longer the wait, the more jittery the market will become.</p>

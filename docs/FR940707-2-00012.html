The priorities described below will be used by the RDA to rate preapplications and applications. Points will be distributed as indicated in paragraph (a) of this section. Points will be distributed according to ranking as compared with other preapplications/ applications on hand. A copy of the score sheet (Exhibit B) (available in any State RDA/FmHA Office) should be placed in the casefile for future reference.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The selection criteria are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Economic conditions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Preference will be given to proposed projects which will serve a rural area(s) that has few rural industries and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agribusinesses; high levels of unemployment or underemployment; high rates of outmigration of people, businesses, and industries; and low levels of per capita income. RDA will consider data supporting these demographics from the United States Bureau of the Census or other reliable data from recognized local, regional, State or Federal sources or from surveys conducted by reliable, impartial sources. Outmigration of businesses and industries, for example, may be supported by county business patterns data available from the Bureau of the Census. Data to support all categories must be for the most current full calendar year for which the data is available and the 3 calendar years prior to that year. The competitive range for proposed projects is as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Number of rural industries and agribusinesses in comparison with the population of the area(s) to be served: 1 or less per 5,000 residents_25 points; 1 or less per 3,000 residents_15 points; or 1 or less per 1,000 residents_5 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Unemployment rate in the area(s) to be served: Exceeds the State rate by 25 percent or more_15 points; or exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent but more than 5 percent_10 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Underemployment in the area(s) to be served exceeds the State rate of underemployment by 25 percent or more_20 points; exceeds the State rate by less than 25 percent_10 points; or is equal to or less than State rate_0 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Outmigration of rural residents from the area(s) as evidenced by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> population loss in the last full calendar year of at least 20 percent_20 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Outmigration of business and industry and/or business and industry closures in the area(s) of at least 20 percent in the last 3 years_20 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Average per capita income of the area(s) is less than the State average by: 50 percent_25 points; or 25 percent_10 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Project proposal.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The project proposal will contribute the most to the improvement of economic conditions of the rural area(s) by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Creation of industries or agribusinesses in the area(s): 1 or more per 5,000 residents_20 points; 1 or more per 10,000 residents_10 points; or 1 or more per 20,000 residents_5 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Increasing employment by 10 percent or more_10 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Stemming the flow of outmigration of people, businesses, or industries by 10 percent or more_10 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Increasing the tax base of the area(s) by 2 percent or more_5 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Applicant experience.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The applicant demonstrates capability to transfer for practical application in rural areas the technology generated and demonstrates the ability to commercialize products, processes, services, and enterprises in rural areas_15 points.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Review of decision.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each application for assistance will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the priorities established in this section. A priority rating will be assigned to each application. Applications selected for funding will be based on the priority rating assigned each application and the total funds available. All applications submitted for funding should contain sufficient information to permit RDA to complete a thorough priority rating.

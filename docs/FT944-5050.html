			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Fall reported in business failures The number of business failures in the third quarter of this year fell to its lowest level since 1989, a business survey has found. The survey, conducted by Trade Indemnity, the credit management group, says that there were 784 business failures in the third quarter of this year. This was 5 per cent lower than in the second quarter, and 33 per cent lower than the same period a year ago. However, Trade Indemnity pointed out that the fall in business failures appeared to be slowing, with some regions, such as the north-east, west Midlands and East Anglia, recording a rise in business failures between the second and third quarters of this year.</p>

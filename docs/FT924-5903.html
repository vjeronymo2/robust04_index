			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Capital Markets: French retailer FNAC up 9.4% FNAC, one of France's largest retailing groups, bucked the sluggish economic environment by achieving a 9.4 per cent increase in net profits to FFr156m (Dollars 28.9m) for the year to August 1992. The group, which is chaired by Mr Jean-Louis Petriat and controlled by the GMF insurance group, has for decades dominated the French market for 'cultural' retailing with its record and book shops. However, in recent years it has faced fierce compet-ition from Virgin, the UK leisure group, which has opened megastores in France. FNAC has retaliated by playing Virgin at its own game. It has accelerated its own expansion outside France and has opened its own megastores in France, culminating in the launch late last year of its opulent 'Cathedral of Culture' on Avenue des Ternes in Paris, north of the flagship Virgin megastore on the Avenue des Champs-Elysees. This competitive climate has affected FNAC's performance. The group mustered an increase in sales of 11.1 per cent to FFr8.25bn for last year. But the slowdown in consumer sales, coupled with increased competition and the impact of FNAC's own FFr491m investment programme, meant that the growth in net profits was fuelled by a rise in exceptional earnings from property transactions. These increased from FFr80.5m to FFr107.8m. The overall increase in net profits enabled FNAC to raise its dividend by 10.6 per cent to FFr26 for the last financial year.</p>

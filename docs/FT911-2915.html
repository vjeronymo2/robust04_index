			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Market support for ICI ICI disclosed sharply lower first-quarter results, but still at the top end of analysts' expectations, some of whom moved quickly to upgrade their forecasts. All were particularly impressed with results from what were thought to be the trouble spots: bulk chemicals and agrochemicals. One disappointing area, again contrary to expectations, was pharmaceuticals. Analysts blamed heavy buying of drugs in the previous quarter ahead of price rises. The range of forecasts for the full year is still wide. BZW, not the most pessimistic of securities houses on ICI, lifted its profits estimate by Pounds 20m to Pounds 770m. County NatWest, which issued a buy note on the stock on Tuesday, reiterated its position and Pounds 850m prediction. Hoare Govett, ICI's broker, moved from 'undervalued' to 'buy'. Hoare has written in an Pounds 875m profit for the year. ICI rose 18 at one point but closed just 3 better on balance at 1073p. Turnover was a solid 1.9m shares. Assets sale stories The oil sector was alive with speculation that the sale of Occidental's North Sea assets had been finalised, and that Elf Aquitaine, the French state-owned oil group and long-time favourite to gain control of the assets, had triumphed with a Dollars 1bn-plus bid. The story focused dealers' minds on the 25 per cent stake that Elf holds in Enterprise Oil, and which many expect to be placed in the market. Enterprise is also thought to have bid for the assets, along with Atlantic Richfield, the US oil group. Specialists said the Elf stake in Enterprise had been overhanging the market and had depressed the exploration and production sub-sector for many months; if it is sold it will lead to an upward rerating. Enterprise shares dipped 5 to 554p. Reuters erratic Reuters' annual meeting caused the company's share price to move erratically. Early in the presentation, Reuters management said revenue would be flat for the year. Some analysts reported this immediately to clients and the shares dropped below Pounds 8. The company later said 'increasing cash balances will assist us in growing our 1991 profits'. The implication that there would therefore be an improvement on last year's Pounds 320m, the figure that some analysts have forecast to be repeated this year, pushed the shares back up to within a few pence of the previous night's close. The shares weakened again in the last hour of trade, with marketmakers saying that a US house had been caught with an over-long position in the stock. Reuters ended a net 20 off at 803p after exceptionally high turnover of 4m. Monday's earthquake in Central America sent shares in the two big banana importers, Geest and Fyffes, higher. Geest gained 28 to 347p and Fyffes rose 2 to 93p. UK importers are expected to benefit from higher retail prices, while Caribbean suppliers are likely to supply from stock. Geest was also boosted following a meeting with shareholders at brokers Cazenove. Asda firmed a penny to 122p as it began its series of meetings with securities houses. Brokers lowered their 1991/92 forecasts following the meetings to Pounds 197m to Pounds 215m from Pounds 225m to Pounds 230m, which had been expected. There was uncertainty surrounding Lilley, the Glasgow-based construction group, where a large placing of shares was said to have been attempted. BZW was said to have tried to place more than 11m shares in Lilley, at a price of 48 1/2 p, representing the holdings of a number of directors and shareholders of Hatfield Estates, taken over by Lilley just over a year ago. At the time of the takeover Hatfield directors agreed not to sell their newly acquired Lilley shares for at least a year and not until Lilley's 1990 figures had been published. Seaq turnover for Lilley was 365,000 shares, indicating that no placing had taken place. Lilley settled 1 1/2 off at 47 1/2 p. YJ Lovell's Pounds 30m rights issue, a two-for-five at 130p, received the thumbs down by the market and Lovell shares dropped 33 to 145p. MJ Gleeson advanced 17 to 805p following good results, with profits up 10 per cent at Pounds 5.05m, but Steetley was the latest building stock to suffer from market fears that a rights issue could be forthcoming and fell 15 to 358p. A report that UK groups were among the 26 first-tier contractors for development of the F-22 Advanced Tactical Fighter project, America's next generation of jet aircraft, sustained their respective share prices. Details of the exact involvement should be released by the US Air Force next week, but Dowty, 2 harder at 184p, hopes to receive a contract for Dollars 20m and Williams Holdings, also firmer at 284p, could be awarded a similar amount. Williams was also the subject of a positive note from Smith New Court. Trafalgar House was bolstered by a broker's buy recommendation and settled 5 higher at 246p. The interim results are due on May 8. With the company effectively dousing Wednesday's speculation of an impending rights issue, ECC recouped much of that day's fall to close 10 higher at 420p. Pilkington firmed to 191p following news of a Pounds 7.4m disposal. Fresh criticism of the fund-raising proposed by Cannon Street Investments lowered the stock 7 more to 105p. Vickers weakened further as fears of a sharp fall in sales of luxury cars were confirmed by chairman Sir David Plastow. He warned at yesterday's annual meeting that this, coupled with redundancy costs taken wholly in the first half, would mean lower profits for the group. 'Over the full year Rolls-Royce Motor Cars is unlikely to make a significant contribution to Vickers' earnings,' he said. Vickers dipped to 205p before ending 2 easier at 209p. Automotive component stocks bowed to more bad news from the motor industry. Hard on the heels of the Volvo job losses, news of which lowered Lex Service 8 more to 189p, speculation arose of the possible temporary closure of the Ford plants at Dagenham and Halewood. This was denied but main suppliers GKN and Lucas Industries still lost ground, the former closing 9 down at 364p and the latter 5 off at 156p. Tace fell 12 to 144p following the resignation of a director and of the company's brokers, Hoare Govett. The latter was appointed less than a month ago ahead of an anticipated capital restructuring. Shell strengthened to close 7 up at 527p, responding to a spate of buy recommendations in the US. Ultramar, which has substantial Canadian businesses, was hurt by poor results from Imperial Oil, the Canadian unit of Exxon, and settled 10 off at 319p with some big selling orders said to have been in the market. British Gas eased to 248p ahead of next Tuesday's deadline for its response to the Ofgas proposals on domestic tariffs. If Gas fails to respond, Ofgas will send its recommendations to the Monopolies Commission. Carlton Communications climbed 11 to 559p as Hoare Govett recommended the stock for the long term. Analysts were impressed with the company's new products at a television equipment exhibition in the US. The broker, however, remained cautious in the short term, trimming this year's profits forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 103m. The return of rights issue talk concerning Granada left the shares 5 off at 187p. Tour operator Airtours jumped 44 to 443p, the day after the company took a group of analysts to the Champagne district of France for a presentation. Sentiment was also helped by the arrival of the company as a constituent of the FT-A All-share index - tracking funds are now likely to buy the stock. New issue Headline Book Publishing closed at 122p, compared with a placing price of 100p. Lancashire &amp; London Investment Trust advanced 9 to 103p on the Pounds 8.4m offer from fellow trust and main shareholder Anglo Scandinavian Investment Trust. National Home Loans reflected investor uncertainty ahead of today's interim results with a loss of 5 at 134p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1991 NEW HIGHS (159).

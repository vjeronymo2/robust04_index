			<p>BFN     [Text] Long An has invested tens of billion of dong to  build a medium-voltage power line linked with the national  electric network. The local people have contributed 50 percent  of the construction cost.    At present, 130 of the 180 villages and wards of the  province  use electricity supplied by the national grid. All 32 villages  of Duc Hoa and Chau Thanh districts have been provided with  electricity for home use and production.    Long An is striving to supply electricity to all villages in  the province in 1995 using its own budget, money collected from  electric fees, and funds contributed by the local people.</p>

			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Manweb Manweb has done much that a good utility management should. It cut costs in the first two years after privatisation and looked overseas for examples of best practice. Its investment in a flexible database of customers will allow selling of other services. It has avoided allowing the Trojan horse of other electricity companies' retailing operations into its patch via joint ventures. It also stuck to its knitting and will only expand gradually through natural extentions to its business. Indeed, it is no small irony that those utility managements best able to cope with the difficulties of diversification are those that have had the sense to avoid it. Yet the company cannot hide its embarrassment of riches. Cash flow is strong, gearing is down to 6 per cent, dividend cover is 3.3 times and Manweb is not even using the full elbow room allowed by its price cap. Admittedly the company was blessed with a generous price cap on the mistaken assumption that the recession would hit the north hardest. But the regional electricity companies are over-capitalised, and progressive dividend policies will hardly make a dent in balance sheets. There may be brownie points for companies prepared to risk the wrath of the regulator and return the excess equity to shareholders. Otherwise customers, the government, or owners of acquired firms will walk off with the money.</p>

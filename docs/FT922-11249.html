			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / UK Company News: Groupe Bull announces 1,100 further job cuts GROUPE BULL, the French state-owned computer maker, yesterday announced 1,100 fresh job losses to sharpen its competitiveness in the recession-hit computer industry. This follows the 9,000 job cuts made over the past 18 months, as part of a complete overhaul by Mr Francis Lorentz, chairman, of the previously cumbersome and bureaucratic company's organisation. The new reductions, all in France, represent 2.76 per cent of the 39,800-strong world workforce, on top of the 19 per cent reduction made last year. Bull has 16,400 staff in France. The job losses come on top of Bull's original restructuring plan, but are part of the same aim of streamlining the group structure and boosting efficiency, said officials. The net loss of jobs will be less severe because Bull is also hiring new staff to work on its wide-ranging technology, research and commercial alliance announced in January with International Business Machines of the US. These posts will be offered to those due to lose their old jobs, and all involved will be offered retraining or help to find alternative employment. Bull said it hoped to avoid redundancies. The plan has won the approval of the group's works council. The move comes three weeks after Bull said it more than halved losses to FFr3.3bn (Dollars 590m) net last year, from a record FFr6.79bn in 1990. It warned it did not expect to break even until next year, rather than 1992 as planned.</p>

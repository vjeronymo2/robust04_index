			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> EL TORO'S BATTERS COME OUT BLAZING AND CAPISTRANO VALLEY IS LEFT BLISTERED,  15-1  </P> <P> El Toro High School had its hottest offensive day so far this season with a  15-1 victory over Capistrano Valley Wednesday in a South Coast League baseball  game at El Toro.  </P> <P> Catcher Scott Toppo, shortstop Sean Drinkwater and center fielder David Nemeth  led El Toro's 12-hit attack with three hits apiece.  </P> <P> "We were due to put everything together, and the hitting became contagious," El  Toro Coach Dan DeLeon said. "I wish we could have saved a few runs for our next  game."  </P> <P> El Toro (11-4 overall, 3-1 in league play) scored seven runs in the first two  innings and then put the game away by scoring eight runs in the fourth, when 13  batters came to the plate.  </P> <P> Winning pitcher Rob Johnson (5-1) shut out Capistrano Valley through six  innings, allowing an unearned run in the seventh as El Toro moved into a  first-place tie with Mission Viejo (10-3, 3-1) in the league.  </P> <P> "They broke it open early and then it became a laugher," Capistrano Valley  Coach Bob Zamora said. "Our young sophomore pitcher (Chris Lugo) walked two  batters and hit two more in the first two innings and that was very unlike  him."  </P> <P> Lugo (3-1) had walked only three batters in 28 innings, but El Toro eventually  scored four runs in the opening two innings by capitalizing on Lugo's mistakes.  </P> <P> Drinkwater, breaking out of a three-game slump, hit two doubles and a single  and drove in three runs. Nemeth scored three runs and made several nice plays  in the outfield. Toppo had three consecutive hits and stole a base as the  Chargers blistered three Capistrano Valley pitchers.  </P> <P> Almost lost in the offensive display was a fine pitching performance by  Johnson. The sophomore allowed a hit in every inning, but had the Cougars shut  out by stranding 10 runners until an error by second baseman Chris Sauritch on  a potential double play ball gave Capistrano Valley its only run.  </P> <P> "I thought Rob pitched a great game," DeLeon said. "He's a competitive kid, and  the shutout meant a lot to him. It's unfortunate that the error cost him the  shutout."  </P> <P> In other South Coast League games:  </P> <P> Mission Viejo 3, San Clemente 1 -- Eric Cedarstaff (5-0) allowed four hits over  6 1/3 innings and Steve Evans finished up for his fourth save for host Mission  Viejo (10-3, 3-1). Jeff Hawkins had two hits and two RBIs for Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> Dana Hills 5, Irvine 3 -- Ricky Whipple (1-0) pitched 4 1/3 innings for the  victory and Mark Kania finished it out to pick up the save.  </P> <P> Dana Hills opened a 5-0 lead after three innings. Nathan Ure had a two-run  single in the first for the Dolphins (6-8-1, 2-2).  </P> <P> In the Angeles League:  </P> <P> Mater Dei 3, St Paul 2 -- Tony Pena (5-0) pitched a complete game with six  strikeouts for the victory at St. Paul. Mater Dei scored three runs in the  third to take a 3-1 lead. Juan Zarate singled, stole second and scored on Greg  Carl's double. Jason Gill had an infield single and Rob Ickes walked to load  the bases. Jeff Ciccarella drove in a run on a ground out and Jim Kelly singled  in the third run for Mater Dei (11-3, 2-1).  </P> <P> In the Empire League:  </P> <P> Los Alamitos 4, Esperanza 2 -- Los Alamitos pitchers Todd Gragnano, Curt Graham  and Tony Napolitano combined for a two-hitter at Esperanza.

La Quinta (12-3-1, 2-1)  capitalized on a hit batsman and a throwing error to score two unearned runs in  the eighth.  </P> <P> Rancho Alamitos 5, Los Amigos 4 -- Roddy McCall hit a three-run home run in the  sixth for Rancho Alamitos (7-5, 1-2) to tie the score, 4-4, and Chris Colbert's  sacrifice scored Chris Singletary with the go-ahead run at Rancho Alamitos.

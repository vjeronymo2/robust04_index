He added  that this round of talks will last four weeks, during which time  the two sides will discuss a detailed 100-page agreement  prepared by both sides and including all issues mentioned in the  Declaration of Principles.    The Palestinian official said that Egypt's mediation, as  well  as direct contacts succeeded in convincing the two sides of the  need to return to the negotiations and discuss outstanding  issues such as border crossings, the area of Jericho, and other  less difficult problems.    The official said that the 13 April deadline for completing  Israel's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area is  a firm date for the Palestinians, adding that the Palestinian  side is adhering to it and will even fight to keep it unchanged.</p>

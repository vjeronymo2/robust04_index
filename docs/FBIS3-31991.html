The  communique reads as follows:    A working session between the Haitian delegation, led by  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide; and a Canadian delegation, led  by Andre Ouellet, minister of foreign affairs, took place on 24  January at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa. The  session's agenda included the following points: the Haitian  crisis; the United Nations file; the training of a managerial  staff for a national police force, as provided for in the  Governors Island agreement; and Haitian-Canadian bilateral  cooperation. The two delegations agreed on the following points:    To disentangle the Haitian situation, the embargo must be  total; this will shorten the duration of the crisis.    Other countries should be added to the four friendly  countries that now include Canada, Venezuela, the United States,  and France.    The police force can be trained outside of Haiti. It will be  done either with the collaboration of the United States or with  the participation of several friendly countries. This force will  receive training not only in maintaining order and safety, but  also in respect for the law and the Constitution.    The two delegations reviewed several branches of activity in  which Haitian-Canadian cooperation will be broadened following  the return of democracy to Haiti: education, literacy,  cooperative communication, and energy. Also discussed was a  radio station that would allow the Haitian people to be well  informed about what is being done and said on their behalf  throughout the world. This would break the rule of silence and  disinformation imposed by the military regime.    This press communique is signed by Jean-Claude Martineau,  spokesman for President Aristide.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Unigate gain Milk producer Unigate firmed as rumours over the possible sale of its stake in Dutch group Nutricia resurfaced. Unigate has a 34 per cent shareholding in the baby food manufacturer, most of which it gained when it sold Nutricia, its Cow and Gate food business, in 1981. Speculation over Unigate's next move has featured intermittently in the stock market ever since, with some suggestions that the UK group might at some stage be considering a full bid. However, yesterday's talk favoured a disposal and the shares gained 3 at 366p. Heinz, of the US, Swiss group Nestle and Germany's Altana were being linked with the gossip which, if true, would most likely be followed by a full bid. Analysts estimated the stake's worth at around Pounds 250m. Channel tunnel operator Eurotunnel lost a strong early advance to end a penny off at 278p. The group reported a 67.7 per cent take-up of the UK part of its Pounds 858m rights issue. A quiet day's trading in Thorn EMI followed the release of the MMC inquiry into compact disc prices, which dealers said had already been discounted in the shares. The report cleared the record companies of collusion, a result which had been widely leaked to the market several weeks ago. Thorn also announced after the market closed that it had reached agreement on the sale of its defence business to Thomson-CSF, of France. Analysts said the long-awaited disposal would hasten the demerger of the leisure group into its music and rental constituents. The shares eased 2 to 1043p. First Leisure slid a further 10 to 279p following results on Wednesday considered by the market as mildly disappointing. But the continued weakness led some specialists to the belief that the shares could be undergoing a rerating. Grand Metropolitan retreated 15 to 390p on 6.7m traded as Smith New Court trimmed its 1995 profits forecast from Pounds 1bn to Pounds 957m. Clearing bank TSB fell 9 to 211p after reporting half-year profits of Pounds 226m, up from Pounds 80m previously and in line with market forecasts. TSB also confirmed market speculation that it intends to buy a big building society. Engineering group ML Holdings rose 4 to 45p after several brokers upgraded current year profits expectations following the group's return to profit. It reported profits of Pounds 5.2m, against an Pounds 11.2m loss in the previous year. A Rolls-Royce presentation to analysts and institutions in the City generated little enthusiasm for the stock, which finished a penny softer at 181p after trade of 7.2m. Business services group BET firmed a penny to 115p after NatWest Securities turned more positive on the stock. NatWest said: 'With the risk factor much reduced, and personnel and textile rental sensitive to improving employment trends, we can no longer be negative on the stock.' Results from Southern Electric were at the top end of market forecasts and the shares ran up 6 to 559p. There were mixed fortunes for four new stocks. Book publishers Bloomsbury Publications came to the market at 105p and was bought up to 110p, while VCI slid 9 to 141p. Property agency Chesterton fell 3 1/2 from its issue price to close at 100 1/2 p. Fragrance house CPL Aromas ended the session 10 ahead at 160p. Other statistics, Page 27</p>

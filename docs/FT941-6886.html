			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / IMF demands may delay debtdeal for Brazil Citibank, the closing agent for Brazil's rescheduling of its private bank debt, is ready to extend the deal's notification deadline. This suggests concern over whether the International Monetary Fund will approve the country's economic reforms. The proposed extension comes at a difficult moment for Mr Fernando Henrique Cardoso, finance minister. He is expected to announce today the next step in his economic restructuring programme, and is running out of time to close the bank deal and launch a bid for Brazil's presidency. Citibank had announced a deadline of March 11 for notification by Brazil that the exchange of old debt for new would go ahead on April 15, the last date possible under existing agreements. Brazil needs an IMF accord before the US Treasury will issue zero-coupon bonds to guarantee part of the package. But Citibank is now looking to extend the notification deadline for up to a week. 'We are studying the possibility of giving notice of the debt exchange a few days later than March 11,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman. An IMF team is in Brazil looking at the reform package announced by Mr Cardoso. This includes the promise of a balanced budget this year and a planned new currency. The country is plagued by annual inflation of about 2,500 per cent. But the IMF is thought to be pushing Brazil to run a budget surplus. It may also be reluctant to grant Brazil an accord until Mr Cardoso's package is implemented, especially given the country's record of signing then ignoring letters of intent with the IMF. According to a Brazilian banker, Citibank's decision does not mean the Dollars 52bn (Pounds 35bn) rescheduling is yet threatened, but it does suggest discussions with the IMF are tense. If the IMF does not sign the accord, the creditor banks could arrange a further extension, although this would be difficult for technical and timing reasons. As an alternative, Brazil could buy the zero-coupon bonds in the market, but this would be expensive and there may not be enough bonds available. The extension may frustrate any presidential ambitions of Mr Cardoso. Brazilian law requires that he resign and declare his candidature by April 2 for the election in October. He is thought to want to run, but only if his reforms are on course and the bank deal is concluded. After Citibank's extension, and delays to his economic package, he is running out of time to act. Mr Rhodes said the outcome of the IMF's discussions with Brazil should be 'clear within a couple of weeks. I remain optimistic there will be an IMF letter of intent no later than a month from now and the exchange of documents on April 15 will go ahead,' he said. Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: The US has dropped its long-running trade case against Brazil's patent, trademark and copyright laws, amid praise by the US trade representative for Brazil's 'continued progress in improving protection of intellectual property rights' and 'its leadership role through early implementation of the Uruguay Round intellectual property provisions.' Ending several days of intense negotiations, as Brazil sought to head off sanctions, Mr Mickey Kantor, the representative, praised new Brazilian regulations on technology transfer and increased efforts to enforce trademark and copyright laws. Brazil also has promised to introduce amendments to a pending industrial property law to strengthen protections.</p>

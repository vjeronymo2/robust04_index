			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Bulgaria orders out Zhirinovsky Bulgaria has ordered the Russian ultra-nationalist leader Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky to leave within 24 hours, saying he insulted President Zhelyu Zhelev and endangered relations with its neighbours, Agencies report from Sofia. Mr Zhirinovsky, who arrived on Saturday, had described his Bulgarian friend and adviser, Mr Svetoslav Stoilov, as the country's next president. He also accused Bulgaria's neighbours, Greece and Turkey, of planning to conquer the Balkans and described Romania as an 'artificial state'. He was booed by angry Bulgarians when he placed flowers at a memorial to Russian soldiers. Jill Barshay adds from Moscow: Official results of Russia's December 12 general election, published yesterday, confirm the strong showing of nationalist and former Communist parties. In the lower house of parliament, or state duma, Mr Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic party secured 64 seats, followed by the pro-reform Russia's Choice with 58 seats. Other results were: Communist party (48), Agrarian party (33), Women of Russia (23), Yabloko (22), Party of Russian Unity and Concord (19), the Democratic Party of Russia (14), other parties (33) and those with no party affiliation gained 130 seats.</p>

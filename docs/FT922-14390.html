			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / International Company News: La Cinq puts MMB in the red MMB, the French holding company that controls the Matra electronics group and the Hachette media empire, will go into the red in 1991 because of the losses incurred by La Cinq, the French television station managed by Hachette which went out of business last Friday. Last Friday the Paris commercial court decided to wind up La Cinq following weeks of fruitless attempts to find a rescuer for the station. Earlier last week Hachette which, like Matra, is chaired by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere, announced that it had been forced to restructure its finances following an overall loss of up to FFr3.5bn (Dollars 637m) on its 18-month investment in La Cinq. Hachette is not only one of the largest shareholders in La Cinq, with a 25 per cent stake, but may also have to compensate the financial partners that it introduced to the station. Yesterday MMB disclosed that La Cinq's losses meant it would produce a negative result for 1991. Neither Hachette nor Matra have yet published their 1991 results. Hachette fell into losses during the first half of the year because of La Cinq's problems and Matra suffered a steep fall in profits due to weak demand from its key customers in the defence and telecoms sectors. Earlier this year Mr Lagardere surprised the Paris stock market by announcing plans to merge Hachette and Matra. He described their combined operations as a 'two headed eagle' claiming that so far they had been unable to derive any benefit from their common ownership under MMB. The details of the merger - which would create a group with FFr54.3bn in sales and FFr1.1bn of net profits according to their 1990 accounts - have yet to be announced. However, last week Hachette said that it planned to press ahead with plans to combine its operations with those of Matra, notwithstanding its own financial restructuring.</p>

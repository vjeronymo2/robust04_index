			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (5): Rich potential in Latin America - Growth markets / Deregulation and an unprecedented opening to cross-border trade are having a profound effect on increasingly sophisticated markets in the region MARKET FOCUS: Here, and on the following eight pages, FT corrspondents report on export opportunities to Latin America, China, Russia and Africa. The opening to international capital, tariff reductions and anti-protectionist measures have stimulated an upturn in trade in Latin America. In response to rapid change, exporters into the region are making investments in manufacturing plants and other facilities to secure their place in increasingly sophisticated markets. 'We wouldn't see any stumbling blocks at all to operating out of the region. They are pretty accommodating in Latin America, but ten years ago it was a different story: US companies then were mainly concentrating on Europe,' says Jason Wright, a senior vice-president of US food group RJR Nabisco. The group had been established in Latin America for well over a decade, selling into markets as diverse as Colombia, Peru, Costa Rica, Brazil and Mexico when last April it purchased a 70 per cent stake in Argentinian biscuit-maker EM Terrabusi. Buying into a manufacturer with market capitalisation of Dollars 280m 'expanded our scope from a smaller business we were involved in there,' says Mr Wright. Many other companies have decided to make investments which allow them to export to a target market from within its borders. Procter &amp; Gamble's (P&amp;G's) acquisition of Argentinian food giant Bunge y Born's 78 per cent stake in Compania Quimica, which makes detergents, for Dollars 52.5m, formed part of a strategy to establish the company's regional penetration. P&amp;G was already operating in Venezuela - where it has a regional headquarters - Chile, Peru and Brazil, as well as Argentina, where in 1991 it established a 50:50 joint venture with a local company, Equimal, producing disposable nappies and other sanitary products. 'What we have done in a number of these countries is to look for access to product categories where our market share is negligible or non-existent,' says Bill Dobson, P&amp;G's director of international public affairs. P&amp;G seeks out strong, established brands. 'We look for companies with a strong operating base, regional sales and a strong manufacturing capacity,' Mr Dobson says. 'We look to start from a place other than zero.' The size of the Argentinian consumer market has encouraged others to invest. The UK's Cadbury Schweppes bought 80 per cent of the equity of a privately-owned confectionary company, Productos Stani, to gain a foothold in the region where, according to Cadbury Schweppes, confectionery production in Argentina alone amounts to around 130,000 tonnes annually. The size of Brazil's domestic market is a crucial factor behind many decisions to invest heavily in the country, despite the fact that, as Mr Ron Brown, the US Commerce Secretary said during a business mission in July, it 'is still a relatively closed market.' Brazil has, however, opened up its market over the past four years. Imports increased by 18.2 per cent in the first quarter of 1994 on a year-on-year basis, including increases in consumer durables of 71.9 per cent and capital goods of 29.7 per cent. Investors in Brazil include the UK's Pilkington Group, which plans a Dollars 100m float glass plant, based on the potential offered by 150m potential consumers and growth in industrial production. Selling into a large domestic market provides the impetus to establish investment-led operations. These may then service smaller neighbouring markets. P&amp;G sells into Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and Ecuador from Argentina and Brazil. The Ford motor company's Venezuelan affiliate sells some assembled products into the Ecuadorian and Colombian markets, benefitting from reciprocal tariff agreements. Cross-border business is being made easier by regional trade pacts. Multinationals, including Du Pont and Dow Chemicals, chose Colombia as a regional base partly because of its potential to service other Andean Pact countries. Cadbury was partly attracted to Argentinian confectioner Stani because of its developing export business in the Mercosur region. 'The economies in Latin America are now opening, but this is a very recent phenomenon and not yet fully established,' says Theo Carnier, Dow's director of communications for Brazil. In this process, trade pacts 'helped us a lot,' he says, and in November 1993 Dow transferred its regional office from Mexico to Sao Paolo 'to be near our markets.' Among the leading pacts are the following: Mercosur, forming a market worth Dollars 600bn a year, serving 190m people in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Internal trade has more than doubled since the agreement was signed in 1991. The Andean Pact, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and Peru, has also agreed to a common external tariff to be implemented from 1995 within its area of around 100m people. Trade among members grew by around 30 per cent in 1993. The Group Of Three, signed on 14 June by Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico. Colombia and Venezuela will reduce their duties on Mexican imports by an average of 21 per cent on 1 January 1995, while Mexico will cut its tariffs by 32 per cent. Some degree of protection remains built in, with, for example, a 13-year transition period for the automotive industry. The North American Free Trade Agreement, linking the US, Canada and Mexico is attracting manufacturers south of the Rio Grande. There is still much to be set in place before companies can invest in the knowledge they are working in a European-type single market. Bureaucracy can remain byzantine across the region. Transport links are often primitive. Not all emerging markets have shown great enthusiasm for multilateral trade accords, including the star performer among economic reformers, Chile. Chile has fought shy of regional groupings, while developing a network of bilateral trade agreements and encouraging investment by promoting its strong commitment to free market principles. The movement of foreign capital into Latin American markets seems irreversible, although there are contraints. Latin America has been a growth market for the Ford motor company, for example, but 'it has nothing like the dimensions attached to Asia,' says Mr Ken Brown, Ford's public affairs manager for the region. For smaller companies, focusing on national markets will remain imperative. But for even the smallest exporters, markets are changing and a regional market is emerging in which ease of access to cross-border trade, as well as the scale of the main domestic market, are becoming critical factors.

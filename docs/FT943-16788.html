			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Queens Moat debenture agreement Queens Moat Houses, the hotel group, said yesterday it had reached initial agreement with its debenture stock holders on the financial restructuring proposals it intended to put to its shareholders. Queens Moat said that while the debenture stockholders' steering committee was still awaiting full details of the restructuring, the agreement in principle was a significant step forward. The debenture stock holders have rights over a list of Queens Moat hotels. Mr Andrew Coppel, chief executive, said the group's next task was to reach agreement with creditor banks over the restructuring of its Pounds 1.22bn debt. He said talks with the banks were making 'encouraging progress'. The debenture stock holders had agreed not to enforce the security on their stocks until June 30. Although this date had now passed, Queens Moat said it was sufficiently encouraged by the agreement it had reached to feel that it did not need to request an extension. The holders of the two debenture stocks - the 10 per cent First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2020 and the 12 per cent First Mortgage Debenture Stock 2013  -first agreed to waive their right to enforce their security last November. The waiver was extended a second time in April.</p>

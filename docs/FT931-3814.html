			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Records: Top notch requiems - Ronald Crichton reviews two Brahms requiems and Gounod's 'Mors et Vita' TWO recordings of the German Requiem of Brahms may come as a revelation to those with early memories of partly amateur performances - voices strained, strings scraped and wind squealed or burbled. The shock comes not only from first-rate singing and playing but from the use of period (1860) instruments  -among the obvious gains are sparing use of string vibrato and hard drumsticks. The profound sighs of the opening of the new EMI set with the Schutz Choir of London and the London Classical Players under Roger Norrington (CDC 7 54658 2), will immediately show what I mean. As well as clarity Norrington's reading has a plainness and restraint both unexpectedly moving and well matched to the religious side of Brahms's temperament. Baptised a Lutheran in Hamburg, he did not become an orthodox believer, but was a devoted student of the Bible. From the Bible he chose the text for the Requiem, less concerned with the peaceful repose of the dead than with consolation for the bereaved living. Norrington's reticence does not exclude high drama: the timpani at the climax of the second movement (the slow march in three-four time), are terrifying. The more impenetrable, thicket-like pages of the fugal sections are less daunting than usual. Those who like a more generally dramatic approach and a warmer, more resonant acoustic may try the 1991 Philips version with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Monteverdi Choir and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique (432 140-2). In his booklet note Gardiner talks of laying bare the rock face of Brahms's texture. It turns out to have quite a few plants clinging to it, but many will think no worse of it for that. The two last movements in particular are impressively handled. For once the consoling final pages sound like a real ending and the arch form of the whole is perceptible. Gardiner's soloists, Charlotte Margiono and Rodney Gilfry, are luxurious. The soprano's exquisite, ethereal notes remind me of an admired Bach singer of the inter-war years, Dorothy Silk. Norrington's Lynne Dawson and Olaf Bar, less luscious, are equally convincing. Norrington's speeds are slightly faster. There is room on his disc for the Burial Song, op. 13, another revealing glimpse of the North German side of Brahms. For a complete contrast turn to Gounod's Mors et Vita (with Michel Plasson conducting the Orfeon Donostiarra and the Toulouse Capitole Orchestra (EMI CDS 754459 2, 2 CDs). Gounod was a Catholic who came under the influence of the Dominican preacher Lacordaire and at one time contemplated entering the priesthood. For most of his career he was torn between the attractions of sacred and profane love - but more prosaically, between church and opera house. Mors et Vita, a 'sacred trilogy', was written for the Birmingham Festival of 1885 as a continuation of Gounod's Redemption, given there with huge success a few years earlier. Mors et Vita was dedicated to the Pope, Leo XIII, whose sermons Gounod had translated into French. The first and longest of the three parts is a Requiem, using the traditional Latin text. The style of the Trilogy is clearly designed for large, resonant buildings (town halls, the Albert Hall or Westminster Cathedral), where the echoes can prolong the sound of the slow-moving harmonies. Outwardly simple music, (eminently) accessible to large audiences. Accessible, but not trivial or vulgar. There is an a cappella double chorus (Gounod adored Palestrina); elsewhere the smooth surface is ruffled by chromatic flurries, and there are hints (quite sinister in this context) of the whole-tone scale. The large orchestra is discreetly used. Plasson's soloists are distinguished: Barbara Hendricks, John Aler and Jose van Dam spin their grateful lines with faultlessly even tone. The alto, Nadine Denize, blends easily in spite of greater vibrancy in her fine voice. The choir from San Sebastian offer a rich, firm body of sound but they make less of the Latin words than the English choirs do of Luther's German in Brahms. Plasson steers a skilful course between the twin dangers of hustle and inertia.</p>

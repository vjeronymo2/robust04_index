			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yakov Plyays: "Captive of the Bloc Struggle: </F> Foreign Policy of the New Russia in the Programs of the Election  Blocs Represented in the Parliament of the Russian Federation"]    [Text] The Agrarian Party, Women of Russia, the DPR  [Democratic Party of Russia], and the PRES [Party of Russian  Unity and Accord] mustered fewer votes than the others and  either have none at all or have very inadequate foreign policy  concepts. Women of Russia speak in their program merely about a  strengthening of the "international authority of Russia and the  development of equal mutually profitable cooperation with the  CIS countries and other foreign states in the interests of  stability, peace, and security."    The PRES has a more extensive program, but it also is very  general and abstract. While advocating a union of the peoples of  the former USSR and East Europe which gravitate toward one  another and the development within the framework of the CIS of  "confederative relations," the PRES at the same time believes  that Russia's foreign policy should be that of a "great world  power" and that the country should rely on its own efforts and  proceed from its own national interests. It is hard to raise any  objection to such assertions. But are the goals that have been  formulated realistic and attainable in the foreseeable future?  Hardly.    According to the DPR's program, "foreign policy should  support the realization of our economic interests," and  "Russia's political influence should be directed toward a  strengthening of the positions of our enterprises on overseas  markets, increased exports, the lifting of discriminatory  barriers, and a strengthening of trade and economic relations."  Like all the other parties and blocs, the DPR did not overlook  the problem of the CIS. Travkin's party puts the building of  integration relations within the framework of the Commonwealth  in the first circle of its interests. And this is as far as it  all goes. Which, objectively, is little enough for so notable a  party in Russian political life as the DPR. Little enough, but  still more than with the Agrarian Party, in whose program a  foreign policy section is lacking altogether.    When interpreting the foreign policy sections of the above  blocs, several questions involuntarily arise. What position will  they hold in parliament, for example, during the discussion and,  particularly, during the adoption of decisions on foreign policy  matters? Or will they not be chess figures that are manipulated  in their own interests by stronger rivals or leaders? These and  similar questions are far from far-fetched, particularly if the  overall alignment of forces in the future parliament is  considered. And it is such that the end result could be  influenced appreciably by the fluctuations of even small blocs  or factions, not to mention their joint appearance on someone or  other's side.    In offering the electorate its program the Russia's Choice  bloc clearly proceeded from the foreign policy doctrine of  Russia published back in spring of this year. This coincidence  is not fortuitous, of course. If only because if was from this  bloc that Andrey Kozyrev, the present head of Russia's Foreign  Ministry, ran for deputy.    Although new points appeared in the Russia's Choice foreign  policy platform--policy in respect to the "near abroad" is  clearer and more detailed, for example--on the whole, the  overall thrust of the doctrine remains unchanged. But however  much we would like as soon as possible to become affiliated to  the liberal-democratic world and to resemble it, this will not  happen in the foreseeable future. Not because the path leading  here is long and thorny, but mainly because the particular  features of Russia and the mentality of its people (NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA has well-foundedly addressed this subject repeatedly) do  not permit this. If we proceed from this, the overall policy of  Russia's Choice, including its foreign policy course, is wrong  and must for this reason inevitably go bankrupt. Judging by the  events of 1993, the final months particularly, the results of  the Duma elections included, resistance to this policy has been  growing constantly and assuming new, increasingly serious forms.  In the new parliament this resistance will be great and will  intensify rapidly, including in the foreign policy sphere. A  serious struggle under conditions where no force is clearly  preponderant will enable some populist, in fact, dangerous  extremist figures, representatives of the LDPR [Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia] in particular, to attract some  deputies and a part of society that is even bigger than prior to  the elections.    The foreign policy doctrine of the LDPR is the direct  opposite of all the others. Its main feature is aggressiveness,  more, unconcealed bellicosity, which is atypical of all the  other programs. This needs no proof.    Although the foreign policy part of the program of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation is not as extensive or  developed as with Russia's Choice, the LDPR, and YABLoko  [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc], it exists, nonetheless. But  the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has simply been  unable to abandon the class approach or the ideological  blinders. This is manifested if only in the evaluation of the  most important factors that characterize today's international  relations. And at the same time, however, a renunciation of the  overemphasis on ideology characteristic, in particular, of the  Soviet period and the at times unjustified geopolitical  pretensions connected with it is considered an essential element  of Russia's foreign policy.    The foreign policy part of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  bloc  would seem to be the one which is most balanced and appropriate  to domestic and international conditions. It is evident  throughout that it was written by an experienced and competent  hand.    A special section of the program is devoted to relations  within the framework of the CIS, which is entirely justified.  Declaring that this sphere is the priority of Russian foreign  policy, YABLoko goes on to note that the purpose of the bloc is  the "all-around (economic, cultural, defense) integration of the  former Union republics exclusively on a voluntary basis."    YABLoko's program has not lost sight of any in any way  important direction of foreign policy. While rightly observing  that "the foreign policy of the new Russia should be as  pragmatic as possible," YABLoko emphasizes attention to the fact  that "Russia's geopolitical position requires Russian foreign  policy's equivalent attention to Europe, the United States,  Central and South Asia, and the Far East." The program  formulates precisely the principles of the country's foreign  policy and its goals and priority and long-term tasks. The  particular efforts of Russian diplomacy, YABLoko believes,  should be geared to the molding of foreign policy support for  the economic transformations in the country and the promotion of  Russian goods and services on foreign markets and the  integration of our economy in the world economy on an equal,  mutually beneficial basis.    Within the framework of its overall strategy YABLoko  advocates partnership with the West, but on the basis of a sober  balance of the interests and possibilities of both sides. "Our  interests," the program says, in part, "largely coincide. The  current differences determined by the specifics of geopolitical  interests and national and cultural traditions are natural and  are not of an antagonistic nature. They can and should be  overcome exclusively by way of political consultations, with an  explanation and defense of our particular position."    Russia is entering, if it has not already entered, a  qualitatively new period of its development, which will  undoubtedly make a strong impression on its foreign policy. In  the new situation there is a very great probability that it is  foreign policy that will be the object of fierce and  uncompromising struggle between the parliamentary blocs or their  captive.    The tremendous difference in the programs of the election  blocs will contribute to this to a considerable extent and will  hardly disappear with time. The contrary, rather, an  uncompromising struggle in parliament, for which many deputies  are already attuned, will harden the adversaries even more.</p>

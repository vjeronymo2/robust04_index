			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Frolov, chief specialist of the </F> Territorial Agency of the Federal Administration on Insolvency  Matters (Bankruptcy) in Novosibirsk Oblast: "The Law on  Bankruptcy: How To Assist Debtor-Enterprises"]    [Text] Under conditions of a general slump in the  volume of production, the result of a myriad reasons, a majority  of large state enterprises and enterprises in which there is a  share of state property face the need to find ways of surviving.  Many are not up to the task.    Of course, objective reasons are being felt to a significant  degree: First and foremost, the reduction in the state order for  products of the military-industrial complex.    There are subjective reasons also. The managers of many  enterprises continue to set their hopes on assistance from the  Ministry of Finance, branch ministries, and various  authoritative structures, instead of working in an earnest way  on actual conversion themselves, while attracting nonstate  investments. It is understandable that in attracting outside  investors (including foreign investors), the management of an  enterprise ends up under their additional control. Not everyone  likes this. Others simply do not want to part with any benefits  that generally do not depend on the results of work. Up to the  present, substantial nonproduction expenditures exist at a  majority of enterprises, and there is an unjustifiably big gap  between the wages of managers and those of the rest of the  personnel at a number of enterprises. The results of unskilled  management are well known--concealed unemployment, insolvency of  enterprises, a breakdown in communications, etc. As a result,  there is an increase in the dissatisfaction of the population  threatening a social explosion.    The conduct of a state policy directed at preventing the  bankruptcy of state enterprises and reducing state expenditures  to support insolvent enterprises has been entrusted to the  Federal Administration on Insolvency Matters (Bankruptcy) and  its territorial agencies.    Supporting enterprises, in the event that the Court of  Arbitration considers them insolvent, will be implemented either  by means of reorganization (the conduct of external  administration of the debtor-enterprise, or financial  restoration of the enterprise), or by means of opening  competitive production. Also possible is the conclusion of an  amicable settlement between debtor and creditors in accordance  with the Law of the Russian Federation "On Insolvency  (Bankruptcy) of Enterprises." The law provides a procedure for  the assignment of an arbitration supervisor with wide powers to  a debtor-enterprise. At the same time, a moratorium is  introduced as a form of support for the period of outside  administration to satisfy the demands of the creditors on the  debtor. But if a capable supervisor himself is unable to pull an  enterprise out of debt, the enterprise can be declared bankrupt  and is subject to sale in a competition. In this case, benefits  for the labor collective can be envisioned as conditions of the  competition.    The Ministry of Economics of the Russian Federation has  developed criteria for the adoption of decisions on rendering  state support and financial restoration. Coming under state  support are enterprises that: produce products, or are able to  produce products after receiving state support; presently have  or will have market demand in the next year or two; are capable  of improving their production, economic, and social indices;  produce products at prices that satisfy the market; do not  excessively raise wages for their workers; do not needlessly  increase profits and prices for products; and employ, or will be  able to employ, advanced technology after receiving support,  including ecologically safe technology. A very important  condition for rendering state support is the presence at the  enterprise of a technically and economically justified plan of  measures for improving the health of the enterprise (financial  restoration project).    Considering that check privatization is coming to an end,  many insolvent enterprises are given a chance to acquire  additional financial means through the mechanism of conversion.  Inasmuch as some of the money obtained from the sale of state  property will remain at the enterprise that has been reorganized  into a joint-stock company. Of course, the shares of a  debtor-enterprise will be bought up only in the event a  well-studied development program is available. In this case, the  territorial agency is called on to perform the role of an  expert, because the interests of the state as the owner are  involved here.    It should be emphasized once more that the task of the  territorial agency, as well as of the entire Federal  Administration on Matters of Insolvency (Bankruptcy), is not to  supplement the budget by liquidating enterprises, but to assist  insolvent enterprises in acquiring financial independence. The  resources of the federal budget and branch and interbranch  off-budget funds will be directed to this end.</p>

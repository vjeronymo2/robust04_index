Lu's success filled a blank page in the history of the  Chinese aviation industry, according to experts of the Test  Flight Research Institute of China.    When a stalling spiral happens, an airplane stalls in  mid-air  and drops spinning at an accelerating speed, which leads to a  crash.    For decades, the test has not been tried on advanced  Chinese-made fighters. But Lu Jun took on the task last  December, and succeeded in 78 stalling spirals during 21 flights  in a new type of Chinese-made airplane at an altitude of 11,000  m.    Lu has test-flown airplanes of ten models in three kinds in  the past.</p>

			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> OLSON IN STONESY SETTING WITH EX-STONE, SIDE STONE  </P> <P> Local rocker Carla Olson, erstwhile leader of the Textones, has traveled her  share of musical courses but always seemed at her best in a hard-rocking,  Stonesy setting. And what better way to showcase those tendencies than to  finally hire on a couple of actual Rolling Stones?  </P> <P> Well, an ex-Stone and a side-Stone, to be precise -- guitarist Mick Taylor and  keyboard player Ian McLagan, respectively, both part of the crack new band  Olson showed off in two shows Sunday at the Roxy that were recorded for a  planned live album.  </P> <P> Imagine the Stones in their very bluesiest, early '70s mode, complete with  plenty of cigarette smoke swirling up from around the guitar necks, but led by  a really nice gal. To make the illusion complete, Olson did sing a few vintage  numbers from the "Sticky Fingers" and "Goats Head Soup" era, and Taylor himself  chimed in with a couple of lead vocals to go along with his slide work.  </P> <P> The bulk of the material, though, was Olson's, either from the Textones'  "Midnight Mission" album of six years back or newer material from a recent solo  album released only in Europe.  </P> <P> For Olson fans, these shows were clearly a relief after a considerably  disappointing second Textones album three years ago and a subsequent duet album  with Gene Clark that found her in a less appropriate folkie mold. Welcome back.  </P> <P> For Taylor fans, this was an all-too-rare chance to check out the legend of The  Guy Who Quit the Stones and Even Jagger Doesn't Know Why in a worthy context --  at home in exile on the Sunset Strip, if you will.

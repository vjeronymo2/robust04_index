			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic response to Compagnie Bancaire Dollars 400m issue THE DOLLAR sector of the international bond market had its first sell-out for some time yesterday when Compagnie Bancaire came to the international bond market with its first big dollar issue. 'It was one of the deals of the year so far,' said a rapturous banker, echoing the sentiment elsewhere. 'People are clamouring for more.' The reason: the Dollars 400m issue, later raised to Dollars 500m due to demand, was priced at a seemingly generous level, given the poor state of the dollar swaps market. The indicated spread over US Treasuries of the 10-year issue, to be priced today, was 75-78 basis points, though the final pricing is expected to be at a 75 basis points spread. That was seen as a fair spread for the AA-rated borrower. However, were the proceeds to be swapped into floating rate dollars at that level, the cost to the borrower would be about 45-50 basis points over the London inter bank offered rate (Libor) - some 20-25 basis points above the level at which Cie Bancaire might normally expect to borrow, according to bankers close to the deal. The Cie Bancaire transaction, its first attempt to generate a following among institutional investors in the international bond market, has been planned for some weeks, perhaps helping to explain its pricing. In spite of the deterioration of the swaps market, the borrower was keen to push ahead with the deal, its main aim being to complete its first substantial transaction successfully. It is not known if the proceeds were swapped, though bankers close to the deal believed they had not been. The generous spread against Libor was said in some quarters to have prompted a degree of asset swapping - that is, banks taking fixed rate paper and selling on floating rate paper to investors. The co-lead managers to the deal are thought to have agreed not to engage in asset swapping, but other banks involved commented that it was impossible to prevent the process if the attractions were significant, as in this case. JP Morgan, which led the Cie Bancaire deal, was also credited yesterday with an Ecu150m issue for Johnson &amp; Johnson which was reported to have sold well. The five-year issue, yielding 9 per cent, was almost guaranteed to find a market among retail investors in Europe given the big-name, AAA-rated borrower, other bankers said. The yield was nine basis points above the level at which Credit Local's five-year benchmark Ecu issue was re-opened yesterday by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, taking the total size of the issue to Ecu900m. Meanwhile, the World Bank brought its first dollar floating rate issue priced against Libor, with a Dollars 250m 10-year issue organised as a block trade through Salomon. Banco Comercial Portugues (BCP) has launched an Ecu140m convertible bond issue, led by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Merrill Lynch International and Companhia de Investimentos e Servicos Financeiros (CISF), the BCP group's investment and financial services company. The bonds are convertible into BCP shares, and offer 8.75 per cent interest and a conversion premium of 16 per cent above BCP shares market price at issue date. The issue is the first convertible issue launched on the international market by a Portuguese financial institution. It forms part of a wider programme aiming to raise Esc50bn (Dollars 357bn) on the international markets and domestically to build up its international position and shareholding base.</p>

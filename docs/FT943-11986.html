			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesia to cut timber production by 28% The Indonesian government has announced plans to reduce its timber output by over 28 per cent over the next five years because excessive felling is believed to have caused floods followed by severe droughts on the country's most densely populated island of Java. Mr Djamaloedin Soeryohadikoesoemo, the minister of forestry, said that the country's timber production would be cut to 22.5m cubic metres by the turn of the century from its present level of just over 30m cu m. This month a severe drought in central Java damaged about 16,000 hectares of rice fields and is expected to lead to 3 per cent fall in Indonesia's rice output. Excessive logging is destroying the forest's crucial function of watershed protection. Plans to reduce timber output are linked to increasing concern about the extent of illegal logging in the country. The government estimates between 4m and 6m cu m a year are cut down illegally each year but environmental lobbyists say the figure is much higher. In recent months, the Ministry of Forestry has attempted to crack down on illegal logging. Mr Soeryohadikoesoemo said that 248 forest concessionaires had violated logging regulations and were being fined a total of Dollars 21m. Some concessionaires had already had their logging licences revoked. Plans are also under way to implement an eco-labelling scheme, which would provide consumers with information about the origin of wood products manufactured in Indonesia. Wood and paper products accounted for nearly a third of the total value of Indonesia's non-oil exports last year.</p>

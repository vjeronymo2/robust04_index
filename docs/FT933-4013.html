			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: LUI liabilities may reach Dollars 9bn during next 40 years TOTAL LIABILITIES of the insurance subsidiaries of London United Investments, the insurance holding group which crashed in 1990, could amount to Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.8bn), it emerged yesterday. Provisional liquidators of the Kingscroft, Walbrook, El Paso, Lime Street and Mutual Reinsurance subsidiaries (best known by the KWELM acronym) provided the new figures when they yesterday proposed a scheme of arrangement for the policyholders and creditors of the companies, numbering more than 100,000. The liquidators, Mr Chris Hughes and Mr Ian Bond of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, say that the proposed scheme is intended to speed partial payment of agreed claims. Initially they will pay between 3p and 12p in the pound, an amount which they hope will eventually rise to 40p. The KWELM companies specialised in direct liability insurance written for North American corporations and professionals, together with reinsurance of similar business by other insurers. 'To some extent it is an unfortunate aggregation of the least attractive business which was around at the time,' said Mr Hughes. Losses stem mainly from court awards in product liability, asbestos, environmental, medical malpractice and professional indemnity claims on policies underwritten between 1972 and 1980. Current best estimates of the companies' unsecured liabilities are about Dollars 5bn - however most claims are not yet known or agreed and the overall figure could rise to Dollars 9bn during the next 20 to 40 years. KWELM Management Services, the company set up by the liquidators to pay claims, will be able to reduce these liabilities through reinsurance recoveries. It expects an ultimate deficiency in the range of Dollars 3bn to Dollars 5bn. Of the estimated claims it is expected that about Dollars 1bn will be paid to policyholders who may be eligible for protection by the Policyholders' Protection Board, including certain lawyers, doctors, accountants and other professional partnerships and individuals. Currently the KWELM companies have nearly Dollars 500m theoretically available for distribution. The liquidators have collected or secured more than Dollars 280m since their appointment, including about Dollars 180m in reinsurance. Creditors are being asked to vote on the scheme proposals at a meeting to be held at the Alexandra Palace in London on 17 November.</p>

			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Closure of insolvency files sparks fraud fears Official files on thousands of liquidations and bankruptcies are to be earmarked for rapid closure in a move that will raise fears that they will escape adequate investigation for potential fraud. Staff at the government's Insolvency Service are under instructions to identify at least 11,000 cases to be closed without detailed examination between today and July 8, according to an internal memo obtained by the Financial Times. That target is more than half the number of cases completed by the service last year, and comes in response to ministerial pressure to reduce a backlog of files as rapidly as possible. The memo, written earlier this month by Mr Michael Osborne, the senior official receiver, warns that the number of investigative reports carried out by the agency will be cut below its plans. An attached guidance note says: 'You will need to review the file thoroughly, but not in depth. Do not spend time on . . . potential offences or possible areas of investigation. It is anticipated that on average it will not be necessary to spend more than an hour on each review.' The drive to close more files follows the National Audit Office's criticisms of the Insolvency Service for failing to seek disqualification of a greater proportion of company directors who have broken the law. Mr Keith Ellis, chairman of the insolvency-service branch of the Institute of Professional and Managerial Staffs, the civil-service union, said: 'It would appear that cases will be swept under the carpet because of these instructions. 'If the Insolvency Service is there to investigate offences the government should give us more resources.' He said he believed the action was being taken as part of a move to speed up the privatisation of the service. A large backlog of cases would make it less attractive and more costly for potential private-sector providers. But the Department of Trade and Industry said: 'These are old cases that have already been examined, but the department did not have the resources to see fully through to the end. When vetting takes place it is not going to be a rubber stamp. There are going to be safeguards in place.' Existing staff at Official Receivers' offices around the country are being asked during the next month to identify the extra files to be closed from cases of bankruptcy and company failure that are more than six months old. These case files will then be forwarded to a special office in Manchester for formal 'closure', which will be mainly conducted by junior casual employees drafted in for the purpose. The total completed last year was 21,126 against a target of 24,000.</p>

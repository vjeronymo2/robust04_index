			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / London Stock Exchange: Stubborn FT-SE confounds investors THE UK equity market's dogged refusal to respond to the recent series of positive data on the domestic economy continued to confound and confuse the investment community yesterday. Some dealers again took the view that the big international institutions have been quietly shifting funds from the UK market to other European centres, notably Frankfurt. There were more stories circulating yesterday that one of the large European banks had taken out more big put options on the FT-SE 100. Market operators spoke of a Pounds 250m Footsie put option being taken out on Wednesday. Others said the market would remain becalmed until the international and retail tender part of BT3 closed later today. Another view was that there was no real value in UK stocks. At the close of another diff-icult trading session in London, the FT-SE 100 was 0.6 down on balance at 2,831.7, its fourth decline in the past five trading sessions. Without the support of a handful of strong performances, notably from Great Universal Stores, Lloyds Bank and BAT Industries, the FT-SE 100 would have been around four points lower yesterday. There was some measure of consolation for investors, however, in the performance of the market's second-line issues, with the FT-SE Mid 250 index managing to stay in positive territory throughout the day and closing a net three points higher at 3,225.5. The session began on a bright note, with the market opening two points firmer, with the initial rise entirely due to the upsurge in GUS shares as the retailing group comfirmed recent market rumours that it was to enfranchise its 'A' non-voting shares and reduce the post-enfranchised shares via a scrip issue. The moves accompanied an increase in preliminary profits and a bullish view of current trading. GUS's move prompted keen interest in other stocks with similar voting structures, such as WH Smith, Securicor, Whitbread and Hammerson. After the initial burst of enthusiasm caused by GUS, the market calmed down and thereafter moved in a narrow range, in spite of a series of positive economic and corporate news items. The retailing sector, already in good form, picked up further as Marks and Spencer's chairman told the group's annual meeting that the company had made a good start to the year. Much of the proceeds of Wednesday's big placing in Abbey National was reinvested in Lloyds Bank and Prudential, while Morgan Stanley's buy recommendation triggered some big US-sourced buying of BAT. News of yet another reduction in unemployment in the UK, the fifth successive decline, and a sharp fall in UK unit wage costs, saw the Footsie edge higher. Thereafter, the market did little more than drift back in idle trading, with sentiment given a slight knock when Wall Street came in lower and continued to lose ground. Traders took encouragement from the level of turnover in the market. Some 611m shares changed hands yesterday, well up from recent levels. Stock Exchange figures revealed that the value of customer business in the market on Wendesday was a healthy Pounds 1.39bn. Activity was boosted by a series of sizeable placings.</p>

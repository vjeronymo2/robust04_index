The United  States, which refused Iraqi participation in the conference,  joined France in criticizing the "nuclear ambitions" of North  Korea.    In a message to the Conference on Disarmament, U.S.  President  Clinton underlined on Tuesday that "the first priority" is to  quickly conclude a treaty on a complete ban of all nuclear  tests. This objective was made possible in light of the  consensus reached among the five recognized nuclear powers  (China, United States, France, Great Britain, and Russia) in  1993.    However, French Ambassador Gerard Errera, who was elected  conference president, noted that "it is hardly conceivable that  the five powers will agree to impose new constraints on  themselves if other countries remain free to develop clandestine  nuclear armament programs."  <H5>  North Korea Condemned </H5>   Ambassador Errera denounced the refusal by North Korea to  "meet its international commitments in the field of  nonproliferation." That country is opposed to the inspection of  facilities which are suspected of engaging in the development of  atomic bombs.    John Holum, director of the U.S. Disarmament Agency,  mentioned the possibility of a nuclear arms race in the Middle  East and between India and Pakistan, but he also pointed out the  progress made in Latin America and Africa in this regard.  <H5>  Enlargement </H5>   An issue to be solved is the enlargement of the membership  of  the Conference on Disarmament (currently 37 states), so as to  allow a better regional breakdown and to include "threshold  countries" which have the capability of acquiring the nuclear  bomb.    The United States recalled on Tuesday that it did not oppose  an application by North Korea. It turned down Iraq's request,  however, as that country is under UN Security Council sanctions  and "disregards" UN resolutions.</p>

"If the United States decides to make sanctions against us we  can answer. These sanctions are pressure against us so we are  prepared for war or peace," North Korean Counsellor to Beijing  Choe Han-chun told journalists.    North Korea has refused to accept International Atomic  Energy  Agency (IAEA) inspections of facilities in Yongbyon, north of  Pyongyang, suspected by Western countries of storing plutonium  for making nuclear weapons. Washington and Seoul have warned  Pyongyang that it would face concerted international action,  most likely sanctions, if it fails to agree to inspections  before February 21, when the IAEA convenes a board of governors'  meeting.    Choe said the hardline Stalinist state would agree to  inspections only when "the United States is not trying to force  us and make the circumstances to receive the inspection."  However, he reiterated that his country would not open all its  facilities to "irregular and ad hoc" inspections, as the IAEA is  demanding. "To inspect all facilities means we give full scope  inspection -- we did not promise this inspection to the United  States. We promised only for guaranteeing the continuity of the  safeguard," he said. Choe said the situation on the Korean  peninsula would remain "dangerous and still strained" until the  United States and South Korea called off planned Team Spirit  military exercises.    China -- which has veto power on the U.N. Security Council  --  has opposed sanctions, cautioning that they could drive isolated  North Korea to an unpredictable response and urging the United  States to continue negotiations.</p>

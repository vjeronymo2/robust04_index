			<p>BFN     [Text] In the Kashmir Valley, a near total bundh [strike]  is being observed today as a mark of protest against the killing  by militants of the religious scholar and mirwaiz [religious  leader] of South Kashmir, Dr. Qazi Nissar Ahmad. Shops and  business establishments are closed and traffic is off the roads.  In Anantnag, thousands of people are visiting the idgah [place  of worship] to pay their last homage to Dr. Qazi Nissar Ahmad.  Dr. Ahmad's body was brought there this morning for burial in  the afternoon. Spontaneous protest demonstrations by people  against militants of the Hizbul Mojahedin and their mentors in  Pakistan have been held at several places in the Kashmir valley  since yesterday. About one lakh persons participated in Qazi  Nissar's funeral procession from Dayalgam to Anantnag yesterday.    In Srinagar, a building of school run by the Jamaat-i-Islami  was burnt down by an irate mob yesterday. Reports say the  militants of the Hizbul Mojahedin and workers of Jamaat-i-Islami  have fled from their homes in several areas fearing the people's  wrath. The police have identified one of the killers of Dr.  Qazi Nissar Ahmad as a self-styled platoon commander of the  militant outfit.    The Indian Union Muslim League [IUML] has asked the union  government to take urgent steps to apprehend the culprits behind  Dr. Nissar Ahmad's killing. In a statement in Trivandrum, the  IUML secretary, Mr. E. Ahmad, MP, deplored the killing.</p>

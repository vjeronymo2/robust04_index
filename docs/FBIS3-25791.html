According to a source who met him in his Beijing house  recently, the former general secretary, 74, pays very close  attention to progress in the economy. "Mr Zhao is heartened that  most of the reforms he advocated before the June 4, 1989,  crackdown have been revived," the source said. "He believes the  reforms will succeed."    He quoted Mr Zhao, a former party boss of Guangdong, as  saying: "Recent developments in the province are very  meaningful." The source added Mr Zhao had in subtle fashion  expressed a desire to resume his work, at least on the economy.  He clearly believed he had a role to play after patriarch Deng  Xiaoping leaves the scene.    According to former Zhao aides who met him recently, the  ex-party chief is in very good physical and mental health. He  plays golf two to three times a week and sometimes walks his dog  in the downtown alley where he lives under police guard. "He is  not bitter about his downfall and he has reminded his friends  more than once that `whatever has happened to me (since  mid-1989) might not be that bad after all'," said another  source. "His mood has been good since the middle of last year,  and sometimes he holds forth on topics like the economy for an  hour without stopping," the source said.    Mr Zhao's friends said his daughter and son-in-law lived  with  the former leader, whose wife, however, had recently been  admitted to hospital. They said Mr Zhao had been pleased that  his youngest son, a businessman formerly based in the United  States, had returned to China on regular business trips.    It is understood the younger Mr Zhao, who travels on an  American passport, spent most of his time in Guangdong and  Hainan, and that he had visited Taiwan more than once for  business reasons. "Soon after my departure from office, there  was talk about investigation into the business activities of my  children," Mr Zhao Ziyang reportedly said. "It turns out they  have been law-abiding businessmen after all."</p>

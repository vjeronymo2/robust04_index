			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Australian trading group sells business Burns Philps, the diversified Australian food and trading group, is selling its Tradelink plumbing supplies business to G. E. Crane. The move will turn the Sydney-based Crane into Australia's largest plumbing supplies distributor. The sale is expected to raise between ADollars 50m and ADollars 75m (USDollars 34.5m to USDollars 51.7m) for Burns Philps, and comes as part of the group's strategy of divesting 'non-core' assets. The first payment is likely to be made at the end of January and will total around ADollars 44.5m, according to Crane. A second deferred payment is due in September 1996 and will be based on the future performance of Tradelink and Crane's existing plumbing supplies business, Watson &amp; Crane. To fund the initial payment, Crane announced a two-for-five rights issue, involving 7.24m new shares, at a price of ADollars 6.20 a share. This should raise around ADollars 44.9m. Crane said yesterday the acquisition would roughly double the size of its plumbing supplies operation, adding about 70 stores located across Australia. Tradelink's sales in the year to end-June were ADollars 187.6m, and profits before interest and tax were ADollars 4.6m. Burns, meanwhile, said it would use the money raised from the sale to expand its hardware division's new warehouse-style 'superstores'.</p>

			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Talks on cut-off date for the 'non-cat' car THE GOVERNMENT and the motor industry are negotiating a programme in which cars without catalytic converters still on offer after January 1 can be sold without infringing European Community exhaust emissions rules. EC environment ministers have accepted the principle of a 'reasonable' period for such sales after January 1, when an EC directive requiring every new car registered to be fitted with a 'cat' goes into effect. The UK scheme being negotiated provides for a cut-off date for building 'non-cat' cars. Cars produced after that would not be exempt. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said yesterday the date was likely to be in July. The aim is to discourage manufacturers from continuing to produce non-cat cars, in the hope of securing extra sales between now and January 1. Typically, non-cat cars are Pounds 250-Pounds 400 cheaper than the same model with a cat. Ford, Peugeot, Vauxhall and Rover discounted any prospect of January 1 arriving with large numbers of non-cat cars in the pipeline.</p>

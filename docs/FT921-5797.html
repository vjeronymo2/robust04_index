			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Ulster leaders to decide on talks formula NORTHERN Ireland ministers and local political leaders will today try to decide how formal negotiations on the province can be reopened amid news that churchmen have sought to curb loyalist paramilitary attacks. The IRA bomb attacks in London at the weekend soured faint optimism over Northern Ireland's future created by a surprise agreement late on Friday between nationalist and unionist leaders to resume 'round-table' negotiations before the general election. Mr Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, will hear details of the deal this morning and is determined to respond positively. But the proximity of the election means that, at best, only a few formal sessions are likely. As with past apparent breakthroughs, unforeseen obstacles may still emerge. There is also a suspicion that an agreement was struck only because local MPs feared entering an election having failed to reopen talks. Meanwhile it emerged that representatives of the Presbyterian Church have met members of the legal Ulster Defence Association (UDA), the largest loyalist paramilitary group. The delegation included two former moderators, Dr Jack Weir and Dr Godfrey Brown, and Dundonald minister Dr Roy Magee. Dr Magee said: 'We asked the UDA leaders how they thought we could get out of this terrible situation and pointed out the folly of the violence.' Mr Brooke will meet Irish ministers in Dublin on Friday when a suspension of further Anglo-Irish conference meetings - a Unionist precondition for talks  -could be agreed. 'Round-table' talks could start next Monday but would probably be halted if later that week Mr John Major called an election for April 9. Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two Unionist leaders, and Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party, deliberately kept a low profile over the weekend but it appears that past disagreements over what would happen if a Labour government was elected while talks were under way have been quietly dropped. Further squabbles could erupt over the Irish government's proposals for a review in 'round-table' talks of the 1920 act which led to partition of Ireland. The talks would follow the same formula as the failed negotiations last summer. They would start with government of the province, then relations between north and south Ireland, and finally relations between London and Dublin. The Irish government would be involved only in the last two stages. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, would be excluded throughout.</p>

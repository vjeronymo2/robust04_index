			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Akzo NV became the first company from any nation to receive a U.S. patent in  the field of high-temperature superconductivity. The Dutch chemical company  upset a wide range of U.S., Japanese and European companies that have been  working in the field. Superconductors carry electricity without any loss of  energy and could someday be part of tiny computers that run at unprecedented  speeds, batteries that last forever and other technological marvels. Although  Akzo is based in Arnhem, Netherlands, it said its research was done at its  laboratory in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., by Fawzy A. Sherif.  </P></p>

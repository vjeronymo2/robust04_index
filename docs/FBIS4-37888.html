			<p>BFN     [Text] According to an agreement by Iran, Afghanistan, and  the United Nations, 840,000 Afghan refugees will be repatriated  to their homeland by the end of this year.    Mr. Hoseyni, general manager for foreign nationals in the  Interior Ministry, said in an interview with our correspondent  that there is no deadline for the repatriation. Mr. Hoseyni  said:    [Begin recording] [Hoseyni] At the moment 1,800,000 Afghan  refugees live in our country. Of those, 540,000 have been given  a temporary six-month residential permit. They are refugees who  have lived in Iran without any identification documents. The  six-month permit has been given to them to enable them to leave  the country.    In fact, 22 June is the expiration date of the six-month  period. This group of Afghan refugees will be leaving the  country gradually under the supervision of the United Nation and  a representative of the Islamic government of Afghanistan. This  has resulted from the agreement reached in the Iran,  Afghanistan, and the United Nations tripartite commission.    The second group are those refugees who have been living  legally in our country for many years. In cooperation with the  United Nations, we have planned to repatriate 300,000 of this  group this year. The repatriation is totally voluntary, and the  refugee can either go back home or stay. We have made plans for  300,000 in the current year. Therefore, if the two plans are  carried out in full, we can repatriate 840,000 Afghan refugees  by the end of the current year.    [Unidentified correspondent] Is there a deadline for the  Afghan refugees, especially the first group?    [Hoseyni] No deadline exists because the repatriation of  540,000 refugees after 22 June may be carried out over several  months. Therefore the Islamic Republic of Iran has not set any  deadlines for the repatriation of Afghan refugees. [end  recording]</p>

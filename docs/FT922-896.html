			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei back below 16,000 in low volume THE Nikkei average closed at its lowest level since October 1986 yesterday as selling of speculative theme stocks dragged the index below 16,000 again, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average fell 253.32, or 1.6 per cent, to 15,853.67. The index rose to the day's high of 16,313.33 in the morning on buying by investors trying to cover short positions. However, arbitrage selling and liquidation of holdings by dealers amid low volume pushed prices lower, and the Nikkei hit the day's low of 15,816.04 just before the close. Volume rose slightly from 211m shares to 220m. Falls led rises by 666 to 250, with 176 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 13.84 to 1,233.37, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.65 to 961.73. Analysts said the Nikkei's decline, triggered by last Wednesday's rumours of financial trouble at Daikyo, the condominium builder, would continue unless uncertainty surrounding the financial soundness of certain companies disappeared. Investors are especially nervous about real estate companies and banks, which have been affected by the plunge in asset values. Mr Craig Chudler at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew commented: 'The market needs proof that the companies are in as sound shape as they say they are.' Banks and construction and real estate companies were among the heaviest losers of the day. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y60 to Y1,480, Mitsui Fudosan slipped Y10 to Y800 and Shimizu, the contractor, lost Y36 to Y889. The five most active issues of the day were bio-technology theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, the most active, dropped Y49 to Y961 and Morinaga Milk Industry Y50 to Y804. Steel issues were weak on earnings worries. Leading steel companies face redemptions of equity-linked bonds issued in the bull market of the late 1980s. According to Kleinwort Benson, Nippon Steel needs to repay Dollars 1.8bn this fiscal year, and Kobe Steel faces Dollars 1.5bn in redemptions. Nippon Steel declined Y8 to Y261 and Kobe Steel lost Y2 to Y288. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 219.05 to 18,826.86 in volume of 16.1m shares. Roundup WITH THE exception of Hong Kong, the tribulations of Tokyo left the region in muted form yesterday. HONG KONG climbed for the third day in a row, the Hang Seng index gaining 67.35 to 5,965.21, but after a day's high of 5,987.91. Turnover expanded to HKDollars 3.59bn from HKDollars 2.99bn. Cheung Kong rose 40 cents to HKDollars 26.10 and Hopewell put on 15 cents to HKDollars 5.80. SEOUL fell to a 4 1/2 -year low, the composite index losing 8.00 to 551.99 in turnover of Won171.1bn. Securities shares were among the weakest issues, with a decline of 1 per cent in their index value. AUSTRALIA was encouraged by futures gains, the All Ordinaries index closing 3.7 up at 1,647.6 in turnover of ADollars 319.6m. The recently listed Fairfax gained 2 cents to ADollars 1.50 in volume of 2.8m shares. TAIWAN reversed early gains as profit-taking set in. The weighted index finished 35.40 down at 4,655.08 in turnover of TDollars 41.3bn. Cement and construction shares showed the biggest losses, with Chia Hsin Cement off TDollars 1.50 at TDollars 55.00. MANILA gained ground on bargain hunting, the composite index rising 23.71 to 1,477.57. Turnover decreased to 324m pesos from 394m. NEW ZEALAND weakened slightly. The NZSE-40 index shed 2.80 to 1,530.53. KARACHI climbed as the government announced plans to disinvest shares of the state-run utility Sui Northern Gas, which rose Rs8.25 to Rs54.50. The 100-share index closed 35.52 higher at 1,524.13 on a 45 per cent rise in turnover.</p>

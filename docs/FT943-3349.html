			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / International Company News: Three-card trick from American Express - Financial services group is entering a new phase Will investors ever again come to look on American Express as a high-growth company? After 18 months of reorganisation, rationalisation and disposals, that question has come to the fore in recent days. The benefits from cutting costs and shedding unwanted businesses have largely been realised: earnings per share, which sagged at the start of the decade, have rebounded. Mr Harvey Golub, the tough-talking Brooklyn native who has headed the US financial group for the past 18 months, knows it is now time to deliver on his promise to make the company grow again. Two events in the past week suggest American Express has entered a new phase. First, the US financial services group relaunched itself in the revolving credit card business (most of its business comes through charge cards, on which the full outstanding balance must be paid at the end of each month). This week it has also bolstered its presence in the travel business with the acquisition of parts of the Thomas Cook operations for Dollars 375m. Both events provide pointers as to how Mr Golub hopes to restore the fortunes of the US financial services group, which was badly dented by a failed attempt to convert itself into a 'financial supermarket' in the 1980s. Mr Golub's plan rests on three elements: extending the company's customer base; finding ways to sell new products to existing customers; and using the information the company has about its customers to make it more nimble than the bank-owned payment systems that are its main competitors. American Express's position in the plastic card market has slipped during a period of explosive growth. While spending on plastic cards around the world leapt from less than Dollars 250bn in 1985 to around Dollars 1,000bn last year, American Express's share of the market fell from 22 per cent to 12 per cent. It was overtaken first by bank issuers of credit cards and, more recently, by non-bank companies ranging from AT&amp;T to Dean Witter Discover. These organisations made headway by offering new incentives to people to use their cards - for instance by giving frequent-flyer miles, discounts on telephone calls or (in the case of the Discover card) cash rebates - or by dropping their fees and reducing interest rates. American Express stuck with its 'one-size-fits-all' charge card, continuing to charge all its customers a fee while applying a higher discount to merchants who accepted its cards than those charged by the credit card companies. This higher discount discouraged merchants outside the travel and entertainment industries - where American Express is almost universally used  -from agreeing to accept the card, thus slowing growth. Three things suggest Mr Golub has at least stopped the rot. First, and most important, the attrition in the company's core card business has largely been halted. While it lost 1.5m cardholders in the US during 1992 and 1993, the number of cards in use has fallen only very slightly, to 11.3m, this year (outside the US the figure has hardly budged from 8m). The company has also cut the charges to its merchants in order to gain wider acceptance for its cards. Last year, the average fee was 2.92 per cent, down from 3.11 per cent in 1992. That, too, has largely stabilised - though Mr Golub has made clear that he will, if necessary, keep cutting the discount rate to build the merchant network. Second, the group has just completed the disposal of a variety of businesses acquired in its disastrous attempt at diversification in the early 1980s. The list includes the sale of the Shearson stockbroking firm and the Boston Company, along with the spin-off of First Data, a data processing company, in 1992 and of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank, in recent months. The third big advance has been in profitability. From a low point in 1992, after-tax profits rebounded last year to equal the previous earnings record set in 1989. This was due in equal measure to cost-cutting and a sharp reduction in credit losses (many of them from the company's first, troubled entry into the credit card market). 'They've had a lot of corporate issues to solve, and they've done a world-class job,' says Mr Eugene Lockhart, the recently-appointed head of rival card group MasterCard International. 'But the world card market has moved on apace.' Like many others, Mr Lockhart questions whether American Express can hope to regain lost ground - particularly since the next wave of growth in the card business will come from persuading consumers to use plastic rather than cash for small-value purchases. American Express's traditional customers have been business people using its cards for travel or entertainment. Mr Golub's plans revolve in part around extending the company's range of cards. Last week, American Express relaunched itself in the credit card business, announcing the first in a series of products it plans to launch in the coming months. Rather than the old one-size-fits-all approach, each card will offer a different range of incentives (the first provides a longer interest-free grace period than is usual). At present, American Express maintains revolving credit balances of around Dollars 8bn: by the end of the decade, that figure will grow to Dollars 30bn, Mr Golub predicts. He bases the estimate partly on the company's ability to persuade its charge-card holders to shift their credit-card spending to American Express. These customers already owe around Dollars 40bn on cards issued by other companies, says Mr Golub. Growth is also coming from the corporate card, a charge card used by companies to make small purchases. Other card companies agree this remains one of the big untapped markets in the payments industry, and could provide solid double-digit growth for some time. The Thomas Cook acquisitions announced on Monday are likely to bolster the corporate card business: around two-thirds of American Express' existing travel customers also use the corporate card. Beyond this, Mr Golub has expounded two ideas for growth. The first involves greater use of information about its customers' spending habits. Unlike bank card issuers, who use the Visa and MasterCard payment systems, American Express runs its own system, and claims this gives it more detailed information about how its cards are used - and makes it possible to target marketing campaigns precisely. Making this information available to retailers could make it easier for American Express to justify the higher discounts it charges them. The second growth area involves taking American Express into new areas of the consumer finance business. Mr Golub has yet to expound on what this may entail, though he suggested at an investors' conference last month that the company's customer base and distribution mechanism could provide a platform for selling other companies' consumer finance products. In a different way, this echoes the financial supermarket vision of the 1980s - though this time it would not involve large acquisitions. Ironically, American Express has itself been talked of as an acquisition target in recent days. Perhaps this is not surprisingly, given the super-charged atmosphere in the US takeover market and the doldrums in which its share price has languished after a brief spurt in the middle of last year. On a multiple of around 11 times forecast 1994 earnings, American Express is trading on a par with regional US banks and behind higher-growth financial services companies. General Electric is rumoured to be interested in making another big acquisition in the financial services sector, and this has helped to push up American Express's share price by 10 per cent since the end of last month. At a current market value of Dollars 15bn, though, it would be a big target to hit, even for GE.</p>

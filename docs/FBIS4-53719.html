			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>   [Text] North Korea has begun to open the Najin-Sonbong  special zone ahead of schedule. The opening was initially  planned for after the nuclear problem was solved. However,  business firms from seven Western countries, including England,  Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, not to  mention China, have concluded investment contracts with North  Korea. This was confirmed on 20 May.    North Korea expressly stipulated in the relevant laws and  regulations concerning the opening of the special zone that it  would guarantee the free passage of ROK nationals and ROK cargo.    Besides, North Korea asked China to include 10  representatives, from different spheres of ROK business firms  that advanced into China, in a 50-member Chinese economic  delegation that will visit North Korea late this month. Thus,  North Korea was positive in inducing investment of ROK capital  and technology.    According to this, the ROK Embassy in China on 20 May  advised  each ROK firm that advanced into China to actively prepare for  their advance into North Korea by taking advantage of business  collaboration with Chinese enterprises.    Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the North Korean External  Economy Commission in charge of the external opening policy,  visited China last month. He conveyed the master plan on the  opening of Najin- Sonbong zone to the Chinese Government, and  asked for China's cooperation. Following this, representatives  of the Najin-Sonbong zone exchanged a protocol with  representatives of Hunchun City, Jilin Province, China, on 6  April on concrete agreements between the two sides on the  opening of the zone.    According to the protocol of agreement obtained by TONG-A  ILBO, North Korea and Chinese authorities agreed to jointly  develop the Najin-Sonbong special zone and the Hunchun-(Jiaohe)  District in China, which is adjacent to Najin-Sonbong zone, into  visa-free entry and tariff-free international free trade zones,  and to conduct joint-ventures in essential facilities, including  ports and roads. The two sides also agreed that the Chinese  capital invested in the zones will be compensated with the  interest earned by the operation of the zones and with marine  products.    This protocol noted an additional article on the passage of  ROK nationals and ROK cargoes into the Najin-Sonbong zone,  stating that "South Korea is included." According to a North  Korean source in Beijing, after the exchange of the protocol,  the North Korean side dispatched to China Sok Hui-hyon, director  of a department in charge of external opening, and conveyed a  concrete plan stating that "in the event that ROK personnel from  a China-ROK joint-venture firm wants to visit the zone, an  invitation will be extended to him if a request is forwarded 15  days prior to his visit so that he can travel freely to the  zone."    The North Korean side has already discriminated between the  residents who are permitted to live permanently in the 746.2  square km special zone from those who will be sent to other  places. North Korea moved from Pyongyang 600 new households of  residents with a strong party spirit into this zone. Meanwhile,  North Korea informed the Chinese side that it will allow the  establishment of field liaison offices from seven countries,  including China, in the Najin- Sonbong zone, and will open on a  full scale the passage of foreigners and foreign cargoes in  Najin and Sonbong ports starting in June, when construction of  buildings in the wharfside is completed.</p>

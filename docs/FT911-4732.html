			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Letter: Chemical mix-up was no laughing matter Sir, I have no doubt that many of your chemically trained readers experienced the same delicious frisson as I when they read Clive Cookson's item 'Nitrous Acid gets last laugh' (April 10). Suffice it to say that intractable confusion between nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and nitrous acid (an entirely distinct compound known only in an aqueous solution) rendered the entire article largely meaningless. Nitrous and nitric acids are present as pollutants in atmospheric water droplets largely as a result of emissions of two other oxides of nitrogen (nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) from petrol combustion and other chemical processes. However, I was particularly entertained by the prospect of dentists using nitrous acid in high concentration as an anaesthetic. It would be unlikely to induce the last (or any other) laugh, but I can confidently predict the last gasp, the last rites and the last will and testament in that order. Dr A. Scotney, 17 Hyndland Avenue, Glasgow G11</p>

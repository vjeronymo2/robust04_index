			<p>BFN     [Text] The Central Committee of the Popular Movement for  the Liberation of Angola [MPLA] ended its session yesterday.  The Political Bureau [words indistinct] recommendations on the  strengthening of the Central Committee's role among militants  and sympathizers. The session also discussed Angolan security  and made specific recommendations to the government delegation  taking part in the Lusaka talks. MPLA spokesman Norberto dos  Santos has the details:    [Begin recording] [dos Santos] The Central Committee  recommended the Political Bureau to assess the activities of the  party in all echelons and to take the necessary steps to  strengthen party activities within the Political Bureau, the  Secretariat, intermediate structures, and grass roots  organizations. So, it is necessary to revamp party activities  involving militants, and to increase the flow of information on  the political and socioeconomic situation.    [Unidentified Correspondent] We have learned that the MPLA  Political Bureau has new members. Would you like to name them?    [Dos Santos] Of the 12 nominees, comrades Venancio de Moura  and Anastacio (da Voca), the first secretary for Huambo  Province, have been admitted as permanent members. Comrades  Joao (Chipingue), the first secretary for Huila Province; Moxico  Province Governor Joao Ernesto dos Santos Liberdade; Benguela  Province Governor Paulo Teixeira Jorge; and Carlos Ferreira  Pinto, a former first secretary for Moxico Province, have been  elected as candidate members. Comrade Carlos Ferreira Pinto has  also been elected coordinator of the Discipline and Audit  Committee. The Political Bureau now has 21 members, of which 17  are permanent and four are candidate members.    [Correspondent] Angolans are very worried about the Lusaka  peace talks. They are also concerned over the Cabinda issue.  Would you like to confirm whether a peace accord will be signed  on 6 June?    [Dos Santos] The Central Committee session did not discuss  dates. No date has been set. The Central Committee has only  recommended the government negotiating team to do its best to  achieve peace. What the Central Committee discussed was the  manner in which we will implement the peace accord. The  principal issue is the organization of domestic structures so  that the implementation of the peace process does not face the  same risks the Bicesse Accord experienced.    [Correspondent] Does that apply to Cabinda?    [Dos Santos] The session heard a report on the situation in  Cabinda. As you known, no direct talks have been held. So far  only exploratory meetings have taken place. There are several  Cabinda factions with whom a government team has held  exploratory talks. That is in addition to the meeting held in  Paris. The Central Committee recommended the Political Bureau  take charge of this issue because one feels that the progress on  Cabinda is slow. [end recording]</p>

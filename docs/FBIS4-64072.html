			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Zuychenko report under the "Poll" rubric: "`Firm </F> Order' and `Strong Authority' Will Win in Next Presidential  Elections. They Would Have Once Again Elected Yeltsin This  Week"]    [Text] Two years before presidential elections in Russia,  Liberal Democrat leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy continues in third  position on the list of probable contenders for this position,  conceding first and second positions to Boris Yeltsin and  Grigoriy Yavlinskiy respectively. At least, this is what  transpires from the results of a poll commissioned by SEGODNYA  and conducted by the All-Russia Center for the Study of Public  Opinion poll 14-18 May among 1,620 respondents representing the  Russian Federation's urban population.    Mr. Zhirinovskiy's escapades, to all appearances, continue  to  hold appeal for his former voters, while the squabbles inside  the party and the virtual split in the Duma faction of the  Liberal Democratic Party of Russia are having no effect on the  attitude to its leader. Supporters of the Liberal Democrats'  fuhrer still regard him as the only man who can act on their  demand for "strong authority" and "a real leader." It is these  notions that rate first on the scale of "civic values" of Mr.  Zhirinovskiy's voters.    However, judging from the poll, neither the "pro-market" nor  "pro-democracy" supporters of Russia's current president are  free from the predilection for a "firm hand."    Aleksandr Rutskoy, who was noted some time ago as the main  rival to Mr. Zhirinovskiy in the contest for the lumpen-like  electorate, has so far been unable to regain the second position  he held in the rating list before the coup. Now one can be  totally sure that the general's golden moment has been left  behind.    As for Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, his probable electorate (among  the four leaders) in future elections looks more eroded than the  others. This is most likely because voters have a vague idea of  the real difference between Mr. Yavlinskiy's policy and that of  his rivals on the possible election list.</p>

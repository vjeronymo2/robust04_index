Their duties include  verifying voters' eligibility, issuing ballots, opening and closing the polls  and delivering completed ballots to neighborhood check-in centers so they can  be transported to election headquarters.  </P> <P> According to Edelman, precinct workers receive between $25 and $55 depending on  what they do. Those interested in participating may call the Polls Section of  the registrar-recorder's office at (213) 725-5940, Monday through Friday, from  8 a.m. to 5 p.m..  </P></p>

			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Books: These are our songs - Music BIOGRAPHIES and reference books are the main musical fare that publishers have been putting out for Christmas. True, a 'think book' has appeared in the form of Anthony Arblaster's Viva la Liberta] (Verso, Pounds 18.95), a study of politics in opera; and this is fluently written and wide-ranging, though it is disconcerting to be twice told by the author that he has been unable to see or hear Britten's Owen Wingrave, when I can see the 1971 Decca recording on my shelf as I write. Of serious substance but greatly entertaining is a portrait of Beethoven as seen by his contemporaries. HC Robbins Landon's Beethoven, His Life, Work and World, and one may add, his Eccentricities, is a handsome Thames and Hudson hardback (Pounds 24.00) adapted by the author from his 1970 volume, Beethoven: a Documentary Study, and makes a wonderful present. Currently reissued in paperback is Eric Sams's definitive study from 1961, revised in 1982, The Songs of Hugo Wolf (Faber and Faber, Pounds 12.99). Song-lovers will also be gratified by the publication of The Spanish Song Companion (Gollancz, Pounds 25.00), which follows SS Prawer's Penguin Book of Lieder in making available both in the original and in translation the lyric texts of an entire tradition - this one extending from the 13th century Alfonso X of Castile to the still living Xavier Montsalvatge. It is chiefly an anthology, but the compiler-translators, Jacqueline Cockburn and Richard Stokes, lucidly explain everything as the book and the tradition unfold. The tenor Nigel Douglas's Legendary Voices (Andre Deutsch, Pounds 19.99) cheerfully reviews the careers of such as Caruso, Flagstad, Gobbi, Pinza, Turner with close reference to what is available on CD. Voice-fanciers are also served by yet another biography of Maria Callas (Quartet, Pounds 25.00), though the author Jurgen Kesting has done diligent research. The crop of biographies includes Robert Baldock's life of the saintly cellist Pablo Casals (Gollancz, Pounds 20.00), David Revill's enthusiastic life of the late composer and maverick John Cage (Bloomsbury, Pounds 22-50), and Harold C. Schonberg's life of the pianist and professional legend Vladimir Horowitz (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 20.00). This last is written in a tabloid style favouring exclamatory single-sentence paragraphs and prefers to take a gossipy interest in the vicissitudes of the music business than probe too deeply into its subject's personal unhappiness, admitted in asides. The sweeping ups and downs of Horowitz's career, his collapses and comebacks, are recorded with a certain vulgar air of suspense; but a profusion of pianistic insights, mostly Horowitz's own, is scattered across these pages ('The moment you know how to colour a phrase . . . excessive rubato disappears by itself. A rubato in tone has replaced it'); and there is an impressively elaborate discography. Not quite a biography, Klaus Lang's The Karajan Dossier (Faber, Pounds 20.00) traces the professional progress of that peculiarly unattractive figure with a quiet but ultimately lethal indirection, using a medley of interviews and speeches. Two out of the three new dictionaries are likely to become standard. The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, (Oxford, Pounds 25.00) by John Warrack and Ewan West is far more comprehensive and useful than Warrack's and Harold Rosenthal's Concise Oxford Dictionary of the same subject, from which it draws some material, and failed my spot-tests only in the matter of saying nothing about York Holler's Der Meister und Margarita (1989), the last opera to be staged at Paris's Salle Garnier. But Robin Holloway and his Clarissa are (just about) there. Anthony Baines's The Oxford Companion to Musical Instruments (Oxford,Pounds 25.00) is ravishingly authoritative. And Norman Lebrecht's The Companion to 20th Century Music (Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 20.00) is remarkably thorough (Holler's work suitably epitomised), though laced with inaccuracies, and wickedly partisan.</p>

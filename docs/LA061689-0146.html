			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH LIFE;  </P> <P> MAGICIAN AT 16;  </P> <P> IRVINE YOUTH TURNS HIS PASSION INTO A PROFESSION  </P> <P> It was a bold move for Eran Feigenbaum to pass out business cards to anyone and  everyone he knew or saw.  </P> <P> Those first cards had a simple message printed on them: "Eran the Magician. I  do and teach magic."  </P> <P> But for a 12-year-old who barely knew anything about magic and had no tricks to  show anybody except for one involving a pair of Chinese linking rings, the  business cards represented a desire to become a magician -- and a famous one.  </P> <P> Just before then, Feigenbaum had purchased his first magic set for $70, never  knowing that it would become such a worthwhile investment.  </P> <P> Now, at 16, Feigenbaum has succeeded in establishing a name for himself in the  International Society of Magicians, as well as organizing a career for himself  as a professional magician.  </P> <P> Feigenbaum, a junior at University High School in Irvine, performs three types  of magic tricks for his audiences: stage magic, kid magic and mental magic.  </P> <P> With an excited voice and shining bright eyes, Feigenbaum described magic as a  phase of his life that has yet to pass.  </P> <P> "Everybody loves magic," he said. "It exists, and everyone has it inside, but  the problem is just how to use it. For example, there are those who are able to  smell and create scents in perfumes in their dreams because they have learned  how to use that skill. Magic is just like that. All of us have it -- we just  don't know how to use it.  </P> <P> "Magic is something that a normal person cannot do, but I, supposedly as an  abnormal person, am able to do."  </P> <P> Feigenbaum became interested in magic at the age of 9, when he saw a magician  performing the famous Chinese linking rings routine on stage. As a result, the  youngster enrolled in a magic class, read all the books he possibly could on  the subject and bought performing sets to practice tricks.  </P> <P> He dreamed that one day he would be skilled enough to perform the linking rings  routine, which, according to Feigenbaum, is one of the hardest tricks to  complete.  </P> <P> Living with his family in New Jersey at the time, Feigenbaum was not alone with  his interest in magic. Along with a group of five friends, Feigenbaum formed  the Gang of Magicians, whose members shared routines and performances with one  another.  </P> <P> At 12, Feigenbaum returned to Israel, where he was born. Because of a lack of  enthusiasm for magic and magicians there, he stopped performing. He put away  his magic props into two chest drawers and began involving himself in other  activities such as karate and computers.  </P> <P> "In the United States, kids are more fascinated with magic than in Israel  because they are exposed to it at an earlier age," he said. "I didn't know of  one kid in the U.S. who didn't own a magic set. But in Israel, it wasn't like  that."  </P> <P> Although Feigenbaum tried his best to set aside his interest in magic, he was  unsuccessful. He began saving up his allowance and was finally able to purchase  a pair of linking rings. His first public performance -- at a friend's birthday  party -- earned him $10 and, at the age of 14, marked the beginning of his  professional career.  </P> <P> "I looked back at that performance as almost being a complete failure,"  Feigenbaum said. "To the crowd it looked great, but not to me. I put a lot more  effort into my shows now."  </P> <P> Feigenbaum's efforts were appreciated by his friends as well as fellow  professional magicians in Israel. At 14, he became the youngest member ever to  join the Israeli Society of Magicians, an elite group of professional  performers. By then, he was earning awards for his routines and acts.  </P> <P> Last summer, Feigenbaum represented the Israeli Society of Magicians and Israel  at the 1988 Federation of International Society of Magicians convention in  Holland, often referred to as the "Olympics of Magic," he said.  </P> <P> Upon returning to the United States with his family, Feigenbaum has performed  at a number of national conventions, but none so prestigious as the one in  Holland.  </P> <P> "Basically, the international convention was the highest realm that I could  ever reach on the magical rings," he said. "Anything after it is a real  downer."  </P> <P> In Irvine, Feigenbaum performs at parties and for such charity organizations as  the Cancer Society and the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. He also practices his  skills at the Magic Castle in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> He said he earns between $100 and $500 -- "weekend money" -- for each  performance.  </P> <P> But Feigenbaum looks at his career in magic as a temporary one.  </P> <P> "I like magic because I'm not forced to do it," he said. "It is a lot like  acting -- when you are a teen-ager, you act for fun, not because you have to do  it. But when you're doing it 24 hours a day, you're doing it to support  yourself -- to live. It would make an unstable career, but magic will always be  a hobby for me."  </P></p>

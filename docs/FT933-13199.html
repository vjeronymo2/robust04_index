			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Tajikistan PM accuses Kabul on border attacks MR Abdulmalik Abdulajanov, Tajikistan's prime minister, yesterday accused the leadership of neighbouring Afghanistan of being behind last week's bloody attack by Tajik opposition fighters on Russian border guards, Reuter reports from Moscow. He said commanders of the Afghan army's 55th division had taken part in the attack on July 13, adding: 'One can hardly imagine that Kabul knew nothing about it.' His charges went much further than anything yet said by the Russian government which, while angered by the attack in which it lost 25 border guards, has avoided linking it to the Kabul leadership. They seemed likely to increase tension between Moscow and Kabul, which has accused Russian forces of killing up to 360 civilians in punitive raids on Afghan border areas last weekend. The Afghan leadership is appealing to the United Nations to halt the deployment of extra Russian forces along the border. It has also asked for emergency aid for the victims of what it called cruel artillery attacks. The attack by Tajik rebels from Afghan territory on a border post, manned jointly by Russian and Tajik servicemen, led to a battle in which the 25 guards and more than 100 civilians were killed. Russia has sent extra troops to the Tajik-Afghan border area, which it is helping to protect under an accord last year, and has vowed to strike back. This has prompted indignant protests from Afghanistan where memories of the Soviet Union's decade-long military intervention are still fresh. Mr Abdulajanov dismissed Afghanistan's reports of retaliatory attacks by the Russians. A Russian defence ministry spokesman also denied the attack. But one member of a Russian parliamentary commission sent to investigate last week's fighting said local forces had shelled rebel positions in Afghanistan.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Jordan gets firm hand as times are changing: The appointment of a new prime minister in the run-up to multi-party elections JORDAN's new government, announced at the weekend, has an unenviable brief: continue with the country's unpopular economic reforms while deciding whether, in the face of fierce Islamic fundamentalist opposition, to change the electoral system before the country's first multi-party elections since 1956. The man King Hussein has appointed as prime minister to oversee these tasks is Dr Abdul-Salam Al Majali, Jordan's chief Middle East peace negotiator. Dr Majali - who also holds the key portfolios of defence and foreign affairs  -replaces Sharif Zeid Ben Shaker, who asked to stand down. He is expected to employ a firm hand in dealings with the kingdom's new political parties, legalised last year, in the run-up to the election in November and in implementing the economic reforms. Anxiety over the elections and the threat of an Islamic fundamentalist majority in the lower house of parliament was expressed by the king when he appointed Dr Majali. 'I fear for our democracy . . . (and) I warn against those who infiltrate our ranks under the pretext that they believe in this democracy but in reality harbour evil and harm,' the king said. The voting reform would involve changing the 1986 election law to a one-person, one-vote system. This is expected to cut the number of votes for fundamentalist candidates. Under the current law, each voter casts more than one vote, depending on the number of seats in their constituency - up to eight in some constituencies. This favours large political groups, such as the fundamentalists, who are able to field a number of candidates in all constituencies. A one-man, one-vote system would limit the likelihood of fundamentalist MPs gaining seats as a second or third choice. This is opposed by members of the powerful Moslem Brotherhood, the fundamentalist religious grouping seeking to 'Islamicise' Jordan. They have said that any changes in the electoral system would be taken as an infringement of their democratic rights. In the last elections of 1989, in which parties were not allowed to participate, fundamentalist candidates captured the largest bloc of 30 out of 80 seats. Of the 17 parties expected to campaign this time, the party political wing of the Brotherhood, the Islamic Action Front, is by far the strongest and best organised. A change in the electoral law is thought to be supported by the palace and the new government. Dr Majali's appointment is also viewed as demonstrating Jordan's commitment to the flagging Arab-Israeli peace talks, which continue to disillusion a growing number of Jordanians and Palestinians in the kingdom. Dr Majali is one of the few Jordanians to deal publicly with the Israelis - an act of treason according to the Moslem Brotherhood. His appointment sends a strong signal to fundamentalists that their calls for a withdrawal from the peace talks will gain no political election mileage. Then there is a controversial sales tax, averaging 5-10 per cent, which was postponed by the previous cabinet because of domestic opposition, particularly from the private sector. The tax, framed by the International Monetary Fund as part of the kingdom's economic restructuring programme, will replace the old consumption tax. But many Jordanians fear that the new tax structure will lead to severe price rises. The IMF has stipulated that the sales tax must be enforced before Jordan's next round of foreign debt rescheduling talks due early next month. The kingdom's foreign debt is about Dollars 6.5bn or 140 per cent of gross domestic product. The new head of Jordan's negotiating team is expected to be Fayez Tarawneh, Jordan's ambassador to Washington.</p>

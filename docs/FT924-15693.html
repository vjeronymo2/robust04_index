			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Ireland and Finland replenish foreign holdings IRELAND and Finland yesterday turned to the Eurobond markets to borrow in European currencies, providing the first hints of what could become a wave of borrowing by European governments after the recent upheaval in currency markets. Central banks from Scandinavia to Italy and Ireland have run down their foreign reserves in defence of their currencies, leaving them under pressure to replenish their foreign currency holdings. In addition, heavy intervention by the Bundesbank to support several currencies within the ERM, among them the lira, sterling and French franc, has left the countries concerned with an obligation to repay the German central bank in D-Marks in the near future. Yesterday's deals are only a drop in the ocean of the total amount of borrowing that will have to be done. Ireland borrowed DM300m with an issue that yields 35 basis points over 10-year bunds. Finland, meanwhile, borrowed Sch1bn for 10 years at a yield of 8.4 per cent. One banker not involved in the deal calculated that the price would equate to around 92 basis points over US Treasuries if the deal had been done in dollars, though another cautioned against seeing this deal as providing an indication of the level at which Finland would have to borrow in currencies other than the schilling.</p>

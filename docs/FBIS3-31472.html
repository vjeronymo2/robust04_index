			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Rugova, president of the republic of </F> Kosovo, by Oszkar Fuzes in Washington; date not given: "We  Would Like an Independent, Neutral Kosovo"]    [Text] In case of a Serbian provocation, the United States  will defend the Albanians in Kosovo -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton assured the head of the province of Kosovo where the 90  percent Albanian inhabitants are striving for independence.  Ibrahim Rugova, the democratically elected leader of the Kosovo  Albanians, was among the guests at the recent prayer breakfast  held by Bill Clinton. Ibrahim Rugova gave an interview to our  Washington correspondent.    [Rugova] I had the opportunity to talk to President Clinton  and Vice President Gore about the Kosovo issue. The U.S.  position is clear: If the Serbs commit or provoke some atrocity  in Kosovo, the United States will defend us. They already said  that clearly one year ago. According to the United States, an  explosion in Kosovo would inflame the entire region. They  appreciate highly the fact that we, the Kosovo Albanians, want  to achieve our goals in a peaceful way, free of violence.    [Fuzes] Is it possible to achieve your goal, the secession  of Kosovo from Serbia, without force?    [Rugova] Yes, if Kosovo is demilitarized and comes under  international protection. In that case, a normal and democratic  dialogue can start. I have been proposing this for quite some  time but, naturally, I am aware that the implementation of this  desire depends on the future of this entire stormy region. As  for ourselves, we would like, first of all, a free, independent,  and neutral Kosovo, one open to both Albania and Serbia. This  is also a compromise from our side because, for the time being  and because of Serb sensitivity, we abandon the unification of  the Albanian nation. I am a realist and I know that all this  also depends on a variety of major-power interests, and the  decision will be made at a future international conference.    [Fuzes] At least one quarter of Macedonia's population are  Albanians. What is their situation like?    [Rugova] Their situation is made more difficult by legal and  constitutional problems. I would like to see to it that these  problems are solved and the Albanians living there can  systematically participate in the normal development of  democratic Macedonia.    [Fuzes] Regarding Serbia, there is naturally a big  difference between the situation of Kosovo Albanians and the  situation of Vojvodina Hungarians. Nevertheless, is there any  cooperation between the Albanian Democratic League of Kosova and  the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians?    [Rugova] Unfortunately, the Hungarians in Vojvodina are also  subjected to great pressure and, in many respects, they have to  bear similar burdens. It is our principled position that the  Hungarians in Vojvodina also have a right to some kind of  autonomy, namely a type of autonomy they would justifiably  desire. We agree on this but, under the current circumstances,  we can have little genuine contact and, unfortunately, we can  hardly help each other.    [Fuzes] The most timely question: Has any political  solution been left at all to solve the Bosnian issue?    [Rugova] No matter how difficult it is now to envisage a  political settlement of the problem, one must try because there  is no other way. If Europe and the United States are unable to  put an end to this war, it will inflame Southern-Eastern Europe  and later, perhaps the entire continent.    [Fuzes] Only a historic rapprochement with the Serbs can  bring a long-term calm. Are the Kosovo Albanians ready for this?    [Rugova] If anyone, we are really aware of the importance of  a rapprochement between the two nations. We are also aware of  the fact that we must work hard for this. The issue at hand is  that the Serbs should now become reconciled with all their  neighbors, and this requires a change in the regime in Belgrade.  Moreover, this would not even be enough. Unfortunately, the  Serbs have become infected by the aggressive nationalist  mythology that measures the greatness of a nation in terms of  acquired and "ethnically clean" territories. It will take a  long time for the Serbs to rid themselves of this sickness and  become disappointed with their extremist chauvinistic leaders.</p>

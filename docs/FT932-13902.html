			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Monsanto slips as recession bites MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday reported reduced first-quarter operating income and sales after weak Japanese and European economies hit its main chemical business. For the three months to March 31, Monsanto's operating income was Dollars 231m on sales of Dollars 1.94bn, against Dollars 259m on sales of Dollars 1.97bn last time. Net income in the latest quarter was Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.71 a share. A year earlier, Monsanto suffered a net loss of Dollars 388m, or Dollars 3.16, including one-time charges of Dollars 540m for accounting changes and other items. It blamed recession in Europe and Japan for severely constricting demand and pricing in its automotive-linked businesses for contributing to a drop in operating income for its chemicals group to Dollars 50m from Dollars 79m. Chemical sales rose to Dollars 898m from Dollars 896m. Its NutraSweet artificial sweetener business had operating income of Dollars 34m on sales of Dollars 170m, against Dollars 37m on sales of Dollars 199m. The business should benefit from a recent Food and Drug Administration ruling expanding the use of NutraSweet in a wider range of drinks, confections and baking. The Searle pharmaceutical unit recorded an operating loss of Dollars 27m on Dollars 361m sales. A year earlier, it had operating income of Dollars 10m on sales of Dollars 363m.</p>

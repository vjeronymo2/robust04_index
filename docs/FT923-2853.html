			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Romanian PM urges real change MR THEODOR Stolojan, Romania's outgoing prime minister, said yesterday the country's leaders had 'made mistakes' and underlined the need for political change after parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled to be held on September 27. 'The situation is not so good for Romania. We have to give the chance to people to have another government based on the power of the vote,' said Mr Stolojan, a non-partisan prime minister of a coalition government. Mr Stolojan's comments come in the wake of bitter criticism from the Democratic Convention (DC), an 18-strong coalition of opposition parties. The Convention contends in its election campaigning that the country's current leaders, and particularly Mr Ion Iliescu, Romania's president, have ruled undemocratically, maintained supporters of the previous communist regime in key institutions and failed to introduce meaningful reforms. While many Romanians appear more concerned about recent price rises and worsening bread shortages than in the elections, opinion polls suggest that the DC's emphasis on the need for a clean break with the past is paying off. The latest polls indicate that President Iliescu, a former high-ranking communist official, who at the start of the campaign was tipped for re-election with a comfortable margin, is now in a tight contest with the DC's candidate, Mr Emil Constantinescu, the rector of Bucharest University. In the parliamentary elections, pollsters give more than 32 per cent to the Convention, which emerged from February's local elections as the main opposition to the National Salvation Front (NSF). The NSF, which took power following the bloody overthrow of the Ceausescu regime in December, 1989, went on to win two-thirds of the vote in the first post-communist elections in May, 1990. But the NSF was weakened earlier this year when supporters of President Iliescu left to form the Democratic National Salvation Front (DNSF), a left-wing party favouring only limited reform. The polls indicate the DNSF will pick up 12-15 per cent, with a similar proportion going to the NSF, which is led by Mr Petre Roman, whose reformist government was toppled following three days of miner-led riots in September, 1991. Many voters say they are still undecided, but with no group likely to win a majority, the next government could be a coalition between the Convention and Mr Roman's NSF.</p>

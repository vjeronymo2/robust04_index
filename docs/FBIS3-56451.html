According to him, in the present  circumstances "Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to justify himself  and defend what Gaydar did over the past two years."    In Baburin's opinion, expressed in an interview with  Interfax  on Monday, Gaydar's step was prompted by Russia's Choice in view  of the 1996 presidential elections, "in order to distance  themselves from the current economic situation, lay all the  blame on Chernomyrdin and his technocrats, and force the entire  opposition to start defending Russia's government in connection  with Russia's Choice's attack on it."</p>

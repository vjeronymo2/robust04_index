			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Arts: Just show me a painting - William Packer is fed up with current academic orthodoxy One might well feel that a year that began with Gravity &amp; Grace, the South Bank Board's high-minded, mind-numbing survey of the conceptual sculpture of the early 1970s, at the Hayward in January; got into its stride with the narrow critical correctness of the Barclays Young Artists Award (now defunct) at the Serpentine; continued with Georgia O'Keefe at the Hayward in the spring, Richard Hamilton at Venice and Tony Bevan at the Whitechapel in the summer; and wound up last month with Julian Opie's play-bricks at the Hayward (again), the recent glories of the Turner Prize, and the present graphic fatuities of Michael Craig-Martin at Waddington, must have been pretty grim. Well, up to a point it was. I am not sure whether I find the academic orthodoxy of the earnest apologists for so much of this stuff, the polarised arguments of their critical opponents, or the work itself, the more dispiriting. It is as clear a nonsense to suppose that the Tate, for example, should only concern itself with the current effusions of the Goldsmiths' College, as that nothing of any interest will ever come from that source. The heresy is that only the supposed avant-garde of the moment can be of any creative interest. There is, of course, a great deal of abstract art of the highest quality, and minimalist and conceptual works of great beauty and imaginative potency - of course, of course. And figurative art is still with us, and the direct response to the real and perceived world will always remain as valid in creative terms as any amount of theorising or conceptual posturing. Of course: of course: all so obvious. And so why is it necessary to say as much, again and again? That said, we can cheer up, for throughout the year there has been, as always, a great deal about to do just that, cheer us up. Paris in particular, has been a great comfort, and Venice too, and London and Edinburgh not so far off the pace. Here then, in a short space, are a few plums picked from my own basket of shows I actually reviewed. Matisse at the Centre Pompidou, a show quite distinct from last year's full retrospective in New York, and the definitive review of the artist's early career; 1893, l'Europe des Peintres, at the Musee d'Orsay; the Nabis, at the Grand Palais (prematurely closed since the roof fell in): the Unknown Modigliani, at the Palazzo Grassi, doubling the canon of known drawings and transforming our understanding of the artist; the Venice Biennale's ommagio to Francis Bacon, at the Museo Correr; late Pissarro's late city-scapes, at the Royal Academy; Lucian Freud's work of the last decade, at the Whitechapel; the Holbein drawings in the Royal Collection, at the National Gallery of Scotland; Dennis Creffield's Petworth paintings, at Gillian Jason; Hamish Fulton, at Annely Juda; Graham Sutherland's early prints, at the Fine Art Society - not so bad a year at all.</p>

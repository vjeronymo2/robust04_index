			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 5 Jun (AFP) -- By Saturday night, Cuban  authorities have still not confirmed reports from the United  States that 61 Cuban refugees, fleeing Cuba by boat, were  attacked by Cuban naval vessels, which resulted in the injury of  seven people.    The official Cuban press has still not released any  information on this new incident, which took place at the same  time 124 Cubans occupy the Belgian ambassador's residence in  Havana.    According to the passengers rescued south of Florida on  Saturday by the U.S. Coast Guard, their boat was chased by Cuban  military vessels following their departure from Mariel (40 km  west of Havana), and they were fired upon.    A coast guard spokesman had not confirmed by Saturday night  the origin of the shots, stating only that 61 Cubans had been  rescued from sea and that seven were wounded, four by gunshots.</p>

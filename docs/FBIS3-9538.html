			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, March 23 (CTK) -- The Chamber of Deputies  today passed the government-proposed amendment to the Employment  Law, with changes as made in the joint report of the  parliamentary committees. Parliament did not approve any of the  changes proposed by opposition deputies during yesterday's  debate.    Deputies of the government coalition parties, the Liberal  National Social Party (LSNS) and independent deputy Josef Jezek,  a former deputy of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) voted for  the government draft amendment. Opposition deputies did not  support the amendment -- they either were not present or voted  against it.    Deputies present from the Czech Social Democratic Party  (CSSD), Liberal Social Union (LSU) and independent deputy  Ladislav Rymes voted against the amendment. Members of the  deputies' groups of the Left Bloc (LB), Communist Party of  Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), Movement for Self-Governing  Democracy-Society for Moravia and Silesia (HSD-SMS),  Czech-Moravian Central Party (CMSS) and Assembly for the  Republic-Czechoslovak Republican Party (SPR-RSC) abstained from  voting.    Neither a proposal by Petra Buskova (CSSD) that a provision  banning women's employment at night be excluded from the Labor  Law nor changes reflecting trade unions' stand proposed by  Deputy Hana Orgonikova from the LSU were approved by parliament.    According to the amended Labor Law, employment legislation  will concern all types of employers equally -- be they physical  or legal persons. Up to now terms and conditions of employment  between an employee and an employer who is a legal person were  set down by the labor law, those between an employee and an  employer who is a physical person by government regulations.  The amended law transfers the decision-making concerning  overtime work from ministries to employment offices.    The amendment says that at places where no trade union is  active, an employer can provide his employees advantages similar  to that set down in a collective agreement (concluded between an  employer and a trade union).    The new labor law makes provision for the future change in  the system of accident insurance by abolishing of the existing  compensation limits for the loss of income of persons who lose  their work capability due to accidents at work or diseases  ensuing from the nature of employment. The pensions these  people receive will rise with the growth of the average salary.</p>

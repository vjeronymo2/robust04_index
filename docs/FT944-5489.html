			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / An investment for the top drawer: Although gilts look like a good long-term bet there is no rush to buy UK inflation, as Mr Kenneth Clarke reminded listeners to his Budget speech this week, has not been so low since England won football's World Cup in 1966. But in the following year, two national humiliations occurred: the pound was devalued and Scotland defeated England at Wembley. There has been little but bad news on either the football or the inflation front ever since. Investors in UK government bonds, or gilts, have suffered third division returns for much of the intervening period, since inflation erodes the value of fixed income investments. An investment of Pounds 100 in gilts in 1966 would, in inflation-adjusted terms, have been worth just Pounds 94 by 1985, even allowing for the reinvestment of all gross income. Only in the last few years have gilts rebounded sufficiently to earn investors a decent return. Nevertheless, at the end of 1993, that original Pounds 100 was still worth just Pounds 181, according to BZW's Equity-Gilt Study, whereas the same sum invested in UK equities would have generated Pounds 483. This year has seen a return to the bad old days for gilt investors. The FT government securities index has dropped from 107.6 on January 3 to 92.3 yesterday, forcing the yield on medium-term gilts up from 6.1 to 8.46 per cent. A look at the chart, however, shows that the real (inflation-adjusted) return on gilts currently looks quite attractive in historical terms. The benchmark 10-year gilt was offering a yield to maturity of 8.46 per cent at the start of trading yesterday. That compares with a headline inflation rate in October of just 2.4 per cent. Inflation may have reached its trough as the recovery starts to pick up speed both in the UK and worldwide. But even if one assumes that inflation rises to the top of the government's 1-4 per cent target range, that still means gilts would offer a real yield of around 4.5 per cent, compared with negative returns for much of the 1970s. Furthermore, after the Budget, UK government finances appear in good order. Mr Clarke forecasts the public sector will be in surplus by 1998-99. By 1996, it will meet two of the main Maastricht criteria for joining European monetary union; its deficit will be 3 per cent, and gross debt will be below 60 per cent, of gross domestic product. In contrast, the likes of Belgium, Italy, Spain and Denmark seem in danger of failing to meet one of the criteria. That may make UK gilts look more attractive to international investors. In the longer term, UK investment institutions may also be more willing to buy gilts than in the recent past, so supporting prices. For a start, pension funds are likely to increase their gilt holdings to meet the solvency requirements suggested by the Goode Committee on pensions law reform. But a low-inflation environment should in any case make the secure returns offered by gilts a vital element of any institutional portfolio. So does this make gilts a bargain? It all depends on your investment horizon. According to Mr Simon Briscoe, bond analyst at S G Warburg: 'If you're going to buy gilts and put them away in your top drawer, there hasn't been a better time for a generation.' Mr Keith Skeoch, chief economist at James Capel, agrees. 'If you are willing to hold gilts until redemption, they are exceptionally good value,' he says. But in the short term, the outlook does not look as good. Mr Skeoch says it is 'very unusual for a bond market to rally without seeing the top in short-term interest rates'. It is normally difficult for gilt prices to rise when interest rates are increasing sharply. Whether or not UK rates are increased after this week's meeting between Mr Clarke and Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, most people believe they will go up early in the New Year. The Confederation of British Industry expects base rates, currently 5.75 per cent, to reach 7.5 per cent by 1996. 'UK markets are uncertain about chances of an imminent base rate rise,' says Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets. The world economic situation is not of a type normally conducive to a strong performance by bonds. 'It is difficult for bonds to rally at a time when economic growth is strong and cyclical inflation is rising,' says Mr Skeoch. He emphasises that it is important to disentangle the long-term shift to a low-inflation environment from the cyclical position of a UK economy growing at 4 per cent a year against a background of rising commodity prices. Furthermore, Ms Katy Peters, senior economist at Daiwa Europe, points out that a 'lot of money went into gilts expecting a good Budget', and such a buying spree is usually followed by a reaction. Markets are also likely to be jittery until it becomes clear how much Mr Clarke will give away in pre-election tax cuts. So while gilts may look a good long-term bet, there is no rush to buy. Income-seeking private investors could be tempted to wait until April when, following a Budget change to personal equity plan rules, it will be possible to own tax-free corporate bonds and preference shares instead. Still, gilt investors should count themselves lucky. The patience needed by the buyer of government securities is as nothing compared with that required of the England football supporter. Roll on the World Cup of 2026.</p>

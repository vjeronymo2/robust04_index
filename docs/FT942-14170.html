			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / New order nobleman, In ascent at summer's crest, By spring was felled: William Dawkins on Morihiro Hosokawa's poetic finale The cherry blossoms of Shinjuku gardens, a hardy double-bloomed variety, are among the last to fall in Tokyo. It was poetically appropriate that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa put in an appearance at the gardens yesterday for the final official display of his ephemeral administration, the prime minister's annual blossom viewing party. Mr Hosokawa and Shinjuku's fragrant pink blossoms will both fall in the next few days, each marking the end of a different kind of spring. Will they both fade into obscurity? The parallel was not lost on the 7,000 or so members of Tokyo's elite who yesterday morning joined Mr Hosokawa for a celebration tinged with nostalgia. The more literary of the politicians staged an informal competition for the most apt haiku, a three-line unrhyming poem. 'A flower does not lament. It takes one day at a time,' proffered one member of parliament. Another part-time poet, Mr Satsuki Eda, minister for science and technology, was also inspired by the brief life of the petals: 'Blossom falls without providing peace of mind.' Mr Eda was doubtless thinking of his government colleagues who could not join the party. They were locked in smoke-filled rooms for the 12th day of negotiations about the next coalition. By the evening, party officals were a fraction closer to agreement on unpoetic things such as national security, North Korea and tax, indicating that they might just make a decision before the last of Tokyo's blossoms fall. Mr Hosokawa, who has confessed recently to feeling like a caged bird that has just been freed, looked relaxed. He strolled amiably among the striped tents, barrels of sake and tables of provisions, undismayed by the pressing crowds. The aristocratic prime minister admitted he had no particular plans beyond taking things easy. Mr Tsutomu Hata, his likely successor, did not join the haiku competition, being more of a musician than a poet - he is reputedly one of the finest karaoke singers in the Japanese parliament. 'I just came here quietly to enjoy the cherry blossom,' he told a television interviewer. It could, given the storminess of Mr Hosokawa's eight-month government, have been Mr Hata's last opportunity for quiet enjoyment for some time.</p>

Sani  Abacha in its efforts to build a united country.    In a message on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr (end of the  Ramadan) made available to journalists Friday [11 March],  Babangida urged Nigerians not to undermine the unity of the  country but keep to the tenets of their religion. He said in  line with the doctrines of Ramadan, Nigerians should always  create "an atmosphere of love for one another and develop the  spirit of brotherhood and righteousness and service to Allah and  the country" in order to live in peace and harmony.    This is the first public statement of the former military  ruler who stepped down seven months ago after plunging the  country into crisis over the annulment of the results of the  elections held on 12 June 1993 in which his close friend,  millionaire businessman Moshood Abiola claimed victory. Before  stepping down, Babangida handed over power to a civilian interim  government led by industrialist Ernest Shonekan who was ousted  by Abacha in November 1993.</p>

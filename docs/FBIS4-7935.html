			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, April 7 -- The Sejm on Thursday did not pass  again a law on new wage-control measures after it had been  vetoed by the president. Despite the address of the prime  minister who appealed to reject the presidential veto, only 243  deputies voted for adopting the law again. To accept the law,  the Sejm needed an absolute majority, that is, in this instance  266 votes.    146 MPs [members of parliament] voted to reject the law,  mainly from the opposition parties of the Confederation for an  Independent Poland (KPN), the Democratic Union (UD), the Union  of Labour (UP), the Non-party Reform Bloc (BBWR), German  Minority as well as from the All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions  (OPZZ) and the Polish Socialist Party (PPS). 10 deputies  abstained.    The Sejm passed the legislation on new wage-control measures  this March 18, but two weeks later President Lech Walesa refused  to sign the law arguing that it aims to halt economic reforms  and will lead to a comeback of the centrally-controlled economy.    Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak addressing the chamber,  appealed to adopt the law once again and start work on its  amendmends taking into account Lech Walesa's remarks. After the  vote the prime minister told journalists that one should not  dramatise the situation. He hopes that enterprises will operate  according to their economic prospects and according to the  economic prospects of the country.    The law, aimed to curb inflation, provided that as of April  1, if enterprises exceeded the permitted limit of wage growth,  they would have to pay a special penalty amounting to 150 per  cent of the extra increase figure. The legislation covered all  state-owned enterprises and companies with more than 80 per cent  of shares belonging to the State Treasury, state-owned forests  and banks.    The law also included a clause which would allow the  government to use it against private companies "in order to  fight special threats to financial stability."    The clause stirred up most controversy and Helena Goralska  from the Democratic Union (UD) said that that is why her party  decided to support the president's veto. Ryszard Bugaj from the  Union of Labour (UP) pointed to the fact that different economic  subjects would be treated unevenly under the law.    Deputies from the ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and  the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) argued that the rejection of the  law would lead to uncontrolled inflation, price hikes and even  destruction of the budget.    The legislation was to replace the highly criticised law on  excess wage tax introduced by the first non-communist finance  minister Leszek Balcerowicz.</p>

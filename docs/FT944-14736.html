			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: US telecoms There are two main lessons from this week's results from US long distance telecoms operators. First, that large price cuts are no longer needed to stimulate growth in call volumes. Second, that there is little pressure on the three main operators - AT&amp;T, MCI and Sprint - to resume the frenetic price-cutting of previous years. The overall market is growing at 9 per cent a year. Some of that is down to robust economic growth. But the economy is also becoming more telecoms intensive: customers are lapping up new services such as voice mail and data communications. Given that the operators' main cost - paying for access to local networks - is also falling, it is hardly surprising that margins have widened. Meanwhile, the industry has settled into a stable phase. MCI, which used to cut prices aggressively to build up market share, is now emphasising margin improvement. That means AT&amp;T is not forced to respond with its own price cuts and has even been able to raise prices on a selective basis. The entrance of the Baby Bells into long-distance market could have upset this modus vivendi, but legislation enabling that collapsed last month. The real concerns about the companies relate to their activities outside the long-distance market. All three have ambitious strategies to enter wireless communications. In AT&amp;T's case, that has already diluted earnings. That explains why the rosy outlook for long-distance services has not been reflected in the groups' share prices.</p>

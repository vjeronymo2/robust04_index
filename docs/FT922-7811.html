			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sparebanken Nor back in the black SPAREBANKEN Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank known internationally as Union Bank of Norway, yesterday reported that it had returned to profit in the first quarter, helped by a reduction in operating costs and stable income. Operating profit was NKr4m (Dollars 629,400) compared with a NKr168m operating loss in the same period last year. Operating profit, before credit losses, rose by NKr137m to NKr317m. Credit losses were reduced by NKr35m to NKr313m. Sparebanken Nor said that net interest income improved slightly to NKr657m from NKr644m. Operating costs were reduced by NKr81m to NKr584m. The bank boosted specified loan loss reserves to NKr2.6bn from NKr1.7bn in last year's first quarter reporting period. Unspecified loan loss reserves were increased by NKr367m to NKr1.17bn. 'The most important reason for the bank's improvement is a 14 per cent reduction in operating costs by the parent bank,' Sparebanken Nor said.</p>

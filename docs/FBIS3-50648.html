			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Mexico City XEW Television Network in  Spanish at 1200 GMT on 4 January broadcasts, as part of its  "ECO" news service, a four-minute report on reaction from  various Mexican political parties to the recent armed  insurrection and subsequent official reaction to events in  Chiapas State.    In a communique issued on 3 January, PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] President Fernando Ortiz Arana strongly  condemned the violence. The communique states: "Legitimate  demands for greater social welfare can be only fulfilled through  peace." The text adds: "The PRI asked the government to enforce  the laws and thoroughly investigate and identify those  responsible for these incidents. The PRI reiterates its support  for authorities in Chiapas and the Mexican Army to continue  acting in accordance with the law and confirms its determination  that dialogue would be in the best interests of all Mexicans."    PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] President Porfirio  Munoz Ledo condemned and regretted the incidents in Chiapas.  Munoz Ledo noted: "Everyone's first reaction, regardless of  political party or ideological conviction, has been to reject  clearly and categorically the use of violence as the means of  solving problems in Mexico."    PAN [National Action Party] Deputy Secretary General Cecilia  Romero said in reaction: "It is necessary that the source of  these incidents be clarified, responsibilities be defined,  factions involved be investigated thoroughly, and authorities  explain to the Mexican people how they plan to resolve this  conflict definitively."    Mexican Ecological Party [PEM] presidential candidate Jorge  Gonzalez said: "A calm analysis of events is essential to a  clear understanding and to stopping bloodshed throughout the  country."</p>

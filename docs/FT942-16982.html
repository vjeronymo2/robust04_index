			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / SBC ruffles feathers in Eurotunnel camp A row involving Eurotunnel, its financial advisers and Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC) took a surprise turn yesterday with a ban on a senior SBC executive taking part in Eurotunnel's proposed Pounds 600m-Pounds 750m rights issue. SBC is financial adviser to Transmanche Link (TML), the construction consortium which built the Channel tunnel. The dispute over SBC's role in the rights issue threatens to take the gloss off the payments settlement reached on Tuesday between Eurotunnel and TML. Sir Alastair Morton, co-chairman of Eurotunnel, which will operate trains through the tunnel, announced that SBC had confirmed that Mr Brian Keelan, a senior corporate finance executive, would play no part in the underwriting. Mr Keelan had aroused Sir Alastair's wrath by revealing that the rights issue might be as large as Pounds 750m. He had also irritated Eurotunnel's advisers, Morgan Grenfell, Banque Indosuez and SG Warburg Securities by appearing to exaggerate SBC's role in the rights issue. Eurotunnel said yesterday: 'comments by Mr Keelan on that issue, its possible timing and underwriting were improper, incorrect and unauthorised.' SBC was keen to play down the involvement of Mr Keelan in the underwriting. He had played a senior role in negotiating the settlement between TML and Eurotunnel, but would not have a part in the underwriting, SBC said. SBC will still play an important role. As well as handling a Pounds 75m share issue to TML and a Pounds 52m funding deal linked to warrants, it is also expected to be responsible for a quarter of the primary underwriting of the main rights issue. But one banker said: 'They have used the underwriting of the shares being taken up by TML to push into the transaction and trodden on the toes of Eurotunnel's traditional advisers.' Mr Keelan is a senior member of a corporate finance team which has ruffled a few City feathers. As part of its efforts to expand in the London market, SBC has taken to attacking accepted practices and undercutting rivals - or, as it might argue, it has brought innovative ideas to a rather staid system. Mr Keelan last year challenged the traditional flat-rate 2 per cent fee for underwriting rights issues. He argued that by using option theory, underwriters could set a price directly related to the risk involved in the exercise. He was also involved when SBC intervened in the enhanced scrip dividend scheme pioneered by Barclays de Zoete Wedd to offer a better deal to investors. Lex, Page 18</p>

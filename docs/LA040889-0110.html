			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NWA REJECTS MARVIN DAVIS' $2.6-BILLION BID AS TOO LOW  </P> <P> NWA Inc., parent company of Northwest Airlines, Friday rejected a $2.62-billion  takeover offer by oil investor Marvin Davis, saying it was too low.  </P> <P> Davis, who holds about 3% of NWA, said last week he wanted to purchase NWA for  $90 a share. He said he wanted to expand the airline and make it stronger.  </P> <P> Davis said his move was prompted in part by an NWA statement that a second  outside group, which has not been identified, said it might also launch a  takeover bid for NWA. That group holds 4.9% of the company's stock.  </P> <P> At the time of the offer on March 30, Davis said he was seeking a "friendly  transaction," adding that he considered the price generous.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Keeping Tokyo Property  </P> <P> "Our board has carefully considered Mr. Davis' proposal as well as numerous  other financial and strategic alternatives available to NWA," Chairman Steve  Rothmeier said Friday. "It is clear that Mr. Davis' proposal does not fully  reflect the value of NWA."  </P> <P> Rumors of a possible takeover of St. Paul-based NWA have circulated in  financial markets for the past few months, due in part to its valuable Tokyo  real estate holdings.  </P> <P> NWA turned down a $200-million offer for the Tokyo real estate last year,  saying it wanted to keep the land for housing employees and development.  </P> <P> Kevin Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley, said the $90-a-share bid is  "not an unfair price." But Davis' failure to line up financing may have been  troubling, he said.  </P> <P> "Davis didn't persuade NWA that his offer was serious," he said. "The next move  is to convince the shareholders that it is," Murphy said, adding: "It's going  to be expensive for Davis to do that."  </P> <P> Davis said he was disappointed in the rejection and said he would raise the  offer if the company's management could show that NWA was worth more.  </P> <P> "We have a strong, serious interest in owning NWA. In that regard, we are in  the process of completing financing arrangements for the acquisition and expect  to be in a position to describe them shortly," Davis said Friday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expects Record Results  </P> <P> At the time of the offer, Davis noted that his bid represented a 50% premium  over NWA's stock price over the past few months. Since then, the shares have  risen more than $20. The stock closed down 50 cents Friday at $88.75 a share,  before the rejection of the bid was announced.  </P></p>

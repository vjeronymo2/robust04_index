			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Major's offer on GCHQ rejected Civil service unions yesterday rejected an offer from Mr John Major, the prime minister, to resolve the continuing dispute over trade union membership at GCHQ, Britain's electronic listening post based at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. Unions were banned at the organisation 10 years ago. Mr Major was repeating a suggestion put forward several weeks ago by Sir Robin Butler, the cabinet secretary, that the staff federation at GCHQ should be allowed to affiliate with the Council of Civil Service Unions. The proposal was rejected by union leaders, who left a 45-minute meeting at Downing Street saying that the prime minister had placed nothing new on the table. Mr Bill Brett, general secretary of the Institution of Professionals Managers and Specialists, who led the union delegation, said: 'We rejected the staff federation offer because it is irrelevant to the real issue.' He added: 'It was a civilised meeting but did not have a civilised ending. The problem is in the minds of ministers, no one else.' Mr Barry Reamsbottom, general secretary of the Civil and Public Services Association, said Mr Major's message was exactly the same when the unions were first banned in 1984. 'The bottom line is still the same,' he said. 'The government believes that national loyalty is not compatible with trade union membership.' A demonstration is being planned in Cheltenham next month to mark the 10th anniversary of the ban, and the government faces being censured by the International Labour Organisation. Mr Major, accompanied by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, told the officials he was not hostile to trade unions but had not changed his mind about an 'inherent conflict of interest' involved in belonging to a union in such a sensitive job. The prime minister's stance was criticised afterwards by opposition parties. Mr Nigel Jones, Liberal Democrat MP for Cheltenham, said: 'The prime minister is breaking international law. He knows that what the government did 10 years ago was illegal, but he does not have the courage to say so and put right a wrong which has lasted a decade.'</p>

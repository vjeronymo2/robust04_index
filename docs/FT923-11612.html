			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / International Company News: Sales inch ahead at US defence group MARTIN Marietta, the US aerospace and defence company, yesterday reported a 12 per cent improvement in second-quarter operating earnings to Dollars 157.3m. A bigger increase in the effective tax rate than a year ago, however, meant that net earnings were Dollars 99m, only slightly higher than the Dollars 97.9m earned after tax in the second quarter of 1991. Sales in the quarter were also only slightly higher than a year ago, topping Dollars 1.58bn between April and June, compared with Dollars 1.57bn in the same period of 1991. The company said revenues from the electronics, information and missiles group rose 2 per cent in the quarter. During the quarter, Martin Marietta won a Dollars 37m contract to develop an improved propulsion system for the Patriot missile, and an initial Dollars 20m contract for Lantirn, a night vision navigation and targeting system, from the Republic of Korea. Operating earnings from the aerospace division rose by 12 per cent between April and June, while earnings at the materials division rose 15 per cent. Sales backlog for the entire company was valued at Dollars 9.3bn at end-June, against Dollars 11.3bn a year ago.</p>

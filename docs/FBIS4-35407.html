			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 29 May (MENA) -- Yemeni Foreign Minister  Muhammad Salih Basindwah has said that Sanaa does not reject a  cease-fire, but does not accept one based on the imposition of  secession. Secession is impossible, he said.    In statements following his meeting with Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majd today, Basindwah said  that as a condition for ending the fighting between Sanaa and  Aden, legitimacy and the Constitution must be the standards. He  stressed that all Yemenis defend unity and reject separation.    On 'Ali Salim al-Bid's request that south Yemen's Arab  League  membership be restored, Basindwah said the Arab League secretary  general stressed to him that the request has no standing.    The Yemeni foreign minister denied that Iraqi or Sudanese  forces are fighting alongside the Yemeni forces in the north.  He said the southern allegations in this respect are false.  Sanaa does not need fighters; it is Aden that needs additional  forces, he said.    Basindwah said he informed Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid of the latest  developments in Yemen.    He said events in Yemen prove that the "secessionists"  cannot  establish "their alleged state".    He said the head of the alleged state has fled to  Hadhramaut,  and will flee abroad from there.    He accused the southerners of providing shelter to world  terrorist leaders, notably Marcos [name as received] and  Abu-Nidal [Sabri al-Banna].    Asked what Sanaa's position will be if the UN Security  Council passes a resolution on the Yemeni crisis, Basindwah  said: We oppose any interference in the crisis by the Security  Council because this is an internal affair.    If the Security Council issues a resolution, he said, then  we  will react according to the situation.</p>

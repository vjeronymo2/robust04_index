			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas Not many companies go to such lengths to highlight their weaknesses as British Gas. But then not many companies' fates depend so hugely on the outcome of a Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry. If British Gas's directors owned hair shirts, they would surely have worn them yesterday. Annual profits were hit by Pounds 320m of extremely prudent exceptional charges. By refraining from capitalising interest on Pounds 1bn of exploration expenditure, the company further depressed its bottom line. At the operating level, the results contained few surprises. Ofgas's pricing regime is clearly squeezing the company, forcing it to cut costs to improve efficiency. The effects of more rigorous competition are also becoming apparent. For the moment at least, the weather remains a greater variable affecting profitability. Gas's shares are supported by a dividend yield above 6 per cent. The MMC's conclusions could send them sharply either way. Having seen their shares climb 20 per cent since the referral, nervous investors may wish to switch into other utility stocks until the horizon clears. But the suspicion must be that the company's plight will ease. The MMC is due to report in April - probably just before the government launches its third sale of shares in British Telecommunications. That would be an embarrassing moment for the government come down hard on a privatised utility.</p>

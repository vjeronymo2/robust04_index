			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN ALBUM: PRESCRIPTIONS FOR AN AGED PATIENT, THE POISON-DAMAGED TREATY  OAK, INCLUDE BOTH SCIENCE, TALISMANS.  </P> <P> John Giedraitis opened the package that had come in the morning mail. The  talisman inside was for the ailing Treaty Oak.  </P> <P> "May fear and hate become peace and love," it read. "May poison become the  water of life. And may you be healed." With it was a letter from the sender,  one Erik Felker of Burbank, Calif.  </P> <P> "That's just today's basket of goodies," Giedraitis said as he stuck the charm  into the ground. Someone else had already sent a crystal reputed to have  healing powers, and it was tucked into the knot of the tree. A suggestion had  been made that playing Indian sitar music would help save the gigantic,  600-year-old oak.  </P> <P> Giedraitis' jovial manner on this hot afternoon belied the very serious nature  of his work and the importance of his gnarled patient. As Austin's urban  forester, he has spent the past two months as head of a team of experts  desperately trying to save the Treaty Oak -- one of the nation's grandest tree  specimens -- from a poisoning that was discovered just before the Memorial Day  weekend.  </P> <P> The poison, however, is still coursing through the historic tree and killing  each new flush of leaves. Someone poured on enough of the herbicide Velpar to  kill the Treaty Oak 20 times over, and the odds are that this much-loved  patient will die.  </P> <P> The Treaty Oak shades a quiet neighborhood street near downtown Austin. Its  name derived from the legend -- probably unfounded -- that Stephen F. Austin  signed the first boundary agreement with the Indians under its branches in  1824.  </P> <P> The tree held a special place in history long before then, long before Texas  was even Texas. The Indians believed that drinking a special concoction made  from the tree's acorns would assure warriors of return home from battle, and  use of another brew was believed to ensure a mate's fidelity.  </P> <P> In 1927, the American Forestry Assn. enshrined the Treaty Oak in its Hall of  Fame for Trees, dubbing it the most perfect North American specimen. When it  was in danger of being cut down a few years later, a campaign to save it spread  across Texas.  </P> <P> Giedraitis proposed to his wife under the tree.  </P> <P> When he received a call reporting that the tree seemed to be ailing, the first  thing that crossed his mind was that it might be afflicted with oak wilt, a  disease that has killed an estimated 10,000 oaks around Austin in the last 20  years.  </P> <P> When state laboratory tests detected the herbicide, DuPont, which manufactures  Velpar, offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to conviction of the  poisoner. Billionaire H. Ross Perot, the richest man in Texas, stepped in then  and offered to foot the bill for the best treatment money could buy.  </P> <P> A task force assembled from around the country recommended that the tree be  sprayed and shaded and that all the soil around it be excavated to a point  where no more poison was detectable. Large sun screens attached to telephone  poles now surround the tree, and its leaves are bathed by a custom sprinkler  system every 30 minutes. In the most recent attempt at expunging the poison, a  mild saline solution was injected into hundreds of tiny holes drilled into the  roots.  </P> <P> The treatments so far have cost $63,000. Giedraitis said the fate of the Treaty  Oak will be known for certain in the spring.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police had been working the case hard. Almost a month after the  poisoning was discovered, they arrested a drifter and former convict, Paul  Stedman Cullen. He has been charged with criminal mischief. So far, there is no  known motive for the poisoning.  </P> <P> Each day now, people drop by to pay their respects to this tree that was here  long before the city. Some bow their heads in prayer; others just read the  Treaty Oak historical marker. Many also sign the posters that are attached to  the chain-link fence.  </P> <P> "Get well, Treaty Oak," reads one inscription penned in a very young hand.  "Hope you get better soon. Don't die."  </P></p>

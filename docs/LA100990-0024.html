			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> NO LIGHTER FLUID BAN IN WORKS;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY AIR QUALITY OFFICIALS WILL SEEK OTHER METHODS OF REDUCING  POLLUTION FIRST.  </P> <P> While much of Southern California will soon be giving up the smoky American  tradition of using lighter fluid to start the back-yard barbecue, Ventura  County cooks can continue to light their fires any way they want.  </P> <P> At least as long as county officials continue to focus their attention on other  air pollution sources.  </P> <P> The South Coast Air Quality Management District last week adopted the first ban  in the nation on the sale of most lighter fluids and pre-soaked briquettes in  Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties starting in 1992.  </P> <P> But the top official at Ventura County's Air Pollution Control District says  there is little chance that anyone will start tinkering soon with county  barbecuing practices.  </P> <P> The primary focus for the county now is reduction of emissions from large  pollution sources like motor vehicles and power plants, rather than smaller  sources like charcoal and lighter fluid, said Richard Baldwin, county air  pollution control officer.  </P> <P> "That's the kind of thing we will propose if we can't find other solutions,"  Baldwin said.  </P> <P> Baldwin did not rule out the possibility that Ventura County may also place  solvent-based lighter fluids under closer scrutiny as other sources of air  pollution are controlled or eliminated.  </P> <P> But he noted that South Coast district officials have studied the lighter fluid  issue closely enough to be able to estimate that 2,700 gallons of lighter fluid  are used in the four-county area every day, generating emissions equal to  34,000 cars or an oil refinery.  </P> <P> So far, Baldwin said, officials have not yet even studied how much lighter  fluid is used in Ventura County or begun to consider how a similar ban might  help clean up Ventura County air.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Baldwin made it clear that he thinks lighter fluid is an inferior  way of starting a back-yard barbecue, even if it remains legal here.  </P> <P> "I started using an electric starter 13 or 14 years ago because of the taste,"  he said. "My most recent test of this was yesterday, when I barbecued ribs  without lighter fluid and enjoyed the taste."  </P> <P> A brief survey of county barbecuers Monday revealed, however, that there are  some strong feelings on both sides of the question.  </P> <P> As he turned some tri-tip steaks on a grill at Arroyo Verde Park in Ventura,  Ron Dawson of Oxnard, a computer scientist for the federal government, said he  thinks the government should keep its regulatory mitts off his barbecue.  </P> <P> "You're fooling with an American tradition that absolutely should not be  tampered with," Dawson said.  </P> <P> If such a measure were passed in Ventura County, Dawson said he may be forced  to cross county lines looking for the lighter fluid or to search for contraband  products.  </P> <P> "Can you imagine a black market for charcoal in mom-and-pop stores?" he asked.  </P> <P> Among county officials, there was a little more readiness to consider other  barbecue options.  </P> <P> Robert Braitman, executive director of the Local Agency Formation Commission  and an outdoor chef of some repute in county government circles, said he often  uses lighter fluid on his custom-made barbecue.  </P> <P> However, he said, he knows several techniques, because he was trained by the  barbecuers of Santa Maria and Lompoc, where barbecue is a way of life.  </P> <P> He sometimes substitutes oak for coals and lights the fire with paper and  twigs, Braitman said. Or he fills hollowed-out tin cans with briquettes, lights  them with just a tiny bit of lighter fluid that newspaper could replace and  fans the flames with a blow-dryer.  </P> <P> "I am ready to cook in 15 minutes when I use that method," he said.  </P> <P> One Ventura County supporter of the ban on lighter fluid is environmental  activist Russ Baggerly.  </P> <P> Before he became a leader in the environmental movement, Baggerly said, he used  lighter fluid to start back-yard barbecues.  </P> <P> He rarely has time for that activity anymore, Baggerly said. But if he ever  again gets time to barbecue, Baggerly said he'll buy an electric fire starter  or a gas barbecue.  </P> <P> "It's cleaner fuel, and you get the same effect from gas as charcoal but  without a mess," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Western European countries and Canada have pledged $1.8 billion in aid over the  next three years to war-ravaged Central America, provided that the region makes  progress toward peace and democratic reforms, U.N. officials said. The money is  to be administered by the U.N. Development Program, which has drawn up a  program for the region that would cost a total of $4.3 billion. The program,  known as the Special Plan for Economic Cooperation for Central America, ranges  from measures to help Central American refugees to steps that would reactivate  the defunct Central American Common Market, reduce the region's foreign debt  and promote industry and agriculture.  </P></p>

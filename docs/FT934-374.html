			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Japanese PM sees upturn despite gloom Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday predicted a national economic upturn by next summer and brushed aside the latest rash of gloomy indicators. 'Although pessimism is prevalent over the prospects for the economy, I take a rather different view,' said Mr Hosokawa. He was speaking four days after unveiling a six-point economic plan for deregulation and tax reform, widely criticised by business leaders as lacking substance. Japan's jobless rate has continued to rise, edging up last month to 2.8 per cent, a six-year high, and a tenth of a point more than in October. The number of people looking for a job continued to rise, by 18 per cent annually, while job offers fell by about the same rate. As a result, the number of jobs per 100 applicants declined to 65 last month, from 93 at the turn of the year. Job losses are worst among women - where employment fell by 0.5 per cent over 12 months - farmers and manufacturing workers. The weak job market has been a continued drag on consumer spending, as shown by a 6.9 per cent decline in sales by large retailers in the year to November. The Tokyo consumer price index rose by a mere 1.3 per cent over that period, as clothing and furniture stores offered big discounts and companies cut entertainment spending. However, the prospects for an increase in industrial employment look remote, as shown by a 3.6 per cent year-on-year fall in industrial output last month, marking a record 26 months of decline. Inventories rose by 0.9 per cent from the previous month, suggesting that companies still need to curb production in line with weak demand. Orders received by Japan's 50 largest construction groups fell by 16.1 per cent last month, from a year earlier, a slowdown compared with the 24.3 per cent drop recorded in October. This was despite an 8.7 per cent rise in housing starts, one of the few bright spots. Japan's gross domestic product (total output of goods and services) grew a revised real 0.4 per cent in 1992-93, after a 3.6 per cent gain the previous year, said the Economic Planning Agency last week. Gross national product (GDP minus net income from overseas production) grew by a real 0.7 per cent in fiscal 1992-93, ended last March, after a 3.6 per cent gain in 1990-91. In nominal terms, GDP rose 2.1 per cent in 1992-93 after a 5.4 per cent rise in 1991-92, and GNP rose 2.4 per cent. Muramoto Construction, subject of Japan's largest post-war financial collapse, has obtained court approval to restructure. The group filed for protection from its creditors early last month, with debts of up to Y590bn, after banks withdrew support. Muramoto's fate, caused by investment in over-valued golf courses in the late-1980s, has led to the collapse of seven suppliers.</p>

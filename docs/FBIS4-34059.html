			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Carlos Alberto Sardenberg] </F>   [Text] The economic team believes that it is losing control  of the Real Plan. After President Itamar Franco trampled on it  in the chapters on rents, school fees, and the antitrust law,  the economic team now finds itself facing a greater threat: the  regulation of banking interest rates.    President Franco has asked Deputy Benito Gama (PFL-BA)  [Liberal Front Party - Bahia] to hasten the presentation of the  draft bill regulating Article 192, Paragraph 3, of the  Constitution, which establishes that real interest rates (not  including the inflation rate) cannot surpass 12 percent  annually. (Public federal bonds currently earn an interest rate  of 25 percent.)    But it so happens that Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero had  asked Deputy Gama exactly the opposite, that is, to delay as  much as possible the presentation of the aforementioned draft  bill.    Deputy Gama presides over the special Chamber of Deputies  Committee that will present the draft bill by order of the  Federal Supreme Court. The first deadline for presenting the  draft bill is 20 June, but Gama had agreed with Ricupero that he  will ask for an extension of the deadline.    All the members of the economic team, without exception,  consider it absurd to regulate interest rates. According to  them, it is wrong in theory, unfeasible in practice, and  politically incorrect.    President Itamar maintains a populist view that high  interest  rates are caused by bank profiteering with the connivance of the  Central Bank, while the economic team members believe that the  high interest rates are the consequence of the chronic  inflationary state of the Brazilian economy.    The whole logic of the Real Plan foresees minimum government  intervention in the economy. If government intervention is  necessary, the idea is to maintain economic neutrality so that  contracts in the new currency maintain the same equilibrium.    Directly inspired by President Itamar, exactly the opposite  was done with the conversion [into URV, real value unit] of the  school fees. Although they officially remain silent, the  economic team members believe that the formula to convert the  school fees [into URV] is simply absurd, because it takes into  account the nominal average fees of the previous four months  rather than the nominal real average fees.    The economic team also believes that the president's  intervention undermined the rent issue. Besides, the delay in  making a decision has resulted in some inflation points being  carried over to the inflation rate of July, the first month in  which the real will come into circulation. The rent contracts  that are converted into URV now will be paid in June, and they  will then be included in the composition of prices.    The economic team members believe that the uproar the  president made over the antitrust law has had a single effect:  an effective increase of prices, besides creating an atmosphere  of instability which is something very negative for the new  currency.    They believe that it is not necessary to issue an arrest  warrant against businessmen to make them lower their prices.  They believe that prices will remain stable because the public  deficit will be under control, the economy restrained, without  any excessive demands, and because the real will break the  inflationary inertia.</p>

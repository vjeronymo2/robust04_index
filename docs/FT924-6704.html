			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank replaces KPMG ROTHSCHILD Bank, the troubled Zurich affiliate of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons, has sacked its auditors, KPMG, Fides Peat. The move follows a series of misadventures at the bank in the past decade, culminating last summer in the arrest of its credit manager for fraud and a SFr250m (Dollars 178.5m) capital restructuring backed by the Rothschild family. Mr Adolf Lustenberger, the KPMG partner responsible for the Rothschild Bank account, confirmed that the firm was 'in the process of being replaced'. Rothschild Bank decided at its last board meeting that it would replace KPMG with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the firm which is carrying out an investigation into the bank's problems. Under Swiss banking law, a bank must apply to the Swiss Federal Banking Commission for permission to change auditors, and the Commission will hear evidence from both the auditor and the bank before deciding. In this case, the commission is likely to ask KPMG how it could have failed to notice and draw attention to some of the problems at the bank. Mr Lustenberger would not comment on the role of the firm. A spokesman for the bank said last week that losses on loans made improperly over a period of several years to companies associated with the German-Canadian property financiers, Mr Karsten von Wersebe and Mr Wolfgang Stolzenberg, would reach around SFr220m.</p>

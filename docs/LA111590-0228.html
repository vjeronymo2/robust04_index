			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HELMETS FOR YOUNG BIKE RIDERS URGED  </P> <P> Overzealous bicyclists can strain their muscles or grow saddle sore, but the  injuries that most need to be prevented are head injuries, those "that doctors  can't fix," says a local pediatrician.  </P> <P> "The serious injuries and the ones from which children do not recover are the  head injuries," says Dr. Modena Wilson, a pediatrician at Johns Hopkins  Hospital.  </P> <P> The best way to prevent these injuries -- skull fractures and often resulting  brain damage -- is to wear a helmet "from the first bicycle on," Wilson says.  </P> <P> Should a child hit his head, the helmet protects the skull and the brain by  cushioning the impact and spreading the shock around so that it is not all in  one spot.  </P> <P> Parents should buy only helmets that have been approved by the Snell Foundation  or the American National Standards Institute, Wilson says. If children are  reluctant to wear helmets, she suggests that "parents sort of gang up on their  kids" by making their area a "helmet neighborhood," where wearing the  protective gear is not only accepted but also required.  </P> <P> "Another high priority is keeping kids off roads . . . until they are old  enough to handle that," says Wilson, adding that children also need to be  instructed to follow the same rules of the road that motorists do.  </P> <P> "And children should not ride at night," she insists.  </P></p>

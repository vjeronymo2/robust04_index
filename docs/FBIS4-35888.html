			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 2 Jun (INA) -- Jordanian Interior Minister  Salamah Hammad has asserted that Jordan sided with Iraq as an  expression of its support for the Iraqi people in their  opposition to aggression and hegemony.    He added that Jordan realizes the magnitude of plotting  against the Arab and Islamic nation, which calls for activating  the nation's capabilities in the face of foreign challenges.    Hammad further said that the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq  and its unyielding people has lost all its justifications after  Iraq has complied with all international resolutions imposed  unfairly on it.    Salamah Hammad visited the holy shrines in al-Hadrah  al-Qadiriyah, al-Imam al-'Azam, al-Rawdah al-Kazimiyah, and the  Royal Cemetery in Baghdad.    The custodians of the religious shrines informed the guest  minister of President Saddam Husayn's concern for the holy  shrines and places of worship.    Salamah Hammad also laid a wreath on the Martyr's Memorial  and read verses from the Koran for the souls of the martyrs. He  then visited the gallery that contains martyr medals. He wrote  in the visitor's book, praising the brave position of the Iraqi  martyrs and their generous sacrifices to defend the soil of Iraq  and the glorious Arab nation.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P>  DAVID NELSON / SOCIETY: LESSON SHARED ON HELPING YOUNGSTERS  </P> <P> Banker Gordon Luce and ninth-grader LaRon Snelling shared the stage at the San  Diego Omni last Thursday as a symbol of an unusual pact formed between a group  of the city's leaders and some of its less-advantaged but ambitious youngsters.  </P> <P> Snelling led his audience of 250 in the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance  that opened the third annual Project I Believe benefit dinner, which Luce  chaired.  </P> <P> The heavily underwritten event was expected to add more than $50,000 to the  Project I Believe scholarship fund, a program created in 1987 by former City  Councilman William Jones that guarantees a college or vocational school  education to any of the 68 members of the 1987 graduation class of John F.  Kennedy Elementary School who complete high school and earn the grades  necessary to enter higher education. To date, all but one of the students have  maintained contact with Project I Believe and participate in its required  activities; before the establishment of this special program, it was projected  that 40% of them would not earn a high school diploma.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earning an Education  </P> <P> Jones, who earned a masters degree from the Harvard Graduate School of Business  earlier this year and now is investment manager and assistant to the chairman  of Prudential Realty Group in Newark, N.J., flew in to applaud the youths,  parents, volunteer role models and civic leaders who work together in Project I  Believe.  </P> <P> "I want all the students to feel encouraged that they can succeed, because  they're in those difficult, tender years right now," said Jones. "I remember  how I felt when I was in the ninth grade. If these kids earn the right to go to  USD or UCLA or any other college or vocational school, they will go. None of  them will be denied an education for lack of money."  </P> <P> Fellow board trustees Larry Cushman, Patrick Kruer and Glen Roberts joined  Jones at the dinner. "This is a great program that not only gives these kids a  chance, but lets them be examples to their peers," said Cushman. "Most of us  feel this a real hands-on project."  </P> <P> Several well-behaved, well-scrubbed students attended to give presentations of  their Project I Believe experiences and seemed confident and self-assured, if a  little awed by the surroundings and crowd. As the crowd sat down to dinner,  Luce gestured at a group of students seated quietly nearby and said, "They're  our future, you know, and that's why this program is so important to the  community. I believe in it, and I hear so many good stories about it. Getting  kids to study is the answer to all the problems in this country."  </P> <P> The meal of chicken in raspberry sauce and bananas Foster provided a respite  from a long round of introductions and speeches, but the audience gave its full  attention when students Irma Gomez, Marlon McWilson and Charoun Soukhaseum rose  to describe the lessons learned from Project I Believe.  </P> <P> The guest list included organization board directors Steven Paull, Sister Sally  Furay, Barry Schultz, Mary Powers, Steven Kuhn and William Hill; the Rev.  George Stevens; Norma and Dr. Sam Assam; Dr. Rodney Hood, president of the  National Medical Assn.; Gladys and Tip Calvin; Barbara Hartung; fish taco czar  Ralph Rubio; Councilman-elect John Hartley, and role model Jaime Mercado, a  one-time dropout from Mar Vista High School who now is principal there.  </P> <P> As a child, Angel O'Brien dreamed of becoming the first woman to play  professional baseball.  </P> <P> O'Brien instead grew up to sing rock 'n' roll with the ever-hot Mar Dels, but  she proved that she can still slug a mean ball at "Be a Kid Again," the Sept.  26 benefit given at the Clairemont Mesa Family Fun Center by the Tuesday Club  auxiliary to the Child Abuse Prevention Foundation. CAPF will share the  proceeds of about $10,000 with Oceanside's Casa de Amparo crisis shelter for  abused children.  </P> <P> The point of "Be a Kid Again" was to allow supporters in their mid-30s and  above to make a brief return to childhood, and O'Brien took a break from the  Mar Dels' stage show to slam 60-m.p.h. fastballs at the batting cages. Some of  the male party-goers, who themselves had taken a whirl in the cages, stood by  with jaws agape as O'Brien, dressed in a short black cocktail dress and spike  heels, calmly nailed pitch after pitch.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Childhood Fantasies  </P> <P> Those whose childhood fantasies extended beyond baseball battled in the bumper  boats, toured the three miniature golf courses and dropped tokens in the video  games before heading up to dance to the Mar Dels and feast on burgers, pizza,  popcorn and other youth fare.  </P> <P> "You can be an adult tonight but remember the days when you were growing up,"  said chairman Sharon Wilson. "The best part is that the funds we raise will  allow today's children to enjoy their childhoods now."  </P> <P> The Family Fun Center, which operates until midnight every day of the year,  closed to the public for the first time in its 20-year history to accommodate  the 300 guests. "This is definitely a different evening for us," said amusement  park spokesman Ken Kobane. "Normally, we provide clean-cut fun for kids and  grandparents, but tonight we've got a full house of big kids. It's worth it for  the cause."  </P> <P> The committee included Bonnie Garrett, Suzanne Willert, Drew Robinson, Kyle  Ciani, Tom Goode, Bob Purvin, Barbara Owen, Vicki McNutt, Elaine Goldstein,  Paul D'Heilly, Mark McDonald, Diana Nadel and Joanna Cunningham.  </P></p>

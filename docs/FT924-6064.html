			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / Ernst &amp; Young agrees Dollars 400m suit settlements ERNST &amp; YOUNG, one of the big six international accounting firms, has agreed to pay Dollars 400m (Pounds 265m) to settle an array of lawsuits stemming from its audit work for failed US savings and loan institutions. The money will be paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) and Resolution Trust Corp (RTC), the federal agencies charged with overseeing the multi-billion-dollar thrift industry debacle. The settlement is one of the largest arising from a mass of litigation which followed the collapse of many S&amp;Ls in the 1980s, and by far the biggest involving an accounting firm. Mr Ray Groves, chairman of Ernst &amp; Young, said yesterday that although the agreement was costly it was 'the only realistic solution to an endless stream of lawsuits that would have been even more expensive to defend'. The federal agencies had alleged that Ernst &amp; Young failed to meet required professional standards and had violated federal regulations in its work for a variety of thrifts. Some of the S&amp;Ls audited by the firm and involved in the litigation were among the highest-profile casualties in the sector - including Dallas-based Vernon Savings &amp; Loan, Silverado Banking in Denver, and California's Lincoln. Under yesterday's deal Ernst &amp; Young said the firm itself would pay Dollars 100m, with insurance covering the remainder. The firm will pay the Dollars 100m over four years and expects to fund the sum out of current earnings. In addition to the cash settlement, Ernst &amp; Young has agreed to a 'cease and desist' order by the Office of Thrift Supervision, concerning its future accounting practices. In the order the firm neither admitted nor denied allegations of improper auditing practices. It did, however, agree to additional training for auditors in relevant areas, external third-party review of audit partners' work and various other operational changes. Three individuals - two former partners and one current partner - signed consent orders prohibiting them from working for insured financial institutions, while seven other partners (six current and one former) signed consent cease and desist orders, requiring additional training.</p>

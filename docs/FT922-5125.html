			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Referendum poll switch lifts Copenhagen Holidays in the UK and Europe took some of the initiative out of equity markets last week, but gentle rises in the US and Japan combined to leave the FT-Actuaries World Index up by 0.4 per cent. The best gains came from Denmark in Europe, and Singapore and Hong Kong in the Pacific Basin, all with domestic stimuli but all, too, seeing the effect of foreign buying. Denmark, says Mr Ole Witte of Bikuben, the stockbrokers, moved as polls ahead of today's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European union switched from a 41:39 ratio of 'No' votes at the beginning of the week, through a similar balance in favour in mid-week to a 43:37 'Yes' indication last Saturday. Going into Europe has always been perceived as a very good thing from an economic point of view, says Mr Witte. He adds that it was mainly blue chips, like Sophus Berendsen, Dansico and Novo which led last week's gains. Singapore led the week on suggestions of a 0.25 per cent cut in prime rate, says Mr Mike Franklin of Kim Eng Securities. This did not happen but there was a perception that the economy was improving and that, in any case, the market had lagged too far behind Hong Kong. The rise was not too discriminating. Singapore Airlines climbed on results at the low end of expectations and Keppel, apparently, went ex-rights without seeing the share price adjustment that this would normally bring. 'Allegedly,' says Mr Franklin, 'there were some big program deals going on in the market, set up by big US institutions which could see the US economic recovery coming through to Far East economies.' There were indications, too, of US involvement in Hong Kong, where domestic confidence was lifted by two major deals - Hongkong Land's sale of 9, Ice House Street and Hutchison's privatisation of Cavendish - going through at good prices.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change   % change in              % change in local currency**       sterling**  USDollars**            1 Week   4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of     Start of    Start of                                         1992         1992        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria     +1.07    +1.28   -19.40    +8.90        +5.00       +2.65 Belgium     +0.51    +0.42    +0.18    +5.24        +1.79       -0.49 Denmark     +4.79    +6.54    -1.85    -0.64        -2.88       -5.06 Finland     +0.22    -1.43   -26.09    +7.71        +4.55       +2.19 France      -0.43    +0.54   +12.97   +15.35       +13.35      +10.81 Germany     -0.13    +2.96    +1.61   +12.34        +8.49       +6.04 Ireland     -1.77    -5.59    -3.79    -0.88        -3.42       -5.59 Italy       +0.41    -0.52   -13.92    +1.28        -1.62       -3.83 Netherlands +1.51    +0.62    +8.22   +12.02        +8.30       +5.86 Norway      +0.41    +1.96   -14.86   +10.52        +7.74       +5.31 Spain       +0.67    +5.23    -5.69    +6.71        +5.50       +3.14 Sweden      -0.93    +4.74    -2.10   +14.45       +12.17       +9.66 Switzerland +0.24    +2.70   +12.28   +15.27        +9.62       +7.15 UK          -0.48    +1.86    +9.25    +9.90        +9.90       +7.44 EUROPE      -0.07    +1.85    +5.48   +10.50        +8.66       +6.22 Australia   -0.22    +0.41   +10.16    +1.15        +3.16       +0.84 Hong Kong   +4.32   +11.81   +69.25   +43.75       +47.72      +44.40 Japan       +0.52    +4.32   -28.34   -20.32       -20.25      -22.03 Malaysia    -0.56    -1.51   -12.15    +1.84       +12.94      +10.41 New Zealand +0.71    +6.99    +2.19    +1.17        +2.58       +0.30 Singapore   +5.65    +5.00    +3.87    +4.49        +6.36       +3.98 Canada      +0.57    +0.82    -4.11    -3.13        -4.85       -6.99 USA         +0.37    +0.77    +9.36    -0.24        +2.04       -0.24 Mexico      +1.48    +0.48   +70.48   +20.87       +20.65      +17.94 South Africa+1.34    +8.61   +20.31    +8.83        +2.29       -0.01 WORLD INDEX +0.38    +2.21    -3.62    -3.05        -2.63       -4.81  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on May 29th 1992.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe left Gaborone  this afternoon after a four-day visit to Botswana. He told  journalists before his departure that he believed creating  additional border posts, and involving local leaders and  villages next to the Botswana-Zimbabwe border, could curb the  problem of illegal border crossings. President Mugabe  attributed the problem of illegal border crossings to  unemployment, which he said is everywhere, even in Zimbabwe. He  also admitted that a bureaucracy problem existed at the Zimbabwe  Immigration Department, which he said hindered Batswana  businessmen and women to do business. He promised that  something would be done about it.    Commenting on the former Ethiopian leader's status in  Zimbabwe, Mr. Mugabe said Mr. Mengistu Haile-Mariam sought  refuge in Zimbabwe in accordance with international law. He  said no extradition treaty exists between the two countries and  in any case the treaty usually deals with individuals who commit  crimes of a nonpolitical nature.</p>

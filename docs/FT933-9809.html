			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Thorn EMI and GEC end defence sale talks THORN EMI has failed in its bid to sell its defence electronics business to GEC. The talks between the two companies, which had been progressing for months, broke down earlier this week. No reason was given for the breakdown, but analysts believe price was a serious consideration. Figures of about Pounds 160m were rumoured at an earlier stage. Thorn EMI's shares, which have been weakening since the middle of the weak, dropped a further 10p to 935p yesterday. Thorn's strategy remains to concentrate on its core music and TV rental businesses, and it is anxious to find another buyer. It is one of the world's top three in publishing and recorded music, and Radio Rentals is the world's biggest rental business. Thorn has for some time been seeking a buyer for its defence business, which includes radar and infra-red imaging. It employs about 4,300 people and has a turnover of some Pounds 425m. Since 1990 the company has disposed of numerous non-core businesses. The most recent was light fittings, recently bought by a management buy-out team for Pounds 162m. The controlling stake in Thames TV was also sold this year. The sale would have strengthened GEC's dominant position in defence electronics, and was thought a few weeks ago to be on the verge of completion.</p>

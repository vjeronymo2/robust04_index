			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Grolsch gains 20% to Fl 17m at midway Grolsch, the Dutch brewer, posted a rise of nearly 20 per cent in first-half net profit and said full-year results would increase at roughly the same rate. Net profit rose to Fl 17.0m (Dollars 9.7m) from Fl 14.2m in the first half of 1993, with profit per share up 18.3 per cent at Fl 1.10. Turnover was 33 per cent lower at Fl 391.8m. Grolsch said the figures were not directly comparable because the company sold Wickuler, its German beer group, to Brau und Brunnen of Germany in January. Operating profit rose by 17.3 per cent to Fl 28.8m, while interest charges fell to Fl 0.4m from Fl 3.3m. Sales in the Netherlands, Grolsch's largest market, fell slightly because of poor spring weather. But it said this was more than offset by lower raw material prices and lower operating and packaging costs. In the UK, where Grolsch owns the Ruddles brewery, a new marketing campaign led to higher sales of Ruddles beer, particularly in the second quarter. Grolsch said its personnel costs fell in the first half, reflecting a reorganisation at Ruddles, rationalisation in the Netherlands and the elimination of the group's UK sales office. This year, Grolsch entered into a UK distribution joint venture with Bass, the largest brewer in the UK.</p>

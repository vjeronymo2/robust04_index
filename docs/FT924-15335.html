			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Norman's turn? Will history repeat itself? Three years ago today the government was embroiled in a political row about the ERM. An embattled chancellor of the exchequer (Nigel Lawson) had to raise interest rates by a percentage point, to a record 15 per cent, in a desperate bid to stem a run on the pound. It didn't work and on the eve of the Tory party conference the pound fell by 6 pfennigs. This time round there is an even bigger ERM row, the pound is sinking fast and, like last time, there are increasing calls for the chancellor's resignation. True, interest rates have not been raised (yet). But a fortnight after Nigel Lawson's 1989 speech to the Tory party faithful, he had quit despite an impassioned plea from his deputy, Norman Lamont, who wrote 'please don't do it. It isn't necessary.' Those who believe that history repeats itself will be watching tomorrow's Daily Mail. It filled its front page on the opening day of the 1989 conference with a banner headline calling for Lawson to go.</p>

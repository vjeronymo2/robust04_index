			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): New class of heart drugs for trial Xenova, the low-profile UK biotechnology company quoted in New York, has identified a member of a new class of heart drugs it will now take into human clinical trials, writes Daniel Green. Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is a natural constituent of blood that controls another substance, plasminogen activator (PA), which clears blood clots. A PAI disorder can cut the PA in the body and trigger clots. Xenova acknowledges that the heart drug field is crowded with successful products. But it claims there are potentially dangerous side-effects with other drugs. Xenova Tel: 01753 692229. Fax: 01753 692613.</p>

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Romantic view of cloning Sir, Professor Robert Edwards accepts (Private View, January 29) that molecular biology cannot address problems such as 'brain' and 'intelligence'  -but objects to 'cloning' of existing or dead people. But human clones have always been with us. Identical twins are clones. At the two-cell stage of embryogenesis the embryo splits and the two cells implant individually. Yet no one is suggesting that identical twins are sinful or ethically unsound. So cloning is OK, as long as it is natural. New-age romanticism raises its head again. People love to protect their individuality, but the sad biological truth is that we are to all intents and purposes identical. Even something as odd as a gorilla or chimpanzee is better than 99 per cent identical to us at the molecular level. We are simply tuned to re-cognising very small differences. Presuming we could artificially clone people, a genetically identical group of humans would not be identical people. No more would Einstein's monozygotic brother Ben (had he had one) have simultaneously discovered the theory of relativity with Einstein himself. To pick the classic example, a re-cloned Hitler would not, in the absence of outside influences, be likely to paint houses and hate Jews, Slavs and gypsies. The environment makes the person. The genes simply make the structures which respond to the environment. Simon L. Goodman, E Merck, Postfach 41 19 6100 Darmstadt 1, Germany</p>

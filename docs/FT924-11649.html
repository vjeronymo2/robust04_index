			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Dam row goes to summit Czechoslovakia and Hungary will make a last-ditch effort to resolve their controversy over the Gabcikovo dam on the river Danube at next week's European Community-Central Europe summit meeting in London, Anthony Robinson writes. The Slovak side has started to divert water prior to an agreement, but claims this is necessary to prevent high river levels flooding the dam and ancillary works on which over Dollars 1bn has been spent. The International Court of Justice yesterday said that Hungary had asked it to help resolve the row.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Loss transforms the political landscape: The death of John Smith will make the Labour party's character the focus of attention Suddenly nothing is clear. The tragic death of John Smith has left the Labour party facing a choice which is critical to the outcome of the next general election. Amid the sadness which enveloped Westminster, Mr Smith's colleagues sensed both a risk and an opportunity. The shock waves from Mr Smith's death were not confined to the Labour party. His departure has transformed the political landscape. The genuine sorrow among senior Conservatives was followed quickly by the judgment that Mr John Major's position was much more secure. The focus of much political attention would, during the summer at least, switch to the battle for the Labour leadership. Labour's campaign for the European elections would be badly damaged. Mr Michael Heseltine, the victim last year of a heart attack, was all of a sudden a much less attractive rival to Mr Major. Only hours before his fatal heart attack Mr Smith had been celebrating with his colleagues at a glittering fund-raising dinner in London. Friends said he was in sparkling form. His party was looking forward to following a strong performance in this month's local elections with a decisive victory in the European poll. Consistently 20 points ahead of a government seemingly intent on self-destruction, Labour had begun to persuade itself that after almost 15 years in the wilderness, power was at last within its grasp. Even those among the party's modernisers who were occasionally frustrated by Mr Smith's careful, cautious approach to remaking policies, were impressed by his growing appeal to the electorate. MPs on the unreconstructed left saw him as more radical than he was perceived of in the outside world. They were impressed by his ability to fight them without rancour. In an opinion poll a few weeks back nearly two-thirds of those questioned said he would make a good prime minister. A Tory cabinet minister yesterday offered the same judgment. The minister was not just being polite about the dead. But Mr Smith left unfinished the task of returning the Labour party to electability. Mr Neil Kinnock's legacy after the 1992 general election was a party which had dumped most of the ideological baggage it had carried through the political wilderness, but had yet to rediscover an identity. After the 1992 general election Mr Smith pressed on with reform. Tax and spending pledges were quietly dropped, the leadership confronted the unions over one-member-one-vote (Omov) in the system of elections for Labour parliamentary candidates. Mr Smith sketched out plans for radical constitutional reform. Mr Tony Blair has fundamentally reshaped the party's attitude to crime and punishment. Mr Gordon Brown has begun the slow, painful task of building a credible economic strategy. But the process has been slowing. The disarray in the Conservative party removed the sense of urgency. Mr Smith made the strategic decision to defer detailed policy commitments until the second half of this parliament. His perilously narrow victory over the unions on Omov reminded him that factionalism had not been banished from the Labour party. So until yesterday morning the prevailing mood in the party at Westminster was that it was probably enough to sit tight and wait for the Tories to lose the general election. If that was ever a realistic prospect - and the astute on the party's front benches at Westminster never really believed it - Mr Smith's departure has removed it. Labour now has to make a choice. It is one between advance and retrenchment: between continuing on the path mapped out by Mr Kinnock from socialism to social democracy or deciding to reclaim some of the party's radical roots. The choice will be posed starkly in the forthcoming leadership contest. Mr Smith's colleagues were understandably reluctant yesterday to talk openly about the succession. The formal contest anyway will be deferred until after the European elections next month. But no one doubted who the contenders would be. Mr Blair and Mr Brown represent the modernising tendency. They want to accelerate the process of reform, to recast Labour in the mould of its social democrat counterparts in the rest of Europe. Mr Blair is the favourite among MPs. He is just 41, but has displayed formidable political talents. A public school boy, he has middle-class voter appeal in southern England. MPs on the left of the party are less antagonistic towards him than might be expected. Mr Blair is judged by professionals to be the politician most likely to return the party to power. In the bars and lobbies of Westminster, parallels are already being drawn with the death of the then Labour leader Hugh Gaitskell in 1963. It was the young moderniser Mr Harold Wilson who won the succession and the subsequent general election. However, Mr Brown has worked hard to win friends in the constituencies. He should secure the backing of the powerful Scottish contingent of Labour MPs. He has run a strong campaign against the government's tax increases. He wants to be prime minister. Labour though, remains equivocal about its future. In spite of nearly 15 years out of power, many in the party cannot break with an emotional attachment to the past. No one believes any more in wholesale public ownership. But the virtues of the market have not permeated deep into Labour's consciousness. On the many committees shaping policy for the next general election, the modernisers are frequently confounded by the proponents of a more radical socialism. Mr John Prescott and Mr Robin Cook represent this still powerful strand of opinion. Both have strong followings among party activists and trade unionists. Both have many friends on the left at Westminster. Either could win. But for now the intricacies of the electoral system and the labyrinthine nature of Labour politics make for far more 'ifs' and 'buts' than for certainties. Labour is still an unpredictable party. It will be days if not weeks before the shape of the leadership contest emerges. But the choice will not go away. The party must decide if it wants to govern.</p>

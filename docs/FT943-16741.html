			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Markets: Fidelity moves on charges - At a Glance Fidelity is abolishing withdrawal charges on its unit trust personal equity plans from Monday. It will instead be increasing the initial charge on its Peps from 2 to 3 per cent from August 1. The annual charge will remain that of the underlying fund. Fidleity was the first to introduce a lower initial charge, combined with tapering exit charges in the UK two years ago but it said that investors found the charging structure confusing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Riyadh, 8 May (KUNA) -- Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal,  Saudi foreign affairs minister, stressed that the only way to  confront the dangers posed by the Iraqi regime to the whole  region and to its people lies "in the complete and comprehensive  implementation of the Security Council's resolutions" in  connection with its invasion of the State of Kuwait. [passage  omitted]    Prince Sa'ud was addressing the 5th meeting between the GCC  [Gulf Cooperation Council] foreign affairs ministers and the EU  counterparts, which opened today.    Karlos Papoulias, Greek foreign minister and head of the  European side, also delivered a similar speech in which he dealt  with the peace process in the Middle East, the situation in  former Yugoslavia, and cooperation between the two sides in the  economic sphere.    In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal stressed the GCC  states' eagerness to bolster security and stability in the Gulf  region and guarantee the safety of navigation in their waters.  He expressed hope that political statements by Iranian  officials expressing wishes to develop Iran's relations with the  GCC states, would be accompanied, on the ground, by policies  compatible with those wishes.    Prince Sa'ud said he looked forward to a positive reply from  the republic of Iran [as received] to the initiative made by the  president of the United Arab Emirates in order to solve the  dispute over the three islands [Abu Musa, Greater Tumb, and  Lesser Tumb].    In his address, Prince Sa'ud called upon the Yemeni  leaderships to resort to self-restraint, stop the fighting,  avoid bloodshed and pursue means of dialogue to solve their  bloody conflict.    He also called for the use of the recent Israeli-Palestinian  agreement to achieve a real progress in all other bilateral  talks, particularly the Syrian and the Lebanese tracks.    He added that any fundamental progress in the bilateral  talks  would help achieve tangible progress in the multilateral talks;  this will accordingly help achieve the set goal for the peace  process: a just, comprehensive and permanent peace in the  Middle East.    In his address, Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal dwelt on the  situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and called on the European Union, to which  he attributed a particular responsibility due to its geographic  location, to take necessary measures to guarantee the security  and safety of all other areas following the example of Sarajevo.    Prince Sa'ud called on the United Nations to take all the  measures to prevent rewarding the Serbs for their aggression and  called for the need to lift the arms embargo on the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to allow it to exert it legitimate right to  self-defense.    Regarding economic cooperation between the GCC and the EU,  Prince Sau'd expressed hope that the recommendations submitted  to the meeting by the joint cooperation committee, particularly  the intertwined issues of energy and environment, would help  drawing defined ideas to implement the contents of the joint  report in the form of recommendations in order to achieve the  goals included in the cooperation agreement concluded between  the two sides in 1988.    [Passage omitted] On his part, the Greek foreign affairs  minister, Karlos Papoulias, affirmed the EU's support for the  implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement which was  recently signed in Cairo.    [Passage omitted] Minister Papoulias expressed worry over  the  continuation of the Yugoslav crisis and renewed the community's  commitment to exert more efforts for achieving just and  permanent peace.    On the economic side, the Greek minister welcomed the  agreement reached by the GCC finance ministers on unifying  customs tariff among their countries, a matter which would  facilitate the start of a joint trade agreement between the  European Community and GCC countries.    He said that the recommendations of the team which is made  up  of representatives from the two sides on energy and  environmental issues would help [the two sides] to overstep the  differences in the points of view in these fields.    Papoulias asked the Gulf states for more commitment to  protect the environment as a step towards participating in  achieving an international strategy for this purpose.    Shaykh Fahim al-Qasimi, GCC secretary-general, delivered a  speech in which he reviewed what the GCC has been achieved since  the fourth meeting, pointing out that the Council has continued  its march among the member countries in the political, economic,  military, and security spheres rapidly and continuously.    He pointed out that the private sector's contribution in the  economic sphere of the economies of the GCC countries has  increased, and that the growth of the non-oil production sectors  has continued.    He pointed out that the council has adopted a number of  decisions, among which was the creation of a trade arbitration  center for the Council's countries for settling trade and  investment disputes and facilitating the movement and exchange  of commodities and services.    He added that there were also directives to speed up the  efforts aimed at reaching an agreement on the unified customs  tariff.    In his turn, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Mubarak Al Khalifah,  foreign  affairs minister of the State of Bahrain, emphasized that the  Gulf-European meeting convened in Riyad acquired extreme  importance which reflected the nature of the period in which it  was held and expressed its aims in developing and strengthening  coordination and political and economic cooperation between the  council's countries and the EU.    He said in a speech delivered at the economic discussions of  the fifth joint meeting of the GCC and EU countries that the  consecutive regional and international transformations and  changes the world was witnessing called for the intensification  of the dialogue and the exchange of opinions and expertise in  order to deal with these changes and transformations which  resulted from the ending of the cold war period, the  comprehensive change in the map of international relations and  the establishment of the new world order.    He referred to the negotiation rounds between the GCC and EU  countries and said that despite the correspondences or  differences in the points of view accompanying such rounds on a  number of political and economic issues, the continued objective  dialogue has achieved positive interconnection and widened the  area of agreement for achieving a cooperative and coordinated  platform.    He expressed the hope that this would in the end lead to an  agreement for setting up the free trade zone between the two  groups [GCC and EU] to safeguard their joint interests,  particularly after some GCC countries have signed the GATT  agreement.</p>

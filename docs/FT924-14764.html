			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Book Review: No magic formula JAPAN'S GLOBAL REACH: The Influences, Strategies and Weaknesses of Japan's Multinational Companies By Bill Emmott Century, Pounds 18.99, 244 pages At Nissan's UK plant, carpet pieces are ordered, made, delivered and fitted to Micra cars within just 42 minutes. The average time a European-made part spends in stock is 1.6 days, compared with the industry average of 20 days. These and countless other facts about the Sunderland plant are surprising, like the lists of things the Japanese own - Firestone, the Exxon Building, Bush House, Aquascutum, Columbia Pictures . . . Gosh, how do those Japanese companies do it? There must be something special about them. Well, no. At least not according to Bill Emmott, business affairs editor of The Economist. His book is about the remarkable expansion of Japan's companies into multinationals during the 1980s. His thesis is that the Japanese are simply taking advantage of economic and business phenomena which have been seen before, such as in the expansion of American companies into Europe. Japanese companies have no magic formula. They do not take a uniform approach and make plenty of mistakes. A former Tokyo correspondent and author of a previous book about Japan entitled The Sun Also Sets, Emmott is an authority on the subject. He is good at shattering myths and deflating prejudices. He tells us that Japanese factories abroad use a wide range of suppliers and most of them are not Japanese-owned; that most Japanese expatriates do not send their children to Japanese schools; that Japanese methods can be emulated by non-Japanese companies. Japan has been doing a good job of demystifying itself lately, with its collapsing stock market and stuttering economy. But Emmott's points are all still useful in view of the passions stirred up by Japanese presence overseas. Emmott correctly attributes much criticism, especially on the issue of domestic content of US-made cars, to prejudice which is not directed at foreign investors of other nationalities. He argues that the overseas operations of Japanese companies are more truly Japanese if they do not import parts. Their 'lean production' methods demand a reliable network of suppliers close at hand. Only in this way can they bring productivity towards Japanese levels. If parts are made domestically, it is irrelevant whether the suppliers are Japanese-owned. Emmott is also no doubt correct in saying that 'Japanese 'superiority' is mighty similar to the sorts of superiority identified among American multinationals in the past'. Like American companies investing abroad in the 1950s, Japanese companies, on average, appear to have the best operating methods. But this does not take us very far. This is where this book falls down. It tells us what is not happening, and not new. It is not as illuminating about what is. The book's structure does not help Emmott to develop a picture of Japan's global reach. Four 'case-studies' of Japanese expansion are interspersed in no obvious logical manner with general chapters which analyse the results of an extensive survey, conducted by the author, of Japanese companies with operations in the US, Britain and the continent. Then, Emmott departs from the book's subject and devotes the final chapters to a rambling look at the future of Japan and even the world, without closely relating his prognostications to Japan's multinationals. The full survey, including questions on employment, productivity, local content, management methods and expatriate life, is published in appendices. The results are generally useful if unsurprising. But some respondents' comments provide tantalising glimpses, such as that of an American employee of a software company who says: 'Their business practices are reminiscent of the 17th-century shogunate.' Other controversial Japanese management techniques are not fully addressed. Something unusual is happening when a former Sony employee in Wales writes a letter to the FT on 'shadowing' - the practice of having a Japanese employee looking over the shoulder of local staff - and says: 'If the Japanese are happy to lead a way of life that to us is insane, then good luck to them.' Yet this practice is dismissed by Emmott with 'there is nothing unusual about Sony's shadowing policy . . . nor is there anything especially sinister about it'. Perhaps, but an examination of Japan's global reach needs deeper discussion of companies' practices. Why do companies have 'shadows', and what do they do? Given his attention to particular examples, Emmott should explore such questions in detail. Though the book contains much interesting material, the case-studies - of car makers, Bridgestone's purchase of Firestone, the forays into Hollywood, and London's financial markets - do not get under the skin of Japan's adventurers abroad. This is perhaps because the author has already decided that there is nothing much new about the phenomenon of Japanese investment overseas - and because of his declared intent to remain 'agnostic'.</p>

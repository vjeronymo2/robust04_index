			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Military shipments from Gulf will be audited - Defence THE Ministry of Defence is organising a 'major audit effort' to prevent fraud in the shipping of military equipment back from the Gulf, the Commons Public Accounts Committee was told yesterday. Sir Michael Quinlan, permanent under-secretary at the Ministry, said the aim was to ensure it was returned 'in a properly accounted manner'. His assurance followed a five-fold rise to Pounds 1.2m. in the amount involved in alleged fraud at defence establishments in the last financial year, compared with a total of just over Pounds 2m in the previous six years. He admitted he was surprised at the low proportion of people who were dismissed or resigned as a result.</p>

			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Observer: Obverse side Premier Major's new found concern that honours should go only to those who patently deserve them is shared by many South Americans. Having noted Argentinian president Carlos Menem's decoration of Chile's Augusto Pinochet, they are puzzled by what the Chilean general has done to merit the award. After all, Pinochet is most memorably linked with Argentina as Chile's president when the two countries almost went to war over territorial disputes in the 1970s. Moreover, he has scarcely earned democrats' plaudits in later years. Before stepping down as dictator, he ensured he would stay probably the only head of a country's armed forces who is not even nominally under presidential control. As such, he has been a constant thorn in the flesh of his democratically elected successor Patricio Aylwin. But that perhaps solves the puzzle, for when Chile's present president handed a gong to the former Argentinian president Raul Alfonsin, the recipient's main political enemy Carlos Menem was sore miffed. So the latest award may be less to honour Pinochet than to spite Aylwin.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Arts: All change at work - Radio RADIO 4's concern with personal distress moves into industry. All with Smiling Faces, 'ganging along the Scotswood Road to see the Blaydon Races,' recalled when Vickers Armstrong employed 20,000 men and there were 54 pubs in four miles - in 1862. Wendy Pilmer's moving feature presented people who had known a happy Scotswood but felt 'the heart had gone out.' Riots, theft, joy-riding were the news. 'You get accustomed to things, you have to live with it.' But building has begun. The Newcastle Business Park may employ 5000, but in desk jobs, not engineering. The future Scotswood will be office blocks and housing estates. No one will sing about that on the halls. Come the Revolution on Wednesdays concerns change in workday life. Last week its presenter Neil Walker dealt with the dockers of Hull, their pay ensured, even without work, by Attlee's Dock Labour Board scheme. Not now. The scheme was repealed in 1989. This week Walker met the railwaymen. Like the dockers, they reckoned theirs was the only trade, for themselves and their sons. Nationalisation in 1948 meant that blaming the railways for anything was now blaming themselves. Sir Brian Robertson could be lived with; even the change from steam to diesel, though this meant redundancies. But Dr Beeching, who preached 'make it pay or cut it out', was too much. He closed 5000 miles of track, nearly 2000 stations, and it was little help to the man on the footplate when the General Secretary of ASLEF wrote to the Press in his support. The oldfashioned loyalty to the railways, that began at school, was no more. In Striking Out on Thursday we joined the miners in the 1984 strike, or rather their wives. They learned for the first time that they were not just 'somebody's something' but independent folk. They made speeches, they organised committees - one, who had never before been further from her Sheffield home than Barnsley, went to Belgium to talk to the women there. A wave of feminism engulfed them. Their men had to look after themselves; and when the strike was done, they had learned to be properly cooperative. Presenter Chrys Salt got women from Yorkshire, Kent and Wales talking cheerfully, even singing what I take to be their own songs, about their awakening. They were pleasant company, but there was a down-side - 'Before the strike,' one said, 'I did not know what I'd missed, so I was happy.' Industry has a bright side too, and on Sunday we learnt who had won the Radio Times/Radio 4 Enterprise '92 Awards. The Pounds 10,000 Category 1 prize went to Tina Magdalinsky for her Pretzel's Continental Bakery in Cambridge; the Pounds 5000 Category 2 award to David Whyatt, who now heads his Glossopdale Bus Company in Cheshire. Both winners praised their bank managers. Classic drama this week from both Radios 3 and 4, that I have left too little space for. On Sunday, Radio 3's fine production of Webster's The Duchess of Malfi had been recorded by director Alison Hindell in Llancaiach Fawr Manor, and it gave a three-dimensional quality. The Duchess was beautifully played by Fiona Shaw, and there was a telling Bosola by Roger Allam. The performance was worth every second of its 140 minutes. Monday evening brought Of Mice and Men, by John Steinbeck. The grim friendship of simple Lennie and watchful George in the Californian farmlands was persuasively traced by Kerry Shale and Peter Whitman under Richard Wortley's direction. On Saturday evenings, the eponymous classic is Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, but this goes on for three weeks more.</p>

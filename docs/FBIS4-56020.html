			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Mariya Tsenkova from the National </F> Assembly]    [Text] The situation here continues to unfold. Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov met in the parliament with Zhan Videnov,  leader of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP], and Ahmed Dogan,  leader of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms [DPS]. After the  meeting Dogan said that the DPS will support the framework  agreement proposed by the government, if it is supported by at  least four parliamentary factions. Dogan did not specify what  factions precisely should support the agreement, but he does not  exclude a situation in which the cabinet will have to resign.    According to Zhan Videnov, procedural issues were discussed  at the meeting with Prime Minister Berov on consultations  between the prime minister and the parliamentary factions.    Nora Ananieva said that real consultations are yet to be  held, and it appears that precisely this is taking place at  present at the National Assembly's West Hall, where the prime  minister is meeting with BSP representatives and two  representatives of the New Alliance for Democracy [NSD]. Mr.  Oktay of the DPS entered the hall, saw what is happening there,  left the hall, and refused to make any statements.    Dr. Yordan Todorov of the NSD said that he is attending the  meeting as a representative of his faction, but the NSD will  nevertheless insist on holding separate talks with the prime  minister.    Deputy Ivan Pushkarov has not been offered the post of  deputy  prime minister. If signing an agreement is on the agenda,  Pushkarov's people will not sign. It is not the business of the  prime minister to make such moves, Pushkarov said. Several  seconds ago Yunal Lyutfi of the DPS joined the meeting that is  taking place at the National Assembly's West Hall.</p>

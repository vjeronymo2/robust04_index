			<p>BFN     [Text] Our guest on Afrique Soir is Ag-Athom Ag Alhassane,  one of the leaders of the Mali Tuareg movements. Recently there  have been more clashes. Many civilians have been killed. Does  this situation call the national peace pact into question? This  is what Muriel Pomponne asked Ag-Athom Ag Alhassane.    [Begin recording] [Alhassane] This does not call the  national  pact into question, but it has to be recognized that the  national pact has run into some difficulties since it was  signed. These are inherent in the behavior of certain persons  who can be found on each side, and who want to sabotage it.    [Pomponne] Can you, as a movement, affirm that you are not  calling the national pact in question?    [Alhassane] As a movement we are indeed reaffirming our  commitment to the national pact, and to its implementation. The  Algiers meeting the other day is for us the consecration and the  conclusion of important arrangements in the national pact.    Among the decisions taken, the most important is the  integration of our fighters, and the dismantling of the bases,  because once this second integration is implemented, the  movement's bases will be dismantled and we will move toward the  dissolution of the movements.    [Pomponne] There are no differences of opinion between you  and the Malian government?    [Alhassane] At the moment there are no differences between  us  and the Malian government.    [Pomponne] There is talk at the moment of armed militia  among  the sedentary population. How do you explain the hostility of  this population?    [Alhassane] Well, we don't know how to explain this  hostility. These are militia who were in fact already organized  in the form of self-defense brigades, and in some villages we  had already seen people (?being killed) last year, and we had  always closed our eyes to that. This has gone on until now, and  it is going on, and we are trying as hard as we can to restrain  ourselves and not to respond, because we think it is sort of  provocation, and we know that it is not in fact the people who  actually belong to the sedentary population who are behind this  sort of action.    [Pomponne] Are you expecting the government to take any  measures to put an end to this violence?    [Alhassane] Yes, we think the government is responsible for  providing security for everyone, both the white population and  the black population, and that is why the movement is going to  try as hard as possible not to start fighting these militia,  since we know, we think this is the state's business, and we are  leaving the state the time to take the necessary measures.    [Pomponne] But you, the movements, are often accused of  being  the cause of the insecurity. How do you respond to these  accusations?    [Alhassane] We cannot say that the movements do not bear a  share of the responsibility for this insecurity. But what has  to be recognized, and what people don't understand, is that  there is the movement, and then there are other groups that are  hard to keep under control, and who carry out this sort of deed.  It is very difficult to see the officials of the movement, or  the movement as such, carrying out this sort of deed. People  must understand that when you have a rebel movement, or a  problem that has gone on for some time, there are always  remnants and you need time to bring them under control. That is  what we are asking people to understand, and everyone must  (?make an effort) to understand this. [end recording]</p>

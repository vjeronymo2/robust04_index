			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt 'We must be very careful that economic recovery does not bring the fall in inflation to a standstill or steer it in the opposite direction,' Mr Helmut Schreiber, a Bundesbank director said on Friday. While his statement had no discernible effect on German bond markets, snoozing in the summer lull, it could be read as an indication that the Bundesbank feels some interest rate forecasters are taking too much for granted. While most are still confident that west German inflation will fall from the July rate of 2.9 per cent to around 2.5 per cent at the turn of the year, there are growing doubts about how much further it will decline before edging upwards - dragging rates along with it. Raw material prices have climbed relatively steeply since the end of the first quarter, and improved exports and stabilising domestic demand may tempt some to raise product prices, Berliner Bank noted at the weekend. Industrial output and order figures, due this week with unemployment numbers, will give some indications of how the recovery is moving. But the key number for the markets is July's money supply, not due for three weeks. Until then sentiment is likely to continue to be dominated by external factors, notably US rate expectations, and the nervousness recently afflicting markets in the UK and Italy.</p>

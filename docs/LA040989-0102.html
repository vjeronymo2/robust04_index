			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BISONS BULLISH THEY'LL DRAW MILLION FANS AGAIN  </P> <P> The Buffalo Bisons are trying to become the first minor-league team to draw at  least a million fans in back-to-back seasons. But owner Bob Rich Jr., said  they're not getting any help from the schedule-makers or the weatherman.  </P> <P> "We have 16 (home) games in April. That's going to put us a little bit more  behind the eight-ball," Rich said prior to Wednesday's season-opener. "I think  we'll have a better shot after we get through April of knowing if the million  is do-able."  </P> <P> The Bisons' American Association opener against the Louisville Redbirds  illustrated Rich's concerns.  </P> <P> Snow over the weekend turned to rain earlier in the week. But temperatures  remained around 40 degrees and, combined with a healthy breeze, helped make for  a number of no-shows at 19,500-seat Pilot Field.  </P> <P> "If we have inclement weather throughout April and it shuts down a bunch of  games, it's really going to be tough because last year, we were 85% occupancy,"  said Rich.  </P> <P> Still, 18,614 seats were sold for the opener and a season-ticket base of 9,000  assures the team will sell at least 640,000 tickets this year.  </P> <P> Last year, the Bisons set a single-season minor-league attendance record with  ticket sales of 1,186,561.  </P> <P> Aggressive promotions and the novelty of a beautiful new downtown stadium  helped bring the fans in. But that loyalty didn't translate into on-field  success.  </P> <P> The Bisons, the Pittsburgh Pirates' top farm team, finished two games above  .500, but were third in the four-team American Association East, 17 games  behind division-winning Indianapolis.  </P> <P> Rich was clearly disappointed with the team's performance and vowed, along with  the Pirates, to have a more respectable club this season.  </P> <P> "The Pirates have really worked hard," Rich said. "They have a new organization  evaluating new talent and they've worked hard to get us a winner."  </P> <P> But Rich's first move was to lure Albuquerque Dukes manager Terry Collins out  of the Los Angeles Dodgers' system to replace Rocky Bridges, a career  minor-league manager whose low-key approach to winning angered Bison fans and  Rich.  </P> <P> Collins, 39, was Manager of the Year in each of the past two seasons in the  Pacific Coast League and led the Dukes to the PCL title in 1987.  </P> <P> "The most significant improvement over last year is the addition of Terry  Collins," Rich said. "He's our kind of guy. The people here want to see  athletes in all sports hustling and giving it their all."  </P> <P> Collins admitted he took a career gamble in leaving the Dodgers organization,  where he had been for 15 years.  </P> <P> "To come over here is a challenge, and that's what I'm accepting it as; a  challenge to go out and accomplish here what we accomplished the last couple of  years in Albuquerque," Collins said.  </P> <P> Rich made it clear to the Pirates he wanted some veterans to supplement  Pittsburgh's prospects.  </P> <P> So the Pirates went out and signed several players with major league  experience, including 34-year-old Tito Landrum, 36-year-old Steve Henderson,  33-year-old Jim Pankovits, 31-year-old Bill Scherrer and 38-year-old Rennie  Stennett, who hadn't played baseball in five years.  </P> <P> Landrum, Scherrer and Stennett didn't make it past spring training, but  Pankovits will be Buffalo's second baseman this season and Henderson will play  behind -- and tutor -- Pirates outfield prospect Steve Carter.  </P> <P> "Here's a guy who's got 10 years in the big leagues, he's got nothing else to  prove, and yet if you watch him play every day, he plays like he's 23," Collins  said of Henderson. "He's going to be a big asset to us all year."  </P> <P> The conflict between the desire to win and the essentially developmental nature  of minor league ball has soured many a relationship between a parent team and  its farm club.  </P> <P> But Collins said those two goals aren't necessarily incompatible.  </P> <P> "One of the things Pittsburgh -- and all of baseball -- is looking for is a  winning player, a player who knows what it takes to win," Collins said.  </P> <P> A competitive team will help the Bisons as they shoot for another million fans  at Pilot Field this season, which will in turn help Rich's goal of a major  league team in Buffalo.  </P> <P> "I don't think you're going to see teams move out of existing cities,  especially with the anticipation of expansion, which is so much more prevalent  this year," said Rich, noting new baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti  has listed adding two National League teams as one of his priorities.  </P></p>

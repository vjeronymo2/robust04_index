			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Sharp increase likely in US bank insurance US BANKERS are bracing themselves for a sharp increase, next January 1, in the premiums they must pay to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC, the government agency that guarantees depositors if their bank fails, had its reserves wiped out by a wave of bank failures in the 1980s. It has proposed a new premium formula that would make weakly capitalised banks pay substantially higher rates than those with solid capital bases. Even the strongest banks, however, would have to pay higher premiums than they do now. But bankers complain that the stiffer premiums will force more weak banks out of business and compel even the stronger banks to be more conservative in their lending - just as the US government is urging them to ease a possible 'credit crunch' by lending more, especially in risky inner-city areas. 'This is mandating a conservative mentality for the rest of this decade,' said Mr Kenneth Guenther, executive vice-president of the Independent Bankers' Association of America. The proposed changes to the FDIC premium structure are available for public comment, but opponents of the increase do not expect to be able to influence more than details of the new premiums. The FDIC proposal would increase the level of premiums from 23 cents per Dollars 100 of deposits to an average of 28 cents, and could levy an additional Dollars 1.5bn a year of premiums. Well-capitalised banks would pay 25 cents; the weakest a 31 cents premium. Advocates of the premium increase believe it is needed to replenish the Bank Insurance Fund (BIF), which the FDIC manages. The administration reckons the fund will have a deficit of Dollars 2bn this year, climbing to a peak of Dollars 39bn in 1996. However, others argue that these projections greatly exaggerate the BIF's likely deficit. Also, higher premiums could slow economic growth and so have a negative impact on the fund.</p>

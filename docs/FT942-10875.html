			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Japanese minister quits over atrocity claim Japan's controversial justice minister, Mr Shigeto Nagano, resigned over the weekend, just 10 days after taking office, after denying that an infamous wartime atrocity happened. He was replaced by Mr Hiroshi Nakai, a centre-right member of the lower house, who immediately tried to calm the row by saying that it was 'undeniable' that the Japanese army 'committed cruel acts' in the war. Mr Nagano had earlier retracted his remarks, in which he said that Japan's invasions of China - now its second largest trade partner - and other Asian neighbours were not acts of aggression. However, the retraction only partly appeased the anger of South Korea and was dismissed as inadequate by Japan's opposition parties, which plan to exploit the blunder to the full. Mr Nagano offered his resignation after meeting the prime minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata, on Saturday. Mr Nakai is a member of the Democratic Socialist party, a minor partner in the five-party government coalition. Mr Hata chose him to avert opposition criticism that the alliance was dominated by the right-wing Japan Renewal party, which now has seven out of 21 cabinet seats. Mr Hata heads the JRP and Mr Nagano is a member. South Korea welcomed Mr Hata's decision. 'It is difficult for both the victim and the perpetrator to overcome the past,' said a South Korean foreign ministry official. Mr Hata's decision showed courage, he said. However, Mr Hata's domestic opponents plan to pursue him after he faces parliament to make his first policy speech tomorrow, when his comments on Japan's wartime responsibility will be closely followed. Mr Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic party, the biggest opposition group, said Mr Hata bore 'great responsibility' for having appointed Mr Nagano. The affair had jeopardised the efforts made by former LDP governments to improve ties with Asian neighbours, said Mr Yoshiro Mori, its secretary general.</p>

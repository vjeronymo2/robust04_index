			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices hit by renewed selling A LONDON stock market looking increasingly unhappy with the peak levels achieved at the end of last month continued to focus on its own worries yesterday, paying no heed to firmness on other European bourses or to the signing in Washington of the Middle East peace settlement. UK equities appeared nervous regarding prospects for Friday's expiry in the stock index sector. An attempt to respond positively to Wall Street's sharp rise on Friday night was tripped up by a heavy trading programme in equities - reportedly worth around Pounds 600m - which was believed to be the first of a likely series of manoeuverings by securities firms ahead of Friday's expiry of the September dated futures contract on the FT-SE Index. The UK equity market rose by nearly 8 per cent over the three month period of the September contract to reach its trading peak of 3.115, with the leading trading firms often arbitraging between futures and underlying equities. Shares have now fallen by about 3 per cent from that peak, leaving some large trading positions open ahead of Friday's expiry. The futures expiry has in the past produced erratic price movements. Early optimism in equities was also undermined by renewed falls in the pharmaceutical stocks following reports that drafts of President Clinton's healthcare reform plans imply a halving of projected growth in US medical spending in this decade. Heavy falls in Glaxo and the other drug industry stocks were quickly joined by wider ranging losses as the two way trading programme got under way. It was believed that the programme originated with SG Warburg, the London-based investment house which is known to be cautious on the market outlook, with a year-end Footsie prediction still held at 2,900 despite the market's advance over the past month. At worst, the FT-SE Index dipped by 19.3 to 3,017.7 yesterday but a rally then set in, encouraged when Wall Street came in on the bull tack again, adding 12.58 Dow points in UK hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 3,024.8 for a net loss on the day of 12.2 points. Traders said that the late rally reflected technical buying from professional dealers seeking stock to meet earlier selling commitments, rather than any significant buying pressure. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, down 4.8 at 3,471.5, followed the direction of the blue chips. The stock market made no response to statistics on domestic producer prices, showing little change, but was poised for futher important economic data this week; tomorrow will bring the August Retail Price Index, and Thursday the latest wages and unemployment figures. The corporate results flow was also slower yesterday, although Inchcape fell sharply after an interim statement which revived stock market concern over the trend of the company reporting season now unrolling. Retail, or genuine customer business in UK equities, which has remained high as the market has turned back from its peak, totalled Pounds 1.37bn on Friday. Seaq-reported volume fell from 596m shares on Friday to 585.3m shares yesterday, with non-Footsie business increasing its contibution to about 67 per cent of the total.</p>

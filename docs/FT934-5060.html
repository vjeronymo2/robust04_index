			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: An early Christmas - The bond markets' wishes have been granted It was all the bond markets could really have wanted. By risking damage to future economic growth and, it has to be said, by stretching credulity a long way with his public spending projections, Kenneth Clarke has opened up a route to low interest rates and, eventually, a balanced budget - should he or a successor ever really want to go that far. It was a challenge that Norman Lamont failed adequately to square up to last spring. His borrow-now-tax-later formula left the markets cold, and both gilts and equities struggled for several months. Now Kenneth Clarke looks like the kind of tough customer that the markets respond to. But there will be casualties, notably in the banks and building societies as they prepare for the decline of their deposit base. They may feel they could have done without the gratuitous sideswipe of a pensioners' bond featuring the 'decent, fixed rate of return' that the old folk presumably will no longer get from the Halifax or the Bradford &amp; Bingley. Will Clarke escape the building society wrath that descended upon Lamont when he introduced First Option Bonds at an aggressive interest rate? As for rates in the government bond market, long-dated gilt-edged yields had already slipped below 7 per cent last Monday, for the first time in 25 years. Although corresponding US Treasury bond rates have backed up by half a percentage point since mid-October, sterling bonds have proved resistant to the international reversal. At the 10-year maturity the spread between US and UK government bond yields has shrunk from 2 percentage points in May to less than half that now. The Budget's arithmetic offers some good reasons why this should be so. Although the current financial year's borrowing requirement has not been reduced as many expected, some Pounds 6bn is knocked off the forecast for 1994-95. The cut in what used to be called the contingency reserve may need more leisurely scrutiny, but lower interest rates will bring their own reward: debt interest will hardly be rising in total, even though the aggregate of government indebtedness will still be rising quite fast over the next two or three years. Moreover Clarke has decided to listen to the pleadings of some of his independent advisers, notably Tim Congdon, and underfund by Pounds 7bn over the next year and a half, to offset past purchases by the banking sector. That means, perhaps, a Pounds 10bn reduction in the issuance next financial year compared with earlier projections. It is strange to recall that back in March Lamont seemed to be facing a big challenge in financing his deficit. In the event it has proved childishly simple against the background of tumbling bond rates worldwide. But that was unpredictable good fortune. Clarke has rightly decided that he cannot risk the global bond market turning nasty, as indeed it may have begun to do. In the first six months of 1993-94 foreigners bought Pounds 8.3bn net of gilts, an unprecedented rate of take-up. In a global marketplace this may be neither here nor there: gilts have only a 5 per cent weighting in global government bond portfolios, and this could easily go higher. But it would mean accepting the interest rates set by the Americans and Germans, plus a premium. Now the prospective easing of the pace of issues will mean that gilt issuance will fall back within the reasonably comfortable digestive capacity of domestic investors. Beyond next year, of course, government borrowing is now scheduled for further sharp drops, but only time will tell what will actually happen in the run-up to the next general election, possibly in late 1996. What about the London equity market? It has been led up by gilts all year and no doubt it will continue to be so. The Budget is not quite so unequivocally favourable, however, because the future rises in the personal tax burden over the next three years look quite steep. Positively, though, the tax threat to pension funds has proved a false alarm. Falling interest rates, short and long, almost always send share prices higher. Unfortunately Tokyo is proving how that rule can be broken - but the circumstances are, of course, very different. Economic prospects in the UK are certainly brighter than they are in Japan. True, next year's projected economic growth rate has been slightly trimmed back (albeit from a higher base in 1993) and the previously programmed export boom scaled down in the face of recession in continental Europe. Astonishing statistical revisions to the balance of payments numbers have eased one threat, again at the risk of disbelief. But some outside forecasters are less optimistic that the UK can go it alone in growth terms in Europe quite as the Treasury is suggesting. What we do not yet know is whether the government will push interest rates more aggressively lower and aim for a weaker sterling exchange rate that would push up the growth rate and bolster company profits. An inflation forecast hovering just above 3 per cent in late 1994 suggests there will be official caution because of the risk of importing inflation through devaluation. Even so, a fall in short-term interest rates to 5 and then maybe 4 per cent is plainly in prospect next year, and the trend presents a serious strategic challenge to the building societies and banks that hold some Pounds 250bn of personal sector interest-bearing deposits. They should start planning on the basis of a yield curve running from 4 up to 6 per cent. In this event many building societies may not be able to survive by collecting short-term retail deposits, and forced to seek a way out by turning themselves into mortgage banks funded mainly through the capital market. Savings would then be collected on a much larger scale by unit trust companies and channelled into bond issues as well as equity funds. Such are the structural questions that must be faced up to when a chancellor opens the way to financial conditions not experienced for a generation. Whatever the head-scratching in Halifax, for the bond market Christmas has come early. If you believe in fairies, and in Kenneth Clarke's public spending estimates, you really can fly, but with luck not to Never-Never Land.</p>

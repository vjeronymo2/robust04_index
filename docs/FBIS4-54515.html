			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Aleksa Crnjakovic: "Will `Turncoats' Cause a </F> Crisis?"]    [Text] Although there are no big surprises regarding  members of the future party, the making of the list of HDZ  "turncoats" is the first-class political event for Croatian  Independent Democrats [HND], for the members of the constituent  circle of the future party is made up of as much as 16 deputies  from the ruling party. Therefore, the most important question  is will those turncoats, fronted by two presidents, of both the  Chamber of Counties and Chamber of Representatives, cause a  parliamentary crisis. There will be more and more people in  suspense over the matter, for it is now President Franjo  Tudjman's turn to make a move. Everybody is waiting to see what  move he will make to prevent a major split in the party, but  also major stirring in the Assembly. What steps will he take  against those who "broke loose"? Is it more harmful for  Croatian interests to eliminate two leading men from the  Assembly than let them be and devote oneself to "being a mole"?  <H5>  Do Moles Remain? </H5>   Although politicians have lately been very much involved in  some vague procedural regulations of some laws, with regard to a  possible parliamentary crisis, the procedure is clear. First of  all, a deputy can change parties and remain a deputy, for that  right is granted by the Constitution. Deputies in the Assembly  have no binding mandate, they cannot be revoked because of their  political views or because they decided to accept another  party's program and leave the party that brought them into the  Assembly. Judging by the list of the Constituent Circle of  Croatian Independent Democrats, with regard to the Chamber of  Representatives, 13 HDZ members and one member of the Croatian  Party of Rights will join the new party. In the Chamber of  Counties, three HDZ members will join the new party. At  present, the HDZ has 83 mandates in the Chamber of  Representatives, without Father Tomislav Duka, who asked to  leave the party, and without deputy attorney general (Lovric of  Osijek is the president of the Trade Court, and that function is  incompatible with the function as a deputy, but he cannot be  released from his function as a deputy, for the State Tribunal  has not been formed yet).  <H5>  The "Duka" Case </H5>   So, playing with numbers a little, we see that everything is  possible, and that the outcome of the ballot is uncertain,  although that does not necessarily mean that a parliamentary  crisis is in the offing. It could just happen that, from now  on, there will be more cases like the one at the last session  when they could not make the decision to acquit Father Tomislav  Duka of his membership in the Committee for Electing,  Appointing, and Administrative Jobs.    Let me remind you: On that occasion, out of 79 deputies who  voted, only 45 were in favor of putting the subject back on the  agenda of the committee, five deputies abstained from voting,  and only 29 voted to acquit Father Duka of his position as a  member of the committee. As far as we can remember, this is one  of those very rare occasions when the HDZ majority did not vote  "by command."    There could be more such cases, even when voting for a  single  law, which means that the arguments of the opposition could also  be the arguments of some members of the ruling party, now more  than ever. A fierce battle is imminent, this time on the basis  of quality, not quantity.    We should not take lightly the disorder created in the  Committee for Electing, Appointing, and Administrative Jobs.  Formerly a member of that committee, Father Duka has now joined  future Croatian Independent Democrats, and HDZ deputies Ante  Karic and Davorin Popovic are also on the list of the  Constituent Circle for the establishment of the HND.  Consequently, for the first time since deputies were elected,  the committee was left without the HDZ majority. For, the  committee has 11 members, seven of which were members of the  HDZ, while now there are only four of them, which means that the  HDZ can practically make no decisions! That is not  insignificant considering the fact that this Committee proposes  all dismissals and appointments, even that of the president of  the Assembly.   <H5>    Possibility of Secret Ballot </H5>   And now we come to the most interesting question: Will the  president of the country and the president of the ruling party  dismiss Mesic and Manolic from their presidential functions and  can he do that at all? The demand to replace the president of  the Chamber can be made by 30 deputies, and it could also be  done by the Committee for Electing, Appointing, and  Administrative Jobs. Even if 30 deputies demanded the  dismissal, the demand would have to be considered by the  committee. The committee cannot stop the procedure of  dismissing and appointing, for even in case of negative decision  by the committee, there would have to be a ballot in the chamber.    Certainly, neither Manolic nor Mesic will resign from their  presidential functions. Therefore, if it should so be decided,  with regard to Mesic, the matter would be decided by a ballot in  the Chamber of Representatives. The matter of acquittal will be  put to the vote as it is usually done with regard to  appointments. However, there might be a secret ballot in case  there are two or more candidates. At the proposal of 10  deputies, the Chamber can decide to put the matter to the vote  if there is more than one candidate. If that should happen, we  suppose that the "logistics" of the new party would be in favor  of a secret ballot.    It is quite probable that both Mesic and Manolic would run  again, and the Standing Orders specify they can do that if Mesic  gets 30 and Manolic 20 signatures. In the present ratio of  powers, that would not be difficult. The HDZ would put up their  own candidate. In that case, it would be almost impossible to  predict who could be a candidate for the president of the  Chamber of Representatives. Perhaps again Zarko Domljan, the  first president of the Assembly, presently vice president of the  Chamber of Representatives? Or Katarina Fucek, perhaps?  Considering the fact that Katica Ivanisevic would run for  president of the Chamber of Counties, this would make a very  interesting female cast! Who will win? The candidate who will  get the majority vote, provided that most deputies are present,  i.e., at least 70, in which case 36 votes will give him or her  victory. If the session will be attended by all deputies, then  it would take 70 votes to win. All deputies of all parties will,  obviously, not miss such an occasion and, in that case, the  ruling party would, of course, have to put up a candidate whom  the opposition would find acceptable as well.  <H5>  Conflicts in Working Bodies </H5>   Still, the prevailing opinion is that the ruling party would  get more if it left things the way they are than if it dismissed  the presidents of both chambers. Clearly, the ruling party has  an indisputable right to elect the president, i.e., presidents  of both chambers, since it won the elections. However, it is  very risky to eliminate both officials at once. It is debatable  whether the two men would be more harmful as presidents or as  two former key figures.    Anyhow, we think there will not be a real parliamentary  crisis, but there will definitely be some changes in the  Assembly. There will first be some conflicts in working bodies.  It is very much possible that the HDZ will no longer have a  majority in many of them. Committee members were elected  observing the election results of certain parties and the HDZ  has hitherto had about 65 percent of the mandate in every  working body. Considering that the new party will soon be  formed, this percentage would be lower, at the expense of the  HDZ. For the first time, the HDZ will be forced to look for  partners and form a coalition on certain issues. Where will it  find them? There could be some absurd situations, indeed:  Should it look for them in Djukic's Serbian National Party or in  Djapic's HSP? And the wheel seems to be turning backward. Let  us remember a discussion held last year on 15 October, during a  three-day session of the Assembly, about taking the mandate of  some HSP members. Djuro Perica was then the only HDZ member who  defended the HSP members, and Minister Tarnaj, who was then a  deputy, voted against taking away their immunity.    Will we witness another procedural competition, this time in  the Chamber of Representatives? Can the procedure block the  Assembly? At present, it seems that is all up to Mesic and  Manolic and their will to convene sessions of those chambers.   <H5>    While in the Standing Orders </H5>   According to the Standing Orders, the presidents of the  chambers convene sessions two times a month, as a rule. The rule  has not been obeyed yet, which is evident from the number of  sessions that were held: 17 sessions in the past 18 months.  What happens if presidents do not convene sessions at regular  intervals? Our Standing Orders do not contain such regulations  as are included, for example, in the Standing Orders of the  Austrian parliament, i.e., that it is possible to convene  parliament within five days of filing a demand at the request of  at least one-fifth of the deputies.    This regulation was deliberately excluded from our Standing  Orders, for the opposition would have the one-fifth in both  chambers without problems; in the Chamber of Counties the  liberals alone make up the one-fifth, which means that the  opposition could keep convening sessions, and some were  obviously trying to avoid that. No one can convene a session but  them and they practically have the possibility to block the work  of the Assembly. However, supposing they do not opt for that,  at least not for a very long time, if for no other reason than  that they would not be true to the name of the party they are  forming, i.e., that they are democrats and that they respect the  procedure.    They will probably be convening sessions and work in favor  of  their party, asking the opposition to help. Perhaps they will  refer to the changed ratio of powers, which gives them the right  to keep their leading positions in the Assembly, which would not  mean much in the division of power since the Government is made  up of members of just one party.  <H5>  Without "Fighting to the End" </H5>   We can only hope that both turncoats and those who remain  true to the ruling party are equally set to work for the  prosperity of Croatia, and that they will not, in their  political struggle, "fight to the end," but that they will try  to act as true members of the Assembly, advocating the rule of  the law and parliamentary ways of fighting. In the leadership of  the Assembly, the ratio of powers is now 2:2, if we consider  presidents and vice presidents. Let us hope the change in the  ratio of powers will not influence the internal political  stability of Croatia.    That is not in the interest of international factors either,  which Mate Granic made clear both at the meeting of the HDZ Club  and at the session of the VONS [Council for Defense and National  Security]. If it should, however, come to serious disturbance in  balance, both sides are to blame, both those who stayed and the  runaways. That will be an opportunity for the opposition,  although it is questionable whether they will know how to make  use of it. Here is a good side of this imbalance: There have  been problems with a quorum for a while. But now it seems  everybody will come to help "their side." If they do not get  out of control, these could be very interesting sessions,  although we can still not expect to have the British unwritten  rule according to which some Labor Party members leave the  session if too many members of the Conservative Party show up  that day, thus disturbing the standard electoral ratio of powers.</p>

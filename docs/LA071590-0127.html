			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> THE ARTS;  </P> <P> OLE! MEXICAN AD ART REVIVAL  </P> <P> THE MEXICAN Revolution of 1910 drastically altered Mexico's artistic climate,  freeing native artists from the prevailing French and Spanish standards of the  time. Later, in the 1930s, with the importation of modern offset presses to  print large color images, many painters discovered they could earn a living as  commercial artists in the growing advertising business.  </P> <P> The sophistication of Mexican advertising art (used most often in the 1930s to  publicize cigarettes and beer) is showcased (through Sept. 16) at The Old  California Store, an antiques shop in Ventura specializing in California Rancho  themes.  </P> <P> "There's a similarity in styles in '30s Mexican and American art," says Don  Shorts, co-owner of The Old California Store, though, he says, the Mexican  pieces are more ethnic and regionalized, stressing pre-Columbian and Aztec  influences. The collection includes about 30 rare color lithographs, most  dating back to the '30s, the art form's heyday. Prints measuring 16x24 inches  run about $175.  </P> <P> The Old California Store, 1528 E. Thompson Blvd., Ventura; (805) 643-4217. SEAN  PRESANT  </P></p>

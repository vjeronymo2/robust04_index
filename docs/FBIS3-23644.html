			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Oleg Panfilov under the rubric "Tajikistan": "The </F> Opposition Protests MID Statement: Russia's Military Presence in  Republic Beefed Up"]    [Text] Tajikistan's Islamic Resistance  Council located in the city of Tulukan in the Afghan province of  Takhar has disseminated a statement refuting one by the Tajik  MID [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] that "militant groups of the  Islamic resistance are shelling their (that is, government)  formations from the territory of Afghanistan."    Sayyid Abdullo Nuri, council leader, warns that the  intrigues  involving the statement are a prelude to a new air raid on the  camps of Tajik refugees in Afghanistan.    At the same time the Russian military are taking new steps  to  build up their contingent in Tajikistan. According to reports  from a highly placed officer in the Russian Ministry of Defense,  Colonel-General Boris Pyankov plans to conduct exercises by  "peacekeeping forces" on the territory of the "Tiger Gully"  reserve, the only place on the planet where rare kinds of plants  and animals have been protected through the efforts of Soviet  scientists. The exercises are presently being worked out in  Moscow at the headquarters for the coordination of military  operations of the CIS countries. According to another version,  an echelon of armored equipment has already been sent to  Tajikistan.    In the meantime a blockade of rail lines leading into  Tajikistan from Uzbekistan continues. More than 1,000 cars of  freight had built up at border stations by mid-February, the  delay of which is costing Tajikistan around four billion rubles  a day. The trains are being plundered, and freight is being  pilfered from the broken cars. Uzbek authorities are  simultaneously hampering the removal of freight from Tajikistan.  According to that same highly-placed officer, Tajikistan's Uzbek  population is increasingly expressing dissatisfaction with  Tashkent's policy, which is leading to inter-ethnic reprisals.  Central Asia's geopolitical structure is now increasingly  subjected to the influence of Uzbekistan, which is laying claim  to a leading role in the region by blockading Tajikistan.    The officer feels that Russia's role here is actually under  threat. In 1993 alone it costs the taxpayers 59 billion rubles  to maintain the Russian Army in Tajikistan. The number of  casualties is constantly growing, which could lead to  dissatisfaction on the part of the Russians, as occurred during  the Soviet-Afghan war. While there is a crisis of authority in  Afghanistan, neither Moscow nor Tashkent will strive for rapid  talks between Dushanbe and the opposition. Furthermore, the  officer states, the buildup of the Russian Army's military  presence in Tajikistan is absolutely deliberate. As reported  from the mountain regions of Karategin (Garm), military aircraft  have carried out raids in the valley each day for the second  week in a row. There is forced recruitment into the army in  Dushanbe, and confrontations among government groups continue in  Kurgan-Tyube.</p>

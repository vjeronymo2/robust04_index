			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Car prices vary 'very widely within EC' CAR PRICES in the European Community differ substantially from country to country, and by more than 40 per cent in the worst cases, a study for the European Commission shows. However, the Commission is divided about the causes of the price disparities, and about what actions should be taken to bring prices into line. The report, prepared with help by the Motor Industry Research Unit, the UK-based automotive consultants, shows that five manufacturers had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent during one of the five study periods, between January 1988 and January 1991. Germany and Spain had the greatest number of high-priced models in 1988. In January 1989, the highest-priced models were concentrated in the UK. Spain had by far the greatest number of high-priced models in the three study periods of 1990 and 1991. Even the car manufacturer with the lowest price gap had differentials as great as 17 per cent, the report by EC competition officials shows. For 18 of the 21 car models studied in detail, the price differentials exceeded 18 per cent, and for 19 of the 21 models the price differentials exceeded 12 per cent for two consecutive study periods. On Wednesday, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, will seek approval by fellow commissioners of two reports they have produced about the motor industry. One is on car prices, produced for Sir Leon, and there is a report by Mr Bangemann's directorate on the industry itself. Both highlight differences in car prices. But advisers to Sir Leon and Mr Bangemann disagree on the extent to which the current system of exclusive car dealerships in the EC is to blame. The system restricts sales of new cars in the EC to dealers chosen by the manufacturers and is exempt from EC competition rules until 1995. Under the terms of the 10-year exemption, EC car prices are supposed to stay within a 12 per cent band in the long term, with fluctuations up to 18 per cent only allowed for periods of less than one year. Consumer groups argue that the system aggravates price differences. Sir Leon and his advisers believe that, while other factors (including tax differences, currency fluctuation, and varying equipment specifications) encourage price differences, the exclusive dealership system is the main culprit. Mr Bangemann's advisers favour attacking specific abuses of the system, but say high prices in Britain and Spain have other causes. Sir Leon will not call for exclusive dealerships to be scrapped but his advisers say that, over the next three years, dealers will have to show the system is consistent with a healthy internal market. His conclusions go further than the lengthy report in February by the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission. This compared UK prices with some continental European markets, and it seemed to accept the car industry's argument that the UK's dedicated dealer and service network be retained because of the complexity of the products sold and the implications for safety if cars were not properly maintained. Mr Bangemann's report on the automobile industry - the latest in a series of Commission communications on industrial sectors - calls for 'a satisfactory and efficient system of selective distribution' to be maintained until 1999, which is unacceptable to Sir Leon. The aim, said a recent draft, is to protect EC manufacturers from 'large-scale indirect importation' of cars while they are adapting to increased competition from Japan.</p>

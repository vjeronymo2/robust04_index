			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONN ASKS E. GERMAN TALKS NOW ON ECONOMY, CURRENCY  </P> <P> The West German government declared Wednesday that it wants to negotiate  "immediately" with East Germany on a monetary union and economic reforms.  </P> <P> The Bonn Cabinet managed to enlist the support of West German central bank  President Karl Otto Poehl, an independent official who has been skeptical that  merging the currencies of East and West Germany would solve the former's  critical problems.  </P> <P> And the Cabinet, under prodding from Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed to work out  details of a currency union that would be presented to East German Prime  Minister Hans Modrow when he arrives here on an official visit next week.  </P> <P> The government also decided to set up working groups to harmonize differences  in the legal, political and administrative structures of East and West Germany,  as a prelude to unification.  </P> <P> East German government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said the East Berlin regime  will consider the Bonn proposals at its regular Cabinet meeting today.  </P> <P> After the Cabinet decision, Finance Minister Theo Waigel told Parliament that  the decisions to proceed toward a single currency are necessary to dampen the  "escalation of the crisis" in East Germany.  </P> <P> "We must remain master of the political process," said Waigel, who is head of  the conservative, Bavarian branch of the ruling Christian Democrats.  </P> <P> "The deutschemark has become the currency of choice for the people," he added.  </P> <P> The Bonn government now envisages a virtual takeover of the East German  economic and monetary system to keep it from collapsing.  </P> <P> In East Berlin on Wednesday, Deputy Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere welcomed  the West German decision as perhaps the only solution to keeping East Germans  from leaving for the West, currently at the rate of about 2,000 a day.  </P> <P> "The proposal is suited to give signals for people to stay here," said De  Maiziere, who is head of the East German Christian Democratic Party.  </P> <P> Bonn economists and financial experts hope that substituting the West's hard  mark for the East's weak mark will convince East Germans that they are being  paid in a solid currency and encourage them to remain where they are. East  German workers paid in West marks would see their purchasing power immediately  jump by 5 to 10 times.  </P> <P> Further, some experts say, if East Germany had a freely convertible currency,  Western investors would be more easily persuaded to put their money into major  efforts to renew industry and redevelop the economy there.  </P> <P> However, a West Berlin economic research institute reported Wednesday that  monetary reform might not stem the flow of East Germans heading west for better  jobs and lives.  </P> <P> "The real differences in standards of living, which are at the core of the  extremely difficult economic situation in East Germany, would remain," said the  report of the DIW Institute.  </P> <P> And Helmut Geiger, head of West Germany's Savings Bank Assn., said Wednesday  that rescuing the East German economy will need staggering financial assistance  -- "substantial double-digit sums in billions (of marks)."  </P> <P> West Germans are beginning to realize, to their dismay, that their own standard  of living might drop if ambitious programs to salvage the East German economy  are enacted.  </P> <P> But Kohl and Waigel say that the alternative is the westward flow of millions  more East Germans. East Germans are guaranteed automatic citizenship and  benefits under the West German constitution, and a flood of them would create a  housing and job crisis in the Federal Republic.  </P> <P> A senior Western diplomat said Wednesday that the standard of living in a  united Germany would probably at first decline while East German was being  modernized but that later, a new "economic miracle" could well take place.  </P> <P> The mass circulation newspaper Bild quoted an internal Bonn Finance Ministry  report on Wednesday as suggesting that in the short term, as many as 1.4  million East Germans could face loss of work in the shift to a free market  economy.  </P> <P> In Brussels, the European Commission on Wednesday set up a special "German  group" to study the implications of a joint East-West German currency. It  issued a statement saying that Kohl had called Commission President Jacques  Delors to brief him on the Bonn developments, adding: "The chancellor  underlined that the negotiations which are to begin will not cause any delay in  the timetable of community business," referring to the community's single  market, scheduled to begin at the end of 1992.  </P></p>

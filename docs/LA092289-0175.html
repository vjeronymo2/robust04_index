			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> COST-CUTTING CHRYSLER SELLS 45% OF ITS SHARE IN MITSUBISHI MOTORS  </P> <P> Chrysler Corp., in the midst of a $1-billion cost-cutting program, today  announced it is selling 45% of its share in the Japanese auto maker Mitsubishi  Motors Corp. for $592 million.  </P> <P> The company said it would see an after-tax profit of about $310 million, or  $1.33 a share, from the sale to 25 Japanese financial institutions. The money  goes to Chrysler's general fund.  </P> <P> "The fact is we didn't need it to meet the short-term cash needs of  implementing our billion-dollar cost-cutting program," Chrysler Chief Financial  Officer Robert Miller said today.  </P> <P> Miller said the money will help fund a five-year product-development program,  meet pension obligations and provide more capital for a stock repurchase plan.  </P> <P> "This will just give us an added bit of balance-sheet strength for those  purposes," he said.  </P> <P> The move will reduce Chrysler's equity in Mitsubishi to 12.1% from 21.8%.  </P> <P> "This has turned out to be a very good investment. By selling, we don't think  the party's over by any means," Miller said.  </P> <P> "Our relationship with Mitsubishi Motors Corp. remains as strong as ever and is  a critical element of our future plans," Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said in  a news release today. "Given today's market conditions in Japan . . . we feel  that this is a good time to reduce the size of our stake in MMC and realize  some significant value for our shareholders."  </P></p>

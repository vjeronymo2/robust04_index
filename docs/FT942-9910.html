			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Bank rejects criticisms of share-settlement system The Bank of England yesterday launched a strong defence against criticisms of its proposed Crest paperless share-settlement system. In a speech in Paris, Mr Pen Kent, executive director of the Bank, rejected suggestions that the system had slipped behind deadlines and exceeded predicted costs. He conceded that the Bank had negotiated an 'absolute cap' on spending of Pounds 35m, in excess of the estimates circulated last November of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m. Mr Kent added: 'Readers of some sections of the British press in the past week have been regaled with stories that Crest will be late, over budget, disappointingly under-subscribed and insensitive to small investors. None of this is true.' He stressed that he expected the costs of Crest to remain within the original range, and that the figure of Pounds 35m was 'a backstop which is not expected to be reached'. He said the design phase had cost Pounds 2m and the estimate to build the core processing system was Pounds 5m, a figure that had been independently audited. The figure reflected a reduction in costs as a result of negotiations and was at the bottom of the estimated range of Pounds 5m to Pounds 7m. It included a 40 per cent contingency figure. Mr Kent said the cost of designing and building the system would be Pounds 12m, including Pounds 5m for the project's business team and professional fees. All deadlines had so far been met and Crest would be built by the end of 1995 and could be in operation by late 1996, he added. The total costs after 1995 until the system was running depended on the decisions taken by the future owners of the system, but they could be as low as Pounds 10m. Mr Kent stressed that the initial Pounds 12m was fully committed, with 48 firms willing to take stakes 'well ahead of what we had expected at this stage'. He admitted that the move to five-day rolling settlement was likely to take place in the middle of next year rather than next January as previously stated, but said this was not 'on the critical path of the project itself'. He said much thought had been given to protecting the position of small shareholders.</p>

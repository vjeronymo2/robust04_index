			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Wellcome in US Aids alliance Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals group, has formed an alliance with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the Massachusetts-based biotechnology group, to develop orally active protease inhibitors against Aids and HIV, the virus causing Aids. The agreement is worth up to Dollars 42m (Pounds 28.1m) to the US group. Protease is an enzyme essential for HIV to replicate. Wellcome will pay an initial Dollars 15m and provide research support and payments for agreed development milestones. In return, the group acquires the rights to develop, manufacture and market Vertex's HIV protease inhibitors in the US, Europe and other countries outside east Asia. In April, Vertex signed an agreement with Kissei Pharmaceutical of Japan, to develop orally active drugs against HIV for the Chinese and Japanese markets. Under terms of the agreement, Kissei could pay Vertex up to Dollars 20m. Other companies which are exploring the use of HIV protease inhibitors include the Du Pont-Merck joint venture, Upjohn, and Abbott of the US, and Roche of Switzerland. The Roche compound is probably furthest developed and has demonstrated some efficacy in humans. Wellcome's move is part of a continuing strategy to forge links with biotechnology groups. In December last year it appointed Mr Mark Weedon to the newly-created post of group licensing director. The deal is one of the first results from the new US licensing team. A team has been set up in Japan, and further agreements are expected next year.</p>

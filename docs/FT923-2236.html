			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Urban Development (2): New agency will revive tired land - John Willman talks to the new minister responsible for the inner cities about the next step in the reclamation of the UK's wasted acres / Interview with John Redwood BY THIS time next year, there should be a new force in urban regeneration in England. Provided parliament approves, the Urban Regeneration Agency (URA) will be up and running, armed with powers to reclaim and develop derelict and under-used land in England - and up to Pounds 300m a year to spend. For Mr John Redwood, the new inner cities minister, the URA offers an opportunity to extend nationwide the approach which has been so successful for the urban development corporations (UDCs). 'Development corporations were the right way forward for large blocks of land in one place, which needed a big budget to revive,' he says. 'The URA will tackle smaller areas, as a sort of roving UDC. 'There remains over 150,000 acres of land in our towns and cities which could be better used. The URA will have funds which can be used to trigger private-sector investment, and compulsory purchase powers where needed to assemble land for development.' The URA will take over responsibility for two parts of the urban programme: Derelict land grant, which over the past four years has funded the treatment of 10,000 acres of derelict land, mainly by local authorities; and City grant, introduced to help the private sector develop inner-city sites which would not otherwise have been viable - it has levered in Pounds 1bn of private investment since 1988. These two grants will immediately give the agency control over more than Pounds 100m of government expenditure. But the URA will also take over English Estates, the government body which helps provide industrial and commercial premises in the assisted areas and certain other development areas. Sales of land and property by English Estates could provide another Pounds 200m a year for the URA. Ideally, the agency will act at the request of a local authority, says Mr Redwood. In most cases, an active partnership with the local council will be essential, for the URA will not automatically have planning powers. In exceptional circumstances, however, the agency will be given development control powers in areas designated by the secretary of state. But even then, development would have to be within the framework of the local planning authority's plans. 'There will be considerable attractions for local councils to co-operate with the agency,' Mr Redwood says. 'The URA will have cash, contacts and expertise which can all assist local efforts.' With larger projects, there may even be some form of local participation, with a steering group bringing together all the partners required for successful urban regeneration: central government, the local authority, the private sector and voluntary and community groups. It is the creation of such partnerships across the country that Mr Redwood sees as the great achievement of 13 years of Conservative urban regeneration policy. He is particularly enthusiastic about City Challenge, the process by which inner-city areas bid for funds for urban regeneration. 'It was one of Michael Heseltine's most creative ideas on his return to the environment department,' he says. 'City Challenge changes the way that people look at regenerating their area: they realise that it can't be done by government money alone.' On arriving at the department of the environment's Marsham Street headquarters in the post-election reshuffle, he was faced with 54 bids for funds in the second round of City Challenge. To the surprise of officials, he decided that every bidding authority should have the opportunity to make a presentation of its case to a minister - John Redwood personally sat in on some 20 bids. Choosing the winners was no simple matter. 'In every case, we asked ourselves the question, does the scheme make sense  -will it work? Some did not, but most did, so we then went on to make the hard decisions about which offered the best way to spend the money. 'There was no difficulty in agreeing on the 10 best proposals, or in eliminating the weakest. But in between, there was a large block of bids of merit which were very difficult to separate. 'At the margins, we came down to examining levels of relative deprivation to select which should go forward.' Mr Redwood is sensitive to the plight of the unsuccessful bidders, especially those who have failed in both rounds. 'We have tried to include an outline of the reasons when writing to those local authorities which were unsuccessful,' he says. 'I am very open to discussion to help improve the chances of subsequent bids.' And he points out that the plans drawn up to prepare bids are not wasted: they can be used to apply for funds under other parts of the urban programme or to raise capital from the private sector. Despite his evident enthusiasm for the way that City Challenge galvanises local authorities, Mr Redwood cautions that the jury is still out on whether it can deliver its promise. 'It remains to be seen whether the partnerships which are formed to mount bids can be held together,' he says. 'We shall be following their progress closely, ensuring that targets are met.' But he is confident that a new relationship is developing between the Conservative government and the largely Labour-controlled inner-city local authorities. One symbol of that is the partnership between the prime minister and the leader of Manchester city council to bid for the Olympic games on behalf of the city. Another is the more emollient approach taken to the reform of local government management. Proposals put out by Mr Heseltine for consultation last year - which included the introduction of directly elected mayors - have been referred to a working group, including local authority representatives, to examine best practice and come up with an agreed approach. 'We wish to work with local councils,' says Mr Redwood. 'And there is a realisation on their side - particularly since the election - that if they want to speak for their own areas, they must talk to us.' After 13 years of often open warfare between Whitehall and the town halls, Mr Redwood's desire for a new relationship will be widely welcomed.</p>

			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir rejected an Egyptian proposal for  Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Cairo, saying it would amount to Israel's  surrender. In a sharply worded speech to business executives in Jerusalem,  Shamir said it is clear that the Palestine Liberation Organization would  appoint the Palestinian delegates to such talks. "Who will come to Cairo? The  leaders of the intifada (uprising) will come. . . . They will come as victors,  they will tell the whole Arab world, 'We succeeded, we succeeded,' " Shamir  said. Egypt has offered to host Israeli-Palestinian talks on Israel's proposal  for elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose delegates to  negotiate for self-rule.  </P></p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Prism Leisure ahead 38% but warns on first quarter Prism Leisure Corporation, the USM-quoted computer games and music group, yesterday reported a 38 per cent profits rise, but a warning that trading in the first quarter of the current year had been 'somewhat disappointing' pushed the shares down 5p at 167p. Mr Geoff Young, chairman, said the Christmas quarter remained the company's most significant trading period. Pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks to April 2 rose to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.33m) on turnover 24 per cent higher at Pounds 19.4m. Earnings per share increased to 14.2p (10.4p) and a recommended final dividend of 3.03p makes a total for the year of 4.18p (3.27p). Mr Young said the computer games division, and in particular the merchandising operation, once more performed strongly. The audio and video side however, had a difficult year, with turnover reduced. The German subsidiary had a good year, with both turnover and profits up, while Prism's pub quiz offshoot made a marginally lower contribution than in previous years, but still 'performed creditably', said Mr Young. In its first full year within the group, Paul Lamond - mainly trading in board games - performed in line with expectations and contributed 'a useful profit'.</p>

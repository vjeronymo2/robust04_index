			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with CNR President Jacques </F> Matanda-ma-Mboyo by Rik De Gendt in Brussels; date not given:  "Zairian Opposition Chooses Armed Action"]    [Text] "We will not allow ourselves to be mistreated  endlessly. Our good will and patience during activities and  negotiations are completely exhausted. Above all, the Zairian  people is living in an inhumane situation. For this reason we  decided to set up an Armed Branch of the Radical Opposition  [Branche Armee de L'Opposition Radicale]. It seems the only way  out of the crisis," said Jacques Matanda-ma-Mboyo, member of the  executive committee of the USORAL [Sacred Union of the Radical  Opposition and Allies], a broad coalition of opposition parties,  in an interview with DE STANDAARD.    Matanda comes from Bandundu. He belongs to a generation of  young politicians who have never served under President Mobutu  Sese Seko and now "wants to make a new sound heard." He is  president of the Confederation of Reformist Nationalists (CNR)  [Confederation des Nationalistes Reformateurs], a political  pressure party which is part of the USORAL. He played an  important role in organizing the so-called "dead city" days of  protest which entirely paralyzed urban life.    On 22 March 1993, Matanda was offered the position of deputy  interior minister in the transitional government of Etienne  Tshisekedi, but he declined the offer. "I could not reconcile  myself with the endless dirty tricks of men who are looking out  mainly or exclusively for their own interests," he said.  "Nearly all of them had eaten out of Mobutu's hand in the past  and they are still under his influence. I decided to withdraw  and leave the country to take a more effective path with some  people thinking along the same lines," he said.    For three months, Matanda lived in Angola and for another  month and a half he lived in the turbulent Congo town of  Brazzaville. There he realized "that you can only get some  rulers on their knees and break through the suffering of  inhumane situations under the pressure of armed action. The  history of Israel, South Africa, Angola, and Zimbabwe provide  abundant proof of that," he said. He then made contact with  armed opposition groups in Uganda and Tanzania and took the  South African ANC as an example. From Europe, he is now making  the final preparations for his activities.    "We are not planning a conventional war," Matanda explained.  "Rather we are planning well prepared commando actions which can  escape the reach of even a large and trained military apparatus  like Mobutu's. It will make him mad and eventually make him  surrender. We are hoping for a good deal of support from the  diaspora and are counting ultimately on a mobilization from  Kinshasa and inside the country."    Matanda lost his belief in any political solution due to  both  the stubbornness and untrustworthiness of President Mobutu and  the high- handed intervention of Monsignor Laurent Monsengwo as  chairman first of the National Sovereign Conference and later of  the High Council of the Republic and the extended transitional  parliament.    "Mobutu has never kept his word and will not do so tomorrow.  It does not harm him that the people is starving. He is clever  and knows how to turn every situation and every agreement to his  advantage. Monsengwo became the victim of that and in turn the  prelate did not hesitate, especially in his international  contacts, to push aside the representatives of the Zairian  people and follow his own path. Both men believe that they are  above any law and that we must dance to their tune for ever. In  fact, one is the other's hostage. We want to break this circle  of power and suffering in the shortest possible time," Matanda  said.</p>

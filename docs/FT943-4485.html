			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / International Company News: Italian banks face tight timetable - San Paolo and BNC seem to be moving towards deal It should have been a simple marriage of convenience: undercapitalised bank meets wealthy suitor, they merge and live happily ever after. That was the draft script for a deal signed in March by Italy's Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni, a small bank with just over 60 branches, controlled by the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), the state railway, and Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino, the country's biggest bank with nearly 1,000 outlets nationwide. The preliminary accord gave little away, but at the time it was said that the two banks would swap shares, leaving BNC with a 6 per cent or 7 per cent stake in San Paolo. It looked like the end of a long search by BNC for a strategic partner which could end losses, and restructure management. The companies wanted to formalise their union quickly to take advantage of fiscal incentives for banking takeovers which were introduced in 1990 but are only available up to the end of this year. Six months later, San Paolo is still the only bank to have declared a formal interest in BNC. But in the meantime, a modest merger has been turned into a highly charged political issue, the catalyst for rumours about phantom counter-bids, tension within the new Italian government, and a series of attacks on the Italian central bank. Mr Publio Fiori, Italy's transport minister since May, has deliberately put himself at the centre of the controversy. It was Mr Fiori who, at the end of June, sought clarification from the FS about the terms of the merger with San Paolo and then began single-handedly to campaign for a better deal. Apart from the bank's foundation, which holds about 44 per cent of the shares, and the FS which controls just over 50 per cent, about 7 per cent of BNC belongs to 80,000 small shareholders, mainly railway workers. Mr Fiori has argued that the strategic importance of the bank is such that it should not be abandoned for a handful of San Paolo paper in a deal hastily struck by an outgoing government. With about L50,000bn (Dollars 31.2bn) of railway investment to be carried out over the next few years, the transport minister says the FS needs to be able to count on dedicated financing. Since August, with most of the rest of the government on holiday, Mr Fiori has increased the intensity of his campaign, lambasting the Bank of Italy - which must approve banking mergers - for allegedly trying to force BNC into the arms of San Paolo without considering possible counter-bids. Fellow members of the right-wing National Alliance attacked the Bank of Italy, accusing Mr Antonio Fazio, the governor, of abusing his position, and asking the Rome prosecutor to open a file on the case. However, the promised counter-bids have failed to materialise. Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, a small retail bank, did make a tentative and informal cash offer, which was dismissed by the Bank of Italy as inferior to the San Paolo bid. Indeed, until this week, it seemed as though Mr Fiori's intervention had achieved little except many column inches of publicity for the minister and deep irritation at the central bank and the Treasury. In the meantime, the timetable for doing a deal has grown tighter and tighter. Analysts suggest that if a merger cannot be agreed by the end of this month there will not be enough time to complete the formalities by the end of the year, and take advantage of the promised tax-breaks. However, in the last few days the fog surrounding the BNC case has begun to lift. On Tuesday evening, Mr Fiori indicated his confidence that Mr Lamberto Dini, the Treasury minister, would decide the outcome of the affair. San Paolo has now amended its own bid, sources say. The cash which Mr Fiori wants for BNC is unlikely to be forthcoming, but the Turin-based bank has proposed a more complex share-swap which would strengthen links between BNC and Crediop, a San Paolo subsidiary specialising in the financing of public investment projects. Although the new deal is said to be worth more than the original all-paper offer, it may not satisfy Mr Fiori. Last night, Italian news agencies reported that the transport ministry had received a new alternative offer for BNC. The BNC affair may not yet have reached the end of the line.</p>

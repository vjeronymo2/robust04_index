			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / Clifford to face NY BCCI trial first A FEDERAL judge in Washington yesterday ruled that Mr Clark Clifford, former US defence secretary facing criminal charges in connection with the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), should first stand trial in New York before facing a federal indictment in Washington. Judge Joyce Hens Green granted a prosecution request that the Washington trial of Mr Clifford be postponed until at least next March, so that he can first be tried on the more serious New York charges of accepting bribes, conspiracy to commit fraud and misleading bank regulators. The New York trial is expected to begin in early January. Justice Department officials have said the Washington case might then be dropped. The Washington charges relate mainly to Mr Clifford's statements to bank regulators regarding First American Bankshares, the Washington bank he chaired until last year and which was illegally controlled by BCCI. The judge also decided to appoint a cardiologist to examine the 85-year-old Mr Clifford, as he and the Justice Department had requested. US prosecutors have said that, depending on the doctor's assessment, they may decide to excuse Mr Clifford a trial. Mr Robert Altman - Mr Clifford's 45-year-old protege and law partner, and the former president of First American - will face trial whether or not Mr Clifford is excused. Yesterday, before the Washington hearing had begun, Mr Altman's actress wife Lynda Carter - known as the star of Wonder Woman, the television show - made a point of appearing in the front row of the courtroom to give Mr Altman a lavish hug and kiss. Both Mr Clifford and Mr Altman have denied any wrongdoing.</p>

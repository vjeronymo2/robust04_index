			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Wineupmanship, beating the bores - Entertaining at home / Jancis Robinson on safe bottles for the pickiest of dinner guests In my experience, the more wine expertise someone claims, the less they generally have. Only a beginner would claim to know a lot about wine; those of us who have spent a couple of decades immersed in the subject are only too painfully aware of how much more there is to learn. People with a little wine knowledge tend to wear it heavily. My heart always sinks, for instance, when someone begins a conversation with 'In my cellar . . .'. It is difficult enough to make a discussion about the wine in your glass interesting, let alone one about someone else's firmly corked bottles. I sympathise, therefore, with anyone required to entertain those who claim to know something about wine. Will the choice of bottles reveal one as an irredeemable cheapskate or vinous lowbrow? As so often, the solution is not necessarily to throw money at the problem. Very, very few wine merchants' most expensive bottles are anything like ready to drink (exceptions include: Reid Wines, of Hallatrow, near Bristol; La Vigneronne of London W7; and Butlers Wine Cellar, of Brighton, Sussex). The answer is to show flair, wineupmanship, and spend less, by choosing some hot, new (or revived) wine types. The insider's whistle-whetting aperitif, for example, is top quality Riesling, preferably a Mosel Kabinett from a quality-conscious producer (which is unlikely to cost much more than Pounds 7). The VDP symbol on the label or capsule is a shorthand way of identifying Germany's goodies, a very high proportion of which belong to the VDP group of superior estates. Merchants who take German wine seriously include: Oddbins, O W Loeb of London SE1; Philip Eyres, of Amersham, Bucks; Harcourt Fine Wines, of London W1; Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk; Summerlee Wines, of Earls Barton, Northamptonshire (0604-810488); Lay &amp; Wheeler, of Colchester, Essex; and The Wine Society, of Stevenage, Herts. Acceptable alternatives include one of the host of Australian Rieslings now being shipped, faute de Chardonnay, to the UK or a dry Riesling from Alsace. Lea &amp; Sandeman, of London SW10, has the superb wines of Marcel Deiss, and Wine Rack stores have made a particularly diligent selection. One clever dry, fuller-bodied white and one red should be enough for most meals - although you could always demonstrate your savoir boire by serving a sweet wine with the cheese such as a Moelleux version of Jurancon or Pacherenc de Vic Bilh, an Italian Moscato with an alcohol of at least 12 per cent, or even (tres chic) an Austrian Beerenauslese (try Noel Young of Trumpington, Cambridgeshire, for the fabulous wines of Kracher). Chardonnay-based wines dominate dinner tables the world over. Much more distinguished at the moment are full, dry whites based on Rhone Valley varieties. Viognier is so sought after it is almost passe. Rostaing's 1992 version at Pounds 9.99 from Bottoms Up and Wine Rack is much meatier than most, and few wines are more outre than Guffens' Ardeche 'Fruits Defendus' oddity which is not allowed to call itself Viognier but fetches Pounds 8.13 at Laytons of London NW1 (and try Andre Simon shops). A more gifted choice would be a well-made wine based on one or both of the white Hermitage grapes Marsanne or Roussanne. Ch de Beaucastel of Chateauneuf-du-Pape has produced an exciting old-vine Roussanne for years now. A more inspired choice might be the intriguingly packaged Sophiste, from Bonny Doon, of California. This blend of Marsanne and Roussanne has the elegance that so much white Hermitage lacks and the 1993 vintage is expected soon by Morris &amp; Verdin at their new address in London SE1 (071-357 8866). It will be about Pounds 17.50 a bottle - not cheap but a real thrill. Another impressive Rhone Ranger white, as the Californians call them, is Jade Mountain's Marsanne/Viognier 1993, Pounds 9.90 from Morris &amp; Verdin. Rather less expensive but with an interesting tang is a white Minervois based on old Marsanne vines, Ch de Violet 1993 which Thresher Wine Shops/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up have been selling for Pounds 4.99. Australia can also provide some Marsanne, which should usually be drunk as young as possible. Pioneer exporters of Victorian Marsanne were Ch Tahbilk and Mitchelton (chez Sainsbury's), the latter now part of Petaluma's expanding empire. Wine Rack also has an interestingly smoky, substantial, oak-aged Catalonian Malvoisie, probably the same grape variety as Sardinia's Torbato, at Pounds 6.49 a bottle. The red wine possibilities for stunning a wine bore are much wider. The Rhone can again provide, particularly in the form of the less famous appellations. Crozes-Hermitage can now be a serious wine, from the cellars of the likes of Graillot and Belle (see Lay &amp; Wheeler and Oddbins) or, another Rhone from Syrah grapes, you could even buy the earthy red Brezeme from Yapp Bros, of Mere, Wiltshire and confound with obscurity. But I would be inclined to head out of France altogether and pick an Italian plum from Winecellars of Wandsworth, London SW18 or Valvona &amp; Crolla, of Edinburgh. The nice thing about Italian fanatics is that they advise while proselytising. A fine Ribeira del Duero, such as Pesquera (from John Armit Wines, of London W11) would also impress with its demonstration of insider knowledge. Both these wine styles need reasonably chewy, assertive food, however. If you are planning a subtler main course, a West Coast Pinot Noir from the particularly fine selection of The Wine Treasury of Fulham Road, London SW6 is guaranteed to delight. They have such gorgeous California Pinot Noirs as Williams &amp; Selyem (a tiny allocation), Olivet Lane and Kistler, and the extremely convincing Christom, regular and Reserve, from Oregon. The Chilean Cono Sur regular Pinot Noir bottling at Pounds 4.49 from Oddbins and Safeway is less serious, but its quality should fascinate anyone with half an interest in wine.</p>

			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / International Company News: CHH sells further NZDollars 260m of assets CARTER Holt Harvey, which is selling assets to pay for its purchase of NZ Forest Products, has sold its Hawkes Bay forests and all but 10 per cent of the giant Pan Pac mill in Napier, to its Japanese partners for NZDollars 260m (USDollars 152.9m). Under the deal, Carter Holt has a two-year option allowing it to return to a 50 per cent stake in the partnership. Mr Richard Carter, executive chairman, said the group expected to release NZDollars 635m from the sale of Elders Resources NZ non-forestry assets. Further money would come from the sale of the Australian Simsmetal business and the sale of 49 per cent of Bridge Oil, which would raise NZDollars 100m. An exchange of contracts on Simsmetal to an unnamed buyer is due over the next month. CHH had a majority holding in Carter Oji Kokusaku Pan Pacific, and had been discussing the position with its two Japanese partners, Oji Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, which helped fund the mill in the 1960s. The forests, bought to support the mill, were among 94,000 hectares CHH purchased from the government last year for NZDollars 383m.</p>

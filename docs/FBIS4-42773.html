			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Pierre Briancon: "U.S. President in National </F> Assembly -- Clinton Safe on Atlanticism"]    [Text] As the only diplomatic area in which the U.S.  President has retained his credibility, relations between Europe  and the United States are expected to be at the core of his  address to the French National Assembly today.    Bill Clinton will deliver today to the National Assembly the  only "political" speech of his European tour, at a time when his  ability to show real leadership in foreign affairs has been  increasingly in doubt. Several international crises -- North  Korea, Bosnia, Haiti -- have proven tough tests for America's  determination and leadership, casting an unflattering light on  Bill Clinton's weaknesses as well as those of his diplomatic  team.    In Paris, his aides indicated, he will likely insist on the  future of Europe and transatlantic relations. This is a  presumably safe issue, as it is the one on which the U.S.  President has proved the least fumble-footed.    Europe is probably the only field in which Bill Clinton has  not committed any blunder since taking office, one in which he  has actually been rather successful. Due to his intellectual  and generational background, he is the first U.S. President to  believe in European integration, as a result of a combination of  convictions and self-interest, and to favor it unreservedly.    Owing to his training, culture, and analysis, he does not  have the protective -- sometimes imperial -- reflex which his  predecessors, because of their war experience, tended to harbor  with respect to Europe. He considers the Old Continent as  politically mature and an economic competitor. Therefore he is  ready to embrace equality, but also competition.    To be sure, there have been many inept moves, especially in  the administration's first months, on the part of Secretary of  State Warren Christopher, who bluntly told the Europeans they  were no longer at the center of U.S. diplomacy and that Asia and  its potential markets were now Washington's chief concern. To  be sure, there was the lingering feeling that on the Old  Continent itself Russia mattered more to Washington than did its  former allies. However, since he came to power, Bill Clinton  has managed to avoid major disputes with Europe.    He even displayed some imagination: His idea of a  partnership for peace -- a way to extend NATO's sphere of  influence without altering its structure for the time being  while crossing old military divides -- was adopted by every  Alliance member in January. Even Russia chose to join. The  confrontation with Europe -- and France in particular -- on GATT  is now forgotten, with people mostly remembering that the  agreement meant to deregulate world trade was eventually signed  by all parties.    However, relations between Europe and the United States are  not just bilateral. At the moment, Mr. Clinton's main problem  is one of credibility with regard to public opinion. His  European partners are visibly unconcerned by the fact that the  President who is commemorating the 50th anniversary of the  Normandy landing was never himself a soldier. Nor is his  supposed lack of a "vision" of the world and its future, of an  operational concept that he could navigate by -- a charge  leveled by Henry Kissinger in NEWSWEEK -- the main concern of  Europeans.    What they worry about is a diplomacy that is exceedingly  responsive to U.S. opinion, and the botched jobs observed in  Bosnia or Haiti, with the President too often appearing to agree  with the most vocal lobby, as dictated by the sophisticated  political and strategic calculations of his pollsters or the  latest pictures broadcast by CNN.    In the last few days, Bill Clinton and his aides have faced  an onslaught of questions on the North Korea crisis and  Pyongyang's statement that any sanctions would be considered an  "act of war." This inquisitiveness on the part of U.S. media  mostly reflects a will to find an answer to the following  question: In a crisis that would directly involve U.S.  strategic interests, would Bill Clinton prove equal to the  situation?</p>

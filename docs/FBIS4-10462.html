			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Tijuana, Baja California, Dr. Gustavo Salazar  Fernandez, the legal medical expert who performed the autopsy on  Luis Donaldo Colosio, said that the bullets that killed the  former PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] presidential  candidate were fired from different weapons. Gerardo Segura  filed this report from Tijuana, Baja California:    [Segura] Two people may be implicated in the assassination  of  Luis Donaldo Colosio. According to reports disclosed by Federal  Judicial Police agents present on the day of the murder, the  bullet fired at the head of the PRI candidate was different from  the one that hit the abdomen. They stated that the bullet in  the skull destroyed a large amount of brain because it  fragmented, contrary to the one in the abdomen, which did not  seriously damage the internal organs.    The informants, who in light of the current events asked to  remain anonymous, expressed their distrust in the official  report. Given this situation, Dr. Gustavo Salazar Fernandez,  legal medical expert, affirmed that the autopsy performed on  Colosio did not establish whether one or two firearms were used  for the attack.    [Begin Salazar recording] We recover projectiles left inside  the body, if any, or state if there was fragmentation. It is  impossible to retrieve them in each and every case. The autopsy  report does not officially establish the caliber of the  projectile. This is done by special request of a prosecutor or  at a given time when the ballistic tests are performed.    From a strictly medical viewpoint, we try to be descriptive.  [end recording]    [Segura] Salazar added, however, that it is possible that  two different guns may have been used by two different  perpetrators, but the exhumation and new inspections of the body  would not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or support such  hypotheses.    Informants of the Federal Judicial Police said that the  second shot may have come from the person who dove at the feet  of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Authorities are still searching for  that person.</p>

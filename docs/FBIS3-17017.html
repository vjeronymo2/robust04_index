He reels off the list of major oil and gas companies --  Chevron, Mobil, British Petroleum, British Gas, Shell,  Elf-Aquitaine, Total, Agip -- that have made major investments  in the Republic many are dubbing in hope "a new Kuwait."    The president says it produces 27 million tonnes of oil a  year, targeted to increase to 70 million tonnes by 2010 and 22  million tonnes of wheat. Sixty million tonnes of coal and 20  million tonnes of iron ore are exported to Russia annually.    The figures continue with the minerals Kazakhstan has to  offer -- 50 to 60 million tonnes of gold, 30 per cent of the  former Soviet Union's copper output, 70 per cent of ts lead  output, and so on.    Mr. Nazarbayev's official two-day visit to Britain begins  today. He will do his best to sell Kazakhstan to British  business. He is bullish about his country's prospects, and he  fixes the listener with an unwavering eye as he elaborates.    He has been invited by the British Government for his first  official visit since Kazakhstan's independence in 1991. From  the Kazakh -- as from the British -- point of view, the chief  purpose of the visit is economic, furthering trade links between  the two countries.    Mr. Nazarbayev will meet the Queen as well as John Major and  and Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, and will  address the CBI and Chatham House as well as having meetings  with companies interested in Kazakhstan.    Agreements to be signed cover trade and economic  cooperation,  the attraction of investments, and foreign ministry  consultations. An airline agreement and one on avoidance of  double taxation will also be signed.    Mr. Nazarbayev, the former Communist leader of Kazakhstan,  has emerged as the best-known leader of an ex-Soviet Republic  outside Russia.    His policy of opening the way for foreign investment to push  Kazakhstan into a market economy has earned considerable praise  from investors, many of whom find the country an easier place  than Russia in which to operate.    The Central Asian republic presents fewer political and  bureaucratic hurdles than Russia. Mr Nazarbayev is undoubtedly  the boss. His instructions are carried out without the  bickering that Russia's unpredictable politics often entail.    The president outlines four priority areas in which he is  seeking foreign investment .    Foremost is the energy sector, where oil and gas have  already  brought huge outside investments. "We are not seeking any  charity here," he emphasises. "We want to invite foreign  investors for mutually advantageous cooperation."    Second is processing in the agricultural sector. "We are a  huge producer of wool and we want to start a wool processing  industry also. We have cotton, but we do not have mills. We  produce 1.5 million tonnes of meat, but we do not have a meat  processing industry."    The third and fourth priority areas are in the extraction  and  refining of gold and other non-ferrous metals.    "You can't lose. Why don't English companies come and start  working here?" Nazarbayev asks. "They are hesitant to come."    Fourteen British companies are now resident in Alma-Ata, in  addition to 32 joint ventures. This compares with about 50  American and 24 French companies registered in the Republic.    Kazakhstan is forging ahead with an ambitious privatisation  programme which will transfer most of the economy into private  hands within three years. Auctions are due to start next month  to sell about 3,500 medium-sized enterprises to investment funds  into which all citizens can buy with coupons that they get free.  Foreigners are initially excluded, but will be able to buy  shares and assets of privatised enterprises at a later stage.    Foreign companies will be allowed to participate in the  privatisation of 37 large enterprises to be sold on a case by  case basis, the president promises.    Ethnic relations are a possible future problem, since  Kazakhs, a once-nomadic Turkic people, and ethnic Russians each  make up about 40 per cent of the population of 17 million.  Historically, relations between Kazakhs and Russians have been  remarkably good. Economic difficulties have revealed some  tensions in recent months however.</p>

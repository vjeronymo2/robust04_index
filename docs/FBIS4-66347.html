			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Liu Weiling: ``AT&amp;T Inks Two Deals to Supply </F> Equipment'']    [Text] American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) signed  two  contracts over the weekend to supply the most modern  transmission and network management equipment to the Beijing  Telecommunications Administration (BTA). The deals, totaling  more than $20 million, will give the city the largest and most  sophisticated digital transmission network in China. It will  also result in the city having the most advanced network  management capabilities for the surveillance and control of its  entire public telecommunications network.    The sale represents the first time AT&amp;T will supply  high-speed transmission equipment to China since the demise of  the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Control  [COCOM]. The 17-member organization controlled technology  transfer to the East Bloc for 44 years and ceased to exist on  April 1.    Under these contracts, AT&amp;T will supply BTA with two  state-of-the-art systems: SDH (Synchronous Digital Hierarchy)  fibre optic transmission equipment operating at 2.488 Gb/s  (gigabits per second) and a set of advanced network management  and surveillance systems to monitor and manage the  communications network.    With the equipment, Beijing will be able to offer advanced  telecommunications services and have the flexibility to move  forward with new services, according to BTA officials. Zhang  Ligui, Director General of BTA, said the signing of the two  AT&amp;T/BTA agreements signifies that cooperation between  AT&amp;T and  Beijing has entered a new stage.    William Warwick, Chairman of AT&amp;T China Incorporated,  said,  ``We see these projects as an important milestone in building  our relationship with the BTA. This is our first delivery of  SDH technology to China since President Clinton lifted export  controls on high-speed transmission sales,'' Warwick added.    AT&amp;T currently has nine joint ventures in China.</p>

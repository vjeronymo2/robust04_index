			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs up on price hopes The regional electricity (recs) stocks raced ahead as the market responded to hints that the forthcoming pricing review by Offer, the industry regulator, will be much less severe than expected. The recs have sharply underperformed the market this year as investors have unloaded shares after leaks that the regulator was seeking to impose across the board price cuts of 25 to 30 per cent, plus annual price cuts of RPI minus 4 per cent for the next five years. But stories emerged yesterday that Offer had notified the recs by fax with revised proposals for the distribution review, indicating immediate price reductions of 20 per cent with subsequent annual price cuts of RPI minus 3 per cent. Analysts and specialists said the market had shown its appreciation of the regulator's latest stance which, they said, offered good news for consumers and investors. Mr Douglas Falconer, utilities specialist at Yamaichi, the Japanese-owned securities house, said the indications were that the forthcoming review 'is not looking as tough for the recs as had been expected; with the results season to date going as well as it has, the sector should continue to outperform'. At Smith New Court, Mr Kevin Lapwood said he felt confident that the recs could achieve 'real dividend growth of 5 per cent over the next five years'. Midlands Electricity led the sector higher yesterday, finishing 23 ahead at 575p, after the group announced a 16 per cent increase in the dividend total, well up with sector rises to date. London put on the same amount to 562p, as did Manweb, 663p, and Northern, 647p.</p>

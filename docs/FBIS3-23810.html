Really, what does an "average" Armenian know about Georgia? That  during the times of Tigran the Great part of the territory of  modern Georgia was subject to the "king of kings"? That the  ancient Georgian alphabet was invented by a disciple of Mesrop  Mashtone, and Tbilisi was built by Armenians? That Georgians are  noble, gay, careless, and vainglorious people but to this day  have not learned how to really make shish kebab?    And what can the "average" Georgian say about his Armenian  neighbors? That under Queen Tamara Armenia was part of Georgia;  that Armenians constantly lay claim on the great Shota Rustaveli  as their own; that they are calculating, stingy, and cunning  people, and generally, why do they not go back to Armenia?    In reality, however, how rich and interesting are the  interconnections between the two peoples! How many glorious  pages of joint struggle against foreign invaders has their  history registered!    How is it that, surrounded by a hostile Muslim environment,  Orthodox Georgia and Apostolic Armenia have managed to preserve  their language, culture, spiritual values, and faith? This is  the amazing historic phenomenon to which our researchers should  turn their attention first and foremost. We should look for the  roots of the strength of the brotherhood of two peoples, which  has not been weakened over time, in ancient manuscripts and  wonderful samples of miniature painting.    It is not surprising that the news of the collapse of  Armenian statehood was perceived by Georgia with alarm and pain.  The country was losing its ally, protection at the approaches to  its borders. Its hard for many to understand today why Georgian  people extended so much warm and heartfelt hospitality to  Armenians fleeing the devastating invasion of Seljuk Turks. They  settled in one of the plentiful regions in Georgia--Kakhetia,  with its capital of Telavi. And to this day thousands of  descendants of those remote resettlers live and prosper in this  land famous for its wines.    In Tbilisi, which by then was already the main city in the  Transcaucasus, Armenians were greeted with expansive  hospitality. Most of them were merchants, gunsmiths, jewelers,  stone masons, and other craftsmen, which in many respects  contributed to economic progress in Georgia and expansion of its  ties with Asia Minor and then with Russia and West European  countries.    According to the testimony of A.S. Pushkin, who visited the  Russian-Turkish front in 1829, "in Tiflis [Tbilisi] most of the  population is comprised of Armenians: they accounted for up to  2,500 families in 1825. During the current fighting the numbers  have grown. It is estimated that there are up to 1,500 Georgian  families (See "Journey to Erzurum").    Naturally, Armenians made a serious contribution to the  development of the Georgian capital and its cultural life.  Suffice it to mention the Ovnatanyan dynasty of artists, whose  creative life in Tbilisi spanned over 200 years beginning in  1661, when Czar Vakhtang the Sixth invited Nagash Ovnatanyan to  his court. Nagash's grandson Ovtnatan was Irakliy the Second's  court painter. Many people do not know that artist Mikirtum  Ovnatanyan did the murals of the famous Sioni cathedral.    The peasant reform of 1864 sped up the development of  capitalism in the Transcaucasus. Gradually a considerable part  of industry, including oil production, as well as trade became  concentrated in the hands of the Armenian bourgeoisie. This is  when strains appeared in Armenian-Georgian relations. This is  when rivalry developed between the Armenian bourgeoisie and  Georgian nobility, which had a negative impact on interethnic  relations. This period in the life of Georgia has been aptly  portrayed in Tsigareli's comedy "Khanuma."    At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century  Tbilisi developed rapidly, becoming one of the most beautiful  cities in the Russian empire. An enormous contribution in city  planning and development was made by major industrialists and  benefactors Mantashev, Aramyants, Melik-Kazaryan, Bozardzhyan,  and others. Dozens of newspapers, magazines, and books were  published in Armenian; a theological seminary opened. The  national party Dashnaktsutyun was also founded in Tbilisi at the  junction of the two centuries.    At the same time, the changes in social and public life and  the advent of capitalist relations that were basically alien to  the patriarchal way of life could not fail to create fertile  soil for stronger Armenian-Georgian rivalry, which sometimes  assumed acute forms. The behavior of certain strata of the  Armenian population inevitably caused disapproval among the  Georgian public. Some Armenian scholars sometimes committed  missteps by clearly exaggerating the role and place of Armenians  in the history of the Georgian nation.    Neither were some Georgian thinkers particularly noted for  their objectivity. In the most concentrated form this  anti-Armenian mood was expressed by Georgian literary classic  Ilya Chavchavadze. The great poet came out with the book  "Armenian Scholars or Crying Stones," in which he accused  Armenian historians and writers of all mortal sins and insulted  the entire Armenian nation. His sense of proportion  unfortunately failed the great patriot, and his emotions  overrode objective and impartial evaluation. I. Chavchavadze's  book went beyond the bounds of scholarly debate, for which it  was justly criticized by an outstanding scholar, Academician  Nikolay Marr, who was, by the way, a Georgian by his maternal  line.    Armenian-Georgian friendship was put to a severe test in  1918-1920. At the time of Turkish invasion of Transcaucasus in  1918, the Menshevik government of Georgia occupied Loriyskiy  District. Over the period of 1,000 years of neighborly  coexistence between Armenia and Georgia there were no wars--a  unique fact in human history. The Georgian-Armenian war (13-31  December 1918) was provoked from outside, by dark political  forces.    In the 1930's there were quite a few Armenians in top-level  positions in Georgia. Gradually they were replaced by Georgian  national cadres. Unfortunately, ethnic policy in Georgia became  biased with the advent to power of L. Beria, who never hid his  anti-Armenian views.    Nevertheless, we can say that the friendship between the  Georgian and Armenian people withstood the test of time. This is  supported by numerous examples of extending mutual help and  special relations of trust. Armenia will never forget that  during the tragic Spitak earthquake the first help to arrive in  the disaster zone was from Georgia. Probably the only people to  show moral support to Georgia after the bloody events on  Rustaveli Prospect, when Tbilisi residents died of the hand of  brutal soldiers, were Armenians. They embodied their solidarity  in a monument erected in the courtyard of the Armenian church in  Avlabar.    Georgia today is the only route for food and fuel to reach  blockaded Armenia. Some political circles in the region and  outside it are artificially inflaming interethnic strife, using  the complex political situation in the Transcaucasus. And  political instability in Georgia immediately impacts in a most  unfavorable way on Armenia.    Therefore, any misunderstandings that arise must be removed  quickly. This is, by the way, one of the most important and  auspicious tasks of the recently created "Armenia-Georgia"  society.</p>

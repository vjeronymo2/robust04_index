			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie struggles to hold on to 2,900 A FLAGGING performance by the US dollar and dwindling confidence in prospects for a cut in UK base rates took the heart out of the London stock market yesterday. By the close of trading, the FT-SE 100 Index was struggling to hold on to the 2,900 level which was regained only at the beginning of this week, and equities were overshadowed by weakness in stock index futures. The final reading put the FT-SE 100 at 2,900.7 for a loss on the day of 6.9. Early deals saw the index at 2,917 but the 2,900 benchmark crumbled in mid-afternoon as renewed selling of the blue chip drug stocks took its toll. The September contract on the Footsie lost much of its premium over the cash market. However, London rallied towards the close in spite of an early fall of 16 Dow points on Wall Street. Hopes for lower interest rates in the near term were discouraged when the Bundesbank trimmed repurchase rates by only a very modest amount, effectively postponing rate cut expectations for at least a couple of weeks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, although helped by unexpected bid activity among the smaller brewery stocks, finished 2.4 easier at 3,215.5. In addition to the Pounds 214m bid for JA Devenish, the West of England brewer, from Greenalls, the corporate scene was enlivened by wider-ranging financing moves. The decision by Charter Consolidated, the mining and building equipment group, to buy in for Pounds 235.5m the 35.7 per cent stake held by Minorco opened up a range of acquisition possibilities in the London market. Shares in Rothmans International and Dunhill Holdings, the tobacco and luxury goods companies, were suspended as the group proceeded with the planned reorganisation disclosed on the previous day. London traders found encouragement in these large-scale restructuring moves by blue chip international companies. Market indices were hit by the new selling pressure on the blue chip pharmaceuticals which focused on Wellcome. Trading in these traditionally heavy volume stocks lifted Seaq turnover to 601.1m shares, from Tuesday's 587.3m which was worth Pounds 1.28bn in retail value. Non-Footsie business made up around 59 per cent of yesterday's Seaq total. UK stock market strategists remained confident that equities have successfully moved into a new trading range based upon the 2,887 Footsie area. They pointed to the depressive effect yesterday of the setback in pharmaceuticals and other dollar-earning stocks, which had been driving the market ahead in the earlier part of the week. Also indicating underlying confidence were the corporate moves across the range of the market, including the retail-ing sector where hints of enfranchisement of the Great Universal Stores 'A' shares resurfaced. But strategists continued to warn that European economies were showing uncertain trends and that activity in the ERM currencies would make it difficult for rates to be cut in Germany and in the UK. Not all analysts of the UK market have been fully convinced by the stock market's recent advance. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko has predicted that the market may fall back towards Footsie 2,800 over the next few weeks 'as the reality of slower than expected economic recovery materialises'.</p>

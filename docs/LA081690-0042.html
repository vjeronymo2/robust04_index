			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> GREYSTONE'S FUTURE STILL CLOUDED  </P> <P> Another study. Another debate. Another date for Greystone.  </P> <P> After 10 years of struggling over what to do with one of the most lavish  estates ever built in California, Beverly Hills this week began to review a  course outlined in a new study that suggests splitting the colossal mansion  into a multiple-use facility.  </P> <P> But rather than generate new enthusiasm for Greystone's future, the report  served to conjure up the ghosts that have shadowed its past. Local  preservationists and nearby residents criticized the study, saying that the  recommended uses would generate too much traffic, not enough money and few  cultural benefits.  </P> <P> After listening to a presentation Tuesday night of the initial phase of the  $40,000 study by consultant Pannell Kerr Forster, which recommends a  combination corporate conference center and banquet-wedding facility at the  famed Tudor mansion, Greystone Foundation officials again suggested that the  city turn it into a museum.  </P> <P> But for each idea, there was at least one countering view.  </P> <P> "In my estimation, the majority of the residents of Trousdale Estates don't  favor a museum," said Alan E. Berlin, president of the 535-member Trousdale  Homeowners Assn., the group that represents the neighborhood around Greystone.  "But I'm not sure that they would favor a corporate center there either."  </P> <P> Berlin suggested selling the property to a private developer, who could either  renovate the mansion or subdivide the property.  </P> <P> After more than 90 minutes of debate, the council said it would consider moving  on to the next phase of the study at its Sept. 4 meeting.  </P> <P> "I'm afraid a single-purpose use has passed us up," Vice Mayor Vicki Reynolds  said.  </P> <P> The city bought Greystone in 1965 with the intention of preserving it. But for  the last 10 years, the sprawling mansion has sat empty while the city has  struggled to find the best, yet least intrusive, use for it.  </P> <P> Completed in 1928 at the then-staggering cost of $3 million, Greystone was  built for Edward Laurence (Ned) Doheny, son of the first man to strike it rich  in Los Angeles oil. The 55-room, 46,000-square-foot mansion was built of  3-foot-thick concrete walls, covered in stone and roofed with imported Welsh  slate.  </P> <P> But while everyone attests to its magnificence, few can agree on what to do  with it.  </P> <P> Negotiations to lease it for use as a Westside branch of the County Museum of  Natural History collapsed last year after the city decided it would have to  give up too much control over Greystone. Beverly Hills officials say that  museum curators want at least a 35-year lease for the property and to expand  its activities, while the city wants to reduce the effect on nearby residential  neighborhoods.  </P> <P> However, the new consultant says the city can meet all of its cultural,  historical and economic objectives by transforming Greystone into a corporate  meeting center and special-events hall for private parties.  </P> <P> According to Steven Hudson, an official with Pannell Kerr Forster, the  multiple-use designation would raise enough money to pay for Greystone's  renovation costs and not bother residents in the neighboring estates. Hudson  said several city hotels have expressed interest in using the facility as an  executive conference center.  </P></p>

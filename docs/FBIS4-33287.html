			<p>BFN     [Text] Managing and supporting the implementation of the  measures approved by the Council of State to mend the national  economy were the main issues of the fourth Communist Party of  Cuba [PCC] special plenum of Havana. The plenum, chaired by  Jorge Lezcano Perez, first secretary of the PCC in Havana, and  Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, debated  implementation aspects of Decree Law 149 on ill-gotten wealth,  as well as changes in prices and fees, and the illegal purchase  of cars, houses, motorcycles, and other items. Provincial budget  revenues and expenses as well as the results of improved  economic efficiency in agricultural production, and in the  tourism, sugar, and cattle industries were also debated.    Finance and Price Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez addressed the  plenum and affirmed that economic measures would not be levied  on the population alone, but would reach every state entity.    [Begin Rodriguez recording] Work is being done to better  control the hard currency economy in Cuba; a number of decisions  have been made to better control this. Work is being done on the  entire tax policy so that foreign entities working in Cuba or  linked to Cuban capital can contribute their share to the state  in hard currency. [end recording]    During the closing, Jorge Lezcano Perez, first secretary of  the PCC in Havana, pointed out the importance of analyzing the  state budget all the way down to the municipality, and even the  people's council, and stressed the importance of PCC members  explaining every measure adopted to the people.</p>

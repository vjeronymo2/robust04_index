			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Book Review: Alone among the president's men TURMOIL AND TRIUMPH: My Years as Secretary of State By George P Shultz Scribners, Pounds 25.95, 1,184 pages In July 1982, George Shultz assumed office as US secretary of state. Leonid Brezhnev was then general secretary of the Soviet Communist party. Following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the crackdown on Solidarity in Poland in 1981, US-Soviet relations were virtually non-existent. Moreover, the Soviet Union was on the diplomatic offensive, trying to split Nato over deployment of intermediate range nuclear missiles on European soil. And many were questioning the market model for economic development. But when Shultz left office in January 1989 the opening of the Berlin Wall was only months in the future. In Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, Shultz provides an indispensable account covering, occasionally to the point of tedium, those aspects of American foreign policy with which he concerned himself. It is illustrative of how the approach of the US has changed that Shultz, a former Treasury secretary and professional economist, appears virtually to have ignored the economic aspects of international relations. There is an ongoing debate among commentators and scholars about whether the Reagan administration stepped up military spending in order to drive the Soviet Union to bankruptcy. But there is no indication of such a plan in Shultz's memoirs. Indeed, Shultz and the CIA believed an unrestrained arms-race would favour the Soviets. Because Shultz is writing of the end of the cold war, his treatment has been compared with the magisterial account of the beginning of that struggle by Dean Acheson, the most influential secretary of state since the second world war. But the comparison with Acheson's Present At The Creation is unfair to Shultz. For, although his writing is serviceable, Shultz is unable to match the style and sense of drama of his predecessor. During Acheson's period, the US had to develop a wholly new strategy to deal with an expanding superpower. The response included the doctrine of containment, the Marshall Plan and Nato. Shultz dealt with a simpler situation - negotiating the end of a conflict with a declining superpower. Shultz was required not to be creative but to show mastery over competing US agency heads. Once Acheson received Truman's backing, the inter-agency struggle was over. But Reagan's support did not settle a dispute; rival barons would continue their obstruction. In Shultz's portrayal, the chiefs of the various agencies concerned with foreign affairs were, usually, dishonest, cut off from reality, or both. William Casey's CIA was, justifiably, distrusted by Shultz because of its ideological blindness, outright lying and lack of competence. The agency insisted Gorbachev did not want to change the Soviet Union or that, if he did, he could not. The national security adviser, William Clark, is dismissed as having a limited grasp of substance. His successors - first Robert McFarlane, then John Poindexter - are described as having intentionally misled the secretary of state. Caspar Weinberger, secretary of defence, generally opposed all negotiations with the Soviet Union. Contrary to CIA analyses, Shultz believed the Soviet Union was declining and that negotiations with it could be fruitful. The National Security Council staff's answer to the question of contacts with the Soviet Union was 'ever a resounding no'. Shultz considered the president 'a prisoner of his own staff'. Yet Shultz obtained the president's approval for moving forward - over the opposition of that staff, the secretary of de-fence and the director of the CIA. Shultz tempers loyalty to his president with fidelity to the facts. He praises Reagan's 'visionary ideas', such as the strategic defence initiative, but he reveals a detached president, devoid of analytical ability, who believed what he wanted to believe. 'He would go over the 'script' of an event in his mind' and, once that script was mastered, that was the truth; no fact, no argument, no plea for reconsideration could change his mind. A large portion of Shultz's account focuses on the Iran-Contra affair. Here, Shultz is entitled to, and claims, a great deal of credit. There is no doubt he opposed arms for hostages. Almost alone among the president's men, he recognised there had been a 'rogue operation' which posed 'an immense constitutional threat'. Nonetheless, a detailed review in the New York Review of Books concluded that Shultz's account of Iran-Contra was hopelessly 'distorted' and 'untrustworthy'. Charles Hill, Shultz's former executive assistant, in what was surely an authorised response, asserted the reviewer failed to understand 'that Shultz confined his narrative to what he knew or was told at the time and excludes information or any evidence which came to light after a decision or event occurred'. According to Hill, this makes Turmoil and Triumph 'a unique, irreplaceable and unchallengeable historical document, as it reveals a reality that 'memoirs' invariably obscure: decisions of statecraft must be taken on the basis of partial and sometimes erroneous reports'. But the book gives no indication that it is confined to what Shultz was aware of at any given time. If Mr Hill is correct on Shultz's approach, the reader has not been given fair warning that Shultz's account of external events may or may not be accurate. On many occasions Shultz threatened to resign in response to the manoeuvrings and inadequacies of colleagues. But he resisted this grand gesture. We can be grateful that he soldiered on. His judgment was much needed. The author is a lawyer in Washington who served on the National Security Council staff in the Johnson and Nixon administrations</p>

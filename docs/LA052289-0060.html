			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli troops carried out the biggest single roundup of Palestinians during  the 17-month-old uprising in the occupied territories, arresting 250 activists  of Hamas, a Muslim fundamentalist movement. The group's spritual leader, Sheik  Ahmed Yassin, was among those detained in the raid, designed to cut the level  of violence in the Gaza Strip. The army accused Yassin, 51 and confined to a  wheelchair, of ordering anti-Israeli activities, including the killing of  Palestinians suspected of collaborating with Israel. Hamas, Arabic for "zeal,"  is considered the strongest movement in the Gaza Strip.  </P></p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Yorkshire Water raises Pounds 60m through convertible bond issue YORKSHIRE Water, the Leeds- based water and sewerage company, yesterday raised Pounds 60.4m through a senior convertible bond issue, which the company said could be used to fund either its regulated or non-core business. All water companies are assessing their funding needs as borrowings mount because of heavy capital expenditure programmes. Last week North West Water, another of the 10 privatised companies, announced it was saving Pounds 60m to invest in its non-core business through an enhanced scrip dividend alternative. Yorkshire and Thames Water, both of which announced final results yesterday, said they had decided against offering enhanced scrip schemes. Yorkshire's pre-tax profits increased by 12 per cent from Pounds 123.9m to Pounds 138.6m in the year to March 31. Profits were lifted by a Pounds 4.4m gain on the establishment of a joint venture water engineering company. Turnover increased by 9 per cent to Pounds 481.6m due to average price increases of 7 per cent. Squeezed operating costs led to a 19 per cent rise in operating profits of Pounds 148.8m. The company's unregulated businesses, including clinical waste disposal and environmental services, made operating profits of Pounds 2.6m, including property profits of Pounds 1m. Mr Malcolm Batty, finance director, said that the division broke even after financing costs. The interest bill increased sharply from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 13.6m. The company's capital expenditure programme meant net debt rose from Pounds 140m to Pounds 216m, while gearing went up from 13 per cent to 18 per cent. Capital expenditure on Yorkshire's regulated business was stable at Pounds 303m, while spending on the non-core nearly doubled to Pounds 20m. Earnings increased 13 per cent to 65p. Adjusting for the one-off profit from the joint venture, earnings increased 9 per cent. The company recommended a final dividend of 14.2p to make a total of 21.25p, a rise of 9 per cent. The convertible had a maturity of 15 years and a coupon of 6.75 per cent. Baring Brothers, acting as arranger, said demand was strong and the bonds were placed in Europe, especially among Swiss investors. Lex Page 22</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (What It Means To You): Investing institutions hit - Advance Corporation Tax SMALL SHAREHOLDERS may be forgiven for finding themselves bamboozled by the chancellor's reforms to dividends and Advance Corporation Tax. Fortunately, the reforms will be quite painless for most investors. At present, shareholders are paid a dividend net of basic rate tax. For 25 per cent taxpayers that takes care of their full income tax liability, so there is nothing more to pay. From now on, however, the tax credit will be reduced to 20p in the pound. That does not mean, however, that they will have to pay more income tax, because the basic rate of tax on dividends will also be reduced to 20 per cent. So basic rate taxpayers will notice no difference in practice. If they currently receive a 7.5p net dividend, they will continue to receive 7.5p. Higher rate taxpayers will however notice a change. At present, they pay basic rate tax and they later have to pay another 15 per cent to make up their total liability of 40 per cent. When the change occurs, they will only have paid 20 per cent up front, and will have to find an extra 20 per cent later. The overall bill will have increased. Non-taxpayers and investing institutions will also suffer. At present, they can claim back the 25 per cent tax credit. When the system is fully in place, they will only be able to claim the lower 20 per cent credit and will consequently lose out. The change will lower the gross yield on the market and will affect the big institutions. It may diminish their appetite for holding shares and will possibly be reflected by a fall in the stock market. For companies, the change means that they will pay less in ACT and more in mainstream corporation tax, but for a conventional UK company the total tax burden will not alter. They will, however, have deferred paying some ACT at the time of dividends until they are due to pay corporation tax later. That will improve UK industry's cash flow by some Pounds 2bn a year.</p>

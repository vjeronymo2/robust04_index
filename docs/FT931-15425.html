			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Aberdeen chief defends shares buy MR GEORGE ROBB, chairman of Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday defended his purchase of 500,000 of the company's shares following an approach from Bellwether Exploration, the US oil and gas group, which was only disclosed this week. Mr Robb, who became non-executive chairman on January 1, bought the shares between December 24 and January 4 at between 6 3/8 p and 7 1/8 p. Bellwether had proposed an all-paper deal which it claimed would value Aberdeen shares at 10 3/4 p. They closed last night at 8 3/4 p. The chairman said he had consulted the accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, and lawyers Ashurst Morris Crisp, as well as the company before buying the shares. However, action on such advice would not be a defence if the purchase was found to transgress company law. Mr Robb, who has been a director of the company since it was founded in 1981, said he bought the stock in light of the decline in the small oil and gas sector Before the transaction he owned 100,000 shares. He had waited until after a meeting with Bellwether on December 14, when the board of Aberdeen and its advisers decided the merger proposal was 'a non-starter' and did not need to be disclosed. Mr Robb said he had also waited until Aberdeen announced its intentions towards Brabant Resources, the USM-quoted company, which has been the unwilling target of Aberdeen's own merger proposals. When it appeared that Bellwether might make an announcement, Aberdeen drew the Stock Exchange's attention to the already disclosed purchase. Nevertheless, the Stock Exchange is likely to interview Mr Robb, the company and its advisers about the transaction. Mr Robb said he would be happy to co-operate.</p>

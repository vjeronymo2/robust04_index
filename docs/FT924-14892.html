			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / Two die in Guyana election violence ARMED soldiers and policemen patrolled sections of Georgetown, Guyana's capital, yesterday following rioting and looting as votes cast in Monday's presidential election were being counted. Two people were killed and almost 200 arrested in the violence which began when supporters of the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) party attacked the offices of the independent Elections Commission, claiming they were being prevented from voting. The commission's offices were damaged, and mobs then fanned out to other parts of the city and began looting. An attempted attack on the headquarters of the opposition People's Progressive party (PPP) was thwarted when the building was cordoned off by police. Mr Desmond Hoyte, the president, said he 'empathised' with the complaints of his supporters but he did not condone the violence. He then called out the army to support the police. Initial returns yesterday indicated a close race between Mr Hoyte's PNC and the PPP, led by Dr Cheddi Jagan. Mr Hoyte has campaigned on a platform of continued deregulation of the state-controlled economy. Dr Jagan is promising to reduce the pace of deregulation but says he is also keen to encourage foreign investment. The country's racial mix is a significant factor in the politics of the English-speaking republic of 900,000 people. The PNC is generally supported by Afro-Guyanese, while the majority Indo-Guyanese have tended to favour the PPP. The violence has cast doubt on the completion of what is widely held to be the country's first fair elections in thirty years.</p>

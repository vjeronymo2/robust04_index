			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: The shadow of the poll Even without Mr Greenspan's gloomy comments in Tokyo, yesterday's figures for US retail sales and producer prices confirmed that the economy is limping badly. While there is not yet a triple-dip recession, the underlying picture is of very sluggish growth and subdued inflation. That poor economic outlook may well have doomed President Bush's re-election hopes. The markets are certainly beginning to think so. In the wake of the weekend's televised debate, US Treasury bond prices fell on expectations that Mr Clinton would introduce a mildly expansionary fiscal package. However, the decline was limited, perhaps because Mr Clinton's room for manoeuvre is circumscribed by the size of the existing deficit. On fundamental valuations, US shares have looked expensive for almost two years, yet share prices have held up in the permanent expectation of imminent recovery. Com-panies are now starting to report third-quarter earnings, which may once again fall below analysts' expectations. Current estimates put the S&amp;P 500 index on a multiple of some 18 times this year's earnings, and perhaps 17 times earnings in 1993. That is towards the top of historical ranges and, in the continued absence of a strong recovery in consumer spending, shares might finally crack. Perhaps the market believes that some of the fiscal measures suggested by the Democrats, such as investment incentives, may spark growth in the corporate sector, supporting share prices. Given that shares still look expensive, there must be a suspicion that this sanguine attitude would not survive once the full details of a Clinton budget were known. There is still a risk that the long-awaited correction has only been postponed until the New Year.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Georg Fischer stays in the red as sales fall Georg Fischer, the Swiss foundries and diversified engineering group, has reported a 1993 loss of SFr34m (Dollars 24.3m), in line with a forecast made last September, compared with a depressed profit of SFr11m in 1992. The directors are recommending that the dividend be passed for the second consecutive year, but they indicated that the group should make a modest profit this year. Fischer, which is heavily dependent on the motor industry, said its sales fell 15 per cent to SFr2.02bn, mostly because of divestments. Trading profits fell 38 per cent to SFr46m because of the lower sales and squeezed margins. The automotive products group, making castings and components for the motor industry, was the only one to make a profit in 1993. The machine tool division was slimmed down following the closure of the Burkhard und Weber unit. Mr Martin Huber, the chief executive, said that new orders were up 12 per cent so far this year. The piping systems division should return to the black this year and the plant engineering division should break even.</p>

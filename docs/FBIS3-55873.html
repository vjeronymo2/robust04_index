A major task of the parliament upper chamber is the  provision  of efficient interaction between the State Duma, presidential  structures, the government and regions. The chamber should  "connect Russian federal power bodies with the authorities of  territories, regions and republics," he said.    In his turn, Eduard Rossel, staunch advocate of the idea of  the Urals republic and president of the association of economic  interaction of Urals regions and republics, voiced the  expediency of territorial associations in the Federation Council.    In his opinion, they should set up "regional parliament  centers to unite local representatives of the State Duma and the  Federation Council". He said the Urals association has been set  up to include two republics and six regions.    Rossel noted they have not held consultations with other  regions on the creation of similar "parliament centers", but it  is planned to hold a conference of representatives of all  Russian economic associations in February to continue the  creation of similar associations on their basis.    Yuriy Boldyrev, a leader of the Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin  bloc, noted territorial factions will inevitably appear in the  Federation Council due to different interests of republics,  territories and autonomous formations and different political  outlook.    Some deputies sharply criticize the idea of territorial  associations. Nizhniy Novgorod regional governor Boris Nemtsov  said they "pose greater threat than political factions in the  Federation Council". In his opinion, territorial associations  will deteriorate differences between various Russian regions.    Vladimir Shumeyko is negative about the associations.  According to the constitution, the Federation Council shall be  formed with representatives of executive and representative  authorities of federation subjects and "it can include no  factions or associations", he said.    According to Shumeyko, the upper chamber should think of the  way legislation is applied throughout the Russian Federation and  the influence of laws on the fate of regions. Members of the  Federation Council should be responsible people, almost  "senators," stressed Shumeyko.    Chairman of the Central Electoral Commission Nikolay Ryabov  stressed the danger of territorial associations. In his  opinion, federation subjects can settle their differences  through compromises and cited as an example the proposal of  Viktor Stepanov to nominate deputies from republics, regions and  autonomous districts deputies of the Federation Council chairman.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Dollar decline triggers Nikkei loss The Nikkei 225 average lost 1.2 per cent as prices were pulled down by the sharp fall in the dollar, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index was down 232.05 at 19,709.74 after a day's high of 19,969.19 just after the opening and a low of 19,653.03 in the afternoon. The dollar moved below Y104 for the first time since March 4, currency traders fearing that the US government would be dissatisfied with Japan's trade package, which included macroeconomic measures and market opening schemes. Analysts predicted volatility in the dollar/yen market. 'The US is going to maintain pressure on Japan to meet its demands over trade, using the yen as a stick,' said Mr Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities. Volume remained almost flat, at 260m shares. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 16.33 to 1,596.51 and the Nikkei 300 shed 3.39 to 292.47. Declines led rises by 693 to 328, with 148 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 5.21 to 1,309.46. Export oriented high-technology stocks retreated on profit-taking. NEC dipped Y30 to Y1,120 and Toshiba Y20 to Y779. Multimedia and telecommunication related shares were down, with NTT losing Y18,000 to Y914,000. Mining and non-ferrous metal stocks, recently firm on the rise in commodity prices, declined: Dowa Mining relinquished Y25 to Y550 and Nippon Light Metal Y13 to Y617. Ricoh, the high-technology office equipment maker, drew heavy buying, was the most active issue of the day, and rose Y13 to Y838. The group forecast double digit increases in profits for the third consecutive year due to restructuring efforts. In Osaka, the OSE average declined 108.90 to 22,020.61 in volume of 28.3m shares. Roundup A more positive mood pervaded many of the region's markets yesterday. Taiwan was closed for a holiday. HONG KONG ended sharply higher, assisted by a late surge in index futures. The Hang Seng index advanced 283.11, or 3 per cent, to 9,480.14, although turnover contracted from HKDollars 5.2bn to HKDollars 4.5bn. Investors appeared unperturbed by news that measures to cool speculation in the property market would be announced this summer. Among property stocks, Cheung Kong rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 41.50, Sun Hung Kai HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 56 and Henderson Land HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 46. Major banks were strong, with HSBC surging HKDollars 4 to HKDollars 91 and its Hang Seng Bank unit gaining HKDollars 2 at HKDollars 54. SINGAPORE saw bargain hunting after falling in recent sessions. The Straits Times Industrial index rallied 33.79, or 1.6 per cent, to 2,093.72. Brokers said some investors were heartened by reports that Malaysia's Bank Negara will report smaller than expected losses in its foreign exchange dealings. KUALA LUMPUR rebounded on bargain hunting after Monday's 2 per cent decline, but brokers said that sentiment remained nervous. The composite index recovered 10.35 to 961.78. SEOUL eased as banks encountered profit-taking. The composite index lost 7.62 at 875.62 and the financial sub-index shed 10.25 to 1,034.50. MANILA ended higher on buying of major issues.

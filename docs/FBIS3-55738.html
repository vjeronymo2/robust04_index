			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas speaking  at a news conference this morning touched upon the NATO summit  in Brussels, in addition to other issues.    Here is correspondent Audrius Baciulis with a report from  the  news conference and about other events which took place at the  Lithuanian Seimas.    [Baciulis] Algirdas Brazauskas said that today a response is  expected from Brussels concerning Lithuania's wish to join NATO.  He also said that when NATO received the written membership  application from Lithuania, it was immediately disseminated  among all its sixteen members. According to the president, not  all the states had submitted written applications asking to join  NATO.    In the president's view, although there will be no specific  date given from which Lithuania will become member of NATO,  Lithuania nevertheless supports the Partnership for Peace  initiative proposed by the USA which, according to Algirdas  Brazauskas, is a starting point in the process of joining NATO.

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Split over MEP role in Maastricht review: Corfu summit may have to settle the issue after foreign ministers fail to agree European Union foreign ministers were split yesterday on how closely to involve members of the European Parliament in the 1996 constitutional review of the Maastricht treaty. As a result, next week's summit of the 12 heads of government in Corfu will probably have to deal with the issue. In May, the parliament demanded a voice at least equal to that of the European Commission in the 1996 inter-governmental conference as the price of ratifying the accession treaties for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway. The MEPs won promises from Germany, the Benelux countries, the Commission and the current Greek presidency of the EU, that they would be closely involved in the 'committee of experts' which is due to start work in middle of next year to prepare the review. Yesterday, however, the UK and France stuck to the formula foreign ministers agreed in April at Ioannina, Greece, where they also agreed a compromise on the EU voting rights dispute, over which parliament had threatened to reject enlargement and which will be at the heart of the 1996 review. Under this formula, MEPs' constitutional experts would be associated with and could contribute to the group, made up of foreign ministers' representatives, but not be an organic part of it. 'A majority of member states would prefer association,' claimed Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, in order to retain their 'freedom of manoeuvre'. But relegation to second-class status is certain to infuriate most MEPs when the newly-elected parliament assembles in Strasbourg next month. Of the near record 468 MEPs present at May's enlargement vote, 150 voted to postpone ratification until parliament received cast-iron guarantees on the constitutional review. When the ratification vote was taken, 60 die-hards abstained, although they backed EU expansion in principle. But they were joined afterwards by many other leading MEPs, who warned that parliament could use its powers to hold up other EU external treaties in the future unless it was fully involved in preparing the EU's constitutional arrangements.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Chemicals sector hit again CHEMICALS group Courtaulds became the latest victim of brokers' downgrades with James Capel, the leading London institutional broker leading the way, cutting its profit forecasts for the second time in little over a month. Courtaulds shares tumbled 32 to 456p after Capel reduced estimates by Pounds 15m to Pounds 185m this year and Pounds 205m for 1993-4. Other houses, including Kleinwort Benson and BZW, followed suit after talking to the company. Like ICI on Monday, Courtaulds hinted at dismal trading over the past three months - raising the spectre of further downgrades ahead in the chemicals sector. Capel analyst Mr David Ingles said: 'Courtaulds has been experiencing pressures on volume and price across its whole range of businesses, particularly in the last two months. Even after today's fall, the shares are still too high and we foresee weakness up to the interims in November and (the shares) down to around 420p.' However, Mr Martin Evans at Hoare Govett, who earlier this week led the downgrading of ICI, was more bullish. 'Courtaulds is highly operationally geared to any upturn in its key markets. We believe its discount rating to the market more than reflects the current poor trading news and we recommend buying into the present weakness.' Forte sale hope Prospects for interim results today from Forte took on added spice after it emerged that television and leisure group Granada had expressed interest in buying Gardner Merchant, the hotel company's catering subsidiary. The sale of Gardner, which could raise in the region of Pounds 430m, is central to Forte's strategy of expanding its hotel operations in Europe. Forte has been hinting that interim profits may barely exceed Pounds 30m, but some analysts believe such suggestions may be on the bearish side. Yesterday, Forte edged back a half-penny at 135p, with Granada up 4 at 262p. Granada's hints over Gardner Merchant came at private briefings to analysts and brokers. The company said it would consider a move for the catering group should Forte fail in its lengthy attempts to find a suitable buyer, and hope to extract a better price than Forte was currently seeking. Trafalgar active Conglomerate Trafalgar House, whose shares have recently been depressed by financial worries, traded briskly on hints that its Cunard subsidiary was about to sell six ships to P&amp;O. Such suggestions were roundly denied by the company after the market close, but one analyst noted 'such a sale would nevertheless make sense'. The shares closed 5 1/2 better at 60 1/2 p, as turnover rose to 10m shares. Trafalgar was also the subject of two conflicting broker's recommendations. BZW, which lost its position as joint broker of the company last week, was reported to have weighed in with a sizeable profits downgrade, reducing its current year estimate by Pounds 45m to Pounds 60m. The broker was also understood to have concerns regarding the dividend. Morgan Stanley also reduced its current year profits forecast, cutting its figure by Pounds 15m to Pounds 80m. Analyst James Ritchie, however, recommended the stock saying, 'the company is in the process of changing. There will soon be announcements on the (management) succession which will clarify the direction of the company.' He believes the company will pay a covered dividend. P&amp;O closed 7 ahead at 389p, on trade of 5.9m. Burmah Castrol continued to lose ground, unsettled by broker sell recommendations, and the shares slipped a further 7 to 638p. BP came under strong selling pressure during early trading and drifted back to 210p, as at least one influential London broking house detailed the bear case on the stock and recommended a switch into Shell. However, the stock later rallied to close a shade firmer at 214 1/2 p, on active turnover of 12m. Shell were aggressively traded to end a busy session a fraction off at 537p on turnover of 2.7m. The banks endured another painful session, with County's bearish stance on TSB said to have triggered the 4 decline to 129p in the shares after heavy turnover of 5.4m. Lloyds, recently pinpointed by County as a sell, fell away to 438p before rallying and closing marginally higher at 432p on 3.4m traded. Property worries continued to bear heavily on Barclays shares which came under consistent downside pressure to close a further 14 off at 337p on sizeable turnover of 6.4m. HSBC attracted the heaviest turnover(10m) in the high street banks, slipping back to 391p on stories of a Dollars 75m provision taken against one of its US divisions. However it recovered strongly to end the session unaltered at 400p. The recovery was helped by a buy note issued by Smith New Court highlighting the impact on the group of the appreciation of the US dollar and the more favourable macroeconomic environment in the UK. In the broking sector, Hogg Group jumped 14 to 131p, after reaching 134p, as the market expressed its satisfaction at the maintained interim dividend. Sturge followed Tuesday's 7p jump with a further improvement of 10 to 90p, in sympathy with Hogg. Gloom in the property sector was deepened by Scottish Metrolpolitan's decision not to pay a final dividend. The company said: 'In recent months property investment and letting markets have shown marked deterioration, resulting in a further decline in values,' adding that its net asset value had slumped from 145p to 114p in the last year. Some analysts said that the company's spread of assets, mostly commercial lettings split 60:40 between Scotland and England, and positive cash flow might make it an attractive target for other property groups wanting to spread their geographical base. The shares recovered to close 2 off at 24p. Following Sears gloomy results on Tuesday, Great Universal Stores retreated over worries regarding its mail order business. Sears had reported flat trading at its Freemans catalogue subsidiary. GUS 'A' shares lost 33 to 1560p. Sears fell 3 to 77p. In transports, BAA gained 14 to 736p, with UBS Phillips and Drew reported to have shown a keen interest in the shares. Among engineers, TI Group fell 20 to 270p, after Kleinwort Benson downgraded current year profits forecast. The stock was further weakened by fears of provisions at the Dowty Group subsidiary. The first signs of renewed confidence at British Aerospace were seen yesterday following Tuesday's long meeting with analysts. The shares bucked the poor market trend to end 10 up at 128p.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Yasuhiro Nakasone predicted Tuesday [24 May] that Japan will  face "a political upheaval" in July after the passage of the  full fiscal 1994 state budget and the Group of Seven (G-7)  summit in Naples, Italy.    He said in an address to a Japan-China forum that Japan  needs  to shift from the unstable minority administration of several  coalition partners.    But Nakasone, who was prime minister from 1982 to 1987,  forecast that Japan will not return to the "pre-Hosokawa" era of  government run solely by the Liberal Democratic Party, of which  he is still a member.    Last summer then Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's  coalition  government ended the LDP's 38-year uninterrupted rule.    Nakasone called on North Korea to help end a dispute over  its  suspected nuclear arms program, saying a peaceful settlement of  the problem would facilitate the start of normalization talks  and economic exchanges between Japan and North Korea.</p>

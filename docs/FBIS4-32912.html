			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Seven O'Clock Newscast"] </F>   [Text] No elections have ever been so well protected in the  country. At least, this is what the defense minister, who has  set up a communications network throughout the country, has  planned. The government has increased its military presence in  the country's most conflict-ridden areas to prevent guerrilla  threats from hampering Sunday's elections.    [Begin Defense Minister Rafael Pardo Rueda recording] The  Armed Forces are present at every municipality seat.  Approximately 88 percent of the voting sites are covered, also.  The Armed Forces are present at every location with more than  three voting sites. This protection of the election process by  the Public Force has been the most complete in the country's  history. [end recording]    The minister said the Army's presence on the streets of  Santa  Fe de Bogota is due to the election process and not to the  capital's security problems.    [Begin Pardo Rueda recording] The Army can cooperate with  the  police in the latter's work but cannot replace it. [end  recording]    For election day, a communications system has been set up  which will make it possible for authorities to act quickly and  effectively if necessary.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Probe on bread price rebuffed The Office of Fair Trading has rebuffed pressure from MPs to launch a formal inquiry into the price of bread in Northern Ireland, David Owen writes. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, told the Commons Northern Ireland committee he had 'not yet been given a reason to believe' that the price differential between the province and the rest of the UK was 'likely to be attributable to an abuse of a monopoly position or to some particular anti-competitive practice'. But in a letter to Sir James Kilfedder, committee chairman and Ulster Popular Unionist MP for North Down, Sir Bryan said he had asked officials to 'make further inquiries bearing in mind my functions under competition legislation'. The recently established Commons committee wrote to the OFT earlier this month to express its concern about the issue. The letter followed an appearance before the committee by the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland. According to the council, a large loaf costs on average up to 40 per cent more in Ulster than in mainland Britain and the difference has increased since 1989. It says the bread market in the province is dominated by three bakeries.</p>

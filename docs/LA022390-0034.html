			<p><P> February 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> MASSACHUSETTS;  </P> <P> LIMITS ON CLINIC PROTESTERS REINSTATED  </P> <P> Massachusetts' highest court reinstated an order barring demonstrators from  blocking abortion clinics, but the group Operation Rescue said it will obey a  "higher law" and continue to protest. The Supreme Judicial Court ruled 4 to 1  that the injunction places only minimal limitations on protesters and does not  threaten their First Amendment rights. A spokeswoman for Operation Rescue,  which has staged several protests at clinics, said her anti-abortion group will  continue its activities.  </P></p>

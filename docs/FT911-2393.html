			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Equal opportunities staff 'among the most stressed' EQUAL opportunities person-nel, who have the task of implementing policies on race, sex and disability within organisations, are among the most stressed of all occupational groups, according to a survey published today. Above-average levels of physical ill health were found in 90 per cent of equal opportunities managers and their staff, and nearly 75 per cent showed above-average levels of mental ill health, the study by occupational psychologists found. More than 30 per cent of EO workers saw no career development if they stayed in the field and nearly 23 per cent indicated that they wanted to leave their present employers. Pearn Kandola Downs, the group of psychologists that carried out the survey, found the greatest sources of stress were lack of clarity about job function and interpersonal relations, particularly in dealing with people who may feel threatened by EO policies.

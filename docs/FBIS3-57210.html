He noted in his opening speech that the conference should  now  devote special attention to the problems of food supply,  distribution of productive forces, and the development of the  region's agroindustrial complex. According to Chernomyrdin, the  state programme for reviving central Russia would be drawn up on  the basis of the proposals advanced by regional leaders during  the current one-day conference.    Head of the Orel regional administration Yegor Stroyev drew  special attention in his report to the need of urgently solving  the problem of the disparity of prices for agricultural goods,  industrial products, and energy carriers. He said "it will be  difficult to feed our country" without developing the national  economy of central Russia. Stroyev pointed out that the  region's economic problems could be resolved primarily by  settling the demographic problem, creating motivations for  productive labour, "otherwise the demographic crisis on the  territory of Russia proper will become irreversible".</p>

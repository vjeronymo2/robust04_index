			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The ERM and Britain: Uncertainty for homeowners until after French vote HOMEOWNERS will probably have to wait until next week to see if the rise in official interest rates is translated into costlier mortgages. Building societies seem to be waiting until after Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht before deciding. The hope is that the jump to a higher level will be temporary and that the mortgage rate will not have to follow suit. Societies are well aware that a rise in rates would further damage the already feeble housing market and intensify bad debt. The main reaction from some lenders was to withdraw offers of fixed-rate mortgages below 10 per cent. Those tend to be funded by borrowing in the wholesale markets and thus quickly become unprofitable when rates rise. Savers might benefit from higher interest rates but will have even longer to wait. Building societies are traditionally slower to raise rates for savers than for borrowers. Given that societies have been complaining about pressure on their margins, an increase in savings rates may be limited. But investors may be able to look forward to increased income from fixed-rate products such as guaranteed income bonds and annuities. Rates on such products are determined by gilt yields, which rose yesterday. Most banks will not decide whether to raise mortgage rates and other 'managed' interest rates for personal customers and small businesses until financial markets stabilise. NatWest and Barclays may decide in the next two days, although Lloyds said it would not alter rates until after the French referendum. Bank loans linked directly to base rates rose by at least 2 percentage points yesterday. The American Life company raised its rate on a one-year Pounds 50,000 guaranteed income bond from 8.5 per cent to 9.3 per cent yesterday. But Mr Colin Jackson of Baronworth Investment Services said he was advising clients to sit tight until next week. Private investors do not seem to have been panicked into selling equity holdings. Fidelity Stockbrokers said its volumes were up substantially, but as many small investors were buying as selling. Sharelink also reported a busy day - with more buying than selling in the afternoon. Mr James Higgins of financial advisers Chamberlain de Broe, said: 'Private investors can't move fast enough to take advantage of these markets, so they shouldn't try. 'You should have paid off your overdraft by now, but cut down on credit card and other borrowings.'</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Going down in flames: Europe The sensational collapse in popular support for the governing Socialist party in the French regional elections a week ago has opened up a national political crisis to which there is no obvious solution. There is no obvious solution because the acuteness of the apparent crisis, as expressed in the violent dislocation of voting patterns, seems irrational and disproportionate, in relation to the observable facts in the real world. It is common to explain the election result as a classic protest vote. Circumstances conspired to turn the minor event of the elections to 22 regional councils into a national test of opinion, with the maximum scope for free expression, in the therapeutic or play-group sense of the term. The voters were angry about unemployment, or immigration, or Europe, or the financial scandals in the political parties; so they let rip with infantile ill temper and disillusionment. Yet the intensity of this French protest seems out of all proportion with what they have to protest about. The vote implies that France is the worst governed country in Europe; in fact the French are as well governed as anyone, and better off than most. In economic management terms, the Socialists' recent record is more than honourable. French economic growth is significantly better and more consistent than Britain's, French inflation is regularly much lower, and France is much more prosperous. No one would deny the pain of high and rising unemployment; but French unemployment is in the same ball park as Britain's. The same goes for immigration. The school system is vastly superior, and the health system is ruinously luxurious. In comparative terms, France's problems simply do not justify this degree of anguish. Some French analysts have taken a stern moral line. Some of them blame the politicians: the French voted to reject all the traditional parties of government, because they are nauseated by the stench of corruption. Others blame the French people: the scandalous National Front vote marks the French as the black sheep of Europe, in the same shameful league as the Austrians. Neither thesis will quite do. A Figaro exit poll said that many more people (41 per cent) were influenced by their revulsion at the political scandals than by high unemployment (24 per cent). But a Liberation poll said unemployment was the top factor for 38 per cent, while the scandals only influenced 12 per cent. You pays your money . . . The thesis of a rotten streak in the French body politic is troubling. History testifies to a resilient extreme right-wing strand in France; there have also been periods of violent anti-Semitism and xenophobia. These two tendencies reached a shameful acme in the Second World War, when Vichy France fell over itself to co-operate with the Nazis. But to infer from last week's elections that there is a moral flaw in the heart of France is going too fast. The National Front vote is a symptom of political disturbance: it does not mean France is going fascist. More than 40 per cent admit to racist feelings; yet France is clearly ashamed of half-buried memories of episodes in its history, and it is striking how often the media dig up skeletons, such as the practice of torture in the Algerian war, or the brutal deportation of Jewish children to Germany in the Second World War *, manifestly for purposes of expiation. The central revelation of the election is the collective rejection of all the traditional parties of government. All polls say that French politicians seem aloof and elitist, talking a wooden, bureaucratic jargon. Their corruption may be distasteful; what is really alienating is their self-satisfied Parisian remoteness. But the politicians' failure lies more in their policies than in their style. The Socialists have abandoned socialism; they have yet to devise a new message. The conservatives have only one message: Get Rid of the Socialists. The reasons for this policy vacuum lie in the European Community. Macroeconomic policy, the traditional centre-piece of political debate, whether in a left-right context or in a Keynesian-classical dialectic, has been removed from the control of national politics. Mainline French politicians scarcely discuss economic policy, because there is nothing much left to discuss. As a result, the Community has shaken the perceived political legitimacy of the nation state. This is especially destabilising in France, which is founded on an intensely normative image of the commanding state and the integrationist republic. Last Sunday, 27.2 per cent voted against Europe, or 41.1 per cent if you include the ecologists. President Francois Mitterrand will go down in history as a great European. But he will go down in flames at home, unless his party can devise a new political message which recreates national legitimacy in a European context. And the first priority in that message will be a plausible answer to unemployment; socialism may be discredited, but the Community will not last long if unemployment is once again regarded as an Act of God or of Adam Smith. *Sans Oublier Les Enfants, Eric Conan, Grasset 1991, FFr98.</p>

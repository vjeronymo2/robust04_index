			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / World Trade News: Poland seeks accord with Fiat Poland is hoping that a final agreement with Fiat the Italian car maker, on a joint venture with the FSM car factory can be signed later this month after the Easter holiday, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Mr Andrzej Olechowski, finance minister, who led the Polish negotiating team in a day of talks with Fiat on Monday, said later that 'notwithstanding unforseeable events' a contract should be signed then. Talks on the joint venture have dragged on for months over differences on valuing the heavily indebted FSM plant which is now the sole producer of Fiat's new Cinquecento model. The Polish government has offered to write off the company's huge domestic debt but there is still a loan valued at in excess of DM1bn (Pounds 352m) to be paid off arising from the Cinquencento development originally agreed in 1987. The Poles have been arguing that the 160,000 Cinquecento cars, to be produced this year under an accord signed with the then communist government, are losing FSM money. They have also urged Fiat to take on at least part of FSM's foreign currency debt before taking a 51 per cent share in the new company.</p>

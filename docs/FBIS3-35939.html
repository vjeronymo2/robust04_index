			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, January 21, RIA -- The West's position on  former Yugoslavia does not correspond to Russia's interests in  the Balkan region in everything, Vladimir Lukin, the chairman of  the State Duma Committee on International Affairs, told a RIA  correspondent.    Russia's interests, in his opinion, are met more by the  maximum strongest Serbia in the peaceful solution of all  problems linked with the settlement of the conflict in former  Yugoslavia.    Parliamentary hearings on former Yugoslavia were held in the  State Duma today, during which Russian deputies were addressed  by Sergey Lavrov, the Russian deputy foreign minister.    He confirmed Russia's intention not to support the idea of  dealing an air strike at the positions of Bosnian Serbs.    "Although the Russian Foreign Ministry is on the correct  road  now, still the report by the deputy foreign minister on the  Yugoslav issue was not quite self-critical," believes Lukin.    Russia's Foreign Ministry, in his opinion, made a serious  mistake in the past by backing U.N. Security Council sanctions  against former Yugoslavia despite objections of the former  Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation.    The committee chairman criticised an argument by the  Liberal-  Democratic Party of Russia on the need to withdraw all foreign  army contingents from former Yugoslavia.    "This may intensify the conflict, since restraining elements  will be absent", he noted.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. The Proposed Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These proposed regulations consist of a subpart of general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicability (subpart A) and one subpart that sets forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific additional provisions for raw molluscan shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (subpart C). The agency is also setting forth guidelines, in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form of appendices, that will provide assistance to processors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cooked, ready-to-eat products (Appendix A), and to processors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scombrotoxin forming species (Appendix B), on how to meet various  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in subpart A relating to the development and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of HACCP plans. The products addressed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines involve special considerations or special hazards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which additional guidance would be useful. Processors and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importers that follow these guidelines will increase the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likelihood that FDA will find their preventive controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acceptable. FDA requests comments on the need for, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substance of, the guidelines that it has set forth. Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should address whether it would be more appropriate for FDA to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopt the guidelines as regulations. If the comments provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> convincing basis for doing so, FDA will include some or all of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the guidelines in the regulations in any final rule that results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is also including a guideline on how to ensure product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity relating to economic adulteration (Appendix D). FDA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including this guideline because economic adulteration is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular problem in the seafood industry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Appendix 1 to this document, FDA is also providing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples from a package of general guidance, to be published  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separately, for processors to use in understanding and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing HACCP principles in their operations. One of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> samples is specific guidance on the processing of smoked and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smoke-flavored fish. FDA requests comments on whether the latter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance should remain as such, be provided as guidelines in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appendix to the regulations, or be made mandatory by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorporating them into any final rule that results from this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The agency is relying generally on the definitions contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the act, in the umbrella good manufacturing practice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines in part 110, and in other agency regulations. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency is using these definitions because it considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency in how it uses terms in its regulations to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary and appropriate. Thus, &sect;123.3(o) is derived from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;113.3(s), and &sect;123.3(r) is derived from &sect;110.3(q).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additional definitions are proposed in &sect;123.3 that are specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the proposed HACCP program for fish and fishery products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

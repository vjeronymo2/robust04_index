			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Eating seaweed and submarines - Moves in Tokyo to promote the humble sandwich For the average Tokyo office worker, lunch is an obento, a lacquered box with quaint little compartments housing a pile of pickled vegetables, salted salmon, dried seaweed and a slice of bamboo shoot, with rice and maybe a fermented bean soup. The brown-bag luncher does exist, but the humble sandwich has an image problem, as the fillings are bland and the bread is often too sweet. However, Suntory, the brewer, and Subway, the US submarine sandwich chain, last week launched a venture to make the gourmet sandwich socially acceptable in Japan. Suntory was inspired by the scent of large profits in a still expanding fast food market. US chains, including McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, have long been catering to changing Japanese tastes, while local competitors have crowded into the market, including DomDom, MosBurger, Lotteria, Love, Bikkuri Donkey, and First Kitchen, a burger chain also run by Suntory. Across the industry, sales grew by an estimated 11 per cent last year, but profits were only 2.9 per cent higher, reflecting rising personnel and advertising charges. The intense competition has prompted companies to experiment with lunch and evening menus. McDonald's is now running a Chinese dim sum special called McChao, and the other chains are offering 'healthy burgers' on rice-based buns, and a burger version of the traditional crumbed pork cutlet. Suntory's purchase of the Subway franchise followed inadvertent test marketing of the product in Guam and Hawaii, where Japanese tourists showed a liking for the submarine sandwiches which, in Tokyo, range from the Cold Cut Combo at Y690 (Pounds 3) to the Subway Club, with roast beef, turkey, ham and assorted vegetables, at Y900. The first of five Subway stores opened last week on a former First Kitchen site in Akasaka, a central Tokyo office and nightlife district. The competition is close by, with a McDonald's across the street, four noodle stores within a minute's walk and a First Kitchen outlet two minutes away. One of the most controversial points of the fast-food debate is whether western ingredients need to be tailored to suit the prejudices of the Japanese palate. Fred Deluca, the founder and president of Subway, which has about 6,300 franchised outlets internationally, said that the subs served in Tokyo are exactly the same as would be bought in a New York store. 'We don't want to try to second guess the market. We are selling exactly what we sell elsewhere. We were pretty confident that Japanese would try the product and like it. 'Japanese tourists in Hawaii and Guam seemed to like the freshness and the fact that the sandwich is made in front of you. We have been helped by McDonald's. They have educated people how to eat with their hands.' The decor of the Tokyo store is similar to other Subway outlets, although a standard mural failed to meet Tokyo fire codes. The stores require less space than a conventional burger restaurant, an important consideration given Tokyo land prices. A second reason for embracing the sandwich is that Japan's service sector is still short of workers and Subway will allow a cut in staff by a third from a First Kitchen store of the same size. In the US, Subway stores with a high turnover generally use a production-line method, with one staff member cutting the bread and others responsible for meats or lettuce. Low-volume outlets have one staff member make the sandwich and serve it. However, Jotaro Fujii, president of Subway Japan and an architect of the 82-restaurant First Kitchen chain, chose the latter method even though the Akasaka store has a high turnover. He reasoned that Japanese shoppers like attention. The continuous contact with one assistant allows a polite greeting and a short conversation during the making of the sandwich. While the Subway store and the previous First Kitchen store both serve fast-food, there has been a sharp turnaround in the ratio of take-aways to eat-in business. At the First Kitchen store, about 60 per cent was eat-in, but for Subway the figure is 25 per cent. The dual personality of the Akasaka area works in its favour. The lunchtime office demand is strong, and the district is a famed bar and entertainment area, creating demand until late into the evening. Apart from displacing the obento lunch, Fujii would like a submarine sandwich to replace the steamed rice and raw egg breakfast. 'We are encouraging people to have a sandwich before they start drinking in the evening, and then to buy a Subway sandwich on the way home. In the morning, when they are in a hurry, they can eat the sandwich and then go to work.'</p>

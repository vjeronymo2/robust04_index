			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Observer: Low interest Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor, influences interest rates but even he can't offer the sort of deal West Bromwich Building Society currently has. The West Brom is giving a BSkyB satellite dish plus a year's free subscription (worth about Pounds 450) to everyone who takes out one of its discount mortgages. Glenn Elliot, West Brom's chief executive, hails from Perth in Australia. There it's common practice to give away things like solar panels with mortgages. 'But solar panels probably wouldn't go down too well in Britain' says the man from West Brom.</p>

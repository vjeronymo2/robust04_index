			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / International Company News: Tenneco moves back to the black TENNECO, the US conglomerate in the throes of restructuring, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 35m, compared with a net loss of Dollars 26m in the same period of 1991. Operating performance was better at all the group's six divisions, although its J. I. Case farm and construction equipment business remained in the red. The net income figure, which worked through at 21 cents a share, against a loss of 24 cents a year ago, included an extraordinary loss of Dollars 12m, while the 1991 period involved a Dollars 5m loss from discontinued operations. Net income from continuing operations was Dollars 47m, compared with a loss of Dollars 204m. The company's improvement dates from the arrival of Mr Michael Walsh, who took over as chief executive at the start of last year. Mr Walsh, who revealed last month that he was suffering from a brain tumour, said the 1992 turnround was 'but the first phase of a long-term transformation of this company'. For the year as a whole the group produced net income of Dollars 292m, or Dollars 1.92 a share, including a gain from discontinued operations of Dollars 71m and a Dollars 12m extraordinary loss. In 1991, it lost Dollars 732m, or Dollars 6.09, including restructuring charges, gains on asset sales and a Dollars 40m loss from discontinued operations. The natural gas pipeline operations reported fourth-quarter operating income of Dollars 111m, up from Dollars 99m, excluding a gain on asset sales. The improvement was due to increased volumes, higher rates on the pipeline system and cost controls. Case narrowed its fourth-quarter loss to Dollars 94m, compared with a loss of Dollars 227m in the same period of 1991, despite a 32 per cent cut in production levels. The company attributed this to the fact it had stopped being the industry's leading discounter, while also making continued cuts in operating costs and headcount.</p>

			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POPE PLEADS FOR RIGHT TO A SAFE ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> Pope John Paul II called today for a global commitment to save the Earth from  ecological devastation and said a safe environment should be part of a new  Charter of Human Rights.  </P> <P> In the first papal document exclusively devoted to ecology, the Pope declared  that the root cause of environmental problems in industrialized countries was  greed, selfishness and disregard for nature.  </P> <P> He said the issue "lays bare the depth of man's moral crisis." Its only lasting  solution was to abandon a life style of "instant gratification."  </P> <P> His remarks were contained in a 12-page message called "Peace with God the  Creator, Peace with All of Creation," issued for the Roman Catholic Church's  World Day of Peace Jan. 1.  </P> <P> The message, the Pope's most powerful remarks ever on the environment, included  issues such as deforestation, fossil fuels, industrial waste and the ozone  layer.  </P> <P> The yearly peace message, sent to world organizations and heads of state, was  printed in Russian for the first time. The Pope met Soviet President Mikhail S.  Gorbachev last Friday.  </P> <P> The pontiff said industrialized countries had no right to demand restrictive  environmental standards from developing countries unless they first applied  those standards themselves.  </P> <P> There has been heated debate between advanced countries and the Third World  over issues such as deforestation and the use of ozone-depleting  chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).  </P> <P> Using technical language not usually found in church documents, the Pope said  the depletion of the ozone layer and the resulting "greenhouse effect" had  reached crisis proportions because of industrial growth and vastly increased  energy needs.  </P> <P> Scientists say that unless there is a halt to the erosion of the ozone layer,  which filters out the sun's harmful rays, the polar ice caps could melt.  </P> <P> A safe environment "is ever more insistently presented today as a right that  must be included in an updated Charter of Human Rights," he said in a reference  to the 40-year-old U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  </P></p>

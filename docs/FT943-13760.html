			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: New York A year ago, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, warned Congress in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony that interest rates were probably too low, and that it was likely the Fed would have to tighten monetary policy to prevent inflationary pressures from building up. On Wednesday, Mr Greenspan returns for another Humphrey-Hawkins session and some analysts believe he may issue a similar warning about interest rates. Although the Fed has raised interest rates four times in the past year, the strength of the US economy continues to surprise observers, including those at the central bank. Consequently, trading on the bond market today and tomorrow should be cautious, with most dealers and investors likely to stay on the sidelines until Mr Greenspan heads for Capitol Hill. Wednesday will be particularly tricky for the market, with two Treasury auctions of two-year and five-year notes also scheduled. If they go poorly, it will bode ill for the auctions of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds due later in the refunding round. If Mr Greenspan suggests on Wednesday that further rate rises are in the pipeline, the ground earned last week could be quickly given up, sending the 30-year yield - currently at 7.5 per cent - back above 7.7 per cent again.</p>

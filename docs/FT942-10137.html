			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Naval dockyards advertised for sale The Ministry of Defence is today advertising the Devonport and Rosyth naval dockyards for sale in the national press. The ministry said it had taken the unusual step of advertising in the national press to gain interest from as wide a group of potential purchasers as possible. Most MoD contracts are advertised in the ministry's contracts bulletin. It was intended that the sale should be more like a conventional privatisation than most other ministry tenders. The MoD is initially inviting companies to register an interest, before May 27, in buying the two yards, and a formal invitation to tender will then follow. A trade sale direct to the private sector is expected to be completed by 1996. Detailed negotiations are likely in coming months over the assets likely to be included in the package, as well as the liabilities any acquiring company would have to take on. These would include how much land is included in the sale of the two yards, responsibility for any environmental liabilities, and the cost of any redundancies. The two yards are run under management contracts. Rosyth, in Fife, is run by Babcock Thorn; and Devonport, in Plymouth, is run by DML Management. Most redundancy costs are met by the ministry. Issues such as who would be responsible for any future redundancy costs will be central to the negotiations. As well as the incumbent management teams, several other companies are thought to be interested in buying the yards. British Aerospace, GEC, and VSEL are all potential bidders - both GEC and VSEL already own construction yards. Devonport recently won the contract to refit all of Britain's nuclear submarines after a fierce two-year battle with Rosyth. In the subsequent arguments over the yard's future, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, awarded Rosyth a large package of surface ship work. While both yards have work for the rest of the decade, analysts question whether the reduction in the size of the Royal Navy will leave sufficient work for both yards in the long term. Devonport is known to be short of work on surface ships, having recently completed a refit of the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious. It is expected to announce about 500 job losses in support and administration personnel in the next few weeks. Some surface ship workers are also likely to go. Analysts believe that further cuts in the workforces are almost inevitable, and that one of the yards may eventually close.</p>

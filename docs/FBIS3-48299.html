It has been learned that the frequency of noise in 1993 was  significantly lower than in the previous year.    The Kadena Town government uses a gauge set up on top of the  town hall building to monitor the frequency of noise over 70  phons lasting more than 5 seconds. Data from the monitoring  effort for 1993 has been compiled recently.    According to the statistics, noise was recorded 19,069 times  last year, more than 3,000 times less than the 22,746 times  recorded in 1992. Kadena Town's records show that noise was  recorded more than 38,000 times at its peak in 1984, and the  frequency of noise has been declining since then.    Regarding the improvement in the frequency of noise, the  Kadena Town government says that one of the reasons might be the  departure of 18 F-15 fighters based in Kadena by December 1992.    Seiyu Nakamura, vice chairman of the plaintiffs' group in  the  Kadena noise case, where a verdict is expected on 24 February,  says: Although the frequency of noise monitored has declined  numerically, we do not actually feel any improvement. The  adverse effect on our daily life remains the same.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by Warsaw TV Polonia Network in Polish] </F>   [Text] [Announcer Jaroslaw Gugala] A private meeting  between Polish and Russian Foreign Ministers Andrzej Olechowski  and Andrey Kozyrev has taken place in the Polish Embassy in  Moscow without the presence of journalists. Minister Olechowski  believes that the eastern policy is one of the most important  tasks of Polish diplomacy.    [Correspondent Witold Laskowski, Television Information  Agency (TAI), Moscow, identified by caption] The meeting was a  of a purely private character, but both politicians had time to  discuss Polish-Russian relations. It is known, among other  things, that, in June, Poland will be visited by Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin, and we can expect the visit of Boris Yeltsin  himself to attend ceremonies commemorating the 50th anniversary  of the Warsaw Rising on 1 August.    Minister Olechowski confirmed Andrey Kozyrev's international  reputation of, as he put it, a splendid interlocutor. In the  opinion of the head of our diplomacy, there is a good climate  for pushing matters ahead in Polish-Russian relations. We agree  with the Russians regarding the objective of Europe without  frontiers, the only difference being that we want to achieve  this by joining NATO, and the Russians see everything  differently.</p>

A meeting of the Tamil Nadu vidhan sabha members has been  called for 30 December 1993 to discuss continuation of the  present legislation. However, K. Ramamurthy, the state Congress  Committee president, has expressed doubt over the government's  intentions while referring to the Constitution's article 31 (B)  or 31 (C).    It is not clear yet which of these articles does the state  government want to implement when continuing the present  reservation system. It should be remembered that the Supreme  Court had decided on the Mandal Commission that reservations  cannot exceed 50 percent in any case. The state government is  forced to go through this constitutional exercise because of  this decision.    Chief Minister Jayalalitha had called a meeting of all the  political parties on 26 November and had discussed following the  Supreme Court's decision. At the same time, they supported  keeping the state's 69 percent reservation quota.    As the result of this all, the government is using these two  articles as an alternative, and has obtained the president's  approval so that the Center does not block the effort to make  the present reservation system constitutional.</p>

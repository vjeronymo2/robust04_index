			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As amended, the criteria provide that the ``Star of Life''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be used on emergency care vehicles that either meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal specifications or are authorized to be used for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency responses by a State or Federal agency. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to provide that the symbol may be used to indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the location of and access to qualified emergency medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria clarify that the ``Star of Life'' may be worn  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or used on patches, badges, lapel pins and other similar items  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by persons who have completed training and are authorized by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State or Federal agency to provide EMS care and by persons who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by title and function are involved in the administration or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supervision of or otherwise participate in an EMS system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As explained above, the criteria have been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the ``Star of Life'' may be used to inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers of medical conditions (such as diabetes) or to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identify appropriate treatment (such as DNR), in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with programs established by the State or Federal agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria continue to provide that the symbol may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used on EMS training materials, other materials (such as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letterheads and publications) having direct EMS application,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical equipment and supplies intended for use by EMS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> providers and by entrepreneurs engaged in the production or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of these items.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to the appearance of the ``Star of Life,'' the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications continue to include a sample of the registered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> blue ``Star of Life'' symbol and to identify the color of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> symbol and its dimensions. The criteria, as amended, indicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that deviations in size may be made, provided they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proportionate, and that other deviations may be made, provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they create the same commercial impression created by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered mark. Deviations which change the basic, overall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial impression created on the public are not permitted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The criteria continue to provide instructions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including the symbol to show that the ``Star of Life'' is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered certification mark. They have been amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that some manner of demarcation should be used on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patches, lapel pins and other similar items to distinguish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the person wearing such item is an EMS provider or an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual involved in the administration or supervision of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EMS system. Provisions that attempted to detail the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appearance of the ``Star of Life'' for these and other uses have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A to this notice contains the revised criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and specifications for the Use of the ``Star of Life'' Symbol.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued on: August 5, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Michael Brownlee,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Associate Administrator for Traffic Safety Programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

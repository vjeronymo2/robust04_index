			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto held wide-ranging  talks with German leaders on various issues and informed them  that bilateral talks between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir  dispute will not succeed until international pressure is mounted  on India in this regard. According to Foreign Secretary  Najmuddin Sheikh, the prime minister informed the German leaders  that Pakistan is not against bilateral talks, but our  experiences from previous rounds of talks show that India is  neither serious nor sincere in finding an acceptable solution to  the Kashmir dispute. The prime minister said the German leaders  greatly appreciated Pakistan's efforts to establish peace in  Bosnia. She held detailed talks with Carl-Dieter Spranger,  German minister of economic cooperation, on financial assistance  to Pakistan. The German financial assistance and technical  expertise will greatly help in overcoming the energy crisis in  Pakistan. The prime minister stressed the need for changing the  strategy on providing German economic assistance in order to  make part of it available for annual development programs which  will help implement welfare and development programs. The  German minister informed Benazir Bhutto that his government has  initiated steps under which a private company will provide [word  indistinct] protection for German investment in Pakistan.    Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto returned to Islamabad early  this morning after her four-day official visit to Germany. When  she left Berlin for home yesterday evening, she was accorded an  extremely dignified send-off. [passage omitted]    Radio Pakistan's representative says the most important  objective of the prime minister's visit to Germany was to  acquire technical and financial assistance for welfare and  development programs of the present government and to muster  support and cooperation for Pakistan's stance on regional and  international issues, including Kashmir, Bosnia, Afghanistan,  and Tajikistan; there has been considerable success in achieving  that objective. A high-level delegation of the German  parliamentary Economic Committee will soon visit Pakistan to  review development needs. Chancellor Kohl assured Benazir  Bhutto that this committee and the ministries concerned will  seriously consider her suggestions in order to give a positive  response to them as soon as possible.    Radio Pakistan representative Yunus Khokar says the visit  has  created a better understanding between Germany and Pakistan on  the Kashmir issue and effectively exposed the human rights  violations and Indian atrocities in Kashmir, which in turn has  created sufficient sympathy from the German leaders and people  to Pakistan's stand on Kashmiri people and the Kashmir issue.  There was total coordination on the views and stand of the two  countries on the Bosnian issue and lifting of the arms embargo  against the Bosnian Government to enable it to defend its people  against the savage Serb attacks. Germany lauded Pakistan's  efforts for peace and normalizing the situations in Afghanistan,  Tajikistan, and Somalia.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Thomas Michelsen: "Committee on Constitution </F> Grills Bildt on Balts and Volvo" -- introductory paragraph in  boldface as published]    [Excerpt] What might Sweden do if the independence of  the Baltic states was threatened again? Will we stay neutral or  will we actively support our neighboring countries, as we did  during Finland's Winter War? There was tough debate on those  issues when Prime Minister Carl Bildt was questioned by the  Committee on the Constitution on Tuesday [26 April].    The starting point was a speech delivered by Bildt at the  Foreign Policy Institute in November of last year. Kurt Ove  Johansson (Social Democratic Party) felt that in that speech,  the prime minister had restricted Sweden's freedom of action and  even aroused dangerous hopes in the Baltic states. Bildt had  aroused expectations in our vicinity that we would not be  neutral if there were a war.    And above all, Kurt Ove Johansson questioned the way in  which  the prime minister's attention-getting speech had been prepared.  Had Bildt consulted the rest of the government or the opposition  parties represented on the Riksdag's Foreign Affairs Committee?  <H5>  "Signal" </H5>   Bildt answered that the purpose of the speech was to send a  signal to Red-Brown revanchists in the East. And the positions  expressed were not new: The prime minister had expressed the  same policy in several previous speeches and articles.    "I hope that the European Union [EU] will react if the  independence of the Balts is threatened. That might involve  economic sanctions. And things like that can in no way be linked  to strict neutrality under international law," the prime  minister said.    "But what does the prime minister mean by active Swedish  support for the Baltic states if there is a Russian invasion?"  Johansson asked. He pointed out that 8,000 Swedish soldiers had  participated in Finland's Winter War using weapons from Swedish  military stores as well as aircraft.    "We will provide political support. That may mean  sanctions,"  Bildt answered. "We must not let ourselves be forced to betray  our neighbors again, as we did in 1940. But exactly what we will  do must be decided when the time comes."  <H5>  Heated Debate </H5>   Kurt Ove Johansson did not think there was any popular  support in Sweden for abandoning neutrality. In a recent public  opinion poll, over 80 percent said they thought we should keep  our neutrality. [passage omitted]</p>

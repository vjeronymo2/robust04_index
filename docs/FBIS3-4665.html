In a meeting on Friday, 25 February, with Japanese  delegations led by Mr. Shozo Azuma, vice minister for foreign  affairs, and Mr. Eisei Ito, vice minister for construction who  had come here to attend the inaugural ceremony of the  Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge, the Cambodian prime ministers  said although the Royal Government had made a number of  concessions the Khmer Rouge were still continuing to resort to  their military activities.    "However the royal government is capable and optimistic to  solve this problem because Cambodia has got legitimate  government, Constitution, National Assembly and political unity  among the two biggest ruling parties, and the support from the  people," they said. Another problem to be settled is, according  to them, the rehabilitation which they said would prevent the  return of Khmer Rouge if successfully done.    The Cambodian prime ministers called on the Japanese  investors [words indistinct] ventures in Cambodia especially in  the agricultural field and in the restoration of hydro-electric  station in Prek Thnaot, which, they viewed, are the basic  factors for the development in Cambodia.    The Cambodian leaders expressed thanks to the Japanese  delegations for having visited Cambodia and attended the  inaugural ceremony of the Cambodia-Japan Friendship Bridge built  by Japan. The bridge is the vivid proof of good relations of  friendship between the two peoples, they said.    They thanked the Japanese Government for having invited them  to attend the international conference on the reconstruction of  Cambodia (ICORC) to be held in Tokyo in March this year.  Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr. Shozo Azuma, who  will preside over the ICORC, pledged to explain to the donor  countries to address the basic needs of Cambodia in its  rehabilitation.</p>

He Zhukang,  secretary of the provincial party committee, made an important  speech at the conference. He stressed that strengthening  propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on the overall  situation, and this work should positively facilitate reform and  opening up as well as the establishment of the socialist market  economic structure, facilitate economic and social development,  and help guarantee social stability. Attending the conference  were leading comrades of the provincial party committee and the  provincial government, including Gao Yan, Zhang Yueqi, Wang  Yunkun, Liu Yazhi, Xu Zhongtian, Quan Zhezhu, Wei Minxue, and  Sang Fengwen. Zhang Yueqi, deputy secretary of the provincial  party committee, presided over the conference. At the  conference held on the morning of 3 March, Xu Zhongtian,  standing committee member of the provincial party committee and  director of the propaganda department of the provincial party  committee, first relayed the guidelines of the national  propaganda and ideological work conference.    That afternoon, He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial  party  committee, delivered an important speech at the conference.  Comrade He Zhukang's speech falls into four parts: 1)  Strengthening propaganda and ideological work has a bearing on  the overall situation; 2) propaganda and ideological work is  valued for construction; 3) build a contingent of propaganda and  ideological workers with good quality; and 4) continue to  strengthen the party's leadership over propaganda and  ideological work.    In his speech, Comrade He Zhukang said: Right after the  conclusion of the national propaganda and ideological work  conference, the provincial party committee's standing committee  listened to and conscientiously studied and discussed the  guidelines of this conference, defined through research the  province's opinions for implementing the guidelines and some  major issues on strengthening propaganda and ideological work,  and then decided to hold the current provincial propaganda and  ideological work conference. This provincial conference is  devoted to relaying and implementing the guidelines of the  national conference and to further unifying ideas, defining  tasks, and strengthening leadership in an effort to create a new  situation in the province's propaganda and ideological work, to  better exploit propaganda departments' role of propaganda and  guidance, mobilization and inspiring, and education and  encouragement in deepening reform, expanding opening up,  promoting development, and maintaining stability, and to better  cement the strength of the people throughout the province to  continuously press forward the magnificent cause of building  Jilin into a development border and near-the-sea province.    He Zhukang said: Over the past 15 years since the  commencement of reform and opening up, guided by the theory of  building the socialism with Chinese characteristics and by the  party's basic line, and based on the realities of reform and  development, the province's propaganda and ideological workers  have vigorously armed the people with theory, propagated just  cases, carried forward the main melody, upheld correct  orientation of the media, and carried forward the role of  uniting and inspiring the people, thus helping promote all the  work of the province.    He Zhukang pointed out: Propaganda and ideological work is  the manifestation of fine tradition and political advantages of  our party, which has always occupied an extremely important  position in the work of the whole party. Under the new  historical condition, the strategic position of propaganda and  ideological work is tended to be strengthened, rather than being  weakened. Therefore, during the new period, strengthening  propaganda and ideological work, correctly guiding ideology and  public opinions, and firmly controlling the orientation of the  media have a direct bearing on the building of socialist  spiritual civilization and on the overall situation of the  socialist modernization. At present, China's reform and opening  up as well as the modernization drive have entered a key period.  Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, expanding opening  up, promoting development, and maintaining stability constitute  the overall situation of the whole party and the whole country.  Standing on the height of this overall situation, propaganda  and ideological workers should fully understand the major  responsibility and historical mission invested on them during  the new period and should positively and enthusiastically serve  the progress of reform and opening up. Under the situation in  which many reform measures have been set forth altogether, the  dynamics of reform has been increased, and the degree of  difficulty of reform has been enhanced, propaganda and  ideological workers should propagate, based on a new starting  point, the importance and necessity of reform and the series of  new reform measures adopted by the party and the government. At  the same time, toward the new contradictions and new problems  resulting from the readjusted relations of interests, propaganda  and ideological workers should positively persuade the people  and answer in vivid and correct terms the questions to the  common concern of the people in order to turn negative factors  into positive ones.    He Zhukang said: The current world opinion is conducive to  accelerating China's economic development. Propaganda and  ideological work should be aimed at creating a good ideological  and public opinion atmosphere for economic development.  Propaganda and ideological departments should make great  efforts to propagate Comrade Deng Xiaoping's strategic idea on  accelerating development, strengthen the people's consciousness  in accelerating development, and disseminate the excellent  situation and tremendous achievements scored in economic  construction of the whole country and the whole province since  the commencement of reform and opening up in order to arouse the  fighting will of the people and enhance the morale of the  people. Propaganda and ideological workers should publicize the  conditions of China and Jilin Province by seeking truth from  facts, make a scientific analysis of the contradictions and  difficulties in economic work, guide the masses to show concern  for the overall situation of economic development, help cadres  and the masses embrace a new idea on development, and make the  people more confident in achieving success in reform and  surmounting difficulties. Propaganda and ideological  departments should go all out to propagate the theory of market  economy, popularize modern economic knowledge, and make the  people more enthusiastic in participating in market economic  activities. The endeavor of improving the people's quality  should be regarded as the most fundamental work in the process  of socialist modernization and, this work should be grasped  constantly in the perspective of enhancing the long-term  competitiveness of the province's economy.    He Zhukang said: Maintaining social stability is the  prerequisite for deepening reform and accelerating development.  Party members and cadres throughout the province as well as the  propaganda and ideological front must pay high attention to  various kinds of unstable factors in social activities, give  full play to the power of propaganda and ideological work to  give correct guidance, take a clear-cut stand in carrying  forward healthy tendencies and condemning unhealthy ones, and  check erroneous ideas at the outset in order to promote and  safeguard stability.    He Zhukang said: Comrade Jiang Zemin has pointed out that  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line are the  essential guide to propaganda and ideological work, and the  major tasks of propaganda and ideological work are to arm the  people with scientific theory, guide the people with correct  public opinion, mold the people with noble spirit, and inspire  the people with excellent works. The above-mentioned guide and  major tasks have defined the essential objective of propaganda  and ideological work as strengthening the common understanding  and the cohesive force of the people of the whole party and the  whole country. The province's propaganda and ideological work  must be focused on strengthening the common understanding and  the cohesive force of the people, on arming all the party  members and cadres in the province with the theory of socialism  with Chinese characteristics, on using new ideas, that are  suitable for the modern economy and for the situation of  economic and social development, to correctly guide public  opinion and [words indistinct], on firmly and unswervingly  upholding the principle of letting a hundred flowers blossom and  a hundred schools of thought contend, on [words indistinct] and  strengthening management with the purpose of bringing the  people's ideas into line with the overall situation of the whole  party and the whole country.    He Zhukang said: Building a contingent of propaganda and  ideological workers of good quality constitutes an  organizational guarantee for achieving success in propaganda and  ideological work. At present, propaganda and ideological workers  must keep abreast of new demands, carry forward the cause  pioneered by predecessors, forge ahead into the future, and make  continued efforts to further strengthen themselves. In  politics, propaganda and ideological workers should be firm and  steadfast by embracing a strong sense of dedication and a high  degree of the sense of responsibility. In profession, they  should constantly improve their skills to become specialized in  propaganda and ideological work and should enhance their  confidence to maintain a good mental state.    Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: Strengthening the party's  leadership over propaganda and ideological work is the  consistent tradition of our party. During the new historical  period, party organizations at all levels should all the more  attach importance to and strengthen leadership over propaganda  and ideological work. He stressed: Party committees must  attach importance to propaganda and ideological work, provide  sufficient and competent cadres for the leading bodies of  propaganda and ideological departments, give full play to the  role of propaganda departments under party committees, increase  the input in propaganda and cultural undertakings, and actually  help propaganda and ideological departments solve practical  difficulties and problems.    He Zhukang said in conclusion: This year is an extremely  important year, in which, reform will be promoted in an  all-round way, and efforts will be made to make breakthroughs in  major aspects. This year is also the last year to conduct the  activity of pushing the province's economy onto a new stage in  three years. The current situation and tasks are important and  arduous, and the vast numbers of cadres on the propaganda and  ideological front are shouldering an important mission. The  provincial party committee expects that the cadres on the  propaganda and ideological front will enhance their morale and  do an even higher level of work to mobilize the vast numbers of  cadres and the masses to forge ahead in unity, to deepen reform,  to expand opening up, to promote development, and to maintain  stability in order to make new contributions to building Jilin  into a developed border and near-the-sea province and to  building the socialism with Chinese characteristics.

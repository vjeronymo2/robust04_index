			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Speculation mounts over editor of Independent Senior journalists at The Independent believe that its main founder Mr Andreas Whittam Smith may soon decide to step down as editor. Staff believe he may have privately taken the decision in the past week, although nothing formal has been said and fellow directors of Newspaper Publishing, the company that publishes The Independent, have not been informed of any imminent change. The intense speculation follows the motion of no confidence in Mr Whittam Smith passed by journalists at the paper, and clear signs that the main shareholders - El Pas of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy - have begun an informal process of trying to find a new editor. The uncertainty over Mr Whittam Smith comes as the latest official circulation figures show a modest respite for both The Independent and The Independent on Sunday. Daily sales in May were 276,660, up from 271,372 in April, but for the six months from the beginning of December to the end of May the drop was 18 per cent compared with the same period last year. The Sunday paper sold 324,711 in May, up from 317,720 in April but down 13.7 per cent over the six-month period. The possible bottoming out of the circulation came as The Times recorded sales of 517,575, a 42 per cent rise year-on-year and the highest circulation in the paper's history. The Daily Telegraph, which in April fell below 1m sales for the first time for more than 40 years, dropped further in May. Sales averaged 993,395 compared with 998,921 in April and a December-to-May figure of 1.04m. The Guardian, which fell to 397,172 in April, rose to 401,831 in May. The Financial Times rose to 300,135 in May compared with 298,971 in April.</p>

			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TORONTO EDGES RANGERS 2-1, REACHES .500 FOR 8TH TIME  </P> <P> Toronto reached the .500 mark for the eighth time this season as John Cerutti  pitched a five-hitter today for a 2-1 victory over the Texas Rangers.  </P> <P> Texas shortstop Fred Manrique's two sixth-inning errors led to both runs as the  Blue Jays improved to 56-56 overall and 44-32 since Cito Gaston replaced Jimy  Williams as manager. On each of the seven previous occasions that the Blue Jays  got to .500, they lost the next game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Second Complete Game  </P> <P> Toronto began the day three games behind division-leading Baltimore in the AL  East.  </P> <P> Cerutti, 9-5, pitched his second straight complete game, striking out five  without walking a batter. The Rangers' only run came on Steve Buechele's 12th  homer of the season, a drive just over the left-field fence with one out in the  fifth inning.  </P> <P> But Manrique's errors enabled the Blue Jays to score twice in the sixth off  Mike Jeffcoat, who fell to 5-5 despite pitching allowing only four hits in 7  1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Manny Lee led off with an infield single and took second on Manrique's throwing  error. Tony Fernandez followed with a high chopper to Manrique, who threw the  ball past first again, allowing Lee to score and Fernandez to go to second.  </P> <P> Fernandez took third on Mookie Wilson's grounder and scored on Kelly Gruber's  sacrifice fly to right.  </P> <P> Jeffcoat struck out four and walked two before being relieved by Cecilio Guante  with one out in the eighth.  </P> <P> The Rangers, who have lost three straight games, have made 12 errors in their  last five games.  </P></p>

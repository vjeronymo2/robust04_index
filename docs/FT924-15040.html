			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally in equities helped by sterling THE SHARP rebound in sterling in Far Eastern markets overnight enabled the UK stock market to outpace the recovery in other European equities yesterday. Trading volume was unimpressive, however, and confidence remained fragile as the stock market awaited a government statement on economic strategy, perhaps at the annual conference of the governing Conservative party which is now in session in Brighton. The market made a strong start as sterling rose to DM2.4548, compared with around DM2.3700 at Monday's low point. London was also encouraged by Wall Street's success in rallying overnight to a close of minus 21.6 on the Dow, a great relief after the 100 Dow loss showing as London closed on Monday. Equities advanced rapidly yesterday morning and the FT-SE Index had gained more than 41 points by mid-session. Traders identified some genuine institutional demand for shares, and there were substantial gains in some of the banking and retail stocks which suffered heavily in Monday's shakeout. Investors backed away nervously when Wall Street opened lower, but London regained its confidence as the Dow rallied to show a loss of a mere 1.89 points in UK hours. The final reading showed the Footsie at the day's peak of 2,488.4, a recovery of 42.1 points. Seaq volume of 467.1m shares compared with 477.6m in the previous session; Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail business fell to Pounds 885m on Monday, barely half that of recent sessions, confirming that the big institutions played little role in the day's 4 per cent collapse in the equity market. Activity focused around selected situations, with bid features attracting attention again, although confirmation of a bid approach at Owners Abroad did not come until after the market closed. Signs of a transatlantic two-way pull in Ranks Hovis McDougall appeared, as some UK institutions took profits but US arbitrageurs, confident that Hanson Group will increase the offer terms, continued to buy the shares. There were US buyers also for Glaxo, which has underperformed since the London market turned higher after sterling's withdrawal from the ERM system. BAT Industries, another transatlantic favourite, moved up sharply. Traders were wary of exaggerating yesterday's recovery, which still leaves the Footsie with a gain of around only 5 per cent since Black Wednesday, less than half of the gain recorded in the market's immediate response to the government's decision to quit the ERM. Although hopes for another cut in domestic base rates are now on hold, some UK strategists believe US rates could be cut again later this week. But investment confidence is still significantly restrained by uncertainty over official policies towards sterling and interest rates. The market will focus on tomorrow's speech at the Conservative party conference by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer.</p>

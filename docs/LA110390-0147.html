			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY PUTS BUENA PARK IN PLAYOFFS  </P> <P> The Buena Park High School football team clinched its first playoff appearance  since 1981 with a 28-13 Freeway League victory over Troy Friday night.  </P> <P> Buena Park is 5-4, 3-1 in league and tied for Fullerton for second place with a  week left in the regular season.  </P> <P> The Coyotes can finish no worse than third.  </P> <P> Buena Park junior Angel Barrios helped lead a second-half comeback, rushing for  211 yards on 20 carries and a 16-yard touchdown. It was his fourth consecutive  200-plus-yard game this season.  </P> <P> Troy (3-6, 1-3), which could have climbed into contention for third and a  playoff berth with a victory, saw its chances fade when senior quarterback Greg  Windle injured his left (throwing) wrist in the first half. He was taken to the  hospital for X-rays at halftime, and Coach John Turek said the preliminary  diagnosis was a break.  </P> <P> Windle dominated before being forced from the game, completing six of 14 passes  for 177 yards and sparked his team to a 13-0 lead. One of his completions  resulted in a 96-yard touchdown pass play with Steve Friedrich in the first  quarter, the longest in Troy history.  </P> <P> But Windle's injury forced Turek to go with an inexperienced sophomore, Bryan  Burchit, who didn't complete a pass in seven attempts, and was sacked three  times by the Coyotes' swarming defense.  </P> <P> That allowed the winners to recover, and they took a 14-13 lead on their first  possession of the second half when running back Robert Starks scored on a  two-yard run.

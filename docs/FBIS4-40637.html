			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaymiyev and  Yuriy Spiridonov, head of the Komi Republic, ceremonially signed  an agreement on friendship and cooperation in Kazan. Here is  our Kazan correspondent Zhaudat Aminov.    [Aminov] At a news conference given straight after the  signing of the agreement it was said that an agreement of this  kind strengthens Russia as a great and distinctive state that  contains many curious phenomenon.    Boris Yeltsin is perhaps the only person in Russia's  leadership who really understands what a federation is, Yuriy  Spiridonov said. It is good that he is president, Mintimer  Shaymiyev said, agreeing. Both leaders believe that the time is  not far off when the federation treaty issue will have to be  tackled again and the federation will be built up from below,  taking into account the interests of the republics and the  regions.    Russia's oil-producing regions, which include Tatarstan and  Komi, today founded a consortium to jointly manage the export of  fuel. The agreement promises to be mutually advantageous.    Both leaders agreed on closer cooperation at the Federation  Council level, too, although they were of the opinion that that  body had yet to assume a proper role and did not have any real  influence on the situation.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / New form for assessing tax A tax form designed to help 9m people assess their payments is launched today in draft form by the Inland Revenue. The form is a crucial part of the government's plan to shift to self-assessment - the biggest change in tax collection since the introduction of PAYE half a century ago. A thousand volunteers will receive the new form and have a month to complete and return it to the 30 tax offices taking part in the study. The form incorporates one radical departure. Instead of all taxpayers getting the same bulky form, each will be targeted with specific returns tailored to their tax history. Self-assessment starts in 1997 and will mean that those currently sending in tax forms, either personally or through agents, will be able to use the new form. It will involve the self-employed, business partners, company directors and some employees and pensioners. It will not affect the 20m taxpayers who use PAYE. Initial research showed that people did not like elaborate forms which often contained irrelevant sections. They also completed the form in two sessions. First they found out what information was needed. Then they completed the form. As a result the new form has a guide which should meet the needs of taxpayers trying to assess what they need to know and what they need to complete. A market research programme of interviews will be undertaken with those taking part in the scheme.</p>

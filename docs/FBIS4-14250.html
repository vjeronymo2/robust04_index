			<p>BFN     [Text] Riyadh, 27 April (KUNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher will this afternoon hold a meeting here with  his counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] states  to discuss the latest developments in the Middle East peace  process and the situation in the Gulf. The U.S. secretary of  state arrived here early this morning preceded by the GCC  foreign ministers who had arrived here late last night.  Christopher is due to meet with King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  custodian of the two holy mosques, today before leaving for  Cairo to complete his Middle East tour.    The GCC foreign ministers held a meeting here last night in  preparation for the talks which they will hold with Christopher  today. Sources from the meeting told KUNA that at the short  meeting held at the airport the agenda for the meeting [with  Christopher] prepared by the GCC general secretariat was  reviewed.    Official political sources said that during their short  meeting the ministers discussed the agenda of topics to be  discussed with the U.S. secretary of state during the meeting to  be held at the GCC general secretariat at noon today which will  be followed by a joint news conference by Christopher and his  Saudi counterpart Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal.    Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Sa'ud al-Faysal, who received  the GCC foreign ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher, said that the meeting will focus on three issues  [as received]: namely developments in the Middle East peace  process, and the need for the co-sponsors of the peace  conference -- particularly the United States -- to exert greater  efforts to overcome the obstacles facing the process. Prince  Sa'ud al-Faysal added that the meeting will also discuss the  situation and developments in the Gulf region and the issue of  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Sources expected that the meeting, which is taking place  within Christopher's tour of the region, will focus on giving  impetus to the peace process in the Middle East, the situation  in the Gulf, and the Arab boycott of Israel.</p>

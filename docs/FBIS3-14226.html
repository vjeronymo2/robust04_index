This was learned by our  correspondent Qobi Mandel, and he is on the phone with the  initial details:    The 20-year-old Syrian soldier, Jasim Khadir, was captured  two days ago on the Israeli-Syrian border after he crossed the  border fence. The soldier underwent commando training with  al-Sa'iqah, a pro-Syrian organization. He told his  interrogators that he decided to defect to Israel and ask for  political asylum here because he was mistreated by his Syrian  commander, a ranking Major. My commander deprived me of my  military rights, he said today in the 'Akko Magistrates Court.    The representative of the Minorities Squad of the Galilee  District Police said at the court that the soldier's version  still needs to be verified through the appropriate channels.  Justice Faris Falah accepted the police request, and ordered  that the Syrian soldier's remand to custody be extended by 15  days.</p>

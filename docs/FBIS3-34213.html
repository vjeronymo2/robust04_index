			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Muhammad al-Sa'id Fa'iq commentary: "The Human Conscience </F> and the Call To Save the Bosnian People"]    [Text] Egypt has strongly denounced the awful massacre that  the Serbian forces carried out against Bosnian Muslims in  Sarajevo yesterday with the arrogance of force, killing about 70  people and wounding hundreds of others.    A Foreign Ministry statement called on the international  community, represented by the Security Council, to act quickly  to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia to enable this nation, which  is being subjected to brutal aggression from many sources that  have more manpower and armaments, to defend itself according to  its right under the UN charter and international law.    As part of Egypt's efforts to prompt the international  community to recognize its moral responsibilities and halt this  brutal series of massacres in which scores of Muslim civilians  die every day, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa held telephone  contacts with the UN secretary general, a number of foreign  ministers from OAU and European Union countries, and the United  States to discuss ways of confronting this hostile escalation  against the Bosnian people.    Proceeding from its moral obligation to stand by the Bosnian  Muslim nation in its struggle against the forces of oppression  and evil that aim to destroy it, Egypt urged the international  community to reconsider the policies adopted to deal with the  continuing aggression against the Bosnian people. These heinous  massacres perpetrated by the Serb and Croat butchers all over  Bosnia and this continuous and escalated bombardment of the  nation, the arming of which is banned by international community  resolutions and that has been robbed of its legitimate right to  self-defense, confirmed the failure of these policies.  Furthermore, these acts provide evidence that the talks held in  a number of European capitals to find a solution to this tragedy  have been a waste of time and will not make the international  community support the Bosnian nation in the sovereignty of its  territories and its right to life in peace and security.    We say once again that the human conscience is urged to act  swiftly to save the Bosnian nation from the Serb and Croat  massacres and the inaction of most of the world's governments  that are contended with watching the violation of all ethical  and human values in Bosnia. Human conscience is also urged to  watch how the Serb and Croat butchers flagrantly challenge  Security Council resolutions.    The latest brutal rocket shelling of Sarajevo came a few  hours after the Security Council's strongly worded statement  threatening economic sanctions against Croatia unless it  withdraws its forces and military ammunition from central and  south Bosnia within two weeks. It is the practical, military  response of Serb and Croat murderers to the Security Council  statement that called for respecting Bosnia's sovereignty,  independence, and territorial integrity as a member state of the  United Nations and that warned against acts of ethnic cleansing  against civilians in that country. It is a response full of  arrogance, haughtiness, and disdain for UN resolutions.    Human history stresses the need to confront such  expansionist, hostile ambitions against nations and to act  quickly to contain these racist conflicts.    If the Bosnian nation's fate is to suffer these brutal  massacres while the world debates how to end this tragedy, the  least that can be done is for the Security Council to move  swiftly to lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian nation, in  accordance with its legitimate right to self-defense, can defend  its land, honor, and right to a free and dignified life.</p>

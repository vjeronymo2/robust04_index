			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO THEATER  </P> <P> Who is Jose Armand?  </P> <P> I am a visual artist and I have been active in the Latino community and art  community for more than 12 years. Neither I nor my colleagues have ever heard  of Mr. Armand. So you can imagine my surprise to see him referred to as "the  most vocal spokesman for Latino arts and multicultural dialogue in Los  Angeles."  </P> <P> DANIEL J. MARTINEZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

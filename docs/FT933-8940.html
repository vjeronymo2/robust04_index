			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Australian wool prices continued to slip this week, with the market indicator declining slightly each selling day. Demand was insufficient to lead to a good clearance at any of the sales and the overall proportion passed in was nearly 15%. The Wool Corporation's market indicator at 434 cents a kg is now 10 cents below its closing level in June. After a hopeful opening day the market is again illustrating the inadequacy of demand in relation to supply. Recession is mentioned as a major cause and the absence of the old Soviet Union is of even greater basic importance.</p>

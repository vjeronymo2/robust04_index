			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: Gardini buys four water brands MR RAUL GARDINI, the Italian industrialist, yesterday announced the acquisition of four Italian mineral water brands, turning him into one of the largest operators in the national market. Garma, a holding company controlled by Mr Gardini, has paid an undisclosed sum to an Italian businessman for Italfin, a drinks business with a combined annual mineral water turnover equivalent to Dollars 200m. This is Mr Gardini's second Italian mineral water acquisition within a fortnight and lifts his market share to 20 per cent, where he rivals the French food group BSN, owner of the Ferrarelle and Boario brands. It is the latest reshuffle in the European mineral water industry after the takeover of Perrier, the French group, by Nestle, the Swiss foods group. The brands Mr Gardini bought yesterday - Rocaro, Pejo, Santa Rita and Ciapazzi - hold 7 per cent of the Italian market. In mid-June, he paid an estimated Dollars 300m for the food and drinks group Nuova GIA, which controls the Levissima water brand, with a 13 per cent market share. Mr Gardini declined to indicate whether or not he might be interested in the several brands which Nestle has agreed to sell as a condition of getting European Commission clearance for the takeover. He said he was studying the situation.</p>

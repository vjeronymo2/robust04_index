			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / International Company News: Moody's upgrades Argentina ARGENTINA has climbed a further two rungs up the ladder of international respectability in the investment community, according Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency. However, the country's large foreign debt and deteriorating current account position mean it is still rated only a B1 risk by Moody's, four notches below full investment grade. Moody's also said it had no plans to review the ratings of other Latin American countries, despite the debt accord reached last week between Brazil's and its international bank creditors. 'Just a debt deal is not by any means sufficient,' said Mr David Levey, head of sovereign debt ratings at Moody's. The agency did not expect any improvement in Brazil's economic position in the near future, he said, leaving it with a rating of B2. Explaining the decision to lift the credit rating of Argentina's long-term debt from B3, Moody's pointed to significant steps in dismantling administrative and regulatory controls within the country. Also, Argentina has linked its currency more closely to the US dollar and made efforts to raise its tax revenues permanently . Pointing to the country's current account deficit, and fears of a resurgence of inflation, Moody's concluded: 'The potential for a reversal of current positive trends thus cannot be ruled out . . . but the credit rating agency does not expect a return to the chaotic conditions of the 1980s.' Venezuela and Mexico remain the two most highly-regarded of the countries with debt ratings in the region. Venezuela is rated by Moody's at Ba1 - just below investment grade - and BB by Standard &amp; Poor's. Mexico is accorded Ba2 by Moody's.</p>

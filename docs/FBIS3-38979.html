			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed LVE/RAY: "Pawlak Traces Path for Poland's </F> Future European Union (EU) Membership"; as released by Brussels  BELGA Database]    [Text] Brussels, 3 Feb (BELGA) -- Polish Prime Minister  Waldemar Pawlak set out on Thursday [3 February] the future  course for his country's accession to the European Union (EU),  stressing that while "Poland's political will has already been  clearly expressed," there is a need to develop in the shortest  possible term economic relations that will allow Poland to meet  competition from EU member states.    The leader of the Polish Government, who has been in  Brussels  since Wednesday, met European Commission's President Jacques  Delors at noon on Thursday to discuss in particular prospects  for an association accord uniting the EU with Poland and Hungary  as well as the "pact for development" as recommended by Warsaw  to further strengthen the economic ties between the EU and  Central Europe.    "The association accord is of essential significance to us,  because Poland has been seeking since 1989 to expand all of its  contacts with the EU. We have thus proposed to supplement the  Partnership for Peace, which binds us to NATO, with a  partnership for development," Mr. Pawlak explained at a news  conference.    "We propose an open formula, and we stress the regional  dimension of this pact, which could take the form of a free  trade area within the Visegrad group and could strengthen  economic cooperation with the EU," such as in relation to trade  in transportation and telecommunications infrastructures, he  added in substance.    But "this cooperation must not solely benefit those sectors  where profits are most easily obtained," the Polish prime  minister added, stressing the need for closer cooperation in  areas such as the processing of agricultural products or coal.    Mr. Pawlak and Mr. Delors also spoke of the EU's PHARE  [Economic Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] program of  economic aid for the countries of Central and East Europe. An  "overall assessment" of the effectiveness of this program is  called for, the head of the European executive indicated.    Jacques Delors also stressed the need to help the Polish  authorities to "solve the crucial problem of agriculture, which  is suffering from internal problems and difficulties in finding  external markets." The Commission president expressed his  understanding of the hopes for future membership expressed by  Poland. "I am not able to say in advance when the conditions  for Poland's membership will be fulfilled, but the EU has  already made an unreserved political commitment on its future  enlargement to include the countries of East Europe. It has the  historical responsibility to respond to the appeals of these  countries," he stated.    In the meantime, Mr. Delors has given his commitment on  behalf of the Twelve to increase political contacts with Warsaw  over the coming months.    He believes Poland already fulfills the first condition for  membership of the Community club by having acquired a democracy  which is "pluralist and respects human rights." But it will be  up to the Polish people themselves to say when they will be able  to satisfy the second condition, which involves an open economy  that is able to "stand up to the Community economy," he added in  substance.</p>

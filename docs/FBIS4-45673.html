			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yan Berling in Severomorsk; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Text] The first trainload of the nuclear fuel waste has  left the Sogagorka railway junction in Arkhangelsk at 0200  today. For almost three years now the nuclear reactor rods have  been deposited at the SevMash [Severodvinsk Machine-building]  enterprise in Severodvinsk at which redundant nuclear submarines  are being dismantled. Nearly 40 submarines are waiting today  for their nuclear fuel waste to be disposed.    For the past three years Severodvinsk has been under a  threat  of ecological catastrophe. A slightest error in handling  nuclear fuel could lead to irreversible consequences. The  volume of radioactive waste exceeded all accepted norms.    The reasons for this pileup was the fact that previously  nuclear waste was shipped by sea to a place near Murmansk where  it was loaded onto railway cars and transported to  Chelyabinsk-65 for disposal. This was too expensive and the  North Fleet command suggested the waste should be transported  directly from Severodvinsk and Archangelsk. The State  ecological expert commission was examining this proposal for  several years, which resulted in a pileup of nuclear waste  waiting to be transported.    Nevertheless, the first trainload has now been dispatched.  The railway lines had to be repaired urgently for this  occasion. The safety of the load was ensured by introduction of  new specially designed containers. [Video shows train with  special containers]</p>

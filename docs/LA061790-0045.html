			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA FE VIEWPOINT  </P> <P> The article by Jerry Hulse on Santa Fe was interesting, colorful and  informative. How I envy him.  </P> <P> I'd like to add a few facts that may interest your readers so that they can  become aware of the historic significance of Santa Fe and the history of the  people who founded it.  </P> <P> Many of us do not have the time or inclination to study history. But articles  such as yours can give us incentive to travel as well as to educate us in a  delightful way.  </P> <P> As a genealogy buff, I have had the pleasure of researching my roots four  centuries in America -- exactly 392 years. Twenty-eight of my ancestors came to  New Mexico with the Juan de Onate Expedition in 1598, hence most of the  founders of Santa Fe were my ancestors.  </P> <P> So you see, Santa Fe isn't just art galleries and blue corn tortillas. Santa Fe  is history, real people. People with dreams, people with faith who dared to  leave their beloved Spain to find a new life in a new world. Every building has  a story or a ghost, each path taken a destiny.  </P> <P> When I visit the plaza, I sit in the warm sun listening to the voices of the  past. I hear the church bells calling the people to prayer, the laughter of  little children. I envision the secret places where lovers met, far from the  eyes of disapproving parents. I feel overcome with sadness and anger as I  imagine the deals that were made by unscrupulous Americans as they conspired to  take over New Mexico in 1846. But I smile as I see the melding of the three  cultures -- Spanish, Indian and Anglo -- all trying to live peacefully in this  most beautiful of cities.  </P> <P> PAULINE CHAVEZ BENT  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

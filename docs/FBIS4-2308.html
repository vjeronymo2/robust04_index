			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Sino-Ukrainian trade  relations were boosted today when government delegations from  the two countries met and signed two documents of cooperation  here.    They involved regulations set up by the Sino-Ukrainian Joint  Government Committee on Trade Cooperation and a summary of that  committee's first meeting. They were signed by the two chairmen  He Guangyuan, minister for China's machine-building industry,  and Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov.    The two sides exchanged views on the prospects of enlarging  trade and technical cooperation between them and agreed that it  is mutually complementary on an economic basis.    They also suggested that the trade, at present mostly on a  barter basis, should take on a new format which involves a  combination of barter, cash transactions and a means of settling  accounts in a third country.    The two chairmen stressed that the joint committee has  become  a bridge for developing cooperation and decided that its second  meeting will be held in Beijing next year.    The Chinese delegation, which arrived in Kiev Sunday [3  April], will leave here for home Thursday.</p>

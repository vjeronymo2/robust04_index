			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / Chess: Honour and defeat In the end, it was an honourable defeat in a match of two halves. Gary Kasparov retained his PCA world title at London's Savoy Theatre by a 12 1/2  -7 1/2 margin, six wins and 13 draws against a solitary win for Nigel Short. The champion collects Pounds 1.06m of the Times' Pounds 1.7m prize money, but Short recovered well from a dreadful start. Short held his own over the final eleven games, the only player apart from former champion Anatoly Karpov to do so well against Kasparov, the all-time Number 1. There are two ways of looking at the result. The match was effectively decided when Kasparov won three of the first four games, and some believe he simply coasted to victory. But Kasparov himself admitted dissatisfaction at not being able to crush his opponent, and he seemed fatigued during the last few games. 'Nigel's strategy was to tire Kasparov out,' says Short's sacked guru, Lubomir Kavalek. 'It was really working near the end of the match, but by then Kasparov was too far ahead. Nigel was well prepared, but he missed opportunities through nervousness.' If Short had taken all his clear winning and drawing chances, he would have been leading by one or two points after 20 games rather than contemplating his Pounds 640,000 loser's cheque. Kasparov's future opponents will note how Short successfully defied classical strategies by gaining active pieces in return for weakened pawns, and that the Russian was uneasy in such positions. Kasparov's legend of invincibility is dented, if not damaged, while Short can reasonably contemplate another challenge in 1995. Off board, the championship has been hyped on Channel 4 and in The Times, and denigrated by that newspaper's rivals. Seat prices at the Savoy were heavily discounted from their original Pounds 45 minimum, but then daily audiences stabilised at about 600 daily even when Short's situation was hopeless. Television audiences settled at a healthy 600,000, viewing both Channel 4, whose one-hour live commentaries broke new ground, and BBC 2. Dealers in chess equipment report large sales increases. But the London Chess Festival, scheduled to run alongside the championship, was a disappointment. The Times was forced to abandon all but a handful of events. It may be a long time yet before the controversies surrounding the match are finally settled. In a few weeks' time, the breakaway Professional Chess Association, founded by Short and Kasparov, holds its first qualifier to decide Kasparov's next challenger in 1995. Then the official Fide world body, whose champion is likely to be Kasparov's old rival Karpov, stages its own elimination matches. The escalating costs of this expensive war are certain to strain the resources of both organisations. Although Kasparov and Short are proclaiming that their match has begin a brave new world where chess is free from the Fide bureaucracy, the reality is more likely to be, at best, an eventual truce and merger between Fide and the PCA. At worst it may be a return to the days when champions personally chose their challenger and often dodged their strongest rivals. Chess column: Page XXI</p>

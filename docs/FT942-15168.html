			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / International Company News: Eisner tops US pay table Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, topped the US executive pay league in 1993 with earnings of Dollars 203m  - not far short of the company's net income, which fell 63 per cent in the year to Dollars 299.8m, according to a survey published yesterday by Businessweek magazine. It was the highest annual compensation for an executive anywhere in the world. However, some Dollars 202.3m of Mr Eisner's compensation stemmed from the exercise of stock options dating back to 1984. His salary was only Dollars 750,000 and he received no bonus as Disney's earnings fell. He is regarded as having done an excellent job for shareholders, lifting Disney's capitalisation from Dollars 2.2bn to almost Dollars 23bn over the past decade. The second highest paid executive was Mr Sanford Weill, chairman of Travelers, the financial services group, who received Dollars 52.8m, all but Dollars 4.3m through the exercise of stock options. Third was Mr Joseph Hyde of Autozone with Dollars 32.2m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Abdallah al-Hajj: "Nahnah Tells AL-HAYAH: </F> Salvation Front's Split Was Expected"]    [Text] Jeddah -- Mahfoud Nahnah, leader of the Algerian  Reform Grouping Movement (HAMAS) [as published; HAMAS is  acronymn for Islamic Society Movement], has cast doubt on the  ability of the leaders of the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] to  stop the current acts of violence in Algeria. He affirmed that  the use of arms "will never resolve the Algerian crisis." In a  statement to AL-HAYAH in Jeddah, he urged a return "to the  sensible option and the need for all political partners in the  Algerian arena to sit together around the dialogue table, lay  down their arms, and convince each other by reasonable and  legitimate methods."    He drew attention to the fact that HAMAS has chosen  dialogue.  He added that "dialogue in the end led to closer views and led  to a meeting between the Algerian defense minister and the FIS  leaders in prison." Referring to the "split within FIS," he  said that "such a thing was expected and will continue until the  appearance of evidence to the contrary, especially after one of  the FIS founders declared that the issue of the current violence  in Algeria can be resolved neither by Cheik Abbasi Madani, nor  by Cheik Ali Belhadj, nor by Cheik Abdelkader Sahraoui -- which  proves that the violence has gone too far and is out of control."    Nahnah warned against interference by "opportunists, the  economic mafia, criminals, fools, thieves, and people with  ulterior motives acting under the cover of the prevailing  violence in Algeria." He reaffirmed that the policy of taking  up arms "will never solve the Algerian crisis."    Nahnah criticized the "exploitation of Islam, culture, and  democracy for personal gain and the involvement of these matters  in the issue of national dialogue in Algeria." He urged  "everyone to give up and sacrifice his personal interests in  favor of Algeria's general interests and the unity of its  people."    He spoke of the need to "purify the dialogue issue" and  called on the people concerned to "join the dialogue without  seeking to settle historical, economic, or political scores,  because such a dialogue would take us to safe shores at the  earliest possible time and the least cost."    Nahnah urged the Algerian leadership to "declare frankly  that  it is not hostile to Islam and to clarify its position on the  question of foreign aid and the way of settling the Algerian  state's debts." He criticized the "tardiness of successive  Algerian governments in rescheduling debts." He called for "a  frank declaration of the reasons for and causes of its delay in  settling this matter."    He also stressed that the old economic laws and regulations  should be abolished and new laws promulgated to free the  economy, investments, and specialization. He urged the current  Algerian Government "to announce its boycott of the members of  the former socialist regime and its bankrupt symbols, and to  have the full courage to move on to a new political, economic,  and social phase."    He warned "the Islamists and those who promote the  ideologies  of al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin [renegades and assassins, old  Islamic sects] and seek to foment sedition and chop off heads  without clear reasons" that they "will meet the same fate as the  al-Khawarij and al-Hashshashin in history."    On the current situation in Algeria, Nahnah said: "Algeria  is witnessing blind sedition. Our motto will continue to be  dialogue, tolerance, and the abandonment of personal interests  in favor of the nation's higher interests, particularly that of  upholding God's religion without conflict with the divine  teachings, either in words or in deeds in society."    He praised the style of President Liamine Zeroual's  government in dealing with "the FIS and in bringing together the  political partners around the dialogue table, and releasing some  FIS leaders." He asked: "If that is going to continue, what is  the point of killing people and spilling blood on Algerian soil?"</p>

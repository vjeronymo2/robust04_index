			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Albanian Parties Requesting </F> Postponement of Census"]    [Text] In order to provide an objective and realistic  implementation of the census, the government is asked, provided  it assesses that there are objective difficulties in meeting the  legal conditions, to undertake an urgent initiative for changing  and supplementing the Census Law by prolonging the term set for  the census. This was jointly requested by all Albanian  political parties and movements in Macedonia [The Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM].    At their recent meeting, it was concluded that the  representatives of the Albanian political parties address the  president of the republic, the government, the state commission,  as well as the expert group determined by the European Council  to monitor the census, with the stance that a successful  implementation of the census cannot be expected if all defects  are not eradicated from the beginning to the end.    In the announcement issued from the meeting of the PDP  [Party  for Democratic Prosperity], the NDP [People's Democratic Party],  and the ADS-Liberal Party (Albanian Democratic Alliance-Liberal  Party) it is concluded that a range of important conditions for  the implementation of the legal provisions are not being  realized at all, while the census deadline is approaching. It  was also assessed that a great part of the population has still  not obtained its personal documentation necessary for the census.    The Albanian parties also believe that the public  competitions for census takers and instructors are also being  announced and organized with a delay and inappropriately,  whereby, contrary to the legal provisions, they do not comply  with the proportional principle of representation, according to  the structure of the population.    The agreement for appropriate hiring of expert personnel at  the Republican Bureau for Statistics from the ranks of the  Albanian population, as an important condition for the  fulfilling of its true function, is not being realized to any  extent. The question regarding the interpretation of Article 30  of the Census Law in regions where the population is not mixed,  is once again raised. It is believed that it is unnatural for a  census taker, a Macedonian, to unconditionally take part in such  mixed regions, while for pure Macedonian regions the census  takers to be exclusively Macedonians.</p>

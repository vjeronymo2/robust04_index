			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Evans article: "Inept Clinton Blamed for West's </F> `Strategic Arthritis'"]    [Text] President Clinton's fumbling and uncertain foreign  policy was partly to blame for the Wests attack of "strategic  arthritis last year, according to the International Institute  for Strategic Studies.    "The United States, even more than usual, does not seem to  be  following a steady compass," the London-based group said in its  annual review of world security issues. In one of the strongest  indictments of Mr Clinton's failings, the report said he had  been "blowing a very uncertain foreign-policy trumpet." The  United States seemed to want, not security guarantees like the  countries of Eastern Europe, but a guarantee of its own security  policy, it said.    The report, published yesterday, said: "By the end of the  year, the U.S. was insisting on no open-ended commitments,  assurance of victory without casualties, and an exit strategy.  These are awesome guarantees to ask for in todays uncertain  world. It took a few American deaths during the humanitarian aid  mission to Somalia to convince Mr Clinton that if the Somalis  would not play the game, "it was time to gather up his marbles  and go home. At least Somalia was left "somewhat better off."    In Haiti, however, the "dubious U.S. policy" had left the  country worse off The report said Washington was guilty of an  "extraordinary show of ineptitude." After sending a few lightly  armed troops to back up Washington's policy of returning the  elected President to run the country in place of "the thugs in  the military who had deposed him, the ship carrying the American  unit was ordered to turn round and go back.    The report also noted the "dangerous implications" of  Russia's recent forays on to the world stage, particularly in  the Balkans and former Soviet republics. Russian influence in  helping to persuade the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina to remove  their heavy weapons from Sarajevo had been effective.    It has, however, given the Russians a degree of influence in  the former Yugoslavia that it has not had since Stalin lost  control there in 1948. No settlement of the crisis in the area  is possible now without Russian participation and full  agreement.    More worrying than Moscow's action in Bosnia was the  reassertion of Russian nationalist zeal towards the so-called  "near abroad," the former Soviet republics. The term, as used  by the Russians, indicated Moscow did not accept that the states  which "rose from the rubble of the Soviet Union" were fully  independent. Moscow seemed intent on ensuring that these states  acted "only with Russian interests and desires in mind. If need  be, it would meddle in their business," even militarily to  ensure this outcome and the West seems willing to accept this  state of affairs with little demur.    On the eve of a NATO Defence Ministers' meeting in Brussels,  at which Pavel Grachev, the Russian Defence Minister, is  expected to tell his Western counterparts what Moscow wants from  the alliance, the survey said Nato governments were finding it  difficult to choose between the demands of Russia and those of  central and eastern Europe.</p>

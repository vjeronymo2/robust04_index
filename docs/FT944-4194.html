			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Strong competition for council cleaning Sir, Your one-sided article, 'Council cleaning overspend revealed' (December 6), shows that Dr Stefan Szymanski has once again chosen to produce a report using dubious methodology to attack the public sector. His claim that in a significant number of local authorities 'competitive tendering is little more than a fiction' does not stand up to closer scrutiny. According to comprehensive data collected by the Local Government Management Board, building cleaning is the most competitive of the services subjected to CCT. Here, the private sector has managed to win almost 57 per cent of contracts let to date. This compares very favourably with the other defined activities, where private sector penetration is, on average, just 38 per cent. In addition, the LGMB data reveal that only 15 per cent of current tender awards have been retained in-house with no outside competition. What Szymanski's report does reveal most clearly, however, is the shocking level of wages paid to workers by some private firms. Wage costs in the building cleaning industry account for 80-90 per cent of total costs. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that firms paying subsistence-level wages to workers drawn largely from the most vulnerable sections of society, many operating in the black economy, are able to undercut more realistic wage rates offered by councils' direct service organisations.

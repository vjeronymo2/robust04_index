			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Purpose and Substantive Description  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 22 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437t) provides for the establishment of Family Investment Centers (FIC). Implementing regulations for the program will be promulgated as part of a consolidated rule on resident initiatives, which the Department anticipates publishing next year. This NOFA is being issued in conformity with the statutory requirements before the final rule is in place in order to make funding available as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> B. Allocation Amounts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1993 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;389, approved October 6, 1992), Congress appropriated $25 million for Family Investment Centers; an additional $25,674,991 is available for the program through an appropriation in the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;124, approved October 28, 1993). These amounts are being combined with excess recaptured funds carried over from FY 1993 to make a total of $75 million available for funding Family Investment Center activities. An additional $10 million may become available pending Secretarial and congressional actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the $75 million total current funds, $74 million is being made available under this NOFA. The Department intends to use $1 million for purposes of demonstrating ways for families living in public and Indian housing in a neighborhood undergoing a concentrated effort of local revitalization to gain access to education and employment activities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence, by enabling HAs to develop facilities for training and support services. These funds will be used to mobilize public and private resources to expand and improve delivery of services, to provide funding for essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded, to improve the capacity of management to assess the training and services needs of eligible families, to coordinate the provision of training and services that meet such needs and to ensure the long-term provision of such training and services. HUD expects that this funding will demonstrate the importance of comprehensive support services in contributing to the local neighborhood revitalization. A separate Notice announcing these funds and soliciting public comment is expected to be published soon in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To ensure that the program is implemented on a broad, nationwide basis, each applicant may submit only one application under this NOFA (published: February 28, 1994. A public housing agency/Indian housing authority (collectively, HAs) may apply to establish one or more Family Investment Centers for more than one public or Indian housing development; however the maximum grant amount per applicant under this NOFA is $1 million.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> C. Overview and Policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The stated purpose of section 22 is:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]o provide families living in public housing with better access to educational and employment opportunities to achieve self-sufficiency and independence by: (a) developing facilities in or near public housing for training and support services; (b) mobilizing public and private resources to expand and improve the delivery of such services; (c) providing funding for such essential training and support services that cannot otherwise be funded; and (d) improving the capacity of management to assess the training and service needs of families, coordinate the provision of training and services that meet such needs, and ensure the long-term provision of such training and services. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although Section 22 is phrased in terms of families living in public housing, the program is also available to Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), because of section 527 of the National Affordable Housing Act (104 Stat. 4216; 42 U.S.C. 1437aa note) (NAHA). Section 527 extends the applicability of many NAHA provisions affecting Title I of the 1937 Act (including section 515, which added Section 22) to housing operated by an IHA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIC provides funding to HAs to access educational, housing, or other social service programs to assist public and Indian housing residents toward self-sufficiency. On May 13, 1993, 33 representatives from public/Indian housing authorities, resident organizations, and nonprofit housing agencies were convened to discuss and make suggestions during the design stage of the Family Investment Centers program. The Department envisions that FIC will complement other self-sufficiency activities, such as the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) Program (see 58 FR 30858 (May 27, 1993) for the interim rule that currently governs the FSS programs) and the requirements of Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u). As an incentive to become self-sufficient, the earnings of public or Indian Housing families participating in the FIC shall not be treated as income for the purposes of any other program or provision of State or Federal law, including rent assistance (see Section I.F(5) of this NOFA). The FIC is administered by the Department's Office of Resident Initiatives in the Office of Public and Indian Housing, with assistance from a network of Resident Initiatives Coordinators (RICs) in HUD's Regional and Field Offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> D.

If the HA is combining FIC with the Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) program, the term also means Public Housing FSS and Section 8 families participating in the FSS program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Secretary  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Service Coordinator  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> means, for purposes of this NOFA, any person who is responsible for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Determining the eligibility of families to be served by the FIC;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

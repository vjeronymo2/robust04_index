			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HITACHI CANCELS MICROCHIPS AD TO AVOID FANNING U.S. FRICTION  </P> <P> Japanese computer giant Hitachi has abandoned plans for an advertising blitz  promoting itself as a future leader in microchips, partly due to fears of  fanning trade friction with the United States, the company said today.  </P> <P> Hitachi ran an advertisement for four-megabit dynamic random access memory  chips in a July issue of industry magazine Nikkei Electronics but canceled  plans to run it in daily newspapers and other journals.  </P> <P> "We decided it was too sensational," the spokesman said.  </P> <P> He declined to comment on a report in the daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun that the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry had advised Hitachi to give up the  campaign. Ministry officials were not available for comment.  </P> <P> "In discussions (of whether to run the advertisement), some suggested it would  irritate the U.S., where people already fear Japan is leading in technology,"  the Hitachi spokesman said.  </P> <P> "But we also considered the domestic reaction. All makers are trying hard to  move to mass production, and it was odd to have a sensational ad which didn't  have specific content."  </P></p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Bonn official plays down recession fear THE SLOWDOWN in economic growth rates in some leading industrial countries was cause for concern but need not give rise to expectations of a global recession, Mr Horst Kohler, state secretary in the German Finance Ministry, said yesterday, agencies report from Kronberg. Mr Kohler was speaking after the final session of a three-day meeting of officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations. He said he was encouraged by the progress of the meeting, the second in a series of gatherings of deputy finance ministers and other senior officials in preparation for the G7 summit in Munich in July. 'The flattening out of growth rates is visible for everyone and there is cause for concern,' Mr Kohler said. 'But on the other hand, the situation is now such that one need not have the impression that we are on the verge of a global recession.' The world economy and the need for policies to strengthen growth, as well as the debts of the former Soviet Union, headed the list of topics at the Kronberg meeting, he said. 'What matters, especially for Munich, is how can we strengthen the worldwide economic growth rates with the right policies. 'That is the key question for Munich and beyond Munich - how can we strengthen growth with the right policies, that is, policies that reconcile simultaneously the short-term problems with the medium-term necessity.' Germany currently holds the chair of the G7, which also includes Britain, the US, Japan, France, Canada and Italy. Mr David Mulford, the US treasury under-secretary, said during a break in the meeting on Saturday that officials had also discussed the weakness of the yen, but had taken no decision on how to respond.</p>

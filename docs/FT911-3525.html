			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Phone tax opposition grows - Finance bill A SENIOR Tory MP is to attempt to reverse the government's plans for taxing portable phones when the Commons considers the Finance Bill, Ralph Atkins writes. Sir William Clark, chairman of the Tory backbench finance committee, says he will table two amendments to the proposals for taxing mobile phones provided by employers and used for personal calls as a benefit-in-kind worth Pounds 200. The first amendment would overturn the government's plans. If that fails, the second would exempt those who made only a very few personal calls on such telephones. A survey of Conservative MPs by Access Opinions, an independent research company, showed 60 per cent of Tory MPs opposed to the plans announced in the Budget. British Coal would face difficulty obtaining planning permission for opencast or surface mining in Wales if recommendations by the Welsh Affairs committee are adopted.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Deposit Insurance Reforms Urged: The chairman of the House Banking Committee  called for a broad range of steps to bolster the nation's deposit insurance  system, with closer regulation and the creation of a new agency. The proposals  by Democrat Henry B. Gonzalez of Texas -- the first comprehensive proposals to  overhaul deposit insurance -- would boost the costs for depositors at banks,  thrifts and credit unions as well as the institutions themselves.  </P> <P> Gonzalez essentially called for limitations on insurance coverage to amounts  authorized by law, arguing that nearly all deposits today are effectively  insured -- notwithstanding the limit of $100,000. The plan would require  regulators to take quick action when an institution loses capital, and make  holding companies responsible for losses suffered by affiliates.  </P></p>

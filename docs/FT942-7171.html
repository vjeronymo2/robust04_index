			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / International Company News: Sankyo ahead in dull drugs sector Japanese drugs companies saw sluggish profits for the year to last March, due to a fall in sales of antibiotics as the number of flu patients in the second half fell sharply from the previous year. A steep fall in purchases ahead of the price cuts implemented last month by the ministry of health and welfare also affected sales during the six months to March. Takeda Chemical Industries said unconsolidated sales fell in all units except its overseas medical drug division. Operating profits rose 5.3 per cent to Y66.8bn (Dollars 639m), due to a Y1.9bn cut in advertising expenses and a fall in prices of raw materials. However, a fall in financial items hurt pre-tax profits and after-tax earnings rose 17.3 per cent to Y37bn. Sankyo posted a firm non-consolidated earnings rise on the back of profits from Mevalotin, its antihyper-lipedemic, in spite of an overall sales decline due to the transfer of its antiallergic cures to Sandoz. After-tax profits rose 30.6 per cent to Y36.9bn. Parent sales at Shionogi declined due to a fall in antibiotic sales, but earnings rose thanks to cost cutting and streamlining its management personnel. After-tax profits rose 22.2 per cent to Y10.3bn as a result of a fall in corporate taxes. Yamanouchi's sales were supported by strong demand for its stomach ulcer drugs. However, the fall in financial income due to lower interest rates depressed pre-tax profits. After-tax profits rose 1.5 per cent to Y27.6bn. Earnings at Fujisawa were hit by the decline in antibiotic sales and sluggish exports due to the strong yen. Net profits, however, soared 71.8 times to Y100bn due to sales of its product rights and stake in Fujisawa-Astra, the joint venture with Astra, the Swedish drug group. For the current year to March, the companies face a squeeze on sales and profits due to the government's official drug price cuts. The amount of drugs prescribed is likely to be hit due to stricter limits on consultation fees reimbursed to doctors by the health ministry. Mr Yoshihide Yoda, pharmaceutical analyst at UBS Securities, forecasts a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the industry, while the size of the market is expected to grow by 2 per cent. Takeda forecasts a 6.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profits while sales are expected to remain almost unchanged at Y565bn, Sankyo sees pre-tax profits rising 3.3 per cent to Y83bn on a flat growth in sales to Y396bn. Shionogi expects earnings to fall 15.2 per cent to Y19.5bn on a 2.7 per cent decline in sales to Y224bn and Yamanouchi predicts earnings to remain almost flat at Y54.5bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y265bn. Fujisawa forecasts a 9.8 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y18bn on a 3.3 per cent rise in sales to Y227bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Japanese drugs companies results 1993-94 (Y bn)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company        Sales     Change     Pre-tax     Change                             (%)      profit       (%) Takeda         561.6       -0.6        77.2      -0.4 Sankyo         395.7       -0.8        80.4     +14.3 Shionogi       230.2       -3.6        23.0      +6.6 Yamanouchi     259.8       +6.6        54.4      -4.8 Fujisawa       234.9       -0.5        19.9     -12.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

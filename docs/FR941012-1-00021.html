			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Though Test 58 was the lowest cost test, the Agency did not select it for proposal because that test did not include a minimum net worth requirement beyond the $10 million. The Agency believes that an additional net worth requirement that is related to the costs to be assured is important to assure that the firm's environmental costs will not increase the probability of firm failure. For example, if a firm had a net worth of $10 million, but closure and post-closure costs of $100 million, those costs would, in all likelihood, cause the firm to enter bankruptcy. Thus, the Agency eliminated Test 58 from consideration and considered for proposal only those financial tests that had a minimum net worth requirement that considered the size of the obligation to be assured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tests 562 and 130 are identical except for the minimum net worth requirement. Test 130 requires that the firm's minimum net worth be at least $10 million and that it be at least the amount of the closure and post-closure care cost estimate. Test 562 requires a minimum net worth be equal to $10 million plus the closure and post-closure care cost estimate. The Agency selected Test 562 for proposal for several reasons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the Agency believes that requiring a $10 million minimum net worth requirement in addition to net worth equal to the firm's assured costs protects against environmental obligations themselves causing bankruptcy. Second, there was no difference in the availability of Test 130 and Test 562, so there was no compelling reason to select Test 130. Finally, selection of Test 562, which is identical to the corporate financial test proposed for subtitle C follows the Agency's policy of maintaining consistency among programs wherever possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Results of Sensitivity Analysis To Determine Effects of Corrective Action Costs on Test Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> As was mentioned above, the Agency conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether the costs of corrective action would affect the performance of the candidate financial tests. This analysis evaluated the alternative tests for closure, post-closure care, and corrective action costs under three scenarios_corrective action costs equal to 50%, 100%, and 200% of the costs of closure and post-closure. Under each scenario, Test 130 and Test 562 were the lowest cost tests with a minimum net worth requirement related to the size of obligation to be assured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 5. Statement of Accounting Standards Number 106 (FASB 106)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Concerns have been raised by some members of the regulated community that the December 1990 Statement issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, entitled ``Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions (OPEB)'' (FASB 106), adversely impacts their ability to pass the Agency's corporate financial test for their environmental obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) is ultimately responsible for specifying Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for publicly-owned firms, the SEC has informally followed policies developed by the FASB, an independent private organization that is funded by various professional accounting associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, according to FASB 106, employers who do not already account for these benefits as required by the Statement must do so for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992 (This requirement is delayed for certain small, non-public employers to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994). FASB 106 allows employers the option of accounting for these benefits in one year (immediate recognition of OPEB) or over a consecutive number of years (delayed recognition of OPEB).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These members of the regulated community that are concerned about FASB 106 have requested that for Security and Exchange Commission purposes, they be allowed to continue to use the immediate recognition method, but for purposes of the Agency's financial test, they be allowed to use the delayed recognition method. Since both the immediate and delayed recognition of these obligations are allowed by the FASB 106 rule, the Agency believes there is enough flexibility in the regulations to allow recognition of OPEB benefits in the manner described above. A more detailed description of EPA's interpretation of the federal regulations governing the corporate financial test within the context of FASB 106 can be found in the docket in support of this proposal.

Shapiro, Director of the Office of Solid Waste.) The Agency solicits comment on whether the subtitles D and C corporate financial tests should be revised to clarify how owners and operators can account for FASB 106 when using the financial test to demonstrate financial responsibility for their environmental obligations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

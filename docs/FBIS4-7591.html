			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sulejman Ugljanin, chairman of the Muslim </F> National Council for Sandzak, by Amir Hodzic; place and date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] [Hodzic] Mr. Ugljanin, due to the communications  blockade and other blockades in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we are not  in a position to found out more about the real state of affairs  in Sandzak. This is a chance to find out from you about what is  really going on there.    [Ugljanin] The situation in Sandzak is identical to that in  Bosnia-Herzegovina before the war. There are mass arrests of  Muslims, Muslim houses are searched, criminal charges are  brought against them. Generally, this is a form of a refined  state terror. It is nothing new, since with the start of the  war, that is, the Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, a campaign of terror was launched  simultaneously against the Muslims in Sandzak.    You know that since the start of the aggression on  Bosnia-Herzegovina some 74,000 Muslims, women and children,  adults who were expelled from Bosnia have passed through  Sandzak. Some stayed a month, some two months, some stayed a  year, and there are still some 16,000 of them there in Sandzak  in our homes, who live with us. Apart from everything that  happened to them [changes thought] their fears are doubled  because they have experienced something terrible and now they  are expecting even worse to come.    Serbia and Montenegro, you know, planned the ethnic  cleansing  of Muslim and Croatian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the ethnic  cleansing of the Muslim people of Sandzak, and the ethnic  cleansing of the Albanian people of Kosovo. They are doing just  that now. It is obvious. Now it is up to us to prevent that  and have our status justly resolved. You might have heard, the  whole world knows, that we as the national council called on the  people to boycott the elections because of the  Serbian-Montenegrin aggression on Bosnia- Herzegovina, and not  one of our people voted in the Serbian and Montenegrin elections  on 31 May 1992 or 20 December 1992, and the third time [words  indistinct] that we do not have to participate in elections in  the country that has attacked our mother state  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The people completely boycotted the  elections for the third time on 19 December 1993. After that,  when Serbian-Montenegrin authorities realized that the people  are united and determined, that they are nationally aware -- the  people stuck by the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] -- then the  police was sent by the politically defeated Serbia and  Montenegro, and -- you must have heard -- the entire political  leadership of the SDA was arrested. Hamo Hadzic, SDA chairman  for Montenegro, was arrested, so was Rasim [words indistinct];  the entire leadership was arrested between 25 to 31 January this  year.    We have been publishing the statements of the lawyers who  defend them -- a group of Montenegrin lawyers is defending them  -- and the statements issued by the lawyers, the statements  about the arrests given by our people in those prisons: that is  a tragedy -- one can barely comprehend how a man can be such an  animal toward another man. In this case, it has gone even  beyond inhumanity. The attitude of the Serbian and Montenegrin  authorities toward the Muslims in Sandzak is identical to the  attitude in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The only difference is that we  do not have the shelling.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Radius Shares in Radius fell 6p to 27p yesterday after the USM-quoted computer systems and maintenance company said that following a particularly bad third quarter operating losses for the second half to December 31 would be broadly similar to the first. However, based on the continuing growth in sales of the group's new products, directors expect a return to profits in 1994. Pre-tax losses of Pounds 466,000 were reported for the first half.</p>

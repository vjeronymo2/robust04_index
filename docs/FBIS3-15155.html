			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Liga Laizane: "Inhabitants of Skrunda Do Not </F> Want Radar Station To Operate for Four More Years"]    [Excerpts] Riga, 16 Feb -- Authorities of the villages  situated in the area of the Skrunda radar station are  dissatisfied with the government's intention to sign an  agreement with Russia whereby the station will continue  operation for another four years, followed by an additional 18  months to dismantle the installation. Today, at a session of  the people's deputies in the House of Culture in Skrunda, in  which local inhabitants took part, a decision was made to ask  the Latvian Government to ensure that the functioning of the  radar base be ended at the same time as the foreign army  withdrawal is completed.    This decision was accepted notwithstanding the explanations  of Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, leader of the Latvia's Way  Faction Andreys Panteleyevs, or the Minister for Special Tasks  Edvins Inkens, who tried to persuade the citizens that Latvia  would only gain if the agreement was signed and there would be a  precise time set for the radar station to cease operations.    A. Panteleyevs said that if the agreement would meet the  requirements of the Latvian Government, it would contain a point  stating that the facility should be dismantled immediately after  the agreement is concluded. The old radar has gone out of date  and it is not foreseen that it could be operated for more than  four years. During this period, everything should be done to  make Russia invest money in building a radar station in  Baranoviche, in Belarus.    V. Birkavs emphasized in his turn, that by signing this  agreement Latvia could integrate quicker into Europe. He said  advantage should be taken of the support of European  international organizations -- the prime minister mentioned in  particular the friendly attitude toward Latvia of the leaders of  the Western European Union -- to conclude the agreement with  Russia. V. Birkavs also reported what he had learned during his  visit to the United States -- there is great interest concerning  the Skrunda radar base, yet the leaders of foreign countries  usually do not give concrete advice; such advice must be found  by the Latvian Government itself.    E. Inkens explained that the agreement would make it  possible  to more effectively control the functioning of the radar  station. Currently, there is no such possibility to do this.  Answering questions from the citizens gathered, V. Birkavs  reported that Denmark has promised to send concrete material aid  as well as its experts to control the environmental situation in  Skrunda. [passage omitted]    Specifying the facts due to which the Skrunda station ought  to be closed immediately, in addition to those already known --  such as a greater instance of diseases among inhabitants than  anywhere else, especially children, the negative influence upon  the environment, and pollution -- the inspector for environment  protection Igo Midrian also mentioned the great amount of freon  which is used in the station's cold storage plants. This could  create complications for Latvia when it ratifies the Montreal  convention on ozone protection. Therefore, the agreement should  foresee a clause stating that freon used by the radar station be  put on the account of Russia.    The inhabitants also expressed their dissatisfaction  concerning the amount of compensation -- $2 million. According  to them, the sum is too small. They also expressed a view that  it is necessary to establish a special local medical center,  because according to the head doctor at Skrunda hospital,  Martins Abolins, diseases in this region have a more serious  nature than in other areas of Latvia. V. Birkavs made a promise  that the entire amount of the obtained compensation will be used  to meet the needs of the inhabitants of the area effected by the  radar station. He also allowed for the possibility that  inhabitants who feel that their health is endangered be provided  with a place to live outside of the area for the next four years.    The operation of the Skrunda radar station is being felt in  the area of Skrunda, as well as in the villages of Ranki, Laida,  Rudbarzi, Snepele, Nikraca, and Turlava, including Kuldiga,  which has 40,000 inhabitants.</p>

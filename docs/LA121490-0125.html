			<p><P> December 14, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> CHARGERS;  </P> <P> AGENT TELLS PHILLIPS' SIDE  </P> <P> One of the attorneys representing nose tackle Joe Phillips said Thursday that  the Chargers have misrepresented his client's salary demands.  </P> <P> "We've been a little aggravated by the Chargers' characterization of the  situation," attorney David Morway said. "Joe Phillips is not asking for 100  percent of his salary.  </P> <P> "The day he went into Bobby Beathard's office he said he came to play and  wanted to be paid from that day forward and be covered by insurance.  </P> <P> "He went home and found a message on his machine that advised him he would be  paid half of his salary. They said they wanted to see him on the practice field  first. They wanted him to come out for nothing, and they decided to activate  him he would have to sign a new contract and agree to a broad (liability)  waiver. That was just too much."  </P> <P> Phillips has stayed away from San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium since last week,  but he will appear at a press conference Tuesday to discuss his situation. The  Chargers have said they will leave Phillips on the reserve/non-football injury  list for the remainder of the season, and, although not obligated to do so,  will pay him half of his salary.  </P> <P> "The idea that he wants 100 percent of his pay and that he's spoiled and  selfish is so inaccurate," Morway said. "The reason he's holding off the press  conference until next week is so that he doesn't become a distraction to the  team."  </P> <P> Phillips, who started the team's first three games, was beaten badly outside a  Mission Beach restaurant on Sept. 26.  </P> <P> Coach Dan Henning said he was a little concerned with nagging injuries to wide  receiver Anthony Miller, but Miller practiced and said he was ready for the  Broncos.  </P> <P> Henning said Miller has been bothered by a sore leg and buttocks.  </P> <P> Wide receiver Nate Lewis caught passes with a cast on his hand, and Henning  said later that Lewis would be "upgraded from doubtful to semi-doubtful."

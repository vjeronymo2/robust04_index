			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / BR pensions 'at risk', say trustees THE government's proposals for the privatisation of British Rail put BR pensioners at risk because there is no safeguard against a shortfall in investment income, according to the scheme's trustees and managers. The board of trustees, which includes representatives of BR management and staff, will send a letter to pension scheme members later this week urging them to contact their MPs to express their concerns. 'The trustee company and the management committee consider that the government's choice is still not as secure as the current BR pension scheme. It still leaves pensioners unprotected against any future investment shortfall,' the letter says. 'It places their pensions at risk in the future because, if enacted, it removes the present, strong protections against any investment shortfall.' The trustees want a government 'solvency' guarantee to insure against a sustained period of poor investment returns at a time when the scheme has few contributing members. They expressed their concerns in a meeting with Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, on June 24. Mr MacGregor indicated that he 'wished to find a solution acceptable to all sides'. He has asked his advisers to explore options with BR's actuarial adviser and a further meeting is expected. The letter follows the government's decision in May to back down from its earlier, more controversial, proposal to seize a portion of the scheme's Pounds 8.5bn assets in exchange for a promise to pay scheme members' pensions and increase them annually in line with inflation. Following a public outcry over the proposal Mr MacGregor announced that the government would instead use the assets to create a scheme in which all current employees may participate as long as they remain in the rail industry. A portion of those assets are to be set aside to pay the benefits of present and deferred pensioners. While the trustees feel the current proposals are much better than the earlier ones, they leave open the possibility that pensioners' benefits may have to be cut if investment income is not as high as expected. The pensions clause in the railways bill is set to be debated again in the House of Lords on July 19 and 21 and will return to the Commons for its final reading towards the end of September.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / UN bars oil, arms for Haiti THE UN Security Council agreed early today to impose an oil and arms embargo on Haiti in a tougher attempt to restore Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide to the presidency after his ouster by the military in 1991. A mandatory resolution was adopted unanimously by the council after several days of talks on the lengthy text. The resolution also calls for the freezing of overseas bank accounts and other financial assets of the current Haitian leadership, which the UN has declared illegitimate. However, the measures will not go into effect until next Wednesday to allow more time for negotiations aimed at reinstating Fr Aristide. Mr Dante Caputo, a former Argentine foreign minister serving as UN mediator in the crisis, has scheduled new talks, excluding the military, and he insists all participants must accept in advance the ousted president's legitimacy. The embargo would supersede voluntary - and largely ineffective - sanctions recommended by the Organisation of American States, which has been working closely with the UN throughout the crisis. Since the US halted its oil shipments, Haiti has obtained most of its oil from Europe, with the Netherlands reported to be a main supplier. Haitian oil stocks are likely to run out at the end of July, so sanctions must be applied as quickly as possible to avoid stockpiles being built up. Enforcing the embargo could create problems as Haiti shares a border with the Dominican Republic and, theoretically, could receive oil smuggled overland.</p>

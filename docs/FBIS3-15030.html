			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "News Bulletin" No. 41/94] </F>   [Text] The Estonian-Russian negotiations continued in  Lohusalu yesterday. The plenary session was followed by the  discussions of different work groups. Another plenary session  is to take place today.    The Russian Foreign Ministry announced the replacement of  six  delegation members. The new members include the head of  administration of the Leningrad region Alexander Belyakov,  deputy head of administration of the Pskov region Viktor  Zvonkov, deputy head of the Russian Federal Migration Service  Yuri Roshtchin and department head of the Russian Ministry of  Nationalities and Ethnic Policy Lev Shishov. The latter used to  be a high-ranking official of the Estonian Communist Party in  the Soviet period.    Head of the Russian delegation Vasily Svirin expressed his  hopes of making progress in the key issues -- the situation of  the Russian-speaking residents and the troops withdrawal.  Svirin assured that the withdrawal deadline, August 31, is  definite, provided Estonia will finance the construction of  apartments and will agree with Russia to give up demands for  compensation for the military bases and the ecological damage  caused by the military. But he added that "Estonia does not  meet those three requirements at present and the final troop  withdrawal deadline will be agreed upon only after the signing  of the corresponding agreements."    The Foreign Ministry announced that the Estonian-Russian  negotiations may be suspended if the claims of the Russian  Foreign Ministry official Alexander Udaltsov will become an  official government position. Estonia is willing to discuss all  issues including the one on the military pensioners, but will  not link them to the troops withdrawal, the Foreign Ministry  stressed.    Prime Minister Mart Laar described the Russian statements as  an attempt to influence Estonia and present new demands. Laar  added that the negotiations are practically at a deadlock and  pointed out that Russia has stopped the withdrawal of its troops  from January 1.    The Russian Foreign Ministry official Udaltsov expressed his  surprise at the Estonian Foreign Ministry statement and claimed  that the Estonian side had been long aware that August 31 was  not an officially agreed-upon deadline.</p>

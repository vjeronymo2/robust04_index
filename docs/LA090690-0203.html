			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUNSET LEAGUE FOOTBALL PREVIEW;  </P> <P> BURYING THE PAST HELPS HUNTINGTON BEACH BEGIN AGAIN  </P> <P> If it were another day at another school, it might have been a routine football  meeting.  </P> <P> Players filed into the physical education building, checked out equipment, said  hello to teammates and coaches, then sat quietly in front of their lockers.  </P> <P> There was nothing unusual about that.  </P> <P> But before the Huntington Beach High School football team could begin the 1990  season, it had to bury the past one final time.  </P> <P> Each current player who was a member of the 1989 team stood and said a few  words about what last season meant to him.  </P> <P> The players spoke of winning a share of the Sunset League championship, only  the third for the school in 27 years, then having it taken away because the  Oilers used an ineligible player.  </P> <P> Instead of a league co-championship, an 8-2 overall record and a berth in the  Southern Section playoff berth, the Oilers made court appearances. They won  Round 1, but ultimately a judge's restraining order was overturned and the  Oilers were thrown out of the playoffs again.  </P> <P> On Aug. 20, the first day the Southern Section allowed teams to practice, the  Oilers talked about it one by one.  </P> <P> "OK, it's over," Huntington Beach Coach George Pascoe said when it was his  turn. "That's the last I want to hear about it."  </P> <P> So it is that Huntington Beach, 8-2 overall and 4-1 in league play on the field  last season, but 0-10, 0-5 in the standings, begins its season.  </P> <P> The Oilers play their long-awaited season opener against Corona del Mar, the  defending Division VI champions, at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> Going against a Southern Section champion isn't the way most coaches would like  to begin their season, but Huntington Beach's case is different. The Oilers  want to get on with the business of playing football.  </P> <P> There is talk among Sunset League coaches that Huntington Beach again could  challenge for the league championship. At the very least, the Oilers will  contend with Edison, Ocean View and newcomer Santa Ana for playoff berths.  </P> <P> "I'm glad to hear it," Pascoe said. "It's a little premature. Let us play a few  games, and then I might agree."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach has 24 lettermen, including nine starters, back from last  season's team. Some league coaches believe the Oilers have something to prove  this year.  </P> <P> "Huntington Beach is going to be tough this year," Ocean View Coach Howard Isom  said. "I think they're on a mission. The kids have got to feel they have  something to prove. It was kind of a shame. They were a good team."  </P> <P> Huntington Beach had won only two league championships in 27 years when the  Oilers ran onto Sheue Field for a nonleague opener against Corona del Mar last  season.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar would go on to win the Division VI title. But that night the  Oilers slugged their way to a 19-6 victory.  </P> <P> Pacifica, Newport Harbor and Long Beach Wilson also fell, and the Oilers took a  4-0 record into their final nonleague game, against Mater Dei.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach lost that game, but only lost one more and earned a share of  the Sunset League championship.  </P> <P> The celebration didn't last long, though. The day after the final league game,  league principals ruled that Huntington Beach must forfeit all eight victories,  the league co-championship and its berth in the playoffs because the Oilers  used an ineligible player all season. The player was ruled ineligible for  failing to fulfill residency requirements.  </P> <P> Three days later, Judge Thomas Thrasher issued a restraining order against the  Southern Section, which restored the eight victories, the co-championship and  the playoff berth.  </P> <P> Newspaper reporters and TV crews crowded around the players and coaches and  their family and friends as they left the courthouse.  </P> <P> But two days later the Southern Section won the final court battle. Once again,  the Oilers were out of the playoffs. This time for good.  </P> <P> "You can never take away the record those kids had," Pascoe said. "In their  hearts it was taken away. I told the kids, 'I have a lot of fond memories from  last year too. But that's the last I want to hear about it.' "  </P> <P> But now the Oilers have a chance to erase those memories.  </P> <P> "It's been a great two (now three) weeks of practice," said Pascoe, who sounded  relieved the new season was at hand.  </P> <P> Tomorrow: Small schools.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PREP FOOTBALL '90: THE SUNSET LEAGUE  </P> <P> Edison  </P> <P> Coach: Dave White (fifth year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 10-3, 5-0  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 10  </P> <P> Returning starters: one on offense, six on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Chip Anderson, DE, 5-10, 170, Sr.; Keith Burke, DB, 6-0, 179,  Sr.; Scott Boslow, NG, 5-8, 166, Sr.; Mike Cunningham, WR-DB, 6-0, 174, Sr.;  Brent Hanson, K-P, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Mike Hawks, DB, 5-11, 176, Sr.; Greg  Schnabel, OT, 6-3, 236, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Kenny Chalabian, DB, 5-8, 159, Sr.; Ryan Blanchard, WR, 6-2,  177, Sr.; Josh Gingrich, QB, 6-0, 190, Sr.; Mark Lamson, DL, 5-9, 169, Jr.;  J.R. Schusterick, RB, 5-10, 190, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Edison's defense figured to carry the team this season. So far they've  reinforced that notion. In a 12-0 victory over Honolulu Iolani Friday, the  Chargers allowed only 25 yards rushing. Six starters return on defense,  including Cunningham and Hawks, making this a veteran defensive unit.  Cunningham showed his versatility last week, returning five punts for 81 yards,  catching six passes for 77 and also getting an interception. Gingrich, who  completed 11 of 20 passes for 128 yards, has led the Chargers to Sunset League  titles on the freshman, sophomore and junior varsity levels. However, the  Chargers must replace 13 all-league players, including quarterback Donnie Smith  and running back Shane Sherman, from a team that advanced to the Division I  semifinals last year.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P> <P> Coach: Mike Milner (12th year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 4-7, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 16  </P> <P> Returning starters: two on offense, two on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Randy Cowell, DE, 6-2, 215, Sr.; Dave Dardis, DB, 5-7, 155, Sr.;  Karl Schroller, OT, 6-7, 280, Sr.; Brian Williams, TB, 6-1, 190, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Ryan Bertoni, QB, 6-1, 180, Jr.; Derek Capps, OL-DL, 5-11, 215,  Sr.; Marcos Diaz, QB, 6-1, 180, Sr.; Todd Gordon, P-WR, 6-2, 180, Sr.; Rocky  Gubernick, WR-DB, 5-9, 170, Jr.; Craig Hurley, C, 6-1, 225, Sr.; Sean Mahony,  RB-DE, 5-9, 180, Sr.; Tom Nix, K, 5-7, 140, Sr.; Mike Pecen, FB-LB, 5-11, 200,  Sr.; Mike Reiley, OL-DL, 6-6, 250, Sr.; Zack Sheppard, WR-DB, 6-1, 170, Sr.;  Bobby Smith, WR-DB, 6-1, 185, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Gone are the days when Fountain Valley attracted 80 to 90 players to  its varsity team. The Barons have fewer than 40 on the roster, the fewest in  the 19 years Milner has been at the school. "Depth is going to be crucial,"  Milner said. "If we don't get anybody hurt we're going to be a representative  football team when league starts. (But) there are a lot of questions. Our  biggest problems are we're very young and inexperienced." Two years ago,  Fountain Valley won the Division I championship, 31-24, over Bishop Amat. But  declining enrollment in the Huntington Beach Union High School District has hit  Fountain Valley hard.  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P> <P> Coach: George Pascoe (seventh year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 0-10, 0-5  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 24  </P> <P> Returning starters: five on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Don Berger, OL-LB, 6-1, 208, Sr.; Jeff Brentlinger, OL-LB, 6-1,  220, Sr.; Adrian Brown, WR-DB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Joe Contreras, TB-DB, 5-9, 170,  Sr.; Robert Griffin, OL-DL, 6-2, 215, Sr.; Gabe Houston, FB-LB, 6-0, 200, Sr.;  Gabe Stupin, TE-LB, 6-1, 200, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Alan Arakaki, WR-DB, 5-9, 155, Sr.; Mike Bolster, OL-DL, 6-2,  250, Jr.; Adam Bowermaster, RB-DB, 6-0, 185, Sr.; Mike Chavira, QB, 6-1, 175,  Sr.; Jack Friend, QB, 6-2, 205, Sr.; Scott Jansen, WR-DB, 6-5, 215, Sr.; James  Mariett, RB-DB, 5-7, 165, Sr.; Garrett Stinson, OL-LB, 6-2, 215, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Offensively, the Oilers will run a balanced, passing and running  attack. They have three of five offensive linemen back from last year's team.  "Defensively, we've got to rebuild," Pascoe said. Last year, the Oilers allowed  only four rushing touchdowns and yielded 108.4 yards rushing per game, a league  low. Pascoe believes this team could be stingy too. "The defensive line stands  out," Pascoe said. "The linebackers are great. We're really doing a good job in  the secondary." Where would Pascoe like to improve? "The kicking game," he  said. "We need to find a punter. That's everyone's quest. We're going to have  open tryouts."  </P> <P> Marina  </P> <P> Coach: John Seeley (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 3-7, 1-4  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 18  </P> <P> Returning starters: two on offense, four on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Dave Armstrong, K, 5-7, 140, Sr.; Chad Durand, LB, 6-2, 190,  Sr.; Shawn Fulford, FB, 5-11, 215, Sr.; Mike Johnston, LB, 5-10, 180, Sr.; Todd  Lewis, LB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Christin McLemore, QB, 6-0, 175, Sr.; Frank Marvitz,  DE, 6-2, 225, Sr.; Axel Paner, DB, 5-3, 120, Sr.; Rick Rice, DT, 6-3, 260, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Dave Anderson, WR, 6-2, 180, Jr.; Chris Della Crosce, DB, 5-9,  160, Jr.; Greg Escamilla, C, 6-0, 205, Jr.; Josh Housman, OL, 6-4, 235, Jr.;  Steve Jackson, DB, 6-0, 185, Jr.; John McLoud, OL, 6-0, 225, Jr.; Bob Stewart,  OL, 6-0, 215, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: Last season, the Vikings just wanted to win. A 17-7 nonleague victory  over Lakewood ended an 18-game losing streak. That accomplished, the Vikings  are moving toward bigger goals this year. "We want to win some league games and  make the playoffs," Seeley said. The Vikings relied on the pass last year with  quarterback David Schultz. This season, they're going to the option with  McLemore, who played wide receiver last year. Seeley believes the Vikings'  strength is its running and offensive line. Fulford, a linebacker who was moved  to the backfield late in the season, and Lewis, a starter last season, will be  the Viking running backs.  </P> <P> Ocean View  </P> <P> Coach: Howard Isom (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 7-4, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 22  </P> <P> Returning starters: two on offense, one on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jeff Bush, WR-DB, 5-10, 160, Sr.; Albert Fanoga, WR, 5-11, 180,  Jr.; Chad Godfirnon, OL-DL, 6-1, 225, Sr.; Randy Karliner, QB, 6-1 1/2, 200,  Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Dennis Eichen, WR-DB, 5-9, 160, Sr.; Joe Fraser, FB-LB, 5-10,  180, Jr.; Chris Hooton, WR-DB, 6-0, 170, Sr.; Rich Jones, OL-LB, 6-0, 190, Sr.;  Chris Muat, OL-DL, 6-0, 200, Jr.; Peter Ohm, DB-WR, 5-7, 150, Jr.; Norris  Perez, LB, 6-0, 180, Sr.; Robert Romine, OL-DL, 5-10, 217, Sr.; Bob Schiel,  OL-DL, 6-0, 200, Sr.; Garrick Twedt, WR-DB, 5-8, 150, Jr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Seahawks, league co-champions last season, have built their  offense around two of the league's top players. Karliner, a three-year starter  at quarterback, threw for 1,622 yards and 17 touchdowns as the Seahawks made  their first Southern Section playoff appearance. Fanoga caught 21 passes for  363 yards and three touchdowns. But Isom said the Seahawks' success will hinge  on their young offensive and defensive lines. "It'll boil down to the guys in  the trenches," Isom said. Of Karliner, Isom said, "He's one of those guys  that's fun to sit and watch."  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P> <P> Coach: Dick Hill (seventh year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 9-3, 4-1  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 20  </P> <P> Returning starters: four on offense, three on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jesse Gomez, OL-DL, 6-0, 230, Sr.; Tommy Gray, OL, 6-0, 220,  Jr.; Efen Nava, DE-TE, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Albert Perez, QB-DB, 6-1, 170, Sr.; Gus  Plasencia, K-P, 6-0, 175, Sr.; Al Rivas, RB-DB, 5-10, 180, Sr.; George Salazar,  OL-DL, 6-1, 265, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Rene Cadena, RB-DB, 5-8, 170, Sr.; Marco Contreras, QB, 5-11,  180, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Saints have been called a favorite and a playoff contender, and  then there are the words of one coach, who said, "I have no idea how they'll  do." Over the past few years, Santa Ana's great team speed and physical ability  have produced one of the county's most consistent programs. The Saints left the  Century League having won or shared four consecutive league titles. This year's  team will miss defender Oscar Wilson, a three-time all-county selection by The  Times, running back Garner Hicks and quarterback Jesse Rosas. Plasencia is one  of the most accurate kickers in the county and could give the Saints added  scoring punch. Rivas showed his potential at running back, gaining 104 yards in  17 carries in a 38-21 victory over Canyon when Hicks couldn't start because of  a leg injury. However, he is academically ineligible for the first half of the  season.  </P> <P> Westminster  </P> <P> Coach: Stan Clark (second year)  </P> <P> 1989 record: 2-8, 2-3  </P> <P> Returning lettermen: 15  </P> <P> Returning starters: five on offense, nine on defense  </P> <P> Top returnees: Jeff Lancaster, OL-DL, 5-11, 220, Sr.; Christian Moore, WR-DB,  5-10, 175, Jr.; Ross Rodriguez, RB-DB, 5-11, 180, Sr.; Vance Senteno, RB-LB,  5-11, 175, Sr.; Eric Wilkins, TE-LB, 6-3, 195, Sr.  </P> <P> Top newcomers: Matt Bailey, QB, 6-0, 165, Jr.; Gabriel Blevins, RB, 5-11, 175,  Sr.; Kirk Pierce, QB, 6-0, 165, Sr.; Myong Kim, DL, 5-10, 170, Sr.  </P> <P> Outlook: The Lions missed the playoffs last year for the first time in five  seasons. It's likely that, barring a string of luck and some unexpected  performances, the Lions will again miss the playoffs. They started this season  with a sluggish, 14-7, loss to Robert E. Lee of Springfield, Va., last  Thursday, giving up the game-winning touchdown in the final minute. Pierce was  five for nine for 42 yards in his debut at quarterback. Last season, he was the  understudy to starter John Shipp. Bailey also played in the Lee game as Clark  searched for some consistency in his offense. Clark, who was co-coach with Jack  Bowman for two seasons, never found it, however. Senteno, the Lions best player  and an all-league linebacker, led the team in tackles last season. He also is  the leading rusher and receiver back from last season's team.  </P></p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Aston Martin output spurred by owner Ford Aston Martin Lagonda, the luxury sports-car manufacturer, intends to raise production to about 1,500 cars a year by the late 1990s from only 144 last year. Ford, the US vehicle-maker which bought a 75 per cent stake in the company in 1987, has taken 100 per cent control with the purchase of the small outstanding minority stake held by the Livanos shipping family. The fortunes of Aston Martin have been transformed through the takeover. Ford injected Pounds 50m in new equity last year. Aston Martin output should increase fivefold next year to about 800 cars with the launch of the DB7 sports car. Developed at a cost of about Pounds 50m, the DB7 will go on sale next month priced in the UK at Pounds 78,500. It will be launched in North America at the end of next year. Production of the DB7 is expected to total about 150 in the final months of this year, rising to 700 next year. Mr John Oldfield, executive chairman of Aston Martin Lagonda, said that the introduction of the DB7 marked the 'start of the new Aston Martin. It will build the volume base on which Aston Martin will secure its future.' He said the company was planning to develop a second range for launch in 1998-99. This is expected to be a four-door, four-seater sports saloon based on the Lagonda Vignale concept car shown at last year's Geneva motor show. The DB7 is a two-door coupe powered by a 3.2-litre, six-cylinder supercharged engine. It has a top speed of 165 mph and produces 335 horsepower. Mr Oldfield said that the sports saloon could be powered by a Ford V12 engine now undergoing prototype development in the US. Aston Martin Lagonda, which had a turnover last year of Pounds 13.96m, is forecasting a rise to a turnover of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 55m next year. The workforce is rising from about 270 to 420 by spring next year. The company has created a new production facility for the production of the DB7 at Bloxham, Oxfordshire, with the takeover of the facility used to build the Jaguar XJ220 supercar. Production of the XJ220 ceased this year.</p>

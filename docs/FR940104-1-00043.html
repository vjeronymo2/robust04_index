			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. NHTSA is considering whether to propose a ``high to low mu surface transaction test.'' This test is designed to evaluate the response for the ABS when the vehicle begins braking on a high mu surface then experiences a change to a low mu surface. This type of surface is discussed in the previous question. The agency is considering whether to require that the vehicle's wheels not lock for more than 0.2 seconds, with wheel lock defined as 100 percent slip. What benefits would be obtained from such a surface transition test? What problems, if any, would be associated with this test maneuver? Would this test be a sufficient indicator of the modulation control and the response to impending wheel lock expected from an ABS-equipped light vehicle? How would rear-wheel only antilock systems perform under this test procedure?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. The efficiency of an ABS affects a vehicle's stopping distance performance with the ABS cycling. Consistent with the agency's decision in the heavy vehicle ABS rulemaking not to propose stopping distance requirements with tests involving low mu surfaces, NHTSA does not anticipate proposing, at this stage of this rulemaking, stopping distance requirements with the curve, split mu, or transaction tests because of the variability of vehicle stopping distance performance on low mu surfaces. Do commenters agree with the agency's tentative decision not to propose stopping distance requirements with tests involving low mu surfaces?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Notwithstanding this tentative decision, NHTSA believes that a measurement of efficiency might provide consumers with information to compare the relative overall performance of various ABSs. In its evaluations, the agency has calculated ABS efficiency by dividing vehicle decelerations (g's) by the peak friction coefficient measured with the vehicle's tire. The agency notes that an ABS efficiency value could provide consumers with a means of comparing the ABS performance capability since no stopping distance requirements are being considered for the tests mentioned in this notice to evaluate ABS performance. Each antilock system achieves a certain level of efficiency based on design factors such as the wheel deceleration rate threshold at which ABS cycling begins, the control algorithm, and the modulator valves. In general, the higher the ABS efficiency, the shorter the stopping distance should be with the ABS operational. NHTSA's light vehicle ABS testing has shown that the improvements in braking performance provided by an ABS varies, in some cases considerably, from system to system and from vehicle to vehicle. Hence, simply setting a standard that requires all-wheel ABS would not necessarily mean that the performance of these systems would be similar. The agency therefore request comments on what would be an appropriate method for measuring ABS efficiency, and whether ABS efficiency would be a meaningful indicator of a system's overall performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. The current requirements in Standard No. 105 for vehicles with failed antilock systems including stopping distance requirements from 60 mph of 456 feet for passenger cars and 517 feet for other light vehicles with a GVWR of not more than 10,000 pounds. This test is designed to ensure that the vehicle has adequate braking if the ABS fails. These distances may be overly generous for an ABS failure on some vehicles, given that the service brake system is generally still intact. NHTSA anticipates proposing ABS failure requirements for Standard No. 105 similar to those proposed for Standard No. 135. In that rulemaking, the agency proposed a stopping distance of 279 feet from a test speed of 62 mph on a surface with a PFC of 0.9. What problems, if any, would be associated with such a requirement? Should the standard allow an ABS that experiences a large degradation of stopping performance if the ABS fails? What is the best method for disabling an ABS for a failed system test? Should performance requirements for integrated ABSs be any different from the requirements for add-on ABSs, in the failed condition? If so, why? Should the failed ABS stopping distance be one absolute value for all vehicles, or should it be based on the performance relative to the stopping distance performance when each vehicle's ABS is in the ``on'' position?  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

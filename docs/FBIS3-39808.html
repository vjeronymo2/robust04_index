Speaking at the 50th  session of the Commission in Geneva, the leader of the Indian  delegation, Mr. Atal Behari Vajapayee, said the promotion and  protection of human rights cannot be ensured through mutual  recrimination, and far less through violence and terrorism. He  said this was not the time for faultfinding in the name of  fact-finding, and the issue of human rights must not be used for  sectarian ends. Mr. Vajpayee assured the delegates that India  has always worked in a spirit of openness and transparency. The  efforts of the government is to create greater transparency  regarding the actual situation of Jammu and Kashmir. Mr.  Vajpayee said that setting up of an independent Human Rights  Commission by India is an indication of the government's resolve  to protect these rights.    Earlier, exercising the right to reply to Pakistan's  allegations of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir,  India asked the international community to declare Pakistan as a  state sponsoring terrorism for its support to militants in Jammu  and Kashmir. Miss Neelam Sabarwarl, who exercised the right to  reply, rejected as baseless Islamabad's charges of human rights  violations. She said Pakistan's sole objective is territorial  expansion through violence and deception. The Indian delegates  told the Commission that Jammu and Kashmir, like the rest of  India, is a multireligious, multiethnic society in which Hindus,  Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, and Christians have lived in harmony  until Pakistan introduced religion-based separatism through its  policy of sponsoring terrorism. During Nawaz Sharif's reign as  Pakistani premier, the U.S. had placed Pakistan on its watchlist  of states sponsoring terrorism, she added. The Indian delegation  also drew the attention of the Human Rights Commission to  Pakistan's dismal record on human rights. Miss Sabarwal said  Pakistan has introduced a system in which its citizens are  identified on the basis of their religion. She said this is  nothing but religious apartheid at its worst.    Speaking before the Commission, an alternate leader of the  Indian delegation, Ms. Justice Sujata Manohar, said that  religious intolerance and extremism and use of religion-based  terrorism for extraterritorial ambitions are the real threats to  the enjoyment of human rights. She pointed out that the  systematic religious extremism has led to the exodus of about 2  and one-half lakh [250,000] non-Muslims and as many as 50,000  Muslims from the valley.    An organization of the Kashmiri pundits [Hindu sect] told  the  Commission that the genocide and the cleansing of the minority  community in the valley by Pakistani-sponsored terrorism has  forced the exodus from their homeland. Presenting their case  before the Commission, they said that the pundits are living the  life of exile as their rights to live with dignity and honor in  their homeland have been snatched away by terrorists.</p>

			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / International Company News: SA leisure group ahead at midway SUN International Bophutatswana (Sunbop), the South African hotel and leisure group, overcame recessionary economic conditions to record a 19 per cent rise in attributable earnings to R106m (Dollars 38.2m) in the six months to December. Turnover rose by 24 per cent to R483.4m and operating profit was 25 per cent higher at R140.5m. Interest received fell substantially due to internal funding of its Carousel and Lost City projects. The group, whose hotels are all situated in the homeland of Bophutatswana, recorded an average occupancy of 78 per cent for the six months. This was in line with its 1990 performance, but well ahead of industry averages with most hotels suffering badly from the recession. Sunbop is spending R1.1bn in developing Carousel and Lost City, an extension of its Sun City resort. Carousel, a gambling resort, opened in November and the R750m Lost City project will open by December. Sunbop has raised more than R300m for the funding of these projects through a R178m rights issue and by offering scrip dividends which were heavily taken up. Mr Sol Kerzner, chairman, said the group's good performance through the recession was testimony to its policy of building quality resorts which were 'exciting and unique'. He said the group had adhered strictly to a value-for-money policy. Explaining the large capital expenditure programme, Mr Kerzner said that the changes in South Africa had led to a 'very significant enhancement of its tourism potential'. He expected 'extraordinary growth' in local tourism. The Lost City project will double the size of conference facilities at the Sun City resort, which are the largest in the region.</p>

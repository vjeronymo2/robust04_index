			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Fashion: Off-the-cuff tales of men's shirts - Alan Wilkinson-Marten Alan Wilkinson-Marten, architect, associate at Norman Foster and Partners: 'I buy for myself because I'm single but anyway I love browsing in the Kings Road and Covent Garden. 'Quality and style are important. A shirt should be very simple - easy-fitting, finely-stitched in good cotton with interesting buttons. As I like plain white shirts, these details are important. I pay more to get the right design. Adolfo Dominguez is my favourite but I like the very subtle patterns and good make-for-price of the new Van Heusen range. 'I work with sleeves rolled up so double cuffs are not on. Jacket and tie are not necessary in the office but for outside meetings a shirt must look good under an unstructured, Italian suit. For work in the Far East, a white shirt and jacket is the convention. I take cheap, short-sleeved ones but they don't last long.'</p>

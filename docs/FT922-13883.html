			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Survey of Management Education and Training (4): New culture sweeps out bureaucracies - The Public Sector BUSINESS SCHOOLS conjure up visions of high-flying MBAs, aggressive corporate executives and mega-buck courses and conferences. The idea of nurses and teachers - let alone charity workers - rubbing shoulders with managing directors seems quaint, almost absurd. In many of the major management schools, it is quaint. A day in Insead and the words 'public sector' go unheard; the nearest the London Business School's executive programmes get to them is courses for ambassadors and senior Home Office officials. Increasingly, however, business schools are waking up to the public and not-for-profit sectors, and vice versa. The growth in part-time and distance learning MBAs has been in no small part geared to them (not excepting LBS), and courses are following, too. 'Management' has ceased - just - to be a dirty word in the public sector. With hardly a country in Europe and the Americas standing apart from the trend, a new managerial culture is sweeping through state bureaucracies. Devolved responsibility, profit centres, even autonomous trading funds, are increasingly widespread; and as privatisation reduces the size of the state machine, the cultural insularity of public sectors is progressively weakening. Britain has gone further than most in all those directions. Privatisation has cut the state sector in half in a decade. In the remaining half, trusts, contracts and fundholding are advancing in the health service, compulsory tendering in local government, and devolved budgets and administration in state schools and colleges. Not even Whitehall is immune: under the 'next steps' programme more than half of all its civil servants now work in semi-autonomous executive agencies and the proportion is set to rise to three-quarters by mid-decade. The management implications are dramatic: almost overnight the typical secondary schools head or fundholding GP is finding himself a multi-million pound manager, in most cases with nothing but 20 years at the blackboard or in a hospital/practice as preparation. Management education in the public sector is no longer limited to high-flying civil servants taking courses at the civil service training college at Sunningdale (itself barely 20 years old - and now an agency): it is spreading to every school and hospital in the land. Of the National Health Service alone Dr Christina Townsend of the NHS Training Directorate says: 'We have a million employees, of whom 240,000 can be designated as managers - after all, as soon as you become a ward sister you take on significant management responsibilities.' The directorate is pioneering a training strategy to give all managerial staff a nationally recognised qualification through distance-learning programmes. Courses have been developed with the Open University and the Institute of Health Service Management. 'We were particularly keen to ensure proper back up and to see that case material directly relates to the health service,' says Dr Townsend. 'If you just produce training materials, they won't use them: a lot of our work has to be done to ensure there are local tutors and mentors to give support.' The courses were launched last year. The first-year take-up target was 1,000 managers: in the event 1,500 signed up, and the directorate is revising its targets. The Open Business School, which claims to be Europe's largest business school with 25,000 course registrations this year, gears many of its distance learning courses to the new market. The OBS's professional certificate in management - the first of three levels leading up to an MBA - runs a foundation course specifically for the voluntary and non-profit sector. Leading clients include Barnardo's and the Red Cross. 'Nothing like it has been produced before in the UK or elsewhere,' claims Mr Rob Paton, senior lecturer at OBS. 'It shares the successes of the voluntary sector and its unsung heroes.' Another option at certificate level is 'managing health services'. Aimed at health service managers 'regardless of their profession or occupation', its content is fairly general - 'managing yourself and your job', 'managing people', 'managing in your organisation' and 'managing in the external environment' are the principal modules. The course fee is Pounds 825, with a reduced rate of Pounds 695 for health service employees. The OBS has also launched a new MBA option on 'Managing Public Services', aimed directly at managers in the civil service, NHS, local government and the police. Organised into three blocks and a project, it tackles issues including the differences between public and private sector management, the working of internal markets, competition between agencies supplying public services and innovations in resource management. Some parts of Britain's public sector are more active on the management education scene than others. Local government, with tightly constrained resources, has tended to lag behind Whitehall and the NHS. Even there, however, courses are developing fast. Birmingham University's Institute of Local Government and Strathclyde's Local Authorities Management Centre are leading the way. The Strathclyde centre, established in 1987 with a grant from the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, is part of a university business school which already has a strong public sector record (British Rail is a leading client). It offers a range of in-service and post-professional courses for middle and senior managers. Strathclyde regional council is the largest client, but participants come from across the country. Professor Alan Alexander, the centre's director, says: 'For middle - and some senior - managers our courses provide a first exposure to general management concepts. That's particularly important in local government, where the emphasis is on technical disciplines and qualifications first, and management second.' The courses have had a strong knock-on effect in encouraging managers to take MBAs, and the centre is about to launch an MSc in public management. Research into public sector management is also gathering pace. London's Imperial Business School and Cranfield Institute of Technology are just two of many to have established public sector research groups. The IBS has a health service management project, partly financed by North-West Thames Regional Health Authority, exploring 'appropriate structures and cultures' to support NHS trusts (in whatever form they survive the election). Cranfield's emphasis is on 'practitioner researchers'. According to Professor Leo Murray, Cranfield's director: 'We are looking to them to see how management skills can best be improved in what is, without doubt, a different environment from that we business schools are used to working in.' Teachers are further down the line. Even Mr Chips, though, may find a business course as essential as teaching practice before long.</p>

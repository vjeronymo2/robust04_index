			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Newsbrief under the "In Moscow" rubric: "Infectious </F> Diseases Continue to Attack"; based on material from the  Postfactum Information Agency]    [Text] The incidence of infectious diseases continues to  increase in Moscow. Especially alarming is the number of cases  of diphtheria (a 3.2-fold increase since 1992), measles (up  2.8-fold over the last year), and Flexner's dysentery (a  1.7-fold increase). There has also been a 1.6-fold increase in  the number of people who have contracted whooping cough. The  number of people infected with the herpes virus has increased  34.92%, and there has been a 24% rise in the  number of  tuberculosis patients. The total number of cases involving acute  intestinal illnesses has dropped 10%, but clinical  physicians  attribute this to the fact that fewer people are seeking medical  help.</p>

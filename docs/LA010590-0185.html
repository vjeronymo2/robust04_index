			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PATRIOTS SAY BERRY PROBABLY WILL STAY TO COACH TEAM IN '90  </P> <P> Raymond Berry is apparently staying on as coach of the New England Patriots in  the 1990 National Football League season, fulfilling the final year of his  three-year contract and keeping continuity for the team, a Patriots spokesman  said today.  </P> <P> "That sounds right, but we haven't announced anything," said team spokesman Jim  Greenidge.  </P> <P> "It's not official."  </P> <P> General Manager Patrick Sullivan told the Boston Globe in a story published  today that Berry will be free to decide the makeup of his staff and make  whatever changes he wishes.  </P> <P> "Changing coaches is not the panacea that everyone thinks it is," Sullivan said  Thursday after meeting with Berry and several others in the organization's  front office.  </P> <P> "The process itself sets the organization back at least a year. I don't want to  set this organization back," Sullivan said.  </P> <P> Berry said he was pleased he'll be back next season, and said he wouldn't be  adverse to changes. The Patriots had a 5-11 record last season, although they  were deluged with injuries.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Tibor Fuzessy, minister without portfolio </F> and member of the Executive Committee of the Christian  Democratic People's Party, by Jozsef Szabo Bartha; place and  date not given: "A Tripartite Government With the Hungarian  Democratic Forum and the Federation of Young Democrats"]    [Text] While the political parties are trying to convince  the citizens about the correctness of their programs at various  rallies and other forums, the Christian Democratic People's  Party [KDNP] gathered its activists, officials, and candidates  with the same goal in Budapest last weekend. The surprise  speaker of the meeting was Tibor Fuzessy, minister without  portfolio and member of the KDNP Executive Committee, who,  according to several opinions, "outlined a regular party and  chairman program." The audience thanked him with a standing  ovation.    [Bartha] How different is the KDNP as outlined by you from  the actual one?    [Fuzessy] It follows a much more marked and firm line than  the Christian democracy, a more Christian-social and  Christian-socialist line.    [Bartha] An unavoidable question nowadays: Who with whom  and with whom not? Is the KDNP a bride much in demand?    [Fuzessy] The KDNP has a lot of suitors. This could even be  flattering, but the richer and stronger suitors do not take into  consideration the fact that the bride is not only beautiful and  honest, but also choosy and priggish. This bride is not lured  away either by richness or power. If necessary, she is also  ready to remain a maiden.    [Bartha] How do you choose?    [Fuzessy] Our Christian and national norms that have been  formulated more firmly than ever determine whom we consider and  whom we do not consider. Extremists on both sides are excluded.    [Bartha] Where do you put the Federation of Young Democrats  [Fidesz]?    [Fuzessy] I have not believed in Fidesz for a long time, and  I continue to have reservations, but it seems that they are now  crossing the bridge over the river that separates the national  trends from the non-national trends, the right from the left.  If they burn this bridge and have no way back, we might become  allies.    [Bartha] What about the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]?    [Fuzessy] In 1990, the SZDSZ was a tough anti-communist  party calling for a hard change in the regime. A change took  place in the party after two years, and now it is ready to share  power with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. I do not use  the terms "lies and fraud" in political debates. However, the  people formulate tough things, and they cannot put up with such  a turnabout, because they feel cheated. I do not believe either  that the SZDSZ could make itself suitable for cooperation with  the KDNP in the last moment.    [Bartha] What about the socialists?    [Fuzessy] There is still no approach between the MSZP and  the KDNP. I came to know several outstanding people among them  who did a lot for the change in the regime, and I am also sure  that they did all that out of patriotism and with patriotic  conviction. However, these people were forced out of the party  or were put into a quarantine within the party. They cannot  assert their voices and opinions. Although in its statute, the  MSZP also favors the national idea and actions, it nevertheless  fails to distance itself from those who played a leading role in  the anti-national policy of the last 40 years, a policy that  supported foreign oppression. We also miss their distancing  from those who played a leading role in quelling the national  revolution [of 1956] and in the ensuing repression. Talleyrand  used to say about the return of the Bourbons that they did not  forget anything and did not learn anything. The same applies to  the MSZP.    [Bartha] What about the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]?    [Fuzessy] They are not our enemies or opponents, but our  competitors with whom we must compete in an honest fight. The  prospects of the KDNP are better in this struggle in the long  run. Our ideology is clearer and easier to outline and this will  definitely be felt in four years' time, if not now.    [Bartha] What about the Smallholders' Party [FKGP]?    [Fuzessy] It is enough to have a tripartite government with  the Fidesz and the MDF.    [Bartha] You have not even considered the possibility that  the MSZP might also be the winner?    [Fuzessy] Nothing is impossible. Then, the president of the  republic will ask them to form a government. They will return  this mandate because they cannot form a majority coalition. But  the second largest party, the MDF, will be able to form a  majority government with the Fidesz and the KDNP. There are  real chances for this.    [Bartha] There are rumors according to which your  precondition for a coalition is that your refuse to spend a  single moment more under the same roof with Tamas Szabo and Geza  Jeszenszky.    [Fuzessy] It is certain that the KDNP will not form another  coalition like the one in 1990, a coalition formed without any  guidelines and conditions. Although, as the deputy chairman and  later the head of the parliamentary group of the KDNP, I  formulated the conditions and exact rules of coalition  cooperation at the time, this "work" of mine did not succeed.  The MDF rejected it, the Smallholders did not even bother to  give an answer, and I also found myself in minority in my own  party. I am convinced that this must not be repeated in any  circumstances. The KDNP can only join a coalition on the basis  of precisely-formulated and detailed rules. No matter which  party we are talking about.    [Bartha] Many people said about your speech last week that  it was not only the program speech of the KDNP but also that of  the party's candidate to the position of chairman.    [Fuzessy] It was definitely not meant to be one. My goal  was to sit down calmly for about two hours in the rat race of  the election campaign and think our situation over and examine  our conscience. The decision to call up the national committee  after the local government elections is still valid, and this  committee will decide on organizational, statute, and personnel  issues. It would only be justified to hold this meeting earlier  if the party failed to achieve the results it hopes for in the  elections. However, in my opinion, there is no such danger.</p>

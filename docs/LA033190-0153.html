			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY SYMPHONY NAMES SCHARF AS MUSIC DIRECTOR;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENT: THE ISRAELI-BORN CONDUCTOR SUCCEEDS THE LATE DONN LAURENCE MILLS,  WHO WAS FOUNDING MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE ORCHESTRA.  </P> <P> Israeli-born conductor Dov Alexander Scharf, 37, was named music director of  the Capistrano Valley Symphony on Friday, succeeding founding music director  Donn Laurence Mills, who died of meningitis Feb. 8.  </P> <P> Scharf conducted the orchestra earlier this month in pops concerts in Dana  Point, and said Friday that "after (those) concerts, I have determined that the  Capistrano Valley Symphony can be developed into a fine orchestra."  </P> <P> He hopes to restore the classical programming that largely was abandoned for  pops in 1987 after the orchestra ran into financial trouble.  </P> <P> Born and raised in Holon, Israel, Scharf studied conducting with Daniel Lewis  at USC. For three years, he has been music director of the Dietersheimer  Chamber Orchestra in Munich, West Germany. He said he will relocate to Los  Angeles, where his parents live, or to Orange County.  </P> <P> The Capistrano Valley Symphony was formed by Mills in January, 1985, but  quickly ran into problems raising money and finding adequate concert  facilities. Several concerts were canceled before the group switched to its  pops format. Scharf said he hopes to initiate a winter-spring classical season,  but will preserve a summer pops series.  </P> <P> Scharf said the orchestra's budget is not finalized but is likely to fall  between $150,000 and $280,000. He said his salary is still being negotiated.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, he is looking for suitable concert sites. "We do have three or four  good possibilities," he said. The orchestra has been playing at the Dana Point  Resort and at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point.  </P> <P> Next up for the orchestra is a five-concert summer pops series at the Dana  Point Resort, May 20, June 17, July 15, Aug. 19 and Sept. 16. Information:  (714) 240-8584.  </P></p>

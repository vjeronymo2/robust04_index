			<p>CSO     [Text] In spite of its differences with the Left Front  Government in West Bengal, the CPI(ML) [Communist Party of  India-Marxist-Leninist], Liberation favours a broad unity of the  Left forces at the national level, to dislodge the Congress(I)  Government at the Centre. This was stated by Mr Vinode Misra,  general secretary of the party, in Calcutta on Friday. He  addressed a rally at Sahid Minar to commemorate the 25th  anniversary of the CPI(ML).    A procession was organized during the day from Deshbandhu  park to Esplanade, with peasants from Bihar and West Bengal.    Criticizing the "parliamentary, social democratic and  opportunist CPI [Communist Party of India] and CPI(M) [Communist  Party of India-Marxist]," Mr Misra said they were interested  more in keeping the Left Front Government in power in West  Bengal than in building up a genuine Left movement against the  Centre.    He, however, added that the Liberation would oppose any move  by the Congress(I) and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] to  dislodge the Front Government in West Bengal.    Mr Misra ruled out the possibility of inviting the CPI and  the CPI(M) to the convention of the Left organizations in New  Delhi on April 25 and 26, to draw a common programme of action  to oppose the Dunkel proposals.    He claimed the Liberation had revised its policies in  accordance with the changing situation and was in a position to  provide leadership to the Left movement in the country.    "We are the only true Naxalite group in the country," Mr  Misra asserted.    Commenting on the recent clashes between the Liberation and  the MCC [Maoist Communist Center (Bihar Extremist Group)]  activists in Bihar, he said the former was prepared for talks  with the MCC "unconditionally," to end the violence.</p>

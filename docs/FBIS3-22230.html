			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Iryna Yashchembska report: ``Chemical Genocide Against the </F> Ukrainian People Continues'' -- first paragraph published in  boldface; words between slantlines published in italics]    [Text] In July 1993, NARODNA HAZETA (No. 25) carried a  report on the results of an inspection by Ukraine's Procurator  General's Office of the procedure for deliveries to our state of  toxic chemical substances, pesticides, and plant-growth  regulating agents, and their registration, storage, and  utilization.    Let me remind you that the report dealt with the deliveries  and utilization in agriculture of chemicals that cause  considerable ecological problems and an extremely serious  deterioration in the health of the Ukrainian population. The  report concluded that a new genocide, this time a chemical one,  had been started against the Ukrainian people.    The Procurator General's Office initiated eight criminal  cases (one of them on economic matters) based on the results of  the examination. It took upon itself the most involved case,  which implicated officials of ministries and departments, and  handed over the rest to local militia bodies.    Besides, demands and proposals were submitted to the  Ukrainian president and the Cabinet of Ministers. They dealt,  in particular, with the need to conduct a state-sponsored  ecological examination of the ``List of Those Chemical and  Biological Methods of Struggle Against Pests, Plant Diseases,  and Weeds, and Those Plant-Growth Regulators That Have Been  Permitted for Utilization in Ukraine's Agriculture in  1992-1996'' (``List'') and suggested that the use of those  preparations that raise any doubts regarding the negative  consequences they may cause to human health and the environment  must be temporarily suspended.    It is worth recalling at this point that Ukraine's Ministry  of Health authorized the Ukrainian Scientific Research Institute  of Ecological Hygiene and Toxicology of Chemical Substances  (UkrNDIGINTOKS) to carry out all work aimed at creating the  ``List.'' This was despite the fact that this particular  institution had concluded direct agreements with foreign  manufacturing plants on conducting experiments involving the  preparations in exchange for hard currency. This was the main  reason for the malpractice committed by the institute's director  M. Motuzynskyy and his deputies A. Podrushnyak and A. Bolotnyy.  They were the authors of the ``List'' (other specialists of the  Institute learned about its existence only during the  procurator's inspection), which included highly toxic,  mutagenic, carcinogenic, teratogenic, and other chemical  substances. Some of the preparations had been banned in the  manufacturing country, while others, such as, for example,  ``harness'' [kharnes] (the United States), were not even  registered, because the date for the end of testing them is May  1995. The ``List'' also includes the preparation ``tigam'' [not  further identified], which was described by the former Union's  State Commission in the following way: ``Highly toxic,  possesses carcinogenic properties, causes dermatitis and  allergic diseases...,'' or the TMTD, which is ``characterized by  the harmful effect on sex organs and fetuses, may cause  mutation, is teratogenic and carcinogenic, and impairs the  reproductive function...,'' and other similar chemicals.    In December 1993 and January 1994, the Procurator General's  Office checked the state of affairs. The time was not chosen at  random. The sowing campaign will soon start, and it is  precisely during these months that agreements are concluded with  foreign firms on deliveries of pesticides. That is why the  inspection was also preventive in character. Its task was to  preclude possible crimes now, rather than state the facts of  their perpetration later.    Unfortunately, even today, the situation does not give  reason  for optimism. No effective measures have been taken by the  Cabinet of Ministers, Ministries of Health and Environmental  Protection, or other institutions to eliminate the violations or  abuse revealed by the Procurator's Office. The government  commission set up last June by the directive of vice premier V.  Demyanov, did not conduct the inspection properly and focused on  the unjustified protection of leading officials, who violated  the law (if you remember, it was precisely V. Demyanov who  permitted the purchase and utilization, on 1,600,000 hectares of  cornfields, of the preparation ``harness,'' which is hazardous  to health).    The conclusions drawn by the government commission make it  possible to assert that its members do not know the true state  of affairs in the branch. Their conclusions do not correspond  to objective circumstances, contradict the requirements of the  current legislation, and do not take into account the interests  of the state and citizens. For example, the members of the  commission keep referring to the use, in foreign countries, of  some of the preparations in question. However, the commission  does not take into account the fact that Ukraine is subjected to  much contamination, including radioactive. Nor are the low  level of culture in using pesticides and the extremely  inefficient state control, especially over the quality of  agricultural products, taken into account. Today, more than 90  percent of plant-growing products reach the consumer without  being previously inspected. Such a situation prevails in all  Ukrainian oblasts. Some chemicals have become global pollutants  even of foodstuffs and not only of the environment. The staple  foodstuffs alone were found to contain the traces of 72 types of  pesticides, including those that are extremely hazardous to  health: ``Dipterex, methyl parathion, DDT, phosphomile  [fosfomil],'' ``copper'' and ``mercury'' compounds, and so on.  Pesticides have been revealed in dairy products and even in baby  food. Dairy products also contain preparations that are used  for the treatment of the seed prior to sowing.  Despite the alarming results of testing preparations that are  imported into Ukraine, no measures are taken to at least  restrict their utilization.    As a matter of fact, the entire territory of Ukraine has now  been transformed into a ``chemical proving ground'' for testing  extremely harmful substances purchased abroad. Foreign firms  ``study'' their preparations on ordinary agricultural lands, and  not on experimental fields. Of course, the resulting produce is  not destroyed, but is offered to the Ukrainian population for  consumption. For example, the firm ``Monsanto'' (the United  States) tested a mixture of chemical substances that do not even  have names in Donetsk Oblast. (In the same oblast, the firm  stores pesticides, the majority of which are not registered in  Ukraine.) The same firm also conducted experiments in the  ``Boryspilskyy'' state farm in Kiev Oblast. Similar examples may  be quoted for other Ukrainian oblasts.    The government commission headed by Academician Kundiyev has  ``overlooked'' this and many other problems. This is very  strange, since in October 1992, Yu. Kundiyev gave a negative  assessment of the aforementioned ``List.'' His conclusions on  the carcinogenic, mutagenic, and other hazardous properties of a  number of preparations became one of the reasons for conducting  the procurator's examination. All the more unfathomable are his  subsequent actions both as chairman of the governmental  commission and, today, as head of the commission of experts  expected to prove that the preparation ``harness'' may safely be  used in Ukraine's agriculture.    The composition of the government commission, appointed by  vice premier V. Demyanov, also suggests that its main task was,  after all, to promote departmental interests. It included,  first and foremost, agricultural experts and only two medical  specialists: Academicians Yu. Kundiyev and Ye. Honcharuk. This  is despite the fact that the inquiry by the Procurator's Office  mainly raised the question of taking urgent measures to prevent  the negative effect of pesticides on the health of the  population.    Regarding Academician Honcharuk, it was, to put it mildly,  unethical to include him in the commission. The thing is that  he, jointly with UkrNDIGINTOKS' director Motuzynskyy and the  latter's deputy Podrushnyak, had founded a small enterprise  ``Scientific Medicine.'' In December 1992, the Institute  illegally transferred 1.5 million karbovantsi to the enterprise  (the money was returned during the procurator's inspection).  Despite such circumstances, Ye. Honcharuk, as a member of the  commission, was inspecting the validity of the actions by  Motuzynskyy and others.    It is a great pity that the governmental commission did not  want or could not see or feel the significance of the extremely  alarming problem: Owing to the greed of some officials and  negligence and incompetence of others, Ukrainians are in danger  of becoming transformed into mutants without a hope for the  future.    The actions by the Cabinet of Ministers and the Ministry of  Health are no more reassuring. They ignored the demands by the  Procurator General's Office that the revealed violations of law  be corrected. Ukraine's chief sanitary inspector V. Mariyevskyy  and deputy directors of the UkrNDIGINTOKS A. Porushnyak and A.  Bolotnyy have not been dismissed from their posts to this day.  As regards Mr. Motuzynskyy, he feels very much in his element.  He now heads a laboratory at the same Institute. Ties with  foreign firms, the signing of agreements, and expert analyses  have all remained in his hands.    Impunity has always given rise to new violations. For  example, the state association ``Ukrahrokhim'' brought  considerable quantities of the preparation 2.4 D, which is not  registered in Ukraine, to Khmelnytskyy, Kharkiv, and Kirovohrad  oblasts. At the same time, recently appointed chairman of the  State Commission for Chemistry V. Petrunek, without coordination  with the Ministry of Health, is issuing permits for importing  unregistered preparations: The ``Bishevskyy'' state farm (in  Donetsk Oblast) received the pesticide ``MON44068'' from the  firm ``Monsanto,'' and the Rivne company ``Rise'' [Raiz] -- the  foreign-made preparation ``40-percent dialene'' [dialen].    It is alarming that officials of all ranks, from the  minister  to the head of a rayon plant-protection station, may issue  permits for deliveries of foreign-made pesticides. For example,  the preparation ``burex [bureks]-430FLO'' was brought into  Ukraine and passed through the Customs with the help of a letter  from the chief of the Holoshchanska rayon plant-protection  station, and the herbicide ``aminopilek [aminopilek]-9'' -- with  the help of a letter from the chief of the Rivne station. The  same picture can be seen everywhere. The chemical genocide  against the Ukrainian people continues.    Of course, the Procurator General's Office is taking  measures  to protect state interests. However, the resolution of many  problems is outside its jurisdiction. It is necessary, first  and foremost, to resolve all problems on the basis of  legislation, and this is the prerogative of the government and  parliament.    I will add this in conclusion: In December 1993 and January  1994, the Procurator General's Office tried to check the local  court proceedings on the relevant cases. It turned out that, by  that time, they had already been stopped. An examination of the  materials showed that the facts had not been properly checked.  Even expert analyses were not done properly. The Procurator's  Office canceled the resolutions on stopping these criminal cases  and united them. Kiev's Internal Affairs State Administration  is currently continuing the investigation.    As we can see, the law-enforcement bodies are doing  everything possible to prevent the further poisoning of the  country's environment and population. However, we hope that the  Cabinet of Ministers, the parliament, and, in particular,  candidates for the new Supreme Council, will include the  ecological issue as a major issue in their programs and will, in  the final analysis, be instrumental in stopping the chemical  poisoning of the people.</p>

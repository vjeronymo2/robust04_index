			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / S Africa poll results halted as officials review vote South Africa's electoral machinery ground to a temporary halt last night as officials fought to reconcile anomalies and irregularities in voting returns the day after President FW de Klerk conceded defeat to Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress. Counting was understood to have been completed in most areas, but the release of results was halted by the Independent Electoral Commission, the body charged with conducting elections and certifying the poll. The delay forced the postponement until Monday of the first session of the national assembly, which was to have been convened on Friday. Officials privately acknow-ledged that the exercise amounted to an attempt to determine an outcome that would be broadly acceptable to the three main political parties - the ANC, Mr de Klerk's National party and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom party. This involves decisions on how disputed ballots are to be counted. Under the electoral act, political parties may agree among themselves on how to resolve anomalies and discrepancies in the vote, if necessary by amending party totals. Mr Mandela, due to be nominated as the next president, held talks during the day with Mr de Klerk, dealing with both the practicalities of the handover and widespread concerns about the integrity of the voting procedures and the count itself. Officials on both sides privately expressed concern that both the momentum of the transition be maintained and the broad integrity of the result be accepted. Officials of the long-ruling National party privately expressed fears over the trend in the results. They spoke of 'two psychological thresholds' which, if crossed, could strain the transition and the authority of the yet to be appointed government of national unity. They said there would be serious reservations about the outcome if, under such disputed conditions, the ANC were to achieve more than 66 per cent of votes cast, allowing it to control the process determining the final shape of the country's constitution, and if the National party support fell below 20 per cent. Latest national results, based on half the estimated votes cast, show the ANC holding steady at 62.5 per cent of the vote and the share of the National party falling slightly to 22.1 per cent. Government officials added a third consideration: if the Inkatha Freedom party gets a substantial majority in its Natal heartland, the ANC may challenge the result. A senior ANC leader in the province last night gave notice of a possible dispute by saying that the lead was 'not a true reflection of the IFP's popularity', while Chief Buthelezi continued to reserve his position on the outcome of the poll until the results were known.

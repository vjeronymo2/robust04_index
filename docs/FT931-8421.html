			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Regions share burden of increase in unemployment - PM under attack over rise in jobless / No slow-down in rate of increase expected HEADLINE unemployment rose last month to 3,062,065, the first time for nearly six years that the total has breached 3m. Adjusted for seasonal variations, the total is 2,995,100, having risen 22,100 in January. And last month all regions of the UK, apart from northern England, registered a rise in unemployment. Although this 33rd consecutive monthly rise in the adjusted total is the smallest since last June, employment department officials said there was no sign the increase in unemployment was slowing. January's headline or unadjusted total increased from December's by 78,726 in January. Much of the rise was due to seasonal factors. The total is the highest since April 1987, while the seasonally adjusted figure was last exceeded in January 1987. A glimmer of good news for the government was that the underlying increase in average earnings across the economy in December was a year-on-year 4.75 per cent, the smallest annual rise for 25 years. The annual change in underlying earnings was 5 per cent in November, while last April it was 7 per cent. The slower growth in wages may help the Treasury to hit its target of keeping underlying inflation below 4 per cent. There were 523,000 working days lost last year through labour disputes, the lowest annual total since government records began in 1891. Since the low point for seasonally adjusted unemployment in April 1990, the number of people without jobs and claiming benefit has risen by 1.4m or 88 per cent. The total in the south-east, including Greater London, rose by 11,800 in January, accounting for more than half the monthly rise for the UK as a whole. South-east unemployment has increased by 616,300, or 183 per cent, since early 1990. The total January increase was lower than expected and follows a large 60,300 rise in December. The average monthly increase during the three months to January was 42,400, compared with the equivalent figure of 35,900 in the three months to October last year. In January, 10.6 per cent of the workforce was without a job, up from 10.5 per cent in December. Employment decreased by 32,000 to 4.32m in manufacturing in December. This comes after falls of 25,000 in November and 10,000 in October. In the year to December, average earnings in the sector rose by an underlying 5.5 per cent, after 5.75 per cent in the year to November. In services the comparable figure came down to 4.5 per cent from 4.75 per cent. Output per person in manufacturing was up 6 per cent in December compared with a year previously, the highest year-on-year figure since April 1989. This reflects the relatively small fall in the sector's output while unemployment has risen steeply. Unit costs in the sector did not rise in the final quarter of last year compared with the corresponding period in 1991, the first time this has happened in six years. Vacancies at government job centres fell by 4,400 last month to 104,000.</p>

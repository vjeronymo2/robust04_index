			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] One-hundred-seventeen members of the National  Peacekeeping Force receiving training at the General De Wet  training center outside Bloemfontein have resigned since the  start of the weekend. A spokesman for the force said that  reasons for the resignations varied from domestic problems to  dissatisfaction with conditions at the base.    About 70 members of the force resigned last week after a  strike over salaries. However, the spokesman said that  conditions at the base had returned to normal and that training  had been resumed. He said a delegation from the Transitional  Executive Council would visit the base this afternoon to help  solve the problem.</p>

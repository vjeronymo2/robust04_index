			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sarah Honig] </F>   [Text] Likud MK [Knesset member] Ari'el Sharon escalated  his ongoing campaign against party leader Binyamin Netanyahu  yesterday, demanding that a new round of primaries be held prior  to the next general elections.    Netanyahu was elected party chairman and candidate for prime  minister when he won the Likud primary by a landslide last March.    Sharon withdrew from the race, but it was clear that he had  not relinquished his ambitions for leadership and was only  postponing his challenge.    The Likud rules make a new primary impossible without a 75  percent majority. Sharon suggested this rule be amended.    He further argued that the primary result is "not valid or  relevant any more because it was held at a very difficult time  for the Likud. By the time new elections are scheduled, things  will be even more different, hence the need to re-consider who  is to lead the party to the polls."    Taking Netanyahu's leadership to task, Sharon charged that  "the Likud is not prepared to wage any struggle and it has yet  to even crystallize its own policies and alternatives. The  Likud simply does not appear now as the leader of the  opposition."    The remedy for this, according do Sharon, is that rather  than  entrust the leadership to Netanyahu, "the Likud be lead by a  team."</p>

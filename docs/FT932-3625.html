			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Russifield Donbass coal miners' strike continues A STRIKE by the coal miners of the Russified Donbass region yesterday entered its third day. The miners' demands for higher pay and a new government appeared to be strengthened rather than quelled by President Kravchuk's emotional appeal for social calm in a half-hour appearance on Ukrainian television. Mr Ivan Pliushch, Ukrainian parliament chairman, quashed hopes that prime minister Leonid Kuchma, who successfully faced down several miners' strikes in the spring, will be granted the extraordinary powers over the economy he has been seeking. This is despite the boost to his popularity which followed his call last week for Ukraine to keep nuclear weapons on its territory.</p>

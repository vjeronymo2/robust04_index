			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By BUSINESS-TASS correspondent Irina Bolshova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- Despite some unsettled  problems in Russian-South Korean economic relations, South  Korean Government and business quarters display interest in  developing trade, economic, scientific and technical cooperation  with greater number of Russian enterprises and firms and in  establishing contacts with the administrations of Russian  regions, Russian Foreign Economic Relations Minister Oleg  Davydov told BUSINESS-TASS here on Tuesday.    The unsettled nature of credit relations is the main problem  in bilateral contacts. This greatly limits the sphere of  cooperation at the interstate level, the minister noted.    Under the pretext of unsettled Russian debts, South Korea  continues to enforce several secret limitations on trade and  economic relations with Russia, including abstention from state  crediting and insurance of foreign trade deals and investment  projects.    This creates some difficulties, especially for small and  medium South Korean firms, Davydov stressed.    Nevertheless, the year 1993 registered growth in  Russian-South Korean trade turnover which was worth 1.5 billion  U.S. dollars, the minister said. Russian export nearly doubled  as compared with 1992, totalling 960 million dollars.    Import from South Korea rose by 45 per cent, amounting to  530  million dollars. "I state with regret," Davydov noted, "that  Russian export to South Korea consisted mostly of raw materials  (98.4 per cent)."    On the other hand, a trend for purchasing ready-made  consumer  goods rather than industrial equipment became more prominent in  imports.    It is expected that Davydov will hold talks on current  issues  of Russian-South Korean trade and economic cooperation with  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam who will arrive in Moscow on  an official visit on Wednesday.</p>

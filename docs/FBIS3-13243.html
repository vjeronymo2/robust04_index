			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Mar (MENA)--The Cairo-based paper  AL-JUMHURIYAH says the time has come for Israel to honestly  determine its position on peace. Bloody confrontations in the  streets of the West Bank and Gaza, says the paper, emphasize  that the Israeli occupation is heading toward an end and that  Israeli army foot patrols cannot roam the streets of Palestinian  villages and cities forever.    The paper says in its editorial today that if the  Gaza-Jericho Agreement was considered a positive step toward  disengaging the Israeli occupation forces and the Palestinian  masses in the West Bank and Gaza, hopes have, or almost have,  been dashed, thanks to the Hebron massacre, Israeli Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's refusal to evacuate or disarm the  settlers, and the Security Council's failure to clearly and  unequivocally condemn the carnage.    It would appear that correct beginnings do not lead to  correct results in Israel's political and negotiatory lexicon,  the paper says. It explains: The world considered the Madrid  conference for Middle East peace to be the beginning of the end  of the bitter conflict in the region within a framework of a  just and lasting peace. But the horrible Hebron massacre threw  all hopes into uncertainty.    The paper believes peace is in Israel's interest. It says  Israel, in return for Arab recognition, must work for mutual  peace and security and show good intentions by offering  realistic concessions commensurate with the importance of ending  the Middle East conflict.</p>

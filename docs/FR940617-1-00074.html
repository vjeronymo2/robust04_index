			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the agency did not intend to restrict formulations of triclosan to bar soap. The agency has reviewed the Panel's recommendations and the footnotes in the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1229) and finds that triclosan under ``antimicrobial soaps'' was erroneously marked with the reference to the footnote ``Category III only when formulated in a bar soap to be used with water.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of triclosan in products for the treatment of diaper rash was discussed in the tentative final monograph for antimicrobial diaper rash drug products published on June 20, 1990 (55 FR 25246 at 25277 to 25278). The use of triclosan in products for treating sunburn will be addressed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at a later date in another OTC drug rulemaking for drug products for this use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> References  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Comments No. CP1, SUP19, SUP23, C103, C109, SUP31, SUP39, and C134, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Comment No. SUP20, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Comment No. OB15, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) ``Two Year Chronic Oral Toxicity Study With Fat 80 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; 023/A in Albino Rats,'' Comment No. C109, vol. 1, appendix E, and Comment No. C139, vol. 1&hyph;8, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) ``Eighteen Month Carcinogenicity Study with Fat 80 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo; 023/A in Albino Mice,'' Comment No. C109, vol. 3, appendix I, and Comment No. C139, vol. 9, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) ``Three Phase Reproduction Study Albino Rats and Rabbits, Bacteriostat CH 3565,'' Comment No. C134, tab 7, and Comment No. C139, vol. 10&hyph;11, Docket No. 75N&hyph;0183, Dockets Management Branch.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Letter from W.

Comments on Combinations of Active Ingredients  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 24. One comment stated that the Panel did not review safety and effectiveness data submitted to it on mercufenol chloride (orthohydroxyphenylmercuric chloride) 0.1 percent and secondary amyltricresols 0.1 percent as single ingredients and in combination for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation, skin antiseptic, and skin wound protectant (Ref. 1). The comment added that the agency did not discuss these ingredients alone or in combination in the previous tentative final monograph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comment asserted that secondary amyltricresols, mentioned in the previous tentative final monograph under phenol (43 FR 1210 at 1238), is not equivalent to phenol because of chemical differences and differing antimicrobial properties, formulation concentrations, and patterns of use. The comment requested the agency to make decisions on the safety and effectiveness of this ingredient when used alone, or in combination, as a patient preoperative skin preparation, a skin antiseptic, or a skin wound protectant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency has previously reviewed data for first aid antiseptic uses of 0.1 percent mercufenol chloride and 0.1 percent secondary amyltricresols and found the evidence insufficient to support their safety and effectiveness either as single ingredients or in combination (56 FR 33644 at 33668). Only safety data on animals were submitted by the comment (Ref. 1); in general, these studies were conducted on a very small number of animals, did not detail methodology, and did not adequately describe results (physical condition of the animals). The submitted in vitro studies also lack sufficient detail to establish the effectiveness of mercufenol chloride.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

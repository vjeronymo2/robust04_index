			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses search for inspiration amid dull trading The Continent's bourses mostly started the week with little desire to move ahead. FRANKFURT struggled to make progress and the DAX index closed the official session a scant 6.83 higher at 2,058.45, losing this in the Ibis session to settle at 2,050.82. Turnover came to DM4bn. In chemicals, Bayer, up DM4.30 at DM344.30, led the way after reporting a third-quarter profits rise of more than 30 per cent compared with the same period in 1993. The company said that it expected to see a continuation of performance throughout the rest of the year and might lift the dividend payment from the DM11 level of 1993. In common with the market, the stock drifted lower in the post-bourse, to close at DM342.10. Elsewhere, BASF firmed 20 pfennigs to DM307.50 and Hoechst, which releases figures tomorrow, rose 50 pfennigs to DM318.00. The car sector concentrated on Volkswagen, off DM10.60 at DM441.20, and then to DM43.50 in the post bourse, as Deutsche Bank downgraded its 1995 earnings per share forecast to DM24 from DM32. PARIS notched up an unimpressive rise, while turnover was an unexceptional FFr3bn. The CAC-40 index added 6.49 at 1,952.38. Rhone-Poulenc sank FFr2.30 to FFr134.50 following what was perceived as unfavourable comments in the local media by the company. Carrefour, which benefited earlier in the session from an upgraded opinion from Merrill Lynch, closed the day just FFr1 higher at FFr2,150. Mr Charles Allen, European retail analyst at Merrill, said that he had been positive on the company for some time, given its strong exposure to developing markets and the prospect of 20 per cent earnings growth over the next five years. MILAN staged a broad advance, making the most of the calmer political situation, but Credito Italiano was a heavy loser as speculation grew that it was about to raise its bid for Credito Romagnolo. The Comit index finished 4.04 higher at 627.21. The FIB 30 futures index made a reserved debut, although all three contracts quoted registered gains. Futures volumes were modest, but dealers said that this was to be expected as investors waited to see how the index fared before committing themselves. Romagnolo, which rallied 3 per cent last Friday, was suspended yesterday, pending an announcement. Italiano fell L66 or 4 per cent to L1,572 amid expectations that it would raise its bid for Romagnolo, and also seek more than the 48 per cent stake mooted when its bid was launched a month ago. Cir, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's industrial holding company, appreciated L32 to L1,801 while Olivetti was L26 stronger at L1,891, amid reports that Mr De Benedetti was willing to sell his 5 per cent stake in Romagnolo. ZURICH put in a firm early performance in response to the dollar and bonds, but edged back from its best levels on a lack of follow-through buying. The SMI index finished 6.9 higher at 2,579.4. UBS bearers dipped SFr5 to SFr1,130. After the bourse closed, the bank said that the Zurich district court had imposed a temporary bar on the registration of changes to by-laws, agreed by last week's extraordinary shareholders meeting, which agreed the creation of a single category of shares. The bank added that it was not surprised by the decision. Bearer shares in Von Roll picked up SFr31 to SFr230 on the view that the price had fallen too far last week after news that the technology group was cutting its equity capital by 90 per cent. A SFr35 advance in Bank Julius Baer to SFr1,280 was attributed to a buy recommendation. AMSTERDAM picked up ground after Friday's loss but activity was slack. The AEX index gained 1.99 to 408.44. Royal Dutch strengthened 90 cents to Fl 186.70 with Paine Webber of the US said to have raised its opinion on the stock. OSLO finished higher as unofficial estimates of very heavy turnout in the country's EU referendum, and the last minute opinion polls, raised the prospect that supporters of membership might win the day. The All-share index closed 3.75 higher at 608.52 in turnover of NKr304m. Norske Skog Free, regarded as having much to gain from a 'yes' vote, were up NKr4 at NKr177. Dealers noted that a 'yes' could, paradoxically, lead to a sharper market fall than a 'no', since a majority was unlikely to be wide enough to secure automatic parliamentary ratification, leading to further weeks of uncertainty. STOCKHOLM strengthened in slow dealing, with the result from Norway one way or the other unlikely to have a significant impact on prices. The Affarsvarlden general index put on 7.2 to 1,502.8. MoDo B gained SKr2 to SKr350.50, following an upgrade.

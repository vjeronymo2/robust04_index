			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Ukraine appeal on inflation battle Ukraine's government called on parliament yesterday to save the economy from collapse by approving an 'anti-hyperinflation' programme that mixes market reforms with measures to strengthen state control, Reuter reports from Kiev. Most deputies ignored the government's eighth attempt to push through an economic reform plan in the two years since independence from Moscow. They blamed ministers for the latest round of price increases that made staples three to five times more expensive and cast Ukraine's 52m citizens deeper into poverty. The acting prime minister, Mr Yefim Zvyagilsky, said Ukraine had to introduce 'radical market reforms' to fight monthly inflation of 70 per cent, including rapid privatisation of 40 per cent of state property over the next year. The programme would grant President Leonid Kravchuk 'extraordinary powers', but these were hardly mentioned in the debate.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Unions in protest to Brussels EUROPEAN trade unions have protested to the European Commission at the withdrawal of a grant to help unions organise meetings on European works councils. Unions have received Ecu14m (Pounds 11m) in the current year for organising such meetings, and had assumed that the payment would be repeated annually for several years. But the budget for 1993 drawn up by the Commission contains no provision for this. Union leaders such as Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the German IG Metall union, fear this might represent a more general retreat from the social dimension of European integration. The works councils, designed for informing and consulting workers on corporate strategy, have been established in about 20 EC-based multinationals and unions are pushing hard to set them up in many more. In 1992 unions received about Ecu50m from EC institutions or through the financing of union-friendly institutions.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / UK Company News: SE completes Warburg inquiry The Stock Exchange has completed a preliminary investigation into SG Warburg's handling of the purchase of Lasmo shares during the bid from Enterprise Oil. In the final days of the bid Warburg spent Pounds 170m on behalf of Enterprise buying a 10 per cent stake in Lasmo from institutions. The purchase, at a large premium to the current market price, brought complaints from other shareholders who said they were not given the chance to sell. Swiss Bank Corporation complained to the Stock Exchange that it had a sell order placed with Warburg which was ignored when the purchases were carried out. Warburg has argued that Swiss Bank did not have a valid buying order and that the dispute concerns a technical issue of little significance. The Stock Exchange confirmed that the panel formed to look into the complaint had 'reached a preliminary view which is now being discussed with the parties concerned'. The stock market raid was carried out in an unusual manner and caused great ill-feeling among those institutions not favoured. Some pointed to the fact that most of the institutions whose shares were bought accepted Enterprise's paper offer for the remainder of their holding. It would be against the Takeover Code for a bidder to offer cash to some shareholders on the understanding they would subsequently accept the offer. But some observers believe the fact that most of the favoured institutions accepted the bid shows only that Warburg misjudged the mood of institutions. It would have been more effective to buy shares off investors who planned to reject the offer. Independent experts believe the Swiss Bank complaint concerns a 'grey area' in the Stock Exchange's rules and question whether the outcome of the investigation will have much effect on Warburg's reputation.</p>

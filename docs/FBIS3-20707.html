			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mihai Cernat: "The PDSR Supports the </F> Acceleration of the Process of Privatization and Restructuring"]    [Text] The set of "objectives and priorities of  socioeconomic strategy," drawn up by the PDSR [Party of Social  Democracy of Romania] and expected to be applied this year,  which is considered to be absolutely crucial for the fate of our  country, is considered to be the response of the governing party  to the current crisis situation and, at the same time, it is  also a response to the groping and searching of the  restructuring department of the government in regard to the  acceleration of the reform.    Reality has proven that, in the past four years, a number of  elements have been accumulated which have not only permitted  access to stronger measures for the transformation of the  economy, first of all, into a market economy, but which also  require the application of these measures. In this context, the  program proposed by the PDSR is notable for its obviously  pragmatic character. Its point of departure is the fact that,  legislatively, Romania has succeeded in eliminating the  backwardness in reforms compared to the neighboring countries.  There is another fact which can be deduced from the structure of  the entire program drawn up by this party -- namely, the fact  that the reform which it would like to have accelerated on all  levels is not an act of virtuosity but one which is absolutely  necessary for the achievement, in time, of an economy which is  in harmony with the Western countries and in accordance with the  human and material resources available to us.    In this context, in 1994, all attention should be  concentrated on ensuring stability and economic recovery, for a  greater coherence of socioeconomic reform, with emphasis on two  basic elements -- privatization and restructuring. Also, it will  be absolutely necessary to take a number of austerity measures.  Without going into detail in regard to such a far-reaching and  ambitious program which offers, upto the end of this year,  possibilities for our economic recovery and, to a no lesser  extent, for our social recovery, we will, however, try to  present a few of the illustrative elements. Thus, ensuring the  development of industrial production (a process for which some  opportunities were offered in 1993) will mean technological  modernization and restructuring of production in all branches.  Labor productivity and product competitiveness will increase.  The structure of services will be developed and diversified. The  investment process will be reinvigorated and the inflation rate  will be controlled. At the end of the year, the rate of  inflation will be about 75 percent higher than in December 1993.    In the field of privatization, first of all, in addition to  supporting competent institutions capable of applying the  development strategy of the private sector (the National Agency  for Privatization and the Romanian Development Agency), we will  aim to privatize 2,300-2,400 commercial companies. An action  worthy of attention will be the utilization of ownership  certificates, which, at present, is only a hope. At the same  time, efforts will be intensified to clarify the system of  ownership in agriculture, aiming at the issuance of at least 1.5  million property titles so that this process can be concluded in  1995.    Restructuring, an extremely important process, must be  expanded. However, this does not mean -- and the PDSR program  points this out -- the dismemberment of national industry or  ultimately, the deindustrialization of the country. Also, it  must not be interpreted as a cause of unemployment or as an  occasion for importing products which will no longer be supplied  by Romanian industry. However, the national economy must be  "purged" of nonviable economic agents. Competitive fields, as  well as economic agents with the same defining characteristics,  must be stimulated. We will not dwell upon the implications of  this measure for individual branches of industry, but we will  mention only a few basic principles with the aid of which the  planned dimensions will be given to this work. Thus, among other  things, we will allocate financial resources to obtain the  necessary financing for the restructuring program by giving  governmental guarantees and assuming state debts upto the limit  of 0.5 percent of the gross domestic product, obtaining foreign  sources of financing, in the form of reimbursable and  nonreimbursable credits, soliciting, on a priority basis, the  technical assistance of international bodies in drafting and  implementing the priority restructuring program and the  medium-term and long-term strategies for the restructuring  process, including assistance in the juridical and legislative  domains. Also, public corporations will be discussed and  restructured.    Of course, only a careful examination of this program could  demonstrate the solid and coherent policy planned for this  sector which is so responsive to restructuring. The policy also  calls for a resumption of investment activity by giving priority  to projects already begun, by clarifying the situations of  suspended projects whose continuation is opportune, by  establishing measures with a view to finalizing the public  investment program for energy, transportation and  telecommunications, land improvement, water resources, forests,  and environmental protection, the communal-administrative  infrastructure of localities, as well as urbanism and  territorial management.    The wage and price policy will be a very important element.  In this area, first of all, efforts will be made to create the  legislative and institutional framework for the protection of  competition and to pursue the strict observance of regulations  in this field, in accordance with the free action of economic  agents and the general interest of economic and social  stability. In regard to prices, the intervention of the state  will be limited only to fields which contain the attributes of  natural monopolies. For this purpose, competition-type  infrastructures for purchasing, processing, and distribution  will be gradually created. And, finally, the legislative  framework will be set up for institutional structures to protect  competition. The wage policy will be geared toward stopping  inflationist pressure and promoting competition in the national  economy.    The budgetary and fiscal domains and the fields of monetary  and hard currency policy have not been neglected. Also, actions  and measures for achieving objectives and priorities for foreign  economic relations, for scientific research and technological  development, education, human resources, health care and medical  treatment, culture, local public administration, national  defense, and reform in the field of justice are being thought  about. We will mention, from the fiscal domain, the presentation  to Parliament of laws on the profit tax, the general income tax,  the tax on agricultural income and local fees and taxes. In  regard to the restructuring of budgetary expenditures, among  other things, wage limits will be introduced and the number of  public functionaries will be reduced, among other ways, by the  effects of the law on the organization of the activity of the  government and the ministries. Subsidies for 1994 will amount to  only 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product. We will aim for  a significant increase in the financial autonomy of the public  administration and special importance will be given to the  organization of institutions for stock market transactions.    The Party of Social Democracy is asking the government to  place measures of social protection at the center of attention.  In this field, the program has several priorities: the  protection of the incomes of the population by slowing down and  stopping the deterioration of their purchasing power, the  stimulation of the demand for workers and the social protection  of the unemployed; the acceleration of the process of reforming  social security and public assistance systems, the improvement  of working conditions and the support of the construction of  housing for the people. As for the employment of the labor force  and the social protection of the unemployed, in 1994, a draft  law on the professional formation, advanced training,  retraining, and recycling of workers will be promoted. For a  better administration of the unemployment fund, a tripartite  system will be instituted for the fund's administration and  monitoring. In regard to the protection of the income of the  people, there are plans to improve the system of indexing  incomes, perfecting the mechanism of moderating the total cost  increases with wages, correlating the base wages of personnel in  public institutions with those negotiated in other sectors of  activity, as well as protecting the wages of persons with low  incomes by ensuring the payment of the minimum wage and its  periodic review.    The reform of the social security system will also aim at  the  establishment of autonomous risk insurance banks and will ensure  that budgetary expenses for social security are limited to 8-8.5  percent of the gross domestic product. In its turn, social  security will undergo profound transformations. This will  include a law for the protection of minors in special  situations, as well as a law on special protection for people  with handicaps. There are plans to improve the legislative and  institutional framework for labor safety and working conditions.  Finally, the construction of housing will be encouraged and  supported. In this area, the construction of 17,000 apartments,  currently in different stages of execution, will be completed.  The legislative framework and the necessary institutions for  financing housing construction will be created. The construction  of public housing for families with modest incomes will begin,  about 3,000 lower quality apartments will be rehabilitated, and  the program of consolidating buildings destroyed by earthquakes  will be continued. This economic strategy program of the PDSR  also makes references to the foreign policy of the country,  stressing, in this area, the elements which define our actions  in the context of a definitive rapprochement of Western European  structures to North Atlantic structures. In essence, the few  elements which we mentioned are proof that the PDSR is  tenaciously working for the consolidation of the state of law,  the acceleration of economic reform, and restructuring and  privatization, along with the assurance of real social  protection, in accordance with the laws and interests of Romania.</p>

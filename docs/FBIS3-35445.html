The  decision was made after miscreants attacked Pakistan's embassy  in the Afghan capital on 23 February. The Pakistani consulates  at Mazar-e Sharif, Qandahar, and Jalalabad will continue to  function as usual. Foreign Secretary Shaharyar Khan told a  Radio Pakistan representative in Islamabad last night that  Pakistani diplomatic and other personnel have already left Kabul  for home.    Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, who made a brief  visit to Kabul to hold meetings with Afghan leaders on the  establishment of peace in Afghanistan, met President Borhanoddin  Rabbani yesterday. He apprised the Afghan president of  Pakistan's decision to temporarily recall its diplomatic  personnel. The Afghan president was told that the embassy  building is now unfit for use, and the diplomatic staff can only  fulfill their duties when arrangements are made for a suitable  building and their security is guaranteed.    Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, who is actually in control of  Kabul, has expressed his deep grief and anguish over the  incident.    Afghan President Borhanoddin Rabbani has expressed his  regret  over the attack on the Pakistani Embassy in Kabul by some  irresponsible people. In a message to President Farooq Ahmad  Khan Leghari, he said the attack was probably the work of vested  interests that want to harm the brotherly relations between the  two countries. President Rabbani said these relations have been  further strengthened by the assistance extended by Pakistan  during the Afghan war against foreign aggression. He  particularly thanked Pakistan for providing shelter to hundreds  of thousands of Afghans during this period. Meanwhile, speaking  to APP in Kabul, the Afghan president said he has ordered an  inquiry into the incident, adding that those responsible will be  punished.    Commander Ahmad Shah Mas'ud, accompanied by the Pakistani  foreign minister, visited the Pakistani Embassy to assess the  damage. Meanwhile, seven rockets landed in the Afghan capital of  Kabul yesterday. At least six people were reported killed and  10 injured.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS AND BRIEFS: PLAYING NAME GAMES ON THE STREETS OF BERLIN  </P> <P> The reunification of Berlin, which makes it the largest city between Paris and  Moscow (pop. just over 5 million), also has resulted in a debate over which of  East Berlin's streets should be renamed to remove any memory of their Communist  associations.  </P> <P> Among the streets likely to be rechristened are, for example, Karl-Marx-Allee,  Lenin-Allee and Ho-Chi-Minh-Strasse.  </P> <P> But Germans are being cautious about the changes, pointing out that there is a  difference between naming streets and squares after corrupt officials and  honoring writers or philosophers, no matter what their politics. All agree that  the former should be changed, but some argue that the latter should stay.  </P> <P> So far, 160 name changes have been proposed, meaning that map makers will be  kept busy with updates for some time to come, as will visitors trying to find  their way.  </P> <P> Quick Fact: A record 3.2 million Americans visited Europe during the 1989-90  fall-winter season, according to figures from the U.S. Department of  Transportation.  </P> <P> Rating the Hotels: A Consumer Reports survey of more than 100,000 readers rated  42 hotel chains based on the level of satisfaction they experienced during  their visits.  </P> <P> Hampton Inn scored highest among economy hotels, Best Western among the  moderate hotels, Residence Inn in the high-priced category and Four Seasons  among luxury hotels.  </P> <P> Biggest complaint overall was about the quality of hotel food (47% of those  surveyed said they were less than "very satisfied"), followed by climate  control (35%).  </P> <P> The category of economy hotels included those whose rates were up to $40 a  night; moderate, $40-$56; high-priced, $63-$94, and luxury $91-$139.  </P> <P> Travel Quiz: Which is larger, Lake Baikal in the Soviet Union or the Bahamas?  </P> <P> Sand Trap: Morris Dweck is not feeling too kindly toward the Iraqis these days,  not since their Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Dweck had a better idea. At least he thought he did. This summer, he decided  that his North Myrtle Beach, S.C., miniature golf course needed a new image,  something that would help attract tourists and the folks from the nearby Air  Force Base in Myrtle Beach.  </P> <P> So Dweck went out and bought himself a roadside genie, then came up with a new  name for his course -- Treasures of Baghdad.  </P> <P> Ah, well, back to the drawing board.  </P> <P> Atlanta Newcomer: The 440-room Hotel Nikko Atlanta opened this month at the  intersection of Peachtree and Piedmont streets in Atlanta's Buckhead section.  In keeping with its name, the 25-story hotel features a Japanese garden and a  collection of Japanese art.  </P> <P> Quick Fact: There are 1 billion more Chinese in the world than there are  Mexicans.  </P> <P> Sweet Dreams: A new museum that should appeal to chocaholics has opened in  Birmingham, England. The Cadbury World Chocolate Experience features a  permanent exhibit at the chocolate factory, with wax models and videos on the  history of chocolate.  </P> <P> Visitors can sample a chocolate drink made according to an ancient Aztec recipe  and see chocolate being made. They can sample more chocolate at an on-site  restaurant, ice cream parlor and souvenir shop.  </P> <P> Mediterranean Crossing: A new ferry service for passengers and freight has been  established linking Turkey, Greece and Italy.  </P> <P> Minoan Lines of Crete operates the ferry, the Ariadne, which calls at Kusadasi  in Turkey, Samos, Paros, Piraeus and Cephalonia in Greece, and Ancona in Italy.  </P> <P> Don't Lighten Up: After a six-month trial run that showed a 90% favorable  reaction, Lufthansa will ban smoking on all of its domestic flights starting  next Sunday. Smoking already is banned on all buses and trains in Germany.  </P> <P> Quiz Answer: The Bahamas could fit twice into the 12,200-square-mile lake and  still leave plenty of room for swimmers.  </P></p>

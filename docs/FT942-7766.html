			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Russia and Ukraine struggle to resolve crisis in Crimea Talks between the Russian and Ukrainian prime ministers yesterday failed to resolve the gathering crisis in the Ukrainian region of Crimea, but were due to resume today with the participation of a senior official from Crimea itself. The talks in Moscow, prompted by fears that constitutional changes made by the Crimean regional parliament last week could draw Russia and Ukraine into conflict, had apparently made little headway. Ukraine sees growing secessionist sentiment in the pro-Russian Crimean parliament as a direct challenge to its sovereignty over the peninsula. Mr Mykhalo Mykhalchenko, domestic policy adviser to the Ukrainian president Mr Leonid Kravchuk, said last night that there was no possibility that the Ukrainian government would agree even to a federal arrangement with Crimea, let alone the near-independent status it voted for itself last week. 'We are not a federal state like Russia - we are a unitary state. We do not sign treaties with our regions,' he said. However, there was a concession to Crimea's status implicit in it being represented in the talks today. The move appeared to show the relative weakness of Ukraine in the talks, which are attempting to settle the contested ownership of the Crimea-based Black Sea naval fleet. The agenda also includes economic co-operation between Crimea and Russia, and the decision last Friday by the Crimean parliament to adopt a virtually independent constitution, creating a Crimean citizenship and deciding to conduct relations with Kiev by treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, who is in Moscow for talks with the country's leaders, said last night he had been assured by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, that Crimea's status as part of Ukraine was not in doubt. A report that some 20 Ukrainian armoured personnel carriers had been sent to a position near the Crimean capital of Simferopol was confirmed yesterday by the Crimean authorities - though they said it was a 'normal' movement of armour. At the same time, a spokesman for the extreme Ukrainian nationalist UNA-Unso group in Lviv, in western Ukraine, said that some 200 volunteers were being despatched to Crimea to help secure it as part of Ukraine. Parallel to the prime ministerial talks in Moscow, negotiations will start today in Kiev between senior parliamentarians from Crimea and their opposite numbers in the Ukrainian parliament. The prospects for agreement are poor. Inching towards the chasm in Crimea, Page 3 Editorial Comment, Page 17</p>

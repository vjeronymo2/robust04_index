			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Overfishing crisis threatens rift, Canada warns EC - The escalating war of words associated with an explosive foreign policy issue THE WAR of words over what Canada claims is foreign overfishing outside its waters is reaching new levels of intensity. 'This is the most explosive foreign policy issue that Canada faces,' warned Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, last month. 'Failure to reach a settlement this year could lead to a major breach in our relations with the European Community.' As Canada steps up its rhetoric, the EC in turn appears to be becoming more entrenched. 'It is ludicrous to claim that the EC is responsible for the decline in fish stocks,' an official said last week. 'We cannot be the object of such slander any more.' Mr Crosbie said that the issue would be Canada's main concern at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro this June. 'Rio really is our last shot to resolve this by the diplomatic route.' Since 1989, Canada has waged a campaign against the activities of EC vessels  -particularly from Spain and Portugal  - immediately outside its 200-mile territorial limit, accusing them of depleting stocks. In February, Canada slashed its own total allowable catch (TAC) for northern cod, the most important stock of the Atlantic fishery, by 35 per cent to 120,000 tonnes. That compares with a 1986 TAC of 266,000 tonnes. The decision followed warnings from Canadian scientists that the northern cod biomass, previously estimated at 1.1m tonnes, was only 780,000 tonnes. More worryingly, Canada says, the spawning biomass was reported to have declined by more than half. The winter fishing of these stocks by offshore vessels inside Canada's waters was halted and the harvesting of capelin, on which cod feed, was banned. A scientific offensive was also launched to persuade EC member countries that without effective management ecological catastrophe loomed. The Grand Banks fishing grounds, which have drawn European fishermen for 400 years, extend east and south of Newfoundland, breaching Canada's 200-mile limit at two points: the so-called nose and tail. A third rich fishing ground, the Flemish Cap, lies further east. Groundfish such as cod and flounder cross in and out of international waters in seasonal migrations. Canada claims this makes them highly vulnerable to foreign fleets active over a relatively small area of the continental shelf. Between 90 and 140 foreign vessels, the majority from the EC, are active in the area at any one time. At the Earth Summit, Canada will propose a resolution calling for changes in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea to give coastal states increased rights over such 'straddling' fish stocks. It hopes that the Rio meeting will rapidly be followed by an international diplomatic conference to work out the detail of a new high seas fisheries management order. So far, 40 coastal states have backed the resolution, including New Zealand, Mexico, Chile and Peru. However, no other Group of Seven industrialised countries have done so, raising fears that the issue could prove divisive in Rio. In theory, a management regime already exists for the waters off Canada: the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, formed in 1979, of which both Canada and the EC are signatories. However, Mr Vic Young, president of St John's based Fishery Products International, says: 'Nafo is totally ineffective. Any country can say it disagrees with its Nafo quota under the organisation's objection procedure and set its own. Nafo has declared a moratorium on northern cod outside 200 miles, but last year EC vessels caught about 40,000 tonnes.' The EC response to its critics is scathing. Officials have denounced Canada for making a mere 'paper' cut in its quotas, saying that Canada has simply cut this year's northern cod TAC to the level of last year's actual catch. They charge further that the issue is being blown out of all proportion for domestic political reasons. Mr Manuel Marin, the EC fisheries commissioner, said last week that he had asked for an extraordinary meeting of the Nafo scientific council to verify the latest Canadian figures on stocks, but that Canada had refused. Ottawa, Brussels says, is avoiding a harsh political reality: it should restructure and cut its own fleet. Amid the accusations and counter-accusations, many Canadians are ready to acknowledge that the decline in the fish stocks may have complex interlinked causes. Mr Young of FPI is bitterly critical of the EC fishing effort for flatfish on the tail of the Grand Banks, accusing Spanish vessels of using ever-smaller gauge nets to harvest young fish. However, he sees foreign overfishing as only one of the causes for the decline in northern cod stocks. Environmental factors such as changes in the cold water Labrador current around Newfoundland, possibly as a result of global warming, may partially account for the decline. The fall in capelin stocks and expansion of the seal herds are other possible factors. Seals eat cod in the absence of capelin, their preferred food. Some inshore fishermen, who operate with small vessels mainly within 12 miles of the shore, lay the blame for falling stocks on high-technology offshore fishing in general, combined with government mismanagement. 'Canadian quotas were set too high for years,' said Mr Tom Best, head of the fishing co-operative at Petty Harbour, a tiny fishing village south of St John's on the Avalon peninsula. 'As a result, Canadian offshore boats raped the resource from the early 1980s. We must take control of the nose and tail of the Grand Banks but we need to knock out the Canadian offshore effort as well and give the stocks a chance to recover.' Wherever responsibility lies, the human effects of the crisis in the industry are real enough. 'Plant closures devastate local communities,' says Mr Randolph Gherson, Canada's Ambassador for fisheries conservation. 'We've had 5,000 job losses and 38 plant closures in Newfoundland since 1989.' Some 40,000 people in the province are directly employed in the industry, and a further 70,000-80,000 indirectly, out of a total population of about 500,000. Unemployment is running at more than 20 per cent. Against this grim economic background, and with its own offshore fleet tied up at the quays, it is little wonder that Canada should turn its fire on the EC. If no agreement is reached in Rio, Mr Crosbie warns, Canada may have no option but to heed the siren voices calling for unilateral action, such as a de facto extension of its territorial waters.</p>

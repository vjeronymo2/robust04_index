			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FURNISHINGS 2000 CITES REASON FOR SHUTDOWN  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000, which earlier this month entered bankruptcy proceedings and  closed all of its 37 stores in California, announced Wednesday that a shortage  of funds had forced it to "cease operations."  </P> <P> Company executives did not return telephone calls, but in a prepared statement,  a Furnishings 2000 spokesman said that it has filed a motion with a U.S.  Bankruptcy Court judge in New York City that would require the company's  secured creditor, "which has a security interest in all of the company's  inventory, to remove the inventory collateral from the company's stores and  warehouses and to pay rent until the inventory is removed."  </P> <P> In the prepared statement, Furnishings 2000 spokesman Dan Morris said that the  company has "only an outside chance" of arranging financing needed to operate  its stores. Without alternate financing, the company "anticipates that proceeds  from the sale of its store leases and other assets will be insufficient to pay  all creditor claims in full," Morris said. "In that event, no distribution will  be available to stockholders."  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000, which was a San Diego-based company when it completed its  initial public offering in 1983, since has moved its corporate headquarters to  Mira Loma. The company has reported only a handful of profitable quarters since  its initial public offering.  </P> <P> Last year, GF Holdings, a privately held, New York-based company, acquired 67%  of Furnishing 2000's shares.  </P> <P> The company, which operated 37 stores in California, has five stores in San  Diego County. Employees at those stores have been furloughed, a company  spokesman said last week.  </P> <P> Furnishings 2000 customers with complaints or questions have been directed to  contact the clerk of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland at the Southern  District of New York in New York City.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS special correspondent Viktor Demidenko] </F>   [Text] Dzhankoi (the Republic of Crimea) 24 June TASS --  Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk does not regard his tours of  the country as a campaign for once again being elected to the  country's top most post. He considers them as visits by the  head of state, who wants to acquaint himself with the state of  affairs in Ukraine, he said this after his arrival in the  republic of Crimea due to the unprecedented drought that has  struck the peninsula's steppe areas. According to old residents,  they have not seen such a dry summer during past 20 years.    President Kravchuk was received at the Dzhankoi airport by  Crimean Supreme Soviet Chairman Sergey Tsekov and other  officials. But President of the Crimean Republic Yuriy Meshkov  was not seen among them. During a press conference on the  tarmac, Leonid Kravchuk said he does not regard this as a big  tragedy.    The Ukrainian president told journalists that he intends to  personally acquaint himself with the situation prevailing in the  area due to the drought, and decide what help is needed by the  people and farms.    When asked about his chances of once again being elected  president, Leonid Kravchuk replied that every person has his  chances, but they are determined by the electorate, who come to  cast their votes.    Regarding the Black Sea Fleet problem, Leonid Kravchuk said  that his stand remains unchanged. According to him, statements  made by certain political leaders about not dividing the fleet  and decide bases, do not stand up to criticism. "The fact is  that this view pint is not shared by Russia and, in particular,  by President Boris Yeltsin." "Besides this, the president  emphasised, there is a law adopted by Ukraine's Supreme Soviet,  which states that the fleet be divided and bases for ships must  be determined. And I, as head of state, must carry out this,"  he said.    Speaking of basing ships, Leonid Kravchuk emphasised that  the  Black Sea Fleet base should not be designated as the city of  Sevastopol, but as Russia's Black Sea base in Sevastopol.  According to him the Ukrainian Navy, apparently, will be based  in Balaklav.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Zuhayr Qusaybati: "Talabani Discusses Supply of </F> Arms to Kurds in Europe"]    [Excerpts] London -- Jalal Talabani, secretary general of  the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], has revealed that he  discussed with the European officials he met with on his current  tour the possibility of providing arms for the Iraqi Kurds. He  said that the results of his talks with French President  Francois Mitterrand were "excellent." [passge ommitted]    He said that the talks at the Elysee and with Defense  Minister Leotard covered "the possibility of France training  security and police forces of the Kurdish region for the  protection of the inhabitants and foreigners living there," most  of whom work for relief organizations. He added that "the reply  was positive and Paris promised to study the matter, along the  same lines as the Palestinian police forces" which will go to  the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area and which receive  international aid within the framework of the autonomy  agreement. [passage omitted]    He said that he discussed with the European officials "the  possibility of getting defensive weapons" and the exemption of  northern Iraq from the military embargo imposed on Iraq since  its invasion of Kuwait. He added that the training of Kurdish  police was one of the topics he discussed in Germany. He  stressed that Bonn is "showing special interest in the Kurdish  issue" in general and is preparing an initiative for the  settlement of the Kurdish problem in Turkey "in the context of a  political solution that would safeguard that country's unity."  [passage omitted]    On the rumors about a Turkish mediation between Baghdad and  the Iraqi Kurds, Talabani said: "We have not been officially  informed of Ankara's position." He added that he believes that  Ankara wishes to normalize relations with Baghdad. Asked about  the recent agreement between the two countries for the repair of  the oil pipelines extending from Karkuk in northern Iraq to the  Turkish coast, he replied: "Resumption of the export of Iraqi  oil via Turkey would depend on a UN resolution (lifting the  embargo) and also on a decision by the government of the region  of Kurdistan." He pointed out that a part of the pipeline passes  through the territory under the Kurdistan Front's control "and,  therefore, a share of the royalties from that oil should go to  the Kurdish people to be spent on administration, development,  and payment of salaries" in northern Iraq."

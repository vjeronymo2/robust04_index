			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Schools' League Tables: On-line reports to parents urged Parents could be given on-line computer access to school inspectors' reports and other information collected by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, under proposals outlined yesterday. Mr Mark Gladwyn, head of strategic programmes at CCTA, the government centre for information systems, suggested that the information collected and held by Ofsted might be made available to personal computer users over the Internet - the informal system of computer networks which connects databases and computers across the globe. Mr Gladwyn said the records of births, deaths and marriages since 1837 could also be made available on-line - a move which he said would be immensely valuable to historians and other researchers. Earlier this month the Treasury confirmed that Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget speech would be made available over the Internet soon after the chancellor delivered it to the Commons next Tuesday. 'Information superhighways present us with a new and exciting opportunity to improve the way we share and access information,' Mr Gladwyn said yesterday. He was speaking at a CCTA consultative meeting on information superhighways attended by more than 800 public and private sector delegates. He said providing electronic access to information was in line with the government's drive for more open government. The Open Government Code of Practice, published earlier this year, emphasised the importance of volunteering and increasing the availability and accessibility of government information. Mr Robert Hughes, minister for public service and science, said the information superhighway 'means government is open for business around the clock. The individual citizen can ask questions when it suits them, their school or small business rather than when it suits a civil servant.'</p>

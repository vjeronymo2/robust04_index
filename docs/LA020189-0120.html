			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Late Final Edition  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> DOLPHIN DEATHS TRACED TO 'RED TIDE'  </P> <P> The "red tide," poisonous algae from the Gulf of Mexico, killed hundreds of  bottlenose dolphins along the Atlantic Seaboard in 1987 and 1988, scientists  reported today.  </P> <P> The algae were carried by small fish, menhaden or Spanish mackerel, that were  eaten by the dolphins, weakening the mammals' cardiovascular and immune  systems, according to Dr. Joseph Geraci, a veterinarian and professor of  wildlife diseases at the University of Guelph in Canada. Geraci led a team of  more than 100 scientists, sponsored by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration, in an 18-month study of the dolphin deaths.  </P></p>

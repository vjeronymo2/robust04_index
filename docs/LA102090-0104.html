			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAR RUNS UP WIRE, FLIPS; 2 DIE;  </P> <P> ACCIDENT: THE AUTO DRIFTED OFF THE ROAD AND RAN UP THE GUY WIRE. ONE WOMAN WAS  PINNED INSIDE; THE OTHER WAS EJECTED ONTO THE ROAD, THEN RUN OVER.  </P> <P> Two young women were killed in a possibly alcohol-related crash early Friday  when their car drifted off the road and flew 20 feet into the air before  landing upside down on a sidewalk, police said.  </P> <P> The driver, Lisa Marie Spicer, 24, of Garden Grove was pronounced dead at the  scene of the 1:46 a.m. accident, which occurred at the intersection of Newport  Boulevard and 23rd Street, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Tom Warnack said.  </P> <P> Spicer died instantly when she was run over by a passing motorist who failed to  see her lying in the road after she had been thrown from her car, Warnack said.  </P> <P> Passenger Toshia Runner, 23, of Huntington Beach died of massive head injuries  at College Hospital.  </P> <P> Authorities said the two friends, who had known each other for only a short  time, were returning home from an evening at the Deja Vu nightclub, a popular  hangout for young adults.  </P> <P> Although investigators said that Spicer apparently had been drinking before the  accident, it was not known what caused her to drift off the two-lane road as  she was heading toward the San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> "It (the accident) is still under investigation," Warnack said. "(But) based on  witness statements, both driver and passenger appeared to be under the  influence of alcohol."  </P> <P> Costa Mesa Police Lt. Alan Kent said that Spicer and Runner had left the  nightclub, located at Newport Boulevard and Fairview Road, and headed north on  Newport Boulevard.  </P> <P> A block later, at 23rd Street, Spicer's 1984 gray Camaro drifted onto the  sidewalk, Kent said.  </P> <P> Before she could regain control, the car rode up a guy wire attached to a  40-foot-high light pole. The car, which was then about 20 feet in the air,  flipped upside down and landed on its roof, crushing it and pinning Runner  inside. The vehicle came to rest on the sidewalk about 15 feet from the pole,  Kent said.  </P> <P> Spicer was thrown from the Camaro as it skidded to a stop and uprooted a  signpost. Moments later, as she lay unconscious in the street, the driver of a  white, 1985 Chevrolet Cavalier swerved to avoid the downed light pole and  inadvertently ran over Spicer, according to Kent.  </P> <P> The driver, who was not cited, stayed at the scene until police arrived and  interviewed him.  </P> <P> "It was a traumatic experience for him," Kent said. "He was distraught. This is  not a hit-and-run situation in any way."  </P> <P> It took a Fire Department rescue team about 20 minutes to free Runner from the  wreckage and take her to the hospital, Kent said.  </P> <P> Runner's mother, Jeanne Blumer, who learned of her daughter's death at 3:30  a.m., said that the last time she talked to Runner was earlier in the evening  when her daughter dropped over to the family's Tustin home for a brief visit  after attending a mathematics class at Irvine Valley College.  </P> <P> "She came by after . . . class and told me she was going to go out," Blumer  said. "That was the last time I talked to her."  </P> <P> Blumer, a teacher for the Laguna Beach Unified School District, said the two  young women met a few months ago when Runner moved into a Huntington Beach  apartment with a mutual acquaintance.  </P></p>

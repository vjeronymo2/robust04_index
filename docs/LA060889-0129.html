			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> U.S., SOVIETS TO SIGN ACCORD  </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union are set to sign an accord pledging that  neither side will resort to force in responding to accidental military  incidents during troop maneuvers, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater  said. The pact, which does not require Senate ratification, is to be signed by  Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and his  Soviet counterpart, Army Gen. Mikhail A. Moiseyev, in Moscow while Crowe is  there for an 11-day visit beginning Monday, Fitzwater said. The pact,  negotiated by a U.S.-Soviet task force over a period of several months, is "not  intended to augment or substitute any arms control forum," Fitzwater added, but  is simply "designed to prevent the use of force in responding to accidental  military incidents."  </P></p>

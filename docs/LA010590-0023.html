			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CRIME SENTENCES  </P> <P> We seem to have one way of acting when a problem confronts us -- to identify  the "enemy," go to war, and trample him into submission. The world has operated  this way for thousands of years. Today it is even reflected in our language;  the war on poverty, war on hunger, war on drugs.  </P> <P> It was therefore hopeful to read Fairchild's article, for it raises our  awareness of another way of functioning.  </P> <P> These wars are not working. They do not stop terrorism, they do not stop drug  use, and we certainly have not been able enforce our will on the environment.  Now is a good time to start to thinking differently. As Fairchild proposes, let  us work to end the underlying causes of these problems. Let us figure out how  to help the individual move himself beyond hunger, homelessness and the despair  that leads to drugs and terrorism.  </P> <P> JACK WEIL  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

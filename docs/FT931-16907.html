			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Boardrooms look to their honours: The prime minister's changes to the awards system could upset the expectations of many business people THERE WAS a fin de siecle feeling in Whitehall last week at the ending of automatic honours for civil servants, career diplomats and politicians. It should perhaps have been echoed in boardrooms across the country because Mr John Major's overhaul of the honours system, which will affect the next list in June, will have an impact well beyond officialdom. Awards to figures in industry are not quite as routine and hierarchical as honours for mandarins, but the government still looks after the business establishment. More than half of the chairmen of the UK's top 100 companies are knights or peers, and many other senior figures in those organisations have received honours related to their status and length of service. A statement on the results of the honours system review is expected in the next three months. Downing Street has cautioned against expecting dramatic alterations in the way awards are given, saying that changes will be incremental. Over time, however, even the gradual shift envisaged will have a striking effect. In 20 years' time the House of Lords might look very different from its present appearance. For a start, it might contain fewer business representatives. Mr Major has created only two life peers from industry, and one of them, Lord Cooke, was at the request of the Ulster Unionists. The contrast in that respect with Mrs Thatcher's practice was heightened by the awarding of three life peerages to businessmen in her resignation honours list in 1991. A further change from the Thatcher years may well be the expansion of the list of those deemed acceptable for honours. Just as Mr Major gave political awards to some Tory MPs snubbed by Mrs Thatcher, so he may be willing to look beyond an inner circle of business leaders that was favoured by his predecessor and included figures such as Lord Hanson; Lord Sterling, the chairman of P&amp;O; and Lord King, the chairman of British Airways. There are also signs that political activity might not be what it once was as a way through the honours system. Although senior figures in generous corporate donors to Tory party funds, such as United Biscuits, will probably continue to receive awards, linkage may well be less immediate. Mr Stanley Kalms, the chairman of Dixons, who was a cheerleader in one of Mr Major's election campaign extravaganzas, has not yet received what many might regard as his reward, while Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, the chairman and chief executive of Kingfisher, the retail group, was knighted in last week's list. Although Kingfisher has given money to the Tories, it has also supported Labour events, and the award seems to owe more to Sir Geoffrey's involvement in initiatives such as Business in the Community. If the honours system does tilt further towards recognition of the business community's contribution to the government's rather than the Tory party's activities, in a few years' time Mr Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group, might well be celebrating a knighthood or life peerage for assisting the franchising of British Rail passenger services. Downing Street has given a strong hint that the honours review will lead to closer links between an award and someone's broader role in the community. There may be more awards such as the knighthood for Mr Paul Nicholson, the chairman of Vaux group, the Sunderland-based brewer and hotels operator, specifically for services to industry and to the public. One aide said: 'The prime minister is keen to make the system reflect areas where individuals make a contribution, rather than necessarily just do a job. The contribution can be within the job, which may go beyond the job specification, but equally may be beyond that in charity or voluntary work.' He added that in the case of someone running an organisation, the contribution might be in being flexible enough to enable their employees to play an active part in the local community. If the criteria for business honours shift in that direction, one likely candidate might be Ms Anita Roddick, the managing director of the Body Shop group, for her involvement with the homeless through the newspaper The Big Issue. Whether revamping the honours system makes it better at recognising individual merit will not be clear for some time. But if the prime minister is seeking to send an early signal that the worst aspects of politicking and Buggins' turnery have been removed, he could do worse than ponder a life peerage for Sir Bob Reid, the chairman of British Rail, whose concern for BR's social role has led him to be both publicly and privately critical of the privatisation plans.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Rybak report under the "Economy" rubric: "Boris </F> Fedorov Points to Standstill in Reforms. World Economic Forum  Winds up in Moscow"]    [Text] The work of the World Economic Forum winds up in  Moscow today. The Forum opened in the evening of the day before  yesterday. The foreign and Russian entrepreneurs attending it,  according to the organizers, set themselves the goal of "getting  the feel of the mood of the Russian economy." Addresses by  Russian political and business leaders were supposed to help the  businessmen in that. On the opening day congress participants  were addressed in Moscow's Metropol Hotel by Boris Fedorov,  former finance minister; Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, leader of the Duma  "Yabloko" bloc; and St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak.  Nikolay Travkin made periodic interventions from the floor.    The former finance minister voiced the opinion that the  government in its present composition continues to adhere to the  course of reforms chosen by Yegor Gaydar's team, however, there  is no movement in many sectors, owing to which reform is rolling  back.    In Boris Fedorov's view, the present parliament cannot work  effectively to speed up reforms. "Russia has a need for new  professional politicians," Mr. Fedorov stated. St. Petersburg  Mayor Sobchak painted his city to the foreigners in roseate  hues. According to him, the situation in the city is so  favorable that it will soon host the Goodwill games. Mr.  Travkin largely attributed the rampant crime to the development  of entrepreneurship in Russia.    Listening to representatives of the Russian establishment  were entrepreneurs representing the world's major companies in  Russia. Most of them are already carrying out specific projects.  According to Roger Gale, International Finance Corporation  (IFC) representative in Moscow, international finance  organizations have three to five more years left for active work  on the market of investments in the Russian economy, following  which, the IFC representative believed, the key positions in the  country will be taken by Russian financiers.</p>

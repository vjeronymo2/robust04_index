			<p>BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, May 31, (OANA/BERNAMA) -- Prime  Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamed Tuesday denied a Cable News Network  (CNN) report that Malaysia intends to supply arms to the  Bosnians in their struggle against Serb aggression in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. "If somebody is providing arms to Bosnia, we  know nothing about this thing," he told reporters here when  asked to comment on a CNN report Tuesday, claiming that  Malaysia, Iran and Turkey will supply arms to the Bosnians.    Dr Mahathir said Malaysia was only providing arms to its  1,500 soldiers serving under the United Nations Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The CNN report could have misinterpreted this as supplying  arms to the Bosnians, he added. We are not in the gun running  business, he said.</p>

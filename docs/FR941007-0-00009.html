The equivalent grams of protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required per 100 grams of product (on a 13 percent moisture basis) would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be determined by the following equation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4725 -->  <IMPORT>  <!-- PJG importformat s,w41,d26 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=92 g=1 f=1 --> E:GRAPHICSER07OC94.022 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </IMPORT>  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> X=grams of protein required per 100 grams of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a=20 grams (amount of protein if casein)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> b=.95 [95% &times; 1 (PDCAAS of casein)]  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> c=PDCAAS for protein used in formulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The total solids content is not less than 87 percent by weight as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by the methods described in the ``Official Methods of Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the AOAC International'' cited in paragraph (a)(2) under Enriched  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Macaroni Products with Fortified Protein in this Appendix.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) Each pound of food covered by this section shall contain 5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> milligrams of thiamine, 2.2 milligrams of riboflavin, 34 milligrams of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> niacin or niacinamide, and 16.5 milligrams of iron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Each pound of such food may also contain 625 milligrams of calcium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Only harmless and assimilable forms of iron and calcium may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added.

This does not include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> color additives, artificial flavorings, artificial sweeteners, chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservatives, or starches. Ingredients deemed suitable for use by this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph are added in amounts that are not in excess of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonably required to achieve their intended purposes. Ingredients are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed to be safe if they are not food additives within the meaning of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 201(s) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or in case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are food additives if they are used in conformity with regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established pursuant to section 409 of the act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)(1) The name of any food covered by this section is ``Enriched Wheat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=7 f=2 --> XXXXXXXX <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Macaroni Product with Fortified Protein'', the blank being filled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in with appropriate word(s) such as ``Soy'' to show the source of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flours or meals used that were made from non-wheat cereals or from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oilseeds.

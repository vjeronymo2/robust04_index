Ciller further stressed the need  to continue with the uninterrupted transport of humanitarian aid  to the Bosnians. Ciller departed for Bosnia on a humanitarian  visit this morning.    In a statement prior to her departure at Ankara's Esenboga  Airport, Ciller stated that she will first visit Zagreb where  she will meet with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.  Ciller explained that they will depart for Sarajevo after being  briefed by UN military officials. Indicating that their visit  is solely for humanitarian purposes, Ciller said: A community  in the midst of Europe has been waging a war of survival for the  last two years, enduring great sufferings to protect their  existence. Unfortunately, the world has been a silent spectator  to this tragedy. The aim of this visit is to show the Bosnians  once more that we have not forgotten them and to call on  international public opinion to be more sensitive to this issue,  our visit being another proof of our determination.    Recalling that the United Nations is constantly trying to  extend humanitarian aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ciller stressed  the need for the uninterrupted continuation of this aid.    Later, Religious Affairs Director Mehmet Nuri Yilmaz  presented Ciller with 30,000 German marks and 250 copies of the  Koran.    Ciller is accompanied by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin on  her  visit to Bosnia. Necmettin Cevheri, state minister and acting  prime minister, several ministers, and other officials saw  Ciller off at the airport.</p>

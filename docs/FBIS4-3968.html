			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Minister Wu Yi Talks About Favorite Topics in </F> Foreign Trade"]    [Text] In 1993, China continued to maintain a good  development trend and make new progress in foreign economic  relations and trade. Following the introduction of China's  reform measures in 1994, major headway will also be made in  foreign economic and trade structural reform. Prior to the  opening of the "75th Chinese Export Commodities Fair," a GUOJI  SHANGBAO reporter interviewed Wu Yi, Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation [MOFTEC] minister, on some favorite  current topics in foreign trade.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Last year there were deficits which have  been rare in China's foreign trade. Will you talk about the  main cause of these deficits?    [Wu Yi] In 1993, China continued to maintain good growth in  foreign trade on the basis of rapid development over the last  few years. In 1993, imports and exports totaled $195.72  billion, an increase of 18.2 percent over the previous year,  fulfilling the target of 11.7 percent growth set by the Eighth  National People's Congress [NPC]. Of this total, exports  amounted to $91.77 billion and imports to $103.95 billion,  increases of 8 and 29 percent respectively.    Last year China's foreign trade was mainly characterized by  a  slow increase in exports and a rapid growth in imports, the  import growth rate being 21 percent higher than the export  growth rate and the trade deficit stood at $12.18 billion. Last  year exports increased slowly but imports increased by a wide  margin, mainly because the domestic economy grew rapidly;  investments expanded; market demand was strong; some commodity  prices, particularly the prices of primary products, soared;  commodities were in short supply; and exports were reduced. In  addition, the imports of raw and semiprocessed materials,  energy, and goods and equipment for economic development  increased by a wide margin. According to statistics, imported  commodities worth more than $1 billion included planes,  automobiles, steel, crude oil, processed oil, chemical  fertilizers, industrial chemicals, and full sets of equipment.  This indicates that China is a market with a huge potential and  that the Chinese market is open.    China's basic principle in foreign trade is to maintain a  basic balance between imports and exports. It is our opinion  that to maintain a basic balance between imports and exports,  there is a need to expand exports, instead of reducing imports.  In 1994, we should make efforts to expand exports so that they  will develop further and there will be coordinated development  between imports and exports.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] It was said that there were deficits in  bilateral trade with some countries last year; what is your  opinion on this?    [Wu] In my opinion, deficits in bilateral trade are  inevitable. It is our opinion that to maintain a basic balance  between imports and exports, there is a need to expand exports,  instead of reducing imports. China's purpose in exporting is to  import advanced technology and equipment for the country's  modernization and to import goods which are in short supply in  the country. According to an estimate, China's imports will  amount to $400 billion during the Eighth Five-Year Plan. As  everyone is aware, 80 percent of China's foreign exchange income  is from foreign trade and exports. If deficits remain unchanged  because of a slowdown in exports, foreign exchange income will  reduce and imports will also be affected. I hope our trade  partners will increase their imports from China to maintain  coordinated development in bilateral trade.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] We have learned that foreign countries'  antidumping lawsuits against China's exports have increased;  will this affect China's exports? Will you please express your  views?    [Wu] Because some countries are experiencing economic  depression, their industrial production has come to a  standstill, their tariff barriers can no longer control imports  and, in addition to this, they do not understand what China is  doing in establishing the socialist market economic structure  and they discriminate against Chinese products and use  antidumping measures to prevent Chinese commodities from  entering their markets. This is something we are unwilling to  see. We favor promoting exports according to international  trade standards and object to expanding exports by dumping  commodities. China is a developing country and does not have  the economic power to dump its commodities on foreign markets.  The prices of Chinese export commodities are low mainly because  China's labor force is cheap and its production costs are low.  We hope the governments of the relevant countries, as well as  their industrial and commercial circles, will view the prices of  Chinese export commodities in accordance with the facts. Of  course, we will impose sanctions against enterprises which sell  their products to the international market at prices lower than  production costs. For this reason, we will soon promulgate  "Regulations on Handling Antidumping Lawsuits Against Chinese  Export Commodities" and "Regulations on Punishments Against  Low-Priced Exports." It is necessary to stress that under the  Chinese socialist market economic structure, enterprises have  the right to set prices. If an enterprise dumps its products at  prices lower than production costs, this is entirely its own  behavior and antidumping can only be meted out against this  enterprise's products; similar products of other enterprises  should not be subjected to antidumping. I would like to  reiterate that we object to expanding exports by dumping  commodities and are also opposed to the practice of trade  protectionism by means of antidumping.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How good is the quality of Chinese export  commodities?    [Wu] Following China's economic development, and its  scientific and technological progress since the introduction of  reform and opening up, the quality of Chinese export commodities  has improved. Particularly since the implementation of the  strategy of "scoring successes by means of quality" in 1991, all  trades and undertakings have improved their awareness about  quality, applied stricter quality criteria, and strengthened  commercial inspection work and methods. As a result of the  common efforts of foreign trade, commercial inspection, customs,  and production departments, as well as their close cooperation  and effective measures, the quality of products has improved  markedly, product variety has increased, products have been  upgraded, a number of crackdowns have been carried out against  counterfeit products achieving prominent results, and foreign  businessmen's claims for compensation have reduced. According  to statistics by commercial inspection departments, from January  to October last year, 941,000 batches of export commodities  worth $30.317 billion were examined, with a commodities approval  rate of 99.05 percent and a total amount approval rate of 99.21  percent, increases of 0.24 and 0.52 percent respectively. The  general situation was good. The implementation of the strategy  of "scoring successes by means of quality" is the fundamental  way to ensure the sustained, rapid, and healthy [chixu, kuaisu,  jiankang] development of China's foreign trade. We will  persistently adhere to this for a long period.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are the main contents of the next step  in foreign trade structural reform?    [Wu] According to the overall arrangements by the State  Council, this year China will carry out foreign trade structural  reform together with taxation reform, financial reform,  investment structural reform, planning system reform, and  foreign exchange structural reform, and will make major steps in  these reforms.    In deepening foreign trade structural reform, we will hold  firm to the orientation of standardized policy, open management,  equal competition, assuming sole responsibility for losses and  profits, integrating industry and trade, and introducing the  agent system. The purpose of foreign trade structural reform is  to establish a foreign trade operational mechanism which  conforms with international economic rules.    The main contents of the next step foreign trade structural  reform are: First, further improving foreign trade  macromanagement, during which the state will mainly use foreign  exchange rates, taxation, credit, and other economic means to  regulate foreign trade activities. The import and export  management system will be reformed, mandatory plans will be  abolished, administrative intervention will be reduced, and  control will be exercised over the total amount of some  commodities. Management over these commodities will be  exercised according to the principle of good results, fairness,  and openness, with the introduction of quota tenders, auction  sales, and regularized distribution. The policy of encouraging  exports will be implemented, the export tax refund system will  be improved, and a credit policy favorable to foreign trade  development will be put into effect. A practical overseas  enterprise management system will be established. Foreign trade  legislation will be expedited and management will proceed  according to law to maintain good operational order in foreign  trade. Second, deepening foreign trade enterprise reform and  reorganizing state-owned foreign trade enterprises according to  the modernized enterprise system. New ways of "macroeconomy and  trade" will be explored looking toward the integration between  trade and industry, trade and agriculture, trade and technology,  and trade and commerce and the integration between foreign  trade, foreign capital, and foreign economic relations.  Production enterprises, scientific and technological units, and  some commercial and material supply enterprises which possess  the necessary conditions will be entrusted with the right to  engage in foreign economic relations. Third, establishing a  foreign trade coordinating service mechanism, improving it, and  fully displaying the coordinating and service functions of  import and export chambers. Fourth, maintaining the unity  between foreign trade policies and system and increasing their  transparency.    I believe that under the correct leadership of the State  Council and with the common efforts of people in all fields, the  anticipated results will be achieved in the next step foreign  trade structural reform.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] China will introduce major reform to the  foreign exchange system. What impact will this have on foreign  trade development?    [Wu] Foreign exchange system reform is the key to deepening  foreign trade structural reform and will produce a major and  farreaching impact on China's foreign trade development. In my  opinion, it will create a fine environment of equal competition  for all kinds of export enterprises, greatly expedite the  transformation of foreign trade enterprises' operational  mechanism, more effectively display the role of foreign exchange  rates in regulating foreign trade, and play quite an important  role in expanding foreign trade and exports. This reform will  enable China's foreign exchange and foreign trade structures to  comply more closely with the requirements of the socialist  market economic structure, help form an operational mechanism  which corresponds with international economic rules, and play a  positive role in restoring China's GATT status.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] After the implementation of the foreign  exchange conversion system [jie hui zhi 4814 0565 0455] and the  abolition of foreign exchange retention, how will the normal use  of foreign exchange by export enterprises be ensured?    [Wu] Some people are worried that after the implementation  of the foreign exchange conversion system and the abolition of  foreign exchange retention, export enterprises' normal use of  foreign exchange cannot be guaranteed. As a matter of fact,  this worry is uncalled for because first, with the abolition of  the approval system for the use of foreign exchange on the basis  of the foreign exchange conversion system, banks will practice a  foreign exchange sales system and conditional conversions  between renminbi and the foreign currencies through current  accounts. If an enterprise wishes to use foreign exchange, it  can exchange renminbi for foreign currencies through a bank by  presenting an effective certificate, provided this conforms with  the state industrial policy. This will provide much convenience  for all kinds of enterprises. Second, to ensure the use of  foreign exchange by export enterprises, as a transitional  measure, they can use 50 percent of their foreign exchange  conversion quota to open an account with a designated foreign  exchange bank. The bank will provide the export enterprises  with the necessary foreign exchange facilities for expanding  their exports, including funds for processing materials,  packing, export bases, payment of claims, transportation  insurance, after-sales service, and affiliation, all to be  provided with preferential treatment and guarantees in their  accounts. The export enterprises can still have their foreign  exchange converted in the designated foreign exchange bank even  if their use of foreign exchange exceeds their account balance.  Therefore, export enterprises' normal use of foreign exchange  is reliably guaranteed.    Of course, during the transition from the old structure to a  new one, all sorts of problems will crop up. We will further  deepen reform and formulate detailed operational methods to  resolve these problems.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What impact will foreign exchange  structural reform have on export enterprises' foreign exchange  retention? To put it more specifically, can they still use  their foreign exchange retention?    [Wu] This question involves enterprises' interests and all  export enterprises are concerned about it. Here, I can say  explicitly that in the current foreign exchange structural  reform, we will fully consider enterprises' interests. First,  we will allow enterprises to retain their accounts for foreign  exchange retention quotas and cash and to continue their use.  Second, enterprises are allowed to continue to use the balance  in their foreign exchange quotas according to the original  exchange rates listed one day before the standardization of  foreign exchange rates. Enterprises which have not entered  their foreign exchange quotas in different bank accounts must  complete the necessary procedures within one month and their  foreign exchange retention can still be used according to the  above principle. Third, enterprises' foreign exchange cash  accounts can still be used, allowing withdrawals and forbidding  deposits; their accounts can be used to cover normal  expenditures or sold to the banks.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How is the situation in China's foreign  trade legislation? What are the plans?    [Wu] Since the introduction of reform and opening up the  NPC, its Standing Committee, and the State Council have  formulated and promulgated more than 500 foreign-related  economic laws and regulations, including the "Joint-Venture  Enterprise Law," "Cooperative-Operated Enterprise Law,"  "Foreign-Invested Enterprise Law," "Foreign-Related Economic  Contract Law," "Customs Law," "Commercial Inspection Law,"  "Animal and Plant Quarantine Law," and the "Maritime Commercial  Law." The state has also explicitly stipulated that to ensure  the standardization and transparency of the country's foreign  economic and trade policy, all laws and regulations involving  foreign economic relations and trade must be promulgated by  MOFTEC with the exception of laws and regulations formulated and  promulgated by the NPC and the State Council. Our ministry has  also promulgated four batches of valid documents, totaling 93  copies; it has also revoked four batches, totaling 744 copies.  In the future, we will still continue to strengthen the  legislation of foreign economic and trade laws so that foreign  economic relations and trade will develop along the legal track  in a sustained, rapid, and healthy manner [chixu, kuaisu,  jiankang].    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] To converge with the international economy,  what foreign economic and trade laws and regulations will China  promulgate?    [Wu] Following the deepening of China's foreign economic and  trade structural reform and the progress of talks on China's  resumption of GATT status, China is changing its foreign  economic and trade management modes and transforming the old  practice of mainly relying on administrative means into mainly  relying on legal and economic means. For this reason, China  will introduce a series of foreign economic laws and  regulations, of which the most important is the "Foreign Trade  Law." The draft of this law has been submitted to the NPC by  the State Council for examination and formal ratification is  expected to come out in the first half of this year. China will  also adopt some international methods to protect its domestic  industries. We are drafting "Antidumping Regulations,"  "Antisubsidy Regulations," and "Regulations on Protective  Measures." These three sets of regulations will soon be  submitted to the State Council for examination and approval.  Moreover, we have started formulating a series of regulations in  coordination with the "Foreign Trade Law," such as the  "Regulations on Ratifying Foreign Trade Enterprises" and  "Regulations Governing Import and Export Chambers of Commerce."    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] Would you please talk about the main  contents and significance of the "Foreign Trade Law."    [Wu] It has taken 12 years to draft the "Foreign Trade Law,"  during which time 10 revisions have been made. It has now been  submitted to the NPC by the State Council for examination.  Hopefully, it will soon be promulgated and put into effect.    Apart from providing terms on equal benefits and  standardized  policies, the "Foreign Trade Law" also contains principled  stipulations on foreign trade management methods which have  remained valid for the last 40 years, such as regulations on  examining and approving foreign trade enterprises, regulations  on import and export quotas, and regulations on license control.  To cope with the situation after China's resumption of GATT  status, the "Foreign Trade Law" will provide stipulations on  service trade, antidumping, antisubsidy, and protective measures.    Apart from being a management law, the "Foreign Trade Law"  will provide stipulations on measures, applicable  internationally and suitable for China's national conditions, to  promote foreign trade development such as: Establishing a  foreign trade risk-bearing fund, a foreign trade development  fund, a special foreign trade financial organization, export tax  refunds, and strengthening the role of import and export  chambers of commerce.    The "Foreign Trade Law" serves as a milestone in foreign  economic and trade legislation and is a basic law in the foreign  trade field. It will establish major foreign trade policies and  laws in a legal form. It is the basis for formulating detailed  laws and regulations and serves as a precondition for putting  foreign trade under the legal system.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] How are the talks on China's resumption of  GATT status progressing? What is the crux of the problem? Is  there a timetable for China to resume its GATT status?    [Wu] During the seven years of talks, the Chinese delegation  has made detailed explanations about China's economic and trade  structure and the signatory nations have obtained an overall  understanding of China's foreign trade system. In the last  seven years, China has carried out profound economic and trade  structural reform, which has brought China's foreign economic  and trade structure quite close to the GATT provisions.  Detailed discussions are now under way on the agreement's  contents relating to China's resumption of GATT status. Most of  the signatory nations are hoping for rapid progress in the  talks. A number of countries are beginning to conduct tariff  negotiations with China or will soon announce their readiness to  conduct such negotiations.    The main problem in China's resumption of GATT status is  that  some major signatory nations have set very high demands on  China-- demands which are a little distant from China's economic  capacity; on the other hand, it is necessary for some major  signatory nations to have the political will so that they can  really support China's reentry into GATT.    On the timetable for reentry, China of course wishes to  renter GATT as soon as possible, to enhance the vitality of the  global multitrade structure. The Uruguay Round of talks ended  smoothly on 15 December last year. Objectively, this set a  timetable for China's resumption of GATT status. According to  the regulations, China must reenter GATT before the whole  package of Uruguay Round agreements come into force; in this  way, China will be able to finally sign the agreements and  become a member of the World Trade Organization.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What is the influence of the Uruguay Round  of talks on China?    [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks has  increased China's sense of urgency to reenter GATT. Because  China was an overall participant in the Uruguay Round of talks,  only by resuming China's GATT status as early as possibly will  China be able to sign the final agreement of the Uruguay Round  of talks and perform all the duties clarified by the agreement.  This will help expand the achievements of the Uruguay Round of  talks and strengthen the comprehensiveness of the multilateral  trade structure--the World Trade Organization.    [GUOJI SHANGBAO] What are your comments on the Uruguay Round  of talks which concluded at the end of last year?    [Wu] The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks will help  prevent the spread of trade protectionism, promote international  trade development and world economic growth, and create a  comparatively stable international trade environment for China's  economy, which is developing speedily. Therefore the Chinese  Government always hoped that the Uruguay Round of multilateral  trade talks could end smoothly.    China has always favored strengthening the multilateral  trade  structure and is opposed to unilateral trade retaliation and  trade protectionism. This position corresponds with the  principle of the Uruguay Round of talks. As an overall  participant in the Uruguay Round of talks, in accordance with  the procedures, China submitted an initially agreed opening  price list for service trades and a reduced and concessionary  opening price list for agricultural and nonagricultural  products, thus fulfilling its duties and making contributions to  the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of talks together with other  participants. However, the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of  talks did not remove all trade and investment obstacles and the  final agreement and documents from the talks were unbalanced and  could not fully portray developing nations' interests. In  future the multilateral trade structure should provide  developing nations with more rights to speak.</p>

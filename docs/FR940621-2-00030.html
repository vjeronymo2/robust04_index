The design is conceived as 230 ft. long &times; 20 ft. wide roof sections in a barrel vault configuration on which photovoltaic cells would reside. The roof structure would be composed of steel columns and trusses with a metal deck and single ply membrane. The PV panels would be integrated to the outer roof layer in segmented panels. The PV panels would be 65 W PEAK to be installed for a total of 250 to 300 KW PEAK which would provide 20&hyph;25% of the peak power requirements of the Aquatic Center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed photovoltaic roof installation project objectives include: (1) Design and research of a PV system to support the increased energy consumption on campus and have a peak capacity of 3400 KW, (2) monitoring and evaluating performance of the system, (3) support Georgia Power's demand-side strategy, (4) support the Climate Change Action Plan, (5) support the Utility Photovoltaic Group (UPVG), (6) support the Georgia Tech Center of Excellence in Photovoltaics Research and Education, and (7) provide the largest, unparalleled facility integrated PV power system in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The project team is a group of individuals with experience in PV research, design, manufacturing and application. Inclusion of the Aquatic Center Design Team (ACDT), comprised of architects, structural engineers, estimators and planners responsible for the design and construction of the Aquatic Center and the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG), in the project team enhances the integration of the PV system into the Aquatic Center construction project and into the integrated schedule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This project represents a unique opportunity to showcase a renewable energy commercialization project with utility-side impact and support the Climate Change Plan. This proposal has been found to be meritorious. The team has the capabilities and commitment to this project which should provide a basis for the successful implementation of the proposed project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The program cost is estimated to be $5,439,000 total, with the DOE share being $1,993,000, Georgia Power Company share being $1,848,000, and Georgia Institute of Technology's share the remaining $1,598,000. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Golden, Colorado, on June 14, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John W.

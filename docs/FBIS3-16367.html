			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 14 Mar -- The Russian Federation has the  most up-to-date defensive weapons systems, it is willing to  trade with them, and weapons made in Russia can ensure the  security and sovereignty of any state. Such are the remarks  made by Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy chairman of the Russian  Federation Government, on the pages of an issue of the VOYENNYY  PARAD journal issued here.    Viktor Glukhikh, the chairman of the state committee for  defense sectors, analyzes the state of Russia's  military-industrial sector. He notes, in particular, that the  volume of production of arms and military equipment in Russia in  1993 was only 47.8 percent of the 1991 level. Over that period,  the production of aircraft and helicopters dropped by a factor  of 3.8, armored tank equipment by over four-fifths, ammunition  by a factor of 4.5, and military production in the electronics  industry by a factor of 5.4. The main reason for the drop in  the pace of military production is the lack of financing. At  the end of 1993, the state owed the military industry about one  trillion rubles for already manufactured products.</p>

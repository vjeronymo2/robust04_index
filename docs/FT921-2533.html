			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Arts: Le Roi d'Ys - Bloomsbury This year's University College Opera presentation is of Lalo's once-famous Roi d'Ys (Paris Opera-Comique, 1888). The choice may have been ambitious - since heavier-than-usual demands are placed on chorus and orchestra - but ambition has been rewarded. A lively, enthusiastic performance brings back to London one of the most stirring and enjoyable of all operas outside the regular repertory. This attempt at a Breton Lohengrin marries Grand Opera trappings to the concision and economy of the smaller-scale French operatic forms. The tale, based on Breton legend, is threaded with Lohengrin-like intrigue and treachery, with secret passion (of Princess Margared for the warrior Mylio) and jealousy (of Margared for her sister Rozenn, Mylio's beloved) - the libretto, not exactly distinguished in tone, is a model of getting-a-move-on. Yet the musical foundation of the opera is its Breton rhythmic pulse and colour, most delightfully experienced in the opening choruses and the Act 3 Wedding Scene (including Mylio's beautiful Aubade). What reads in the libretto as stock melodrama is made elatingly muscular and pointed by the music. Mike Ashman's production has been brilliantly designed by Bernard Culshaw in terms of primary-colour costume and sliding panel; it works up a remarkable amount of fast-moving spectacle in a small space and on a limited budget. The means are modern, simple; the management of student-choral forces is both daring and canny. The threat of inundation that provides the opera with its finale is suggested with billowing sheets and cloths - an over-familiar device made brand-new by the intelligence of its accomplishment. Student opera-staging of this imaginatively bold kind is always a special pleasure, especially when underwritten by such committed student-chorus singing (in passable French) and acting. The valiant UCO orchestra's struggles with the complexities of the scoring were less easily concealed. In spite of this the conductor, David Drummond, kept a strong hand on the dramatic unfolding: the mounting excitement of the closing scene was proof of that. Of the principals, all requiring a peculiarly French combination of power, elegance and sweetness, by far the most stylish was Hilary Western as Rozenn  -a lovely performance, accurately and truly sung, from an undervalued soprano. Two young visitors from eastern Europe add to the interest of the casting: the inexperienced but highly promising Russian tenor Alexander Naumenko (charming in Mylio's Aubade) and the forceful but wooden Georgian baritone Irakli Grigalashvili (the villain Karnac). As Margared, the opera's beau role, the mezzo Jenny Miller released flashes of eloquence and passion whenever a constricted vocal technique permitted. Performances tomorrow and Saturday.</p>

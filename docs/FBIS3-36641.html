He said in response to journalists' questions put to him  before his departure to Tashkent and Almaty: "Approximately one  third of the population (in Estonia and Latvia -- IF) is marked  by ethnic belonging. This is to say the Russian-speaking  population -- Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Jews, and even  Finns who are refused citizenship. They would like to acquire  such citizenship. They are refused for only one reason -- the  ethnic one. If this is not ethnic cleansing, then what would  you call it?"    "If people are called `occupants' and `aliens,' they start  to  act that way. This results in instability," the foreign  minister emphasized.    He mentioned another example proving the violation of the  Russian-speaking population's human rights. "Everyone was to  serve in the army in the former USSR. Now they want to  expatriate from Estonia and Latvia not all former Soviet  servicemen but only Russian-speaking ones. It is obvious that  this has been based on ethnic reasons rather than political  ones," Kozyrev remarked.    In his words, "the attempts to repay ordinary people for the  Stalin regime's crimes were political stupidity." "I recognize  that the Stalin regime did commit crimes. However, we cannot  forget that they were committed by the political power -- Stalin  on the one hand and Hitler on the other, who had concluded the  Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. It is unacceptable that thousands of  ordinary people have to pay for these crimes 45 years later and  that the ethnic principle is used."    Kozyrev pointed out that Russia could not remain indifferent  to all that was happening near its borders. "The world must pay  attention to this inhuman and potentially dangerous situation,"  the Russian foreign minister concluded.</p>

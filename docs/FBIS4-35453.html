			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The Palestinian President Mr. Yasir 'Arafat  arrived in the capital this evening on a visit to our country.  [passage omitted]    After listening to the Palestinian and Mauritanian national  anthems and reviewing a unit from the armed forces which  performed a salute of honor, President 'Arafat greeted the  people who welcomed him before going to the VIP lounge where he  answered the questions of the national press.    Colleague (Mounha Bint Sbiaa) from the national TV asked him  about the goal of the visit and the Palestinian president  replied: I am not asked when I come to my second country; I am  here with my brother and the beloved of our people the  president, for whom we have all friendship and love. In  reality, before my visit to the homeland soon, God willing, it  is my duty to come to greet his excellency the president and  thank him for this continuous and permanent support which we  have received from the Mauritanian president, government, and  people at all levels and at every meeting. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] According to  what we have announced and as you mentioned, we can say that  your present visit is a farewell one to his excellency the  president before your blessed journey to Jericho, God willing.  What are the certain guarantees which we can talk about in the  future when we mention the implementation of self-rule in Gaza  and Jericho first as being an effective start for the full  Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and  consequently for the setting up of a free independent  Palestinian state on this land?    ['Arafat] The sole guarantee is our people and the sole  guarantee is our Arab brothers who stand by us and the sole  guarantee is our friends in the world who stand by us. It is  known that we only get things with difficulty and it is no  coincidence that we have been negotiating for more than two and  a half years and what for, for a transitional period and we are  still negotiating with our Arab brothers and despite that, we  have not been able to reach that, and there are still  negotiations on the Syrian track, and on the Palestinian track  which will continue, and there are also negotiations on the  Lebanese and Jordanian tracks until we are able to reach a just  and comprehensive solution on all the Arab tracks and not only  on the Jordanian, Palestinian, Syrian, or Lebanese tracks  [sentence as heard].

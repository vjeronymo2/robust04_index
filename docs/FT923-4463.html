			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Crackdown urged on life houses ONE OF the founders of Allied Dunbar, the company which has revolutionised life insurance sales techniques, has sent the Office of Fair Trading a submission calling for tougher controls on the industry. The move comes as a response to the OFT's consultation exercise on the Securities and Investments Board's retail investment review, which ended last week. Mr Joel Joffe, who retired as deputy chairman of Allied Dunbar last year, said he was disappointed with SIB's review. He said the evidence for mis-selling was overwhelming and that consumers received bad value for money. The Association of British Insurers strongly rebutted Mr Joffe's charges, describing some of them as 'factually inaccurate'. Observer, Page 17</p>

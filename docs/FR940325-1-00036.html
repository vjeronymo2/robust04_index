Orders issued by the COTP may be appealed as provided in &sect;160.7 of this chapter. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;128.310 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Survey: general. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each operator of a passenger terminal shall conduct an initial, comprehensive terminal security survey before preparing the plan required by &sect;128.300. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The operator shall update the survey at least every two years and whenever there is a notification from the COTP of an increased threat to the terminal or a passenger vessel subject to part 120 of this chapter which moors at the terminal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The operator shall update the survey and notify the COTP within 10 days of a_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Change in the description of the terminal required by &sect;128.320(e); or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Change in the owner, operator, or terminal security officer of the terminal or in the operator's representative. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The survey must identify potential threats of unlawful acts against the terminal, against a passenger vessel subject to Part 120 of this chapter moored to the terminal, or against persons on the terminal or vessel.

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Arts: Today's Television There can be few publicity stunts as cost-effective as that of the K Foundation which has promised to give Pounds 40,000 to the losers of tonight's Turner Prize, itself worth Pounds 20,000. The prize, for an outstanding piece of work by an artist under 50 (an amazing piece of 'ageism') will be awarded during the C4 culture series Without Walls (9.00). We are told that the larger amount for the losers will be announced during a commercial break in the programme. Whether it really happens is almost irrelevant: the point about the tawdriness of such money awards has already been made. 40 Minutes (BBC2, 9.50) is also about art. Were you aware that you and I have been supporting Peter Howson in Bosnia as he acts as official war artist? Nor was I. Do you suppose we also employ official war sculptors? Official war alternative comedians? If not, why not? According to the programme's billing, Howson's impressions 'bring fresh perspective to the tragedy of civil war'. Omnibus (BBC1, 10.20) is about conductors, some of whom it seems are paid more than the entire orchestras in front of them.</p>

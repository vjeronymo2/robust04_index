			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / London hints at early start to Sinn Fein talks: The government may not wait for weapons to be handed in The government was put on the defensive yesterday after Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, indicated it might enter preliminary dialogue with Sinn Fein without waiting for the IRA to hand in its weapons. His remarks dismayed some Tory backbenchers, with one MP accusing the government of giving in to the terrorists. Downing Street said the government had made a non-negotiable demand that Provisional IRA leaders end violence for good; those concerned should accept that they had 'no need for weapons'. Downing Street also signalled that a secret message sent to the Provisionals on November 5 and made public later in the month gave an indication of subjects the government would be prepared to address in exploratory meetings. One subject that might be discussed was the restriction on broadcasting direct speech by members of terrorist organisations in the province and their apologists. Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, is expected to report on a review of the restrictions to the prime minister early next year. Officials acknowledged that while there was no question of an amnesty for IRA prisoners, the sentence of any prisoner could be reviewed under normal procedures which took account of whether criminals were likely to reoffend. The November 5 message set out three purposes for the exploratory dialogue that the government originally proposed entering into in January, in return for a permanent end to IRA violence. These were: To explore the basis upon which Sinn Fein would come to be admitted to an 'inclusive political talks process'. To exchange views on how Sinn Fein would be able over a period to play the same part as the present constitutional parties in the public life of Northern Ireland. To examine the practical consequences of the ending of violence. For the first meeting of exploratory dialogue it was proposed that each party could field up to three delegates plus possibly an additional group of advisers. The British side was to be represented by 'senior officials' acting under 'political authority and direction'. Interviewed on BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Patrick said: 'At exploratory talks it would be highly relevant as to when and how arms should be surrendered. You cannot be sitting on top of arms and at the same time saying you are for real when you say that violence is at an end.' Separately, he signalled the government would not automatically say any deal with Sinn Fein was off if one bomb exploded during the interim three months. 'If there is a bomb that goes off somewhere, that will count very heavily against their credibility, but it is very important not to be tied down here and now to precise circumstances when we do not know what they are going to be,' he said. Mr David Wilshire, Tory MP for Spelthorne, said he was 'appalled and alarmed' at the prospect that the government did not expect the IRA to hand over arms until the talks started. 'This means we have just given in to the terrorists. I had a sense that this was too good to be true. We are beginning to see some of the detail - and I don't like it,' he said. Security sources in Northern Ireland said yesterday that an extended ceasefire by the IRA would be matched by a phased reduction of the Army and police presence. Army commanders and senior Royal Ulster Constabulary officers are understood to hold in reserve a contingency plan drafted in the event of an IRA ceasefire lasting well beyond the traditional three or four-day Christmas lull. The sources insist that there would be no immediate return to barracks. But measures including an end to security barriers in city centres and a reduction in Army and police checkpoints would be taken 'within weeks'. A senior Northern Ireland source who has acted as a channel of communication in the past between the IRA and government officials said that Sinn Fein officials were finding it difficult to persuade sectors of the IRA that the joint declaration represented the best possible solution for the nationalist community.</p>

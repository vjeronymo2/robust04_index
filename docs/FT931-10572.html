			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / More cautious approach by new EC environment commissioner 'CONTROLLING carbon dioxide is a very long-term project - it will certainly not be finished by the end of the year. Beyond that it is hard to guess what happens,' says Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the new EC environment commissioner. Mr Paleokrassas describes this judgment as 'realistic', but it is likely to be controversial. Proposals for a combined carbon and energy tax to combat the threat of global warming are among the most ambitious and well-publicised of EC environmental policies. There is also a view that the appointment of the former Greek finance minister is a signal of downgrading the importance of environmental issues within the European Community. While he rejects that view, his cautious approach contrasts with that of his best-known predecessor, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, who was credited with putting environment policy on the EC map. The commission is looking at ways of rebalancing the proposed carbon and energy tax so it falls more heavily on transport and less on energy generation than early versions. However, the main obstacle the proposals face is the condition that other industrialised countries must take similar steps, although Mr Paleokrassas is 'encouraged' by statements from the new US administration and from a recent high-level Japanese visit to Brussels. Because of the difficulties, he says he would be happy to see a long-term place for nuclear power, which does not emit carbon dioxide, along with greater use of natural gas. He acknowledges too some of the problems of enforcing the 200-odd environmental directives enthusiastically passed by Brussels in the past two decades. The new standards on drinking and bathing water are proving particularly expensive for some countries to meet: UK water companies say that around half of their present Pounds 45bn (Dollars 68bn) investment programme is prompted by the EC rules. To help poorer countries comply he wants to turn to the new cohesion fund created by the Maastricht treaty, intended to help Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece to fill in missing 'links' in European transport networks and to meet EC environmental standards. However, those countries have so far shown more interest in using the money to build roads - a further environmental headache, as transport emissions are already the fastest growing type of air pollution. He is resigned to the environment getting the smaller share of the cohesion fund: 'If 30 per cent (of the fund) went purely to environment I would be happy.' Even that share - which some believe is unlikely - is a small sum: only Ecu5bn (Dollars 6.2bn) spread over seven years. He is optimistic, however, about some of the lower-profile EC projects such as eco-labelling and eco-auditing, arguing that 'these make it profitable for industry to promote the environment', and that eventually 'environmental businesses may provide a stimulus to growth'.</p>

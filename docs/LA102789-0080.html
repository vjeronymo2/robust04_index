			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> AFTER 1 YEAR IN OFFICE, DOUBTS CLOUD CHARISMA OF SUPT. GEORGE MCKENNA;  </P> <P> CHASING ELUSIVE DREAMS  </P> <P> Some of those on the selection committee for Inglewood's new school  superintendent still remember when George J. McKenna III -- fresh from a  television movie and White House visit -- first entered the interview room last  summer.  </P> <P> "When he walked in I could see the mouths drop open," said Terry Coleman, one  of those present. "He was debonair. He was dressed to kill. People looked at  him like he was the Messiah."  </P> <P> Another committee member, Mildred McNair, said: "I felt like we had a Hollywood  figure in the room. . . . We tend to look at anyone in a movie as a Hollywood  star, and we can't look at them as a normal person."  </P> <P> A year has passed since McKenna left the rejuvenated Washington Preparatory  High School in South-Central Los Angeles and took the reins of a school system  beset with political infighting, low test scores and deteriorating campuses.  </P> <P> When he took over the $80,000-a-year post heading the Inglewood Unified School  District, McKenna was basking in praise and nationwide attention, including a  made-for-television movie called "The George McKenna Story," which chronicled  his successful efforts at Washington Prep.  </P> <P> Ahead of him in the county's 13th-largest school district, however, was a rocky  educational road lined with a powerful teachers' union, a contentious school  board and parents fed up with the district's poorly run schools.  </P> <P> Those who selected McKenna, those who work with him, those whose children he  supervises, generally agree that one year is too short a time to raise a  district's test scores, repair disintegrating buildings and set up a new system  for educational excellence. But as McKenna begins the process, resistance is  developing among some who say that underneath his star quality is an  inexperienced administrator who demands too much and negotiates too little.  </P> <P> McKenna, in his first superintendent's job after a decade as a principal in the  Los Angeles Unified School District, says he's ready for the challenge and has  heard all the criticism before.  </P> <P> "I expect disbelievers to surface," he said of his first year. "There are more  disbelievers out there than there are believers. I know that. I expect anyone  trying to make major, systemic change in public institutions to face major  resistance."  </P> <P> It's 9:15 a.m. and McKenna is alone in the center of the Inglewood High School  gym as several hundred students eye him from the bleachers on either side.  </P> <P> "Life to some of us is not as important as it should be," he bellows into the  microphone. "Trust me, there is no gang-bangers' heaven. If there were, it  would have bars on it."  </P> <P> His voice rises and falls at just the right moments. He knows what the audience  wants, and needs, to hear. He strides back and forth as he speaks, waving his  arm for emphasis. At the end comes wild applause.  </P> <P> Whether on television's "Nightline," at an educational meeting in Lexington,  Ky., or in a high school gym, McKenna's power is in his tongue, those who work  with him say. Even his critics acknowledge how McKenna motivates, inspires,  impassions, when he has a microphone in his hand. It's in the nuts and bolts of  the superintendent's job that some critics and supporters say McKenna needs  work.  </P> <P> "McKenna is a visionary," said board member Zyra McCloud. "He's an orator, a  motivator. But in terms of running a school district, McKenna is a rookie, very  inexperienced, very weak. He doesn't always listen to good advice from board  members, parents, administrators and teachers. I'm still waiting for results."  </P> <P> Board member Thomasina Reed added: "For someone who has no experience for a  superintendent, he is doing a reasonably good job. If he had more experience,  he would be doing a better job. He has some impressive and perhaps unattainable  goals."  </P> <P> McKenna, 49, a New Orleans native who holds a bachelor's degree from Xavier  University, a master's degree in mathematics from Loyola University of Chicago  and an honorary doctorate from Xavier, admits that he gets frustrated with some  aspects of the job.  </P> <P> "One of my weaknesses is I try to do too many things simultaneously," he said  earlier this month from the district offices on South Inglewood Avenue. "I may  not have the resources to finish or the people to carry it through. . . . When  you make a speech or write a bulletin, it doesn't mean all the schools will  change overnight. It won't happen. You have to spend time. And sometimes with  minutiae. Minutiae, that's my frustration."  </P> <P> Getting along with an often tumultuous school board is another challenge.  School trustees frequently question the superintendent's proposals at board  meetings, which can stretch to eight hours or more.  </P> <P> "I doubt that he realized it would be this tough to get along with the board,"  said Larry Aubry, board president. "You have five personalities and five  agendas. It's his job to balance them."  </P> <P> The last Inglewood superintendent didn't succeed at that.  </P> <P> McKenna was first offered the Inglewood job in 1985, when a three-member board  majority aligned with Mayor Edward Vincent fired then-Supt. Rex Fortune. He was  rehired six weeks later after a community uproar. McKenna said he declined the  1985 offer because of the divided board. When Fortune resigned in July, 1988,  McKenna said the political climate had changed.  </P> <P> McKenna's chief critics during his first year have been the teachers, who have  been working for more than a year without a contract. Members of the Inglewood  Teachers Assn. call McKenna authoritarian and anti-teacher for his hard-line  stance during the contract talks.  </P> <P> Beginning salaries for Inglewood's teachers last year -- $22,614 -- ranked 25th  out of the 43 unified districts in Los Angeles County for those with bachelor's  degrees and 30th for those with master's degrees, according to county education  statistics. Earlier this month, teachers turned down the district's offer of a  2.5% salary increase for the 1988-89 year; the union wants 14%.  </P> <P> The union also says McKenna is quick to send memos to teachers but is slow to  involve them in decisions.  </P> <P> Wayne Johnson, president of United Teachers-Los Angeles, says similar  criticisms were leveled against McKenna during his 10 years at Washington Prep.  </P> <P> "George was very demanding, very authoritarian," Johnson said. "It really had  to be done George's way. There was very little collaboration with the faculty.  It was George's way or the highway, as we used to say."  </P> <P> Of the 142 teachers he first worked with at Washington, 122 moved elsewhere  during his tenure, Los Angeles union officials said.  </P> <P> Cheryl Bell, the vice president of the Inglewood union, says morale among her  colleagues could not be lower. Many are looking to Los Angeles and other  districts to escape the low pay, deteriorated classrooms, lack of supplies and  now, she said, a lack of respect from the superintendent.  </P> <P> "I would give him a poor grade -- a low D," said union president Ervin Drayden.  "I think we had high expectations. We hoped he would come in and work with the  teachers. The teachers think they have gotten the short end of the stick."  </P> <P> McKenna disagreed with the characterization that he is anti-teacher, but  emphasized that it is his job to run the schools.  </P> <P> Even McKenna critics say the teachers' union has become too powerful in  Inglewood. After a brief walkout in 1987, the union gained a 14% raise over two  years that has been blamed for the district's budget crunch the next year.  </P> <P> "Teachers should get more money," McKenna said, "but the question is, 'Where  does it come from?' The second question is, 'After we give them the money, what  commitment do we get in return?' "  </P> <P> Money is a problem for the district, which had to cut $3 million from its  $44-million general fund budget for 1988-89 and is struggling back toward  financial health. The current $47-million budget restores several top-level  positions eliminated during those cuts.  </P> <P> His first year, McKenna said, was spent presenting his educational mission to  the community and laying the groundwork for it. McKenna's goals are ambitious:  turning upside down a system that he says is not designed for disadvantaged  youngsters.  </P> <P> He wants parents at every school maintaining order, teachers judged on  performance just like everybody else, students not slipping through the cracks.  Inglewood has about 720 teachers and an enrollment of more than 15,900 students  -- 54% black, 43% Latino, 2% white and 1% others.  </P> <P> McKenna has sent contracts to homes that outline the district's expectations  for both parents and students. A memo also went out to principals and teachers  outlining McKenna's standards.  </P> <P> Although some of McKenna's staff choices have won praise -- like his  appointment of the district's only Latino principal -- others have met  resistance.  </P> <P> At a school board meeting in August, dozens of community members protested  McKenna's selections of new principals and assistant principals. They said he  had vowed to clean house and then simply shuffled the current administrators,  missing his first big chance to improve the schools.  </P> <P> During that meeting, an angry McKenna told the board: "If I cannot make the  district function, you can with three votes find yourself another  superintendent." When tempers cooled, the board approved all but three of the  superintendent's choices.  </P> <P> Earlier this month, residents crowded into another meeting to complain about  severe scheduling problems at Morningside High School, where the principal and  assistant principals were replaced by McKenna in August.  </P> <P> When school opened, some classes had more than 100 students, others had 10 or  fewer. Even two months into the school year, many student schedules have not  been worked out. Whereas administrators blame the situation on computer  problems, critics say last-minute staff changes caused the chaos.  </P> <P> "I don't think he's made the progress people expected, and I don't see it in  the near future," said W. R. (Tony) Draper, a former board member. "Morningside  is an example of the confusion that has occurred during his first year."  </P> <P> Everyone wants to see if the district's lagging test scores will improve under  McKenna. The district traditionally finishes in the bottom third in the county  for all grade levels in the California Assessment Program. In 1988-89,  12th-grade reading and math scores were lower than 98% of the districts across  the state.  </P> <P> "This district has been floundering for a long time, and now we're asking for a  new direction," said Joseph Rouzan, board vice president. "The problems are not  going anywhere overnight. You put out one fire, and another one starts."  </P> <P> Vincent, a former school board president who frequently grumbles about how the  district is run, concurred. "He came to a very difficult situation, and he is  trying to put the pieces together," the mayor said. "I think it is unfair to  castigate him. He has inherited a bad situation."  </P> <P> Coleman, a member of the Inglewood PTA-Council, said people "thought McKenna  had the magic wand when he came in. They're realizing now that he's human. I'm  not pleased with his first year. I'm still waiting for action."  </P> <P> Aubry said everyone will expect more from McKenna during his second year. "In a  way, it's been like an extended honeymoon. That will end soon. At that point,  the training situation is over."  </P> <P> McNair, a longtime Inglewood resident who works in the Los Angeles schools, is  even tougher on McKenna. "If he thinks we'll continue to pat him on the back in  Inglewood, he can forget it," she said.  </P> <P> McKinley Nash, superintendent of Centinela Valley Union High School District,  which covers Lawndale, Hawthorne and Lennox, says McKenna's first year has gone  according to schedule.  </P> <P> "Leadership itself illicits critique and criticism," Nash said. "The  superintendent who has little or no criticism is not leading anywhere. McKenna  should have a high enough threshold that he is not bothered by the criticism."  </P> <P> McKenna, who has a contract through the 1990-91 school year, says he is on  track to meet his goal of revamping Inglewood's schools in three years. That  goal stands despite all he has learned about the hurdles a superintendent must  leap.  </P> <P> "I've learned that you can't take this job too seriously," McKenna said. "You  can take the concepts and the philosophies very seriously. But I always  remember that superintendents have committed suicide, superintendents have  dropped dead on the job, superintendents have lost their families and gotten  divorced (while) fighting over issues that they should have been able to ease  off on."  </P></p>

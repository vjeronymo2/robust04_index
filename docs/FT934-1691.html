			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Bonuses - perhaps it was only half the story? Sir, I was most interested to read the article, 'What to buy her with the bonus' (How to Spend It, December 11/12). I take it, from the tone of the article, that either: a) Women do not earn bonuses of any great value; b) Women are less likely to need a point by point guide as to how to spend them; or c) The concluding part to the article will appear next weekend.

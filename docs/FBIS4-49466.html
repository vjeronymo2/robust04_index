			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Edward Chen and Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Managua, May 4 (CNA) -- Republic of China [ROC]  President Li Teng-hui said here Wednesday [4 May] that his  country will continue helping Nicaragua in its push for economic  development.    Li made the pledge when meeting his Nicaraguan counterpart,  Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, shortly after Li's arrival in  Nicaragua Wednesday afternoon for a two-day official visit.    Chamorro expressed her heartfelt thanks to Li for Taiwan's  assistance in Nicaragua's economic reconstruction. In return,  Li thanked Chamorro for Nicaraguan support of the ROC's bid to  gain a seat in the United Nations.    Nicaragua is one of Taiwan's seven Latin American allies  that  together submitted a letter to UN Secretary-General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali, asking the United Nations to put the ROC's UN bid  on the agenda for the 48th General Assembly last September. The  request was voted down.    Li and Chamorro also exchanged a wide range of views on  issues of mutual concern. Raymond Tai, spokesman for the  Presidential Office, said the meeting was held in a "friendly  atmosphere."    Li stressed in a welcoming reception held in his honor later  in the day that the ROC is willing to share its successful  "Taiwan experience" with Nicaragua.    The first ROC-Nicaraguan ministerial meeting was also held  Wednesday, during which Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Ernesto Leal  Sanchez vowed to continue to support the ROC politically, saying  there is no reason to continue keeping Taiwan and the 21 million  people in Taiwan out of the UN.    Attending the meeting on Taiwan's side were Foreign Affairs  Minister Chien Fu, Central Bank of China Governor Samuel C.  Shieh, council for economic planning and development chairman  Hsiao Wan-chang, Executive Yuan adviser Jeffrey Koo, and Tai,  who is also vice presidential secretary-general.    The second ministerial meeting will be held Thursday, during  which an extradition treaty, bilateral economic cooperation and  Taiwan investment in Nicaragua will be discussed.    A joint communique will be issued on Thursday before Li  leaves Managua for Costa Rica, where he will attend the  inaugural ceremony for Costa Rican President-Elect Jose Maria  Figueres on Sunday.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORAL MAJORITY HAS REACHED GOAL, WILL DISSOLVE -- FALWELL  </P> <P> Claiming that his goal of prodding religious conservatives into the political  arena has been achieved, the Rev. Jerry Falwell announced Sunday that he will  dissolve the Moral Majority in August.  </P> <P> "The Religious Right is solidly in place. . . . Moral Majority as an  organization is no longer needed," Falwell said during a news conference as  part of the Religion Newswriters Assn. meeting here.  </P> <P> The independent Baptist pastor from Lynchburg, Va., founded the lobbying  organization 10 years ago this month at a time when fundamentalists and the  Religious Right had only begun to attract attention. He was here to speak  Wednesday to an evangelists' meeting as part of the three-day annual convention  of Southern Baptists, which opens Tuesday.  </P> <P> "Moral Majority was credited or blamed, depending on your perspective, for the  election of Ronald Reagan to the Presidency in 1980" and the voters' rejection  of some liberal U.S. senators, Falwell said.  </P> <P> That claim was disputed several years ago by some religious sociologists, who  felt the political swing to the right was already occurring. Nevertheless,  Falwell added that he thought it was likely that Reagan was reelected in 1984  and succeeded by George Bush because of the galvanizing influence of Moral  Majority.  </P> <P> The organization -- and Falwell -- became symbols of the resurgent Religious  Right. Newspapers and television shows increasingly sought out Falwell and  others as spokesmen for conservative views -- a forum Falwell said did not  exist in the 1970s.  </P> <P> As an example, Falwell said that before 1979 it was rare "that anyone with our  point of view" would appear on Phil Donahue's talk show. "Now, I've been on the  Donahue show 16 times and turned it down as many times because of scheduling  problems," he said.  </P> <P> Yet Falwell, 55, acknowledged that Moral Majority reached its peak in the  mid-1980s.  </P> <P> Moral Majority, which Falwell said registered "millions" of conservative voters  who had previously shunned politics, raised a high of $11 million in 1984, but  dropped to its lowest amounts over the last three years.  </P> <P> "We only raised about $3.5 million last year," he said.  </P> <P> Moral Majority never became a large membership organization, but developed a  mailing list of 50,000 pastors, Falwell said. Yet some state chapters, such as  the one in California, were only intermittently active and had very little  impact.  </P> <P> The current "rising star" for the Religious Right, Falwell said, is radio  broadcaster and author James Dobson of the Pomona-based Focus on the Family  ministries. Dobson, an ardent foe of abortion, pornography and, last year, the  controversial film "The Last Temptation of Christ," has begun forming political  lobbying groups in each state.  </P> <P> Dobson was recently criticized by U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop for  allegedly giving out misinformation about AIDS. And Dobson was in the news  early this year when his prison interview with mass murderer Theodore R. Bundy  -- the final one granted before his execution in Florida -- quoted Bundy as  pointing to a youthful fascination with hard-core pornography as a factor in  his path to violent sex crimes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Less Political Activity  </P> <P> By contrast, Falwell has reduced his political activity since 1986, when he  said he would devote more time to his church, TV ministry and his Liberty  University, which will have 7,000 students in the fall.  </P> <P> He resigned as president of Moral Majority in 1987, acknowledging that the name  had often become a hindrance because critics attacked it as a symbol of  political and religious intolerance. Falwell stayed as Moral Majority board  chairman but subsumed it within a larger body he called the Liberty Federation.  </P></p>

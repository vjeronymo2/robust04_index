			<p>BFN     [Text] Islamabad, May 29: Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has  said that the government will impose new taxes of about Rs 15  billion in the forthcoming budget.    Speaking at a Press conference in her chamber on Sunday, Ms  Bhutto said the forthcoming budget would be a realistic one, but  said the government would have to impose taxes owing to the ill-  conceived policies and economic mismanagement of the previous  government.    She said the budget would be tough because of variety of  reasons. She pointed out that salaries had not been increased  for the last three years and the government would have to take  budgetary measures to increase salaries and provide relief to  the people.    Dilating on the country's economic situation she said the  yawning gap hetween the income and expenditures was not because  of the present people's government. She pointed out that loans  taken by the previous government of Nawaz Sharif exceeded the  sun of loans taken by all the governments since 1947.    "The government had the option either to meet the budget  deficit through more borrowings or imposing taxes," she said.  She said the people's government while departing from the  policies of previous governments decided to take a tough  decision of introducing new taxes and help recover the ailing  economy.    She claimed that the budget deficit during the previous  Nawaz  government rose from 6 per cent of GDP to over 8 per cent of  GDP. It is likely to cross 9 per cent of the GDP in the coming  June, she said. The present government has arrested the  increasing deficit and was taking every possible step to bring  it back to 6 per cent, she added.    The previous government, she maintained, spent over 80  million dollars on the yellow cab scheme and stopped the Hub  power project which was initiated in the previous PPP  government. She said it resulted in severe energy crisis in the  country which again reflected on the country's production and  further aggravation of economic situation.    Giving yet another reason for the government decision to  impose taxes, she said the government was introducing structural  reforms and tariffs. She pointed out that tariffs had already  been brought down from 150 per cent to 100 per cent and intended  to further reduce these. The shortfall because of the reduction  in tariffs should also have to make up from other taxes, she  added.    However, she said the decrease in the tariffs would help  accelerate pace of industrialisation in the country, which would  not only provide employment but also improve the overall  economic situation.    Expressing determination to eliminate unemployment from the  country, she said "we do not want to betray the people or want  to buy time."    I do not believe in making cosmetic changes," she said.    Responding to a question about general sales tax in context  with the Afghan transit facility, she said the government was  fully alive of the situation and would certainly address to the  problem. She agreed that Afghan transit facility was being  abused and in the present situation without reviewing the Afghan  transit facility imposition of general sales tax would  strengthen the black economy. She, however, refused to disclose  the details of measures the government intended to take in this  behalf, and said the government wanted to force the black  economy to join into the mainstream economy.    Further criticising the policies of previous government she  said they cut the budget of education women development, energy  and other important social sectors just for the sake of laying a  lavish motorway.    Enumerating the steps taken by the present government during  the past six months, she said it was highly unjustified to say  that we had taken no steps for the socioeconomic uplift of the  people.    "We introduced agriculture tax, enacted anti-drug laws, set  up women police station, launched anti-polio and population  planning campaign," she said while adding that the economic  measures taken by the present government would bear fruit before  the next elections.    Replying to another question about the increase in the ghee  prices, she said she had already issued directives to all the  provincial chief secretaries to launch anti-hoarders campaign.  She said the ghee prices were increased because of the slackness  of provincial administrations and not because of the government.    She pointed out that the Ghee Corporation of Pakistan was  marketing ghee at much less prices than private ghee units. She  said the government was hiring a consultancy firm to suggest  measures for checking monopoly of the private sector and  regulate prices.</p>

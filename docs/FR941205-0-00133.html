			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Allow Interchange of Detectors in EPA Methods 505, 507, 508_Commenters favored this proposal. Two commenters noted that data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with alternative detectors must be verified, and were concerned  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about poor ECD response of some nitrogen-containing compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees that data must be verified when changing detectors,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and that the results for all chemicals in Methods 505, 507 or 508  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not meet quality control requirements when an alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detector is used. This is why Section 6.8.3 of Methods 507 and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 508, and Section 10.4 of Methods 505, 507 and 508 allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative detectors only if the initial demonstration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability criteria in Section 10 of each method is met by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative detector.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter wanted to allow use of other detectors with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Method 504. EPA cannot approve this request, because EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no data to justify use of alternative detectors in Methods 504 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 504.1, which use an electron capture detector (ECD). The ECD has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been the only detector capable of routinely measuring EDB and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DBCP at the required parts-per-trillion concentrations (56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3550, January 30, 1991).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guidance on Preserving Samples_A commenter asked that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biocide procedures be dropped from the VOC methods, because EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has dropped mercuric chloride as a biocide in synthetic organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical (SOC) methods. EPA dropped mercuric chloride from SOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods, because EPA has no data to show that biodegradation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulated SOC occurs in a typical drinking water sample, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because mercuric chloride is toxic and a hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, EPA has data to show degradation (EPA, 1994e) in samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected for measurement of VOCs. The biocide procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required in the VOC methods require some combination of chilling,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rapid transit and analysis, or acidification. None of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures pose health or waste disposal problems that compare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the problems associated with preservation using mercuric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chloride. Therefore, EPA continues to require use of a biocide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in VOC methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Liquid-Solid Extraction (LSE) in EPA Methods 507 and 508_Some commenters believed more data were needed before EPA allowed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of LSE in Methods 507 and 508; EPA agrees. EPA stated in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December proposal that ``the Agency regards this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modification as tentative and will base a final decision on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether to approve on public comment and additional EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance data.'' After studying this option and developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional data (EPA, 1994e), EPA has decided not to add LSE as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an option in Methods 507 and 508, because EPA does not have data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to support use of this technique for all of the chemicals in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods. As an alternative, EPA has developed and is approving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 508.1 (EPA, 1994c). Method 508.1 uses the procedures and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the electron capture detector that are used in Method 508, and it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows use of LSE. The scope of Method 508.1 covers many of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 507 and 508 analytes that are subject to regulated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unregulated contaminant monitoring requirements, but it does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include butachlor, PCBs or toxaphene. In today's rule EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approve Method 508.1 for measurement of alachlor, atrazine,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlordane, endrin, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, hexachloro-benzene, hexachlorocyclopentadiene, lindane, methoxychlor, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simazine, which are regulated SOCs. It is also approved for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aldrin, dieldrin, metolachlor, metribuzin, and propachlor, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are unregulated SOCs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Methods for Other Contaminants_In the 1993 proposal EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided guidance to systems that wish to measure chemicals that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not regulated, and need advice on what method to use. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidance stated that ``although EPA approves methods only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency encourages laboratories to use these methods for other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contaminants if the method description specifically includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these contaminants.'' One commenter mistakenly believed that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminates the use of other methods or techniques, such as test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kits. Although EPA encourages laboratories to save money by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using a compliance method to measure all chemicals of interest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are in the analytical scope of the method, this does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preclude systems from using other methods, including test kits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for samples other than compliance monitoring samples.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Nicosia, Jan 31 (CNA)--The president of the House of  Representatives Alexis Galanos disputed Turkey's credentials at  the Council of Europe because of its illegal occupation of  Cyprus' northern part and its attitude towards Turkey's own  people.    Speaking before the plenary session of the parliamentary  assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, Galanos argued  that Turkey did not comply with the Council's principles, nor  did it respect democratic processes, human rights or  international law and order.    In an interview with the Cyprus radio, the House president  warned that this time he did not intend to put Turkey's  membership of the Council to the vote and asked that double  standards policies for existing members and new members be  abolished.    He believed it was high time this matter was dealt with  directly to avert the possibility of allowing the Turkish  Cypriots to upgrade their representation to the Council and  consequently pave the way for recognition of their illegal  administration in Cyprus' Turkish-occupied areas.    Turkish troops invaded and occupied 37 per cent of the  republic's territory. Turkey has refused to comply with U.N.  resolutions calling for the immediate withdrawal of its troops  from the island.    "We are fighting a big battle in the Council of Europe,"  Galanos said and advocated an enlarged Cypriot representation to  carry on the battle for Cyprus.    Meanwhile, the island is playing host to Lord Finsberg,  rapporteur for the Cyprus problem at the Political Committee of  the Council of Europe.    Lord Finsberg, here for contacts to prepare a report on  Cyprus, met Monday [31 January] with President Glavkos  Kliridhis. Later in the day, he had a meeting with U.N.  secretary-general's resident representative to Cyprus Gustave  Feissel.    He told Cyprus radio after the meeting that judging from  what  he had heard at his meetings here, he believed talks on the  Cyprus issue would yield good results.</p>

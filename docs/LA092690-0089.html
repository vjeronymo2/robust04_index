			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN'S KAIFU TO VISIT MIDEAST FOR TALKS;  </P> <P> POLICY: THE NATION IS STILL DEBATING A RESPONSE TO DEMANDS THAT IT SEND FORCES  TO THE GULF.  </P> <P> In an apparent effort to salvage Japan's tarnished image as a global power  after its much-delayed response to the Persian Gulf crisis, Prime Minister  Toshiki Kaifu will visit the Middle East early next month for talks with  leaders of the front-line gulf states, the Foreign Ministry announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> In effect, Kaifu will be resurrecting an itinerary that was canceled -- in  keeping with Japan's traditional low-posture foreign policy -- after Iraq's  Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> After attending the United Nations-sponsored world summit conference on  children in New York, Kaifu will leave Oct. 1 for a seven-day tour of Egypt,  Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Oman, Foreign Ministry officials said.  </P> <P> The announcement came as Japanese bureaucrats and political leaders were locked  in a protracted, mostly closed-door debate over how Japan should answer  international demands that it take part in the peacekeeping effort with  manpower as well as money.  </P> <P> It was not made clear whether an agreement would be reached on a plan of action  before Kaifu leaves Friday for New York.  </P> <P> The Kaifu administration procrastinated for weeks before pledging $4 billion  for the international response to Iraq's aggression -- $2 billion as aid to  gulf states hurt by the economic sanctions against Iraq and $2 billion to help  support the U.S.-led military deployment in the region.  </P> <P> But the government has ruled out sending uniformed military personnel, saying  that the Japanese constitution forbids it to send the so-called Self-Defense  Forces overseas.  </P> <P> Discussion now centers on a proposal to create a "U.N. Peace Cooperation Team"  by drafting a new law that would allow sending a corps of 1,000 or more people  to join U.N.-sponsored peacekeeping efforts in foreign trouble spots. The team  would apparently include some Self-Defense Forces personnel, but it would be  unarmed and non-military in function, according to the consensus in official  thinking, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.  </P> <P> Even if agreement is reached soon, a special session of Parliament would have  to be called to act on it, and support from opposition parties will have to be  solicited because Kaifu's Liberal Democratic Party lacks a majority in the  upper house.  </P> <P> The largest opposition group, the Japan Socialist Party, announced only  recently that it would accept the existence of the Self-Defense Forces within  Japan, but emphasized its opposition to sending them abroad in any capacity.  </P> <P> The centrist Komeito, or Clean Government Party, is the likely swing vote in  the upper house, but it is Buddhist-backed and pacifist.  </P> <P> Ministry spokesman Watanabe acknowledged that, at the earliest, it would be "a  matter of months" before a new law could go into effect and a Japanese  government peacekeeping team could be mobilized, raising serious doubts as to  whether it would play even a symbolic role in the current Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> "Japan has never faced this kind of choice before," Watanabe said, "and for the  Japanese government to reach a decision to create an organization that can cope  with this kind of situation, a matter of months is a very short time. You need  to put yourselves in the shoes of the Japanese people to appreciate how quickly  we are moving along."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a previously announced plan to send 100 non-government medical  volunteers to the gulf is getting off to a slow start. An advance team of 17  has been sent and will report back before further steps are taken.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA CRUZ ISLAND;  </P> <P> 2 MEN RESCUED AFTER RACING BOAT SINKS  </P> <P> Two men were rescued by a helicopter after their racing boat sank seven miles  off Santa Cruz Island, U.S. Coast Guard officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> Neither boat owner Joe McGowan nor his passenger, Rick Harding, both of Santa  Barbara, was seriously injured, Coast Guard Lt. John Dagostino said.  </P> <P> The Coast Guard received a radio call from McGowan and Harding saying the  24-foot-long boat was taking on water shortly after 2 p.m., Dagostino said. By  the time a Coast Guard helicopter arrived about 45 minutes later, the boat --  the Bold Marauder -- was under water, he said.  </P> <P> The men managed to put on wet suits, grab the radio and get into a life raft  before the boat sank, Dagostino said.  </P> <P> One of the men had a cut elbow, Dagostino said.  </P> <P> The boat, described as a customized racing boat, apparently sank in deep water  and appeared to be unsalvageable, Coast Guard officials said. They did not have  an estimate on the loss.  </P> <P> Coast Guard officials were still investigating the incident.  </P></p>

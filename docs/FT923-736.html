			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Letter: Conflicts of 1930s a lesson on need for European integration Sir, Reasonably stable exchange rates are an essential complement to freedom of trade. For otherwise a country can dodge its obligation to keep open its frontiers to goods and services from elsewhere by depreciating the exchange value of its currency. This lesson is evident from the events of the 1930s. The devaluation of the pound sterling to the tune of some 40 per cent in September 1931 was followed within a year by more than 40 countries; in 1933 by the US; and in 1936 by France, Holland and Switzerland. In addition to this competitive depreciation of currencies, countries sought to fend off the consequent penetration of imports by raising tariffs or by imposing import quotas. As a result, the world-wide deflation was aggravated. The European Community, the Single European Act and the Treaty of Maastricht have represented, as far as Europe is concerned, a progressive attempt to avert a relapse into the conflicts of the 1930s. In the widespread recession (depression?) of the 1990s, that attempt has to be resumed. Aubrey Jones, 'Arnen', 120 Limmer Lane, Felpham, Bognor Regis, West Sussex</p>

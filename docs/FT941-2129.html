			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Survey of Management Education &amp; Training (14): Education is a big industry - Overseas Marketing The University of Hull, in Humberside is not shy about advertising its MBA programme. Its MBA in strategic marketing is 'the pinnacle qualification' in its field, according to an ad placed by the university in a Singapore newspaper. 'Over 100 GMs, MDs, CEOs already in the programme.' It is enough to make old fashioned academics retreat for ever into their ivory towers. These days British, Australian, Canadian and US universities market their courses overseas like General Motors sells its cars, or Chanel its perfume. About 12,000 Singapore students are at present involved in some form of higher education overseas - with more than 3,000 of them in Britain. The figures for Malaysia are higher: more than 50,000 Malaysians are at tertiary level institutions overseas. Of those, about 9,000 are in the UK, with another 3,000 at British secondary schools or studying for university entrance. Worldwide, education has become a big industry. It is estimated that students from Singapore and Malaysia contribute about Pounds 200m to the UK balance of payments each year. In both Malaysia and Singapore, the British Council acts as a vital conduit for students planning to study in Britain. Despite the recent fracas over Malaysia's ban on government contracts with British companies, educational links appear unaffected. The student counselling room at Kuala Lumpur's British Council is crowded everyday. 'People here have a great appetite for higher education,' says Mr Gareth Howell, director of the British Council in Kuala Lumpur. 'I can't see any slackening of demand for overseas places between now and the end of the century. While law and medicine continue to be popular, there is increasing demand for engineering and business orientated courses, including accountancy. 'The MBA seems to be the thing these days' says Mr Howell. 'Courses focused on finance and banking are particularly popular.' The Malaysian government has become increasingly anxious about the foreign exchange losses caused by the exodus of its students each year. While the bulk of overseas students are privately funded, it is still estimated that they bring about a loss of more than MDollars 3bn (Pounds 750m) of foreign exchange reserves each year. A decade ago the Malaysian authorities started to allow local private colleges to set up twinning degree courses with overseas institutions. Private colleges are now in virtually every part of the country: many thousands of Malaysian students study for one or two years at such colleges in Malaysia and then do the remainder of their course in Britain or elsewhere. In the case of MBAs alone, 12 British universities and management centres now offer courses in collaboration with Malaysian institutions. Many of Malaysia's big companies send their personnel on such courses. The same applies in Singapore. Twinning not only saves on foreign exchange and makes higher education cheaper for many thousands of students. It also plugs a considerable gap between supply and demand for higher education within Malaysia. Malaysia aims not just to cut down on the number of its students going abroad. Through twinning programmes it eventually hopes to develop its own education services to a level where it can serve as a regional educational centre - instead of sending students overseas, Malaysia hopes to be able to encourage students from Singapore, Thailand and Indonesia to do MBAs and other courses in Malaysia. In time, it is likely that foreign universities will be allowed to set up campuses in Malaysia. The University of London is already involved in discussions about such a scheme. 'The authorities want students to be able to do the whole degree programme here,' says Mr Howell. 'That would mean either foreign universities setting up here or foreign institutions franchising their complete degree courses to local colleges.' But such moves are still some way off. First problems have to be ironed out in the twinning programmes. There are worries that not all courses under such programmes are being properly supervised - both by institutions overseas and by the private colleges in Malaysia. 'Tension between the marketeers of such courses and the guardians of academic standards is probably inevitable,' says Mrs Alexia Bannikoff, a counsellor in education and training at the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur. There are now more Malaysians at tertiary institutions in Australia than any other overseas group. Australia also has 20 twinning programmes in Malaysia. Again, there are no signs that the flow of students is drying up. But there is concern that the first year of such twinning programmes in Malaysia is often treated merely as an extension of school, leaving the student ill-prepared for the less disciplined world of university, with its emphasis on self learning. Wider questions of just how much academic freedom the Malaysian government will be ready to tolerate will doubtless occur - particularly if foreign institutions open local campuses - but such questions are not deterring foreign educational institutions and their marketing people. They are continuing to beat a path to Malaysia and elsewhere in fast-developing, education-hungry, south-east Asia.</p>

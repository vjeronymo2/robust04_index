			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Saddam holds talks with Kurdish leader PRESIDENT Saddam Hussein of Iraq yesterday met Mr Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish Democratic Party and a longstanding enemy, as negotiations continued over nationwide political reforms and autonomy for Iraqi Kurdistan. Mr Saddam had talks two weeks ago with Mr Jalal Talabani, who heads the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, the other main guerrilla group in the Iraqi Kurdistan Front. Mr Talabani spoke then of an agreement in principle on Kurdish autonomy, but many Kurds doubt that the Iraqi government will meet their demands for international guarantees to uphold an accord. Nor has Iraq expressed a willingness to allow the oil town of Kirkuk to be included in the Kurdish region. The official Iraqi news agency said only of yesterday's meeting that Mr Barzani had led a four-man delegation of Kurds. Kurdish leaders are anxious to reverse the exodus of Kurds from northern Iraq which followed a failed uprising in March, while Mr Saddam apparently wants to bring peace to the north so that he can tighten his grip on Iraq as a whole. The allied forces - whose victory over Iraq in the Gulf war prompted the Iraqi uprisings - have set up 'safe havens' for the Kurds in northern Iraq. Yesterday an allied military spokesman said Iraqi anti-aircraft gunners fired twice at US navy aircraft scouting the area on Tuesday, without hitting the target. Baghdad denied its gunners had opened fire. Meanwhile, the last US troops pulled out of southern Iraq. Units of the 3rd Armoured Division rumbled across the desert and into Kuwait, while UN peacekeeping forces in white four-wheel-drive vehicles patrolled the Iraqi border town of Safwan and the surrounding area.</p>

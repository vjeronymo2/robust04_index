			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rescue plan may fall foul of EC rules - Andrew Hill and David Lascelles report on a dilemma over state aid for the mines MR Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, may have to accept tough deadlines imposed by the European Commission for phasing out any subsidies he includes in his rescue plan for the coal industry. Officials are studying how a UK coal subsidy might fit in with EC policies limiting state aid following Mr Heseltine's visit to Brussels last week. The difficulty is that the EC's position is not clear, with the commission's energy and competition directorates on conflicting courses over how to sort out the community's heavily subsidised energy market. The meetings which Mr Heseltine held with Mr Abel Matutes, the new energy commissioner, and Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition commissioner, were a prelude to high-level political negotiations on coal subsidies which will begin after he tables his rescue plans next month. Such negotiations could provide a fascinating spectacle. For the last four years Sir Leon Brittan, the determinedly anti-subsidy commissioner who preceded Mr Van Miert, has sparred with socialist-governed member states such as France over the sensitive issue of state aid. It will be interesting to see how a determinedly anti-subsidy government fares against a socialist commissioner in the same debate. Under new draft rules for state subsidies - which will come into force from next year if the member states approve them - inefficient coal mines would have to bring their production costs in line with the community average, or lose their right to aid. Energy officials believe that, under these rules, Mr Heseltine should be able to subsidise UK mines, which are the most efficient in the EC. It is the high-cost, heavily subsidised pits in Germany and Spain which would have to work hard to improve efficiency. But Mr Heseltine's plan to support the coal industry might fall foul of guidelines observed by the commission's competition authorities. Under these non-binding criteria, introduced at the time of the privatisation of the UK electricity industry in 1990, Brussels allows member states to protect up to 20 per cent of their indigenous energy sources through subsidies or supply contracts signed with electricity generators. The aim is to underpin security of supply, but without distorting the growing market for cross-border sales of electricity. It is a unique part of the commission's policy on state aid in that the size of subsidy member states can grant to these protected industries is unrestricted. But the policy hamstrings Mr Heseltine because the UK is already up against the 20 per cent limit. The main recipient, according to the Department of Trade and Industry, is state-owned Nuclear Electric which accounts for 13 per cent of electricity generated, followed by Scottish Nuclear (4 per cent), the Longannet coal mine in Scotland (3 per cent) and a fractional amount for renewable forms of power such as wind and solar power. If the commission enforced the guidelines strictly in the British case, it might be put in the strange position of hastening the demise of the most efficient pits in the community, ostensibly in the interests of protecting community energy sources. When UK and commission officials meet in the next fortnight to discuss the options, they will look for ways of skirting round this dilemma. The commission, for example, may drop its insistence that renewable energy sources should be counted as part of Britain's allowance. If the commission then permits a consumer levy on electricity bills to support the coal industry, the size of Britain's energy subsidies will increase to nearly 30 per cent of the market. In return, partly to save the 20 per cent aid principle, the commission would expect Mr Heseltine to reduce the scope of aid to the nuclear industry, and to set strict time-limits on coal subsidies - perhaps abolishing them as early as the end of 1995. But he would find it hard to agree to these demands. There is little room to cut aid to the nuclear power industry because of the need to build up provisions to finance the decommissioning of old nuclear power stations. The 1995 deadline would impose a much tighter time limit than Mr Heseltine is believed to have in mind. Only a small number of additional mines would be able to achieve commercial viability in that short time. More time might also be needed to get British Coal into a condition where it could be privatised, which is still Mr Heseltine's aim. Suppliers' link, Page 21</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts: Our heritage is in his hands - The role of Lord Rothschild and the lottery Like it or not, and on the whole they do, Lord Rothschild, chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, and Georgina Nayler, its director, seem destined to become the patrons of our age. From next January, throughout the land, small, and not so small, improvements in the cultural and physical shape of the nation will become apparent - and Lord Rothschild will be approving and Ms Nayler will be signing the cheques. In this village the war memorial, or the duck pond, might be restored and enhanced; in that small town the derelict Methodist chapel might be converted into an arts centre; in our big cities the municipal art gallery might be showing off paintings that were in danger of disappearing abroad. A cathedral might have its bells restored; a country house secure a visitor centre; a decaying mansion be brought back to life. The British heritage, so long under threat from foreign predators and domestic neglect, is in line for revival. Lord Rothschild and Ms Nayler will be the conduit for change but the motivating force is, of course, the National Lottery. A fifth of its proceeds destined for good causes, an estimated Pounds 150m in the first year rising, hopefully, to Pounds 320m. When the government was looking for institutions to handle the windfalls from the lottery some seemed obvious - the Arts Council was in place to distribute the money going to regenerate arts buildings; ditto the Sports Council. The heritage honeypot became the responsibility of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, a tiny quango, set up in 1980 by the government in response to public outrage over the sale of one of the nation's most historic stately homes, Mentmore Towers. The task of the fund was to try, with a limited government grant, to prevent any more such scandals. Undoubtedly the presence, since 1992, of Lord Rothschild as chairman, has given the fund bottom. He spent his early career making money and shoring up the heritage and then managed to combine the two. He restored one of the great aristocratic mansions of London, Spencer House, and lets it out for business and social functions. More recently he gave a facelift to a former family home now in the hands of the National Trust, Waddesdon Manor in Buckinghamshire. Lord Rothschild and Ms Nayler have been presented with a monster that could well consume their tiny organisation. The government has been fairly good (to date) about the lottery, regarding it as additional money and, in theory, pledging to maintain current funding on the arts, heritage and sports. Yet it could not resist cutting its annual grant to the Heritage Memorial Fund by Pounds 3m, to Pounds 8.6m, for the next three years. Lord Rothschild has tried to create a new role for the organisation, concentrating its grants on obvious memorial projects, on saving for the nation Nelson's letters, Victorian paintings of Florence Nightingale tending the wounded, and putting money aside for the yet unresolved matter of the Churchill archive. But in three years there is a real danger that the government will allow the traditional grant to wither away. But this is the least of Lord Rothschild's problems. His main task is to define the heritage and to ensure that the new money is spread impartially around the country. Every region will have its lottery punters and must receive its benefits. Treasured stretches of countryside must be saved as well as paintings and museums. The sums involved will range from the Pounds 2,000 needed to preserve a village common, up to the Pounds 200m which might be required to ensure that the Duke of Sutherland's unrivalled collection of Poussins, Raphaels, and Titians, remain on loan to the National Gallery of Scotland after his death. About 10,000 requests are anticipated annually and already Lord Rothschild can be seen as the soft cop, prepared to help where he can, while Ms Nayler is the tough cop, worried about establishing precedents and allocating money before it has been handed over. Already, Lord Rothschild has won two major victories in the run up to the launch. He has persuaded the government to broaden its original criteria and accept that paintings, and other works of art, were objects worth saving with lottery money. Bad timing, with an early August deadline, makes it virtually inevitable that Canova's neo-classical sculpture of the Three Graces will leave the UK for the Getty Museum in California. But if a comparable work appeared on the market in a year's time the odds are it would be saved. Ms Nayler might draw in her breath, but Lord Rothschild boldly hopes that: 'the Three Graces should be the last great treasure to go. In future there will be an acknowledgement that we exist to save things'. Lord Rothschild's second success was in persuading the former national heritage minister, Peter Brooke, to allow the fund to give money towards endowment funds for worthy projects. There was little point in contributing towards a new gallery in a museum if there was no money to pay the additional keepers and to preserve the objects. To a great extent the work of the fund will be defined by the nature of its supplicants. This week the Memorial Heritage Lottery Fund embarks on a proselytising mission around the country, explaining what it can offer. It will also learn more about the needs it will be expected to address. The hope is that it will grow into its job. The payroll has already risen from six to 15. It should level out at 27, a modest task force for the allocation of Pounds 150m. But Lord Rothschild, with his own merchant bank, is used to handling vast sums of money. As a former chairman of the National Gallery he also knows his heritage. This very British institution might just have the character and breeding to convert the casual wagers of the public into enduring national treasures.</p>

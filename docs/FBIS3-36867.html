			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs announced today that  the Cabinet of Ministers has agreed to allow Russia to keep the  Skrunda radar station at its disposal for a period, because  Latvia's previous obstinacy on the issue of the full withdrawal  of the Russian troops seems to be gradually losing Western  support. This decision by the Latvian Government was motivated,  Birkavs said, by the claim that in the event that Latvia  continues to decline to compromise on the issue of the  withdrawal of the Russian troops, it could lose the support of  European countries and the United States.    According to the (?previously) reached agreement, Russia  will  maintain the Skrunda radar station for four years as its  property, and after the end of this period, dismantling of the  site will be carried out over 18 months.</p>

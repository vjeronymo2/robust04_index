			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'thirtysomething' Gets Calls: David Marshall Grant and Peter Frechette slipped  between the sheets on Tuesday night's episode of ABC's "thirtysomething," and  Wednesday morning the ABC switchboard was busy answering the phones as a  result. By midmorning, one operator (of three taking calls) had logged 25  calls, 23 of which were offended by the post-bed scene between the two men.  "thirtysomething's" Emmy-winning executive producer Marshall Herskovitz's own  response Wednesday: "We didn't do it for fun. It was a natural following-out of  themes we had established. I don't know if the relationship between the  characters will continue; that hasn't been decided. But we're not waiting for  public response to influence our decision. We've never worked that way, and  we're not going to start now." Incidentally, this was not the first time the  two actors had played a homosexual couple. Two years ago, Grant and Frechette  co-starred as gays interned in Dachau in the acclaimed drama "Bent" at the  Coast Playhouse -- for which Frechette won a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle  Award.

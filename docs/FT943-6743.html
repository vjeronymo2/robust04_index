			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Call to ease Taiwan curb on foreign investment in shares Taiwan's top securities regulator yesterday called for the easing of controls on foreign investment in domestic shares, in remarks exposing sharp divisions within the government over the pace and scope of financial reform. 'Compared with other countries, we have too many restrictions on foreign investment,' Mr Day Linin, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, told a conference on the stock market. Foreign investors are keen to gain entry to Taiwan's share market, seen as undervalued relative to other Asian markets. At the same time, the ruling Nationalist party aims to transform Taiwan into a regional hub for business and finance. But 'how can Taiwan become a financial centre under the current restrictions?' Mr Day asked. Total market capitalisation of the local bourse was USDollars 209bn (Pounds 134bn) at the end of July. But Taiwan has set an overall ceiling of Dollars 7.5bn on funds remitted into the country by approved financial institutions for direct investment in shares. The Taiwan stock market was opened to direct foreign investment in 1991. Each approved foreign institution may remit up to Dollars 200m, but combined foreign holdings in a single stock may not exceed 10 per cent of outstanding shares and any one foreign investor may not buy more than 5 per cent of a listed company's outstanding shares. Individual foreigners are banned from investing in local shares. At the end of July, about 100 foreign institutions had applied to invest a cumulative total of more than Dollars 12bn in Taiwan's stock market. About 60 institutions had been approved to invest Dollars 6bn, of which Dollars 4.5bn had been invested in shares. Expansion of foreign participation would strengthen the local market's structure, increase its size and depth, and make it less vulnerable to manipulation, said Mr Day. His remarks highlight a longstanding battle between the Finance Ministry, under which the SEC resides, and the Central Bank of China. The central bank wields near-absolute power over foreign investment in the bourse through stringent foreign exchange controls and vets each foreign investor. It had been hoped that the accession of a new central bank governor, Mr Liang Kuo-shu, on June 1 would defuse tensions between the feuding agencies. In late July, the SEC called for the ceiling on foreign investment to be raised to 10 per cent of total market capitalisation. Mr Liang demurred, saying that three conditions had to be met before foreigners' market access would be increased. Total market turnover and capitalisation had to rise significantly; the government's limping privatisation programme had to be speeded up to mitigate the weighting of foreign investment in the market; and annual growth in money supply had to be kept below 15 per cent. He also said the impact of capital movement on the local currency's exchange rate must be minimal. Money supply and inflation have exceeded targets in recent months, making it unlikely that controls on foreign investment will be lifted soon. But brokers do expect a gradual easing of restrictions under the government's long-term financial liberalisation policy.</p>

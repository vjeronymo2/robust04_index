			<p><P> December 22, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KELLY JOHNSON, DESIGN PIONEER OF LOCKHEED AIRCRAFT, DIES  </P> <P> Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson, creator of Lockheed's secret "Skunk Works"  research and development division and legendary designer of aircraft, died  Friday. He was 80.  </P> <P> The planes he designed ranged from the World War II P-38 Lightning to the U-2  and triplesonic SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance aircraft.  </P> <P> Lockheed announced that Johnson died at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank  after a long illness that the company did not describe.  </P> <P> Tony LeVier, Lockheed's former chief test pilot who flew many of Johnson's  planes, said Friday that Johnson's state-of-the-art aircraft "kept us out of  World War III."  </P> <P> LeVier said Johnson's planes "flew like a dream." The test pilot described the  engineer as a stern father figure with great influence in the Pentagon.  </P> <P> Johnson was a renowned aircraft engineer from the outset of his career at  Lockheed in 1933. Within four years, when he was only 27, he won the Lawrence  Sperry Award for outstanding aeronautics achievement for developing the world's  fastest commercial air transport. Johnson had personally piloted the craft,  which flew 250 m.p.h., in some of its test flights.  </P> <P> Johnson founded the "Skunk Works" in 1943 to build the XP-80 Shooting Star, the  United States' first production jet fighter, for World War II.  </P> <P> Housed in circus tents next to a plastics factory in Burbank, the secret  facility smelled so bad that engineers dubbed it the "Skunk Works" after the  foul-smelling moonshine distillery in Al Capp's comic strip "Lil' Abner."  </P> <P> Johnson, who contributed significantly to the design of more than 40 planes,  was the key designer of the Constellation or "Connie" transport planes, the  Hercules cargo planes, the P-2V anti-submarine patrol aircraft, and the Agena  spacecraft.  </P> <P> His indelible mark was also stamped on the F-104 Starfighter, the first  production aircraft to fly at twice the speed of sound; the U-2, a favorite  target of the Soviets in the 1950s and the first plane able to make a sustained  flight above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird, the world's  fastest and highest-flying planes.  </P> <P> With the assignment to develop the U-2 under a joint CIA-Air Force request for  a high-altitude strategic reconnaissance and special-purpose research aircraft  in 1954, the "Skunk Works" became an autonomous unit of Lockheed, complete with  its own manufacturing facilities. The complex was formally named Advanced  Development Projects.  </P> <P> Considered something of a heresy in the aerospace industry because its tiny  staff and informal operation could sidestep red tape and bureaucratic reports  associated with government work, the "Skunk Works" became the natural place for  military leaders to go when they needed something invented and produced  quickly.  </P> <P> The unit took only eight months to build the first U-2, code-named "Aquatone."  It was a U-2 in which Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union  in 1960 and another U-2 that provided photographic proof in 1962 that the  Soviets were installing missiles in Cuba.  </P> <P> Johnson's triplesonic Blackbirds were only recently retired by the Air Force.  The planes could fly faster than 2,000 m.p.h. and higher than 85,000 feet. Even  on the way to museum display last March, the last Blackbird shattered at least  three airspeed standards crossing the continent.  </P> <P> Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson learned about tools from  his Swedish immigrant father, who was a carpenter and bricklayer.  </P> <P> Young Johnson, certain by the age of 12 that he wanted to build planes, studied  aeronautical engineering at the University of Michigan. He worked on the  aerodynamic design of cars slated to run in the Indianapolis 500 while studying  for his master's degree.  </P> <P> Lockheed's chief aircraft designer for more than three decades, Johnson was  named vice president for research and development in 1956. The same year, he  was named Aviation Man of the Year by aviation writers for his development of  the F-104 supersonic jet fighter.  </P> <P> Always close-mouthed about his secret research projects, Johnson was known for  following his own advice: "You can't put your foot in your mouth if you keep  your mouth shut."  </P> <P> In 1960, after the Soviet Union had shot down a number of his U-2 spy planes,  Johnson characteristically refused in a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars  to discuss the plane's reconnaissance role.  </P> <P> "Over the years, during the development of the program, it was essential that  we learn how to keep our mouths closed," he told the veterans, "and I would  like to say it would be a splendid idea if we could carry out this tactic in a  large number of other defense fields."  </P> <P> Over the years Johnson collected laurels as fast as his planes collected speed  and altitude records. Along with the prestigious Collier trophy and the  Theodore Von Karman award, Johnson won the Thomas D. White National Defense  Award for "outstanding contribution to the national defense and security of the  United States"; the National Medal of Science, presented by President Lyndon B.  Johnson for the revolutionary U-2; the Sylvanus Albert Reed Award twice from  the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics for "the most notable  contribution to aircraft design"; the Kitty Hawk Memorial Award for several  airplane designs, and the National Security Medal, presented by President  Ronald Reagan in 1983 for his "original ideas in aerodynamics and aircraft  design."  </P> <P> In 1974, Johnson was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame at Dayton, Ohio.  </P> <P> "Kelly Johnson and the products of his famous 'Skunk Works' epitomize the  highest and finest goal of our society, the goal of excellence," noted  President Johnson in presenting him the Medal of Science.  </P> <P> "His record of design achievement in aviation is both incomparable and  virtually incredible," the President said. "Any one of his many airplane  designs would have honored any individual's career."  </P> <P> Johnson retired from Lockheed in 1975 with the title of senior vice president,  and left the company's board of directors in 1980. In 1987, Lockheed donated  $350,000 to Caltech to establish the Clarence L. Johnson Professorship in  Aeronautics.  </P> <P> Johnson is survived by his wife, Nancy, a brother and a sister.  </P> <P> Services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Thursday in the forecourt of the Hall of  Liberty at Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills. Visitation will be at noon that day in  the Old North Church, Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills.  </P> <P> The family has asked that any memorial contributions be made to St. Joseph  Medical Center Foundation for Taro Yokoyama's Heart Program, 501 S. Buena Vista  St., Burbank 91505.  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei discounts Hosokawa resignation Share prices initially fell sharply on news that Prime Minister Morhiro Hosokawa had indicated that he would resign, but later regained ground on short covering and bargain hunting to close marginally higher, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index ended 44.01 higher at 19,934.99, a week's rise of 3.4 per cent. The index fell to a low of 19,520.90 in the early afternoon following press reports that Mr Hosokawa would announce his resignation, but later rebounded. Mr Hosokawa said that the direct cause for his resignation was not his Y100m loan from Sagawa Kyubin, a trucking company, or the purchase of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares by his father-in-law, but possible illegal investments made by his office staff. Traders said that political instability had already been discounted into stock prices, and rumours that Mr Hosokawa could resign had been circulating over the past week. If the ruling coalition manages to form a new government within a short time the effect on the economy and financial markets will be small. However, markets could be hurt if the process of choosing a new prime minister drags on, said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Volume was 530m shares against 282m. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 0.11 to 1,613.30 and the Nikkei 300 rose 2.55 to 296.41. Losers led winners by 667 to 385, with 111 issues remaining unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 3.41 to 1,325.55. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for investor confidence, rose Y4,000 to Y904,000. However, stocks which had drawn buying by individual investors recently, lost ground on profit-taking. Sumitomo Coal Mining fell Y18 to Y966. In Osaka, the OSE average lost ell 11.32 to 21,965.18 in volume of 17.9m shares. Aoyama Trading, the men's suits maker, fell Y270 to Y4,860. Roundup With the region's decline during the first quarter many investors have become worried that the current correction has a lot further to go. According to the IFC, the Asian regional index has fallen back some 20 per cent in dollar terms over the three months, compared with a slight rise in the Latin American region. Morgan Stanley, in a note issued at the end of March, said that it remained overweight in Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong, 'but we consider that the correction is not over in that region'. Regarding Hong Kong, Mr David Roche of Morgan Stanley, wrote that a 5 per cent weighting against a benchmark of just 0.5 per cent 'is based on the long-term restructuring story of China, which we believe is still intact.' Short-term risks remain, he added, that could well lead the Hang Seng below the 7,000 level, including failure to renew China's MFN status and further US interest rate rises. 'If none of these risks materialise, then the index could jump up well above 11,000 ..If some of these materialise, as seems likely, then the index could move towards 7,000.' HONG KONG edged higher in quiet conditions, and the prospect of political uncertainties in Tokyo after Mr Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation raised the prospect that the colony could be a beneficiary if investors turn their attention away from Japan to other regional markets. The Hang Seng index closed up 12.30 at 9,298.22, a 3 per cent advance over the week. Turnover fell to a meagre HKDollars 2.46bn from HKDollars 2.9bn on Thursday, with many fund managers on holiday. SEOUL was higher for the fourth consecutive session in a day of thin trading after blue chips staged a technical rebound. The composite index rose 9.17 to 872.53, for a 0.6 per cent rise on the week. Speculation that the government would soon lift an 8 per cent ceiling on foreign holdings in Posco, the steelmaker, and Kepco, the electricity-monopoly, boosted blue chips, although the government dismissed the rumours as groundless. Both Posco and Kepco, - heavily weighted in the index - went limit up, gaining Won2,000 and Won1,000 to close at Won52,300 and Won25,200. TAIWAN closed higher on a strong rebound in the financial sector. The weighted index added 52.79 to 5,528.47, off an intra-session high of 5,553, and up 4 per cent across the week. Turnover was TDollars 50.5bn. Late institutional buying in Acer, limit up at TDollars 61.50, boosted overall sentiment. AUSTRALIA fell back late in the day on the news from Japan. The All Ordinaries index shed 5.4 to 2,082.0, down from an early morning high of 2,096.2. SINGAPORE was firmer, helped by some light foreign demand, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 13.71 higher at 2,120.24, for a 2 per cent rise over the week. KUALA LUMPUR gave up early gains to close little changed as some nervous investors liquidated positions in early afternoon trade. The composite index finished 4.23 lower at 961.95, having seen a day's high of 970.25, and 1.9 per cent higher on the week. BOMBAY was higher on a revival of buying by Indian financial institutions and mutual funds which took the BSE 30-share index up 42.72 to 3,878.55. NEW ZEALAND ended the week on a high note, with the NZSE-40 capital index up 14.79 at 2,131.67, a week's gain of 2.2 per cent.</p>

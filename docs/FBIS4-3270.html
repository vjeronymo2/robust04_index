			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 19 (XINHUA) -- China said  today that international arms transfers should help ensure  self-defense and not undermine peace and security.    Arms transfers should neither be used as pretext for  interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states,  affirmed Chinese Ambassador Hou Zhitong when addressing the UN  Disarmament Commission.    The key to solving the problem of unrestricted arms  transfers  lay in the political will of a few countries which have the most  advanced defense industries and most arms exports, he noted.    The international community should call on certain countries  to stop their exports of large quantities of arms to other  states for ulterior motives, stressed Hou.    He called on the world community to take immediate steps  forcefully against the illicit arms transfers.    Meanwhile, the Chinese ambassador also clarified his  country's positions on some other issues concerning disarmament.    China supported efforts to conclude negotiations on the  Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty by 1996, he said. The  negotiations began earlier this year at the conference on  disarmament in Geneva.    Hou reiterated that his country had undertaken not to  threaten the use of, or to use, nuclear arms against  non-nuclear-weapon state and it had also called on other  nuclear-weapon states to do the same.    Hou expressed China's support to many developing countries  in  their demand that non-proliferation should not hinder  international technological cooperation, much less be used as an  excuse for blocking their acquisition and development of science  and technology.</p>

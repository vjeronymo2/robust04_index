			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;237.4 would require the owner or operator of a waste source or receiving facility to: (1) Meet standards related to loading and offloading municipal or commercial waste to assure that any deposit of waste in coastal waters is minimized; (2) provide methods and procedures to promptly clean up waste deposited in coastal waters; (3) have fixed lighting; (4) develop, adopt, and submit, as appropriate, an Operation and Maintenance manual; and (5) maintain records of waste deposited in coastal waters. EPA considered other alternatives to the regulations proposed today, such as identifying specific methods and tools for clean up required by the regulations instead of generic waste handling practice standards. Rather than require the use of specific methods or tools, EPA believes that the generic waste handling practices contained in the proposed regulations, if promulgated in final form, will be sufficient to eliminate the waste problems resulting from inadequate municipal and commercial waste handling activities in coastal waters while preserving necessary flexibility on how to best achieve that result.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Among the proposed waste handling practices for waste sources and receiving facilities are requirements for containment or diversionary structures. EPA believes this equipment,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , booms, dip nets, and oily water separating equipment, is necessary to control or contain the waste that is deposited in coastal waters. In addition, EPA proposes that waste sources and receiving facilities must have fixed lighting when conducting loading and offloading operations between sunset and sunrise. Such lighting is necessary to provide waste handling personnel with the visual ability to control and contain waste transfers with a minimum of improper disposal into coastal waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also contains requirements for owner or operators of waste sources and receiving facilities to clean up all municipal or commercial waste that may have been deposited into coastal waters during loading or offloading. EPA is proposing that such clean up must occur before the first high tide after the disposal occurs. EPA believes that requiring this time frame for the clean up is appropriate because otherwise the waste would disperse at high tide beyond the waste source or receiving facilities' ability to contain or control the waste. Among the cleanup methods set forth in the proposed rule are sweeper boats, manned boats with nets, booms or other equipment, and/or shoreline cleanup personnel. The proposed rule would require that cleanup resources be in continuous operation or on standby for loading and offloading operations which take place during an ebb tide. EPA believes that this requirement will ensure that waste that is deposited into coastal waters is contained or controlled before it has the chance to disperse with an ebb tide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal also would require waste sources and receiving facilities to have a placard located at the facility which is readily visible to persons involved in waste handling practices. Such placard would need to display the name and telephone number of the individual responsible for notifying the USCG National Response Center (NRC) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;424&hyph;8802 in the event of a deposit of waste into coastal waters that is not cleaned up.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPA section 4103(b)(2) provides that the Administrator may require responsible parties to submit Operation and Maintenance manuals, as appropriate. EPA proposes to require that  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> all <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  waste sources and receiving facilities covered under SPA (with the exceptions noted in &sect;237.2), develop and adopt these manuals and that each of the waste sources and receiving facilities submit to the EPA a letter certifying that the manual was developed in accordance with the guidelines provided. The Operation and Maintenance manual shall then be submitted to the Administrator only upon request, and, if requested, within two weeks of the request by the Administrator for the manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternatives, such as requiring the submission of operation and maintenance manuals by a subset of the regulated community, or ``as appropriate,'' depending on the circumstances, would be difficult to implement and more likely an obstacle to meeting the intent of SPA. The development of operation and maintenance manuals by all of the regulated community will ensure that owners and operators are aware of waste handling procedures, including who shall be responsible for the cleanup of waste deposits, notification and reporting requirements, and equipment needed to contain and or clean up a waste deposit. Submission of manuals upon request will help assure that there is a minimum standard of waste handling practices for the regulated community. To facilitate implementation of this requirement, EPA is proposing as an appendix to this regulation information on developing an operation and maintenance manual. The proposal leaves the content of the manual flexible_each responsible party will develop its own procedures and document these procedures in the manual, following the general guidance in the appendix. EPA encourages those that have already developed operation and maintenance manuals consistent with the guidelines prescribed in Appendix A to use these manuals. Those that have not yet developed a relevant operation and maintenance manual are encouraged to use the guidelines provided in Appendix A to develop a manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, the Administrator or the Secretary may review these manuals and either accept the manual or reject the manual with comment if the manual fails to provide the necessary information prescribed in the regulations. Operations may continue during this review process. Failure to develop an operation and maintenance manual, or to follow the procedures adopted in the facility's manual, would be a violation of these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Operation and Maintenance manual must include procedures for notifying the USCG in the event of a deposit of regulated waste into coastal waters that is beyond the capacity of the owner or operator to clean up. In addition, it must identify an individual responsible for such notification. This individual must be designated by the owner or operator of the waste source or receiving facility. The identification of this person and his or her responsibilities shall provide a process for reporting and requesting assistance in the case of a deposit beyond the capacity of the waste source, vessel or receiving facility to contain and clean up after implementing clean up procedures outlined in the operation and maintenance manual. The responsible individual must be a supervisory employee responsible for waste handling activities or an officer of the company owning or operating the waste source, vessel or receiving facility, who is responsible for some aspect of waste handling activities (e.g. vice president in charge of operations). Therefore, the responsible individual can be an owner or operator of the company. When a municipal or commercial waste deposit is beyond the capacity of the regulated entity to clean up after implementing the clean up procedures outlined in the Operation and Maintenance manual, the responsible individual is accountable for notifying the USCG NRC in the case of a deposit of waste into coastal waters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations would require that the Operation and Maintenance manual be accessible to all employees involved in waste handling activities. In addition to the notification requirements, any person witnessing a deposit of municipal or commercial waste into coastal waters is encouraged to contact the USCG NRC when it is suspected that there is a violation of these regulations. Owners and operators are encouraged to put this USCG NRC number on the placard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

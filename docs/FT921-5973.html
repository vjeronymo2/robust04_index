			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / The good life? It is a nightmare: A strange meeting with the Beautiful People I HAVE a recurring dream, perhaps a nightmare. I am a character in a property magazine. The dreams started when we moved into an area deemed by these magazines as suitable for dumping their glossy product. For some reason I could not resist them. First, I read the soft core property magazines, but now I read hard core, like Boardroom and London Portrait. And then the dreams began. Sometimes they are in black and white, sometimes in colour. In the colour dreams everyone seems much more affluent and people never talk about the actual price of property. They come up to me and say 'Price on application, dear boy,' or, as we drink cocktails by the azure indoor swimming pool, the man next to me says: 'Ah, hello. Offers invited, offers invited.' There are so many cocktail parties in these dreams that even in the black and white ones, everyone seems happy and optimistic. There is a deafening hubbub so that the same phrases always seem to catch my mind's ear, 'so much pent up demand', 'prices have reached bottom', 'recovery in the spring'. The nightmarish aspect is that I too seem to be unable to say anything which is not effusive. All my critical faculties and judgment have been taken away from me. I want to tell the truth, what I really feel, but I am capable only of adjectival incontinence: 'stunning]' I exclaim. 'Stylish]' 'immaculate]' 'substantial]' 'delightful]' There are some pleasant aspects to the dream. The restaurants are always free, and the meals invariably delicious. There are health clubs on every street corner, full of firm young bodies topped by faces which always look thrilled to see me. Outside one of these health clubs I am offered a shining new car. In the dream the cars are always shiny and new, unless they are fabulously old and valuable. Once I saw someone getting into a car that I particularly admired. I asked the man behind the wheel how much the car was worth. 'Buy my outstanding seven bedroom, detached family house in the most prestigious road in this up and coming area, and the car is yours', the man shouted, waving the keys. One of the most peculiar aspects of the dream is that although it is set in an intensely urban environment, everyone I meet says they live in a 'village'. I meet people from Hampstead village, Kensington village, Notting Hill village, even Brixton village. Sometimes I try to visit these people in their villages, but they do not seem to exist in any map, or on any road signs. But then I remember that I am in a dream and that anything is possible, even Brixton village. Towards the end of the dream I am accosted by all manner of strange and sometimes unsavoury people, offering services which I never knew existed. Most of them press on me cards with Harley Street addresses. A man comes up to me claiming that he has made 'great advances in human sexuality particularly' - and here he winks knowingly - 'the management of male virility problems. Call me,' he murmurs. 'All treatment in strictest confidence.' I smile and move on. Only to be pinned to the wall by a woman of uncertain age. 'Lymphoedema,' she says, by way of introduction. 'Dominic,' I reply. 'No, cheeky,' she simpers, 'I am talking manual lymph drainage and compression bandaging. Plus Frigi-seaweed, volcanic and marine mud treatment. Call me.' I light a cigarette. Another woman appears. 'Stop smoking in one hour]' she insists. 'Depression?' she goes on, 'addiction? phobias? call me on this number.' I begin to run but yet another strange saleswomen grabs me by the arm. 'Stress?' she yells, 'you need holistic health care, deep relaxation therapy, and natural healing'. 'No I don't,' I yell back. 'I need to wake up.' Then I do wake up and find that I have fallen asleep over the classifieds in London Portrait. I look up to see the familiar damp patch on the bedroom ceiling, the cracked pane in the window. Through the wall I hear the neighbours arguing. I turn to my left: 'Shall we invite offers for this immaculate and peaceful semi-detached residence?' Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.</p>

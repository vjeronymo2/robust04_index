			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Dollars 100m Maltese debut in syndicated loan markets MALTA is making its first appearance in the international syndicated loan markets. Enemalta Corporation, the 100 per cent state-owned monopoly which manages the islands' energy requirements, is raising Dollars 100m over seven years to complete its new Marsaxlokk power station. Chemical Bank is co-ordinating a group of banks underwriting the loan, which is guaranteed by the republic. The other underwriters are ABN Amro, Societe Generale, Sumitomo Bank and WestLB. The margin over Libor is 52.5 basis points and front-end fees range down from 30 basis points for lead managers at Dollars 10m. Bankers note that, while the basic yield is not over-generous at around 60 basis points, tax receipts available to lenders against corporation tax liabilities could double or treble the return. The syndicate is expected to have a heavy European flavour, with a large German contingent. Maltese borrowings are 100 per cent-weighted for capital adequacy purposes, as it is outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Malta's net foreign assets are around Dollars 1.5bn while its official external debt is about Dollars 150m, excluding lease finance for flag carrier Air Malta.</p>

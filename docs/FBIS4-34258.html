			<p>BFN     [Text] San Jose, 16 Jun (AFP) -- Central America "went  united and returned even more united" from the Ibero-American  summit held this week in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, where  the area's proposals received a major boost, Costa Rican  President Jose Figueres stated upon his return from the  hemispheric meeting.    Figueres arrived at noon aboard an airplane provided by  Colombian President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo in the company of  Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, Honduran President  Carlos Roberto Reina, Guatemalan President Ramiro De Leon  Carpio, and Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, who continued  their journeys to their respective countries this afternoon.    Figueres said during a news conference that one of the  topics  discussed in Colombia was the possibility of negotiating jointly  a free trade agreement in the near future, taking private  sectors "very much into consideration." Central Americans want  Colombia and Venezuela to grant them an asymmetrical preference  treatment in terms of value added and place of origin rules, as  well as in terms of the time it would take for the agreements to  enter into force.    On another topic of interest to the region, namely its  electricity power grid, Figueres said Spain is willing to  finance the first $100 million the project costs, with the  Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) financing the remaining  $350 million. Spain will also contribute $320 million to the  financing the IDB will grant for other projects in those  countries.    According to Figueres, Spanish Prime Minister Felipe  Gonzalez  pledged to decide on the Central American request to Spain to  provide capitalization funds to the Central American Bank of  Economic Integration (BCIE). For this purpose, Gaviria offered  approximately $70 million, Argentine President Carlos Menem, 60  million [currency not specified], and Venezuelan President  Rafael Caldera talked of the possibility that his country will  contribute 122.5 million [currency not specified], an amount  similar to that which Mexico had provided to the BCIE.    Figueres said he felt "very satisfied" with the results of  the Ibero-American summit and the accompanying bilateral and  multilateral meetings, where, he said, the participants  discussed the topics of democracy, independence of the Judicial  Branch, strengthening electoral courts, commercial exchange,  human rights, the war on poverty, and the need to boost social  investments, among many others.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Escada to sell a subsidiary ESCADA, the German fashion house favoured by Norma Major, Virginia Bottomley and Cilla Black, is struggling to stave off mounting financial difficulties. Yesterday, it announced that it will sell one of its subsidiaries to prop up its balance sheet. It also reported an operating loss for the 12 months to the end of October 1992, and the erosion of a third of shareholders' equity. The shares fell by 10 per cent yesterday and the day before. They closed at DM108 last night, a drop of 87 per cent from last year's high of DM855. Escada said that once it had completed the sale of the unnamed subsidiary, its balance sheet would be be as strong as at the end of the previous financial year. The company was one of Germany's 1980s success stories. Founded in 1976 by Mrs Margaretha Ley and her husband, it was enthusiastically received when it came to the stock market in 1986. Acquisitions helped it double its sales between 1989 and 1991, to DM1.36bn (Pounds 550m) a year. Mrs Ley fell ill, however, and died in June 1992. Since then, the company has lost investors' favour. The company yesterday blamed the recession for its problems, adding that it had been particularly surprised by the severity of the recession in Germany last autumn. Escada's three traditional labels - Escada, Laurel and Crisca - have attracted affluent women customers, willing to pay Pounds 800 for a suit. Its success in this market was highlighted last year by the occasion on which Mrs Norma Major and Mrs Virginia Bottomley, wore identical pink Escada suits. Other devotees in the UK are Cilla Black and Esther Rantzen. The company has had difficulty in integrating recent acquisitions, especially Schneberger and Kemper, bought in 1987 and 1988 respectively. These purchases took Escada into a lower segment of the market than its core business. The company said that in spite of the recession, sales for the year to October 1992 would probably hold up at the same level as the previous year. Profits in 1991 fell 23 per cent to DM45.1m.</p>

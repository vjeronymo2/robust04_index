			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres stated this  evening that Israel has not changed its position regarding  crossing procedures on the Jordan River bridges and the scope of  the withdrawal in Jericho. Mr. Peres made these remarks on the  eve of the resumption of the talks in Taba. In its weekly  session today, the cabinet heard a briefing on the issue. Our  political correspondent Shlomo Raz reports from the studio:    [Raz] [passage omitted] Israel is not prepared to change the  Cairo understandings, either with regard to the crossing  arrangements on the bridges or the scope of the withdrawal in  Jericho. This position was unequivocally reaffirmed by Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres.    [Begin Peres recording] The Cairo understandings do not  include 'Arafat's observations, that is as clear as day. As for  the Cairo understandings, there is the document we issued and  the observations of Nabil Sha'th -- and they do not differ all  that much from each other -- and this should be the basis for  discussion. [end recording] [passage omitted]    In anticipation of the meeting between Clinton and al-Asad,  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin remarked that if the Syrians link  peace to the normalization of relations with Israel this would  be a change. If al-Asad chooses to maintain the current  vagueness, then nothing will have changed, the prime minister  said.</p>

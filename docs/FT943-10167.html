			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): US stocks retreat after jobs figures Wall Street US stocks retreated yesterday in the face of a July employment report which increased the likelihood of higher interest rates, writes Frank McGurty in New York. However, the reaction was mild in view of a sharp decline the data triggered in the bond market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 18.77 lower at 3,747.02, while the more broadly based Standard &amp;Poor's 500 was down 1.31 at 457.09. Activity was light, with volume on the Big Board reaching only 230m shares. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.01 at 440.34, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 1.52 to 718.66. The negative tone was set before the market opened. At 8.30am, the Labor Department announced that non-farm payrolls had increased by 259,000 jobs last month, well ahead of the consensus forecast. Investors had keenly awaited the data, looking for convincing evidence that would allow the Federal Reserve to delay its next move to tighter credit conditions. Instead the data suggested that a rate increase could come at any time. As a consequence, the blue chips extended a decline which had begun in the closing minutes of the previous session, when investors had sensed the bad news to come. However, the downturn paled when compared with the rout in bonds. Late in the day the benchmark 30-year government security was down nearly a point and a half amid an onslaught of selling pressure. The hardest hit issue among the Dow industrials was Cater pillar, a stock that prospered early in the economic recovery. With the cycle apparently taking another turn its share price dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 104 3/4 after an order imbalance briefly halted trading in the issue. But the stoppage coincided with the approval by shareholders of a two-for-one stock split, suggesting that the decline was not simply a response to the fundamentals. However, Cummins Engine, another company whose performance is closely tied to the economy, dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 1/8 , a 52-week low. The recent spate of mergers and acquisitions showed no sign of abating. News of two deals struck by Nextel, a New Jersey telecommunications concern, added a touch of spice to a surprisingly bland session. The stock rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 26 3/4 after Nextel announced a tax-free merger with Dial Page and agreed to buy certain wireless communications businesses from Motorola. Dial Page was up Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 5/8 and Motorola added Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 52 5/8 . Earnings news continued to straggle into Wall Street. Scientific-Atlanta, a cable television equipment supplier, jumped Dollars 4 7/8 to Dollars 39 after surprising Wall Street with net income of 53 cents a share, 10 cents better than expected. On the Nasdaq, Ben&amp;Jerry's share price dropped Dollars 1 5/8 or 10.8 per cent to Dollars 13 3/8 after the Vermont ice cream company posted second-quarter earnings of 10 cents a share, about a third of the level forecast by analysts.</p>

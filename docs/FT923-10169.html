			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Honecker charged in Berlin MR ERICH HONECKER, the former East German leader, was charged yesterday on 49 counts of manslaughter after his extradition from Moscow on Wednesday. The 79-year-old ex-communist leader was charged in connection with the shooting by border guards of 49 would-be refugees at the Berlin Wall and other parts of the frontier with West Germany between 1961 and 1989. Mr Honecker was also charged with breach of trust in connection with the privileges enjoyed by the communist leadership at its compound in Wandlitz outside Berlin. The East German treasury, the charge sheet said, lost DM15.5m (Pounds 5.4m) in hard currency during 1988 and 1989 alone. Mr Honecker's lawyer, Mr Friedrich Wolff, described his client as 'very shaken' after the hearing. Carrying his trademark fedora hat, Mr Honecker smiled wanly at his lawyer and shook his hand after the hearing. He was returned to the hospital of Berlin's Moabit detention prison. Mr Honecker was once imprisoned in Moabit by the Nazis as a young communist militant. The former leader was examined by prison doctors, who found him in good health for a man of his age. Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor, advised of Mr Honecker's return, said: 'It was about time. Now the trial can begin.' Mr Wolff said his client had no chance of a fair trial because reunited Germany had already found him guilty. The lawyer, who once defended East German dissidents, said the uproar surrounding Mr Honecker's return from Moscow after 16 months as a fugitive made it almost impossible to stage an effective defence. 'Honecker has been tried in public and by the media and has been found guilty,' Mr Wolff told reporters. 'A fair trial is not possible when one considers how he has already been prejudged.' Former East German officials put on trial for manslaughter or fraud so far have been acquitted or given light suspended sentences. Mr Wolff said his client had refused to leave the compound of the Chilean embassy in Moscow after hearing on Wednesday that the Chilean government no longer desired his presence. Russian security men then entered the embassy and told him to leave - a move Mr Wolff described as a breach of international law. Meanwhile, Mr Honecker's wife, Margot, left Moscow on a flight for Chile, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. Homecoming, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 14</p>

Governor Yue Qifeng presided over today's session of the  work  conference at which Gu Jinchi, secretary of the provincial party  committee, delivered a report entitled "Emancipate Minds and  Deepen the Reform To Improve Agriculture and the Rural Economy  to a New Level".    In his report Gu Jinchi said: Over the past few years, our  province has consecutively reaped a bumper harvest in  agriculture and created a new record in grain production every  year. It has achieved stable development in the production of  forestry, animal husbandry, sideline cultivation, and fishery.  It has also made a historical breakthrough in developing  township enterprises. Such achievements scored the province  have resulted from earnestly implementing the party's line,  principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the  11th CPC Central Committee; and from emancipating minds,  changing the concept, and following a correct road. These  achievements have also resulted from the arduous struggle  launched by the broad masses of cadres and people throughout the  province. He said: Firmly regarding agriculture as a  foundation in conducting economic construction represents the  fundamentally guiding ideology fostered by our party in a long  time and also represents an important component of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The prominent  role played by agriculture in Liaoning Province that is with a  large proportion of industrial production and a large number of  urban population has become more obvious. He stressed: The  party committee at city and county levels should give its  working emphasis and major energy to the rural work. Following  the rural work conference, various localities should go into  action immediately to implement in a down- to-earth manner the  spirit of the work conference and do a good job in conducting  the work in various fields for the winter-spring period.</p>

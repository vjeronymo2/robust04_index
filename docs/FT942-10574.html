			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Observer: Dial-a-stick Britain's Foreign Office can perhaps be forgiven for drawing a blank in trying to contact British nationals by telephone in Aden, southern Yemen, where a confusing battle has been raging. For the southern Yemenis, in a highly effective 'communications offensive' against their northern enemies, have changed all telephone area codes to their pre-unification digits. They have also declined to tell anyone what the new/old codes are. This cunning plot fell foul of a non-digitalised telephone exchange worker in Aden. He informed a British Airways employee, who in turn contacted London. There, the news spread swiftly to the small community of Indians originally from Aden, one of whom informed the Foreign Office. The moral? You never know when you might need your cleft stick.</p>

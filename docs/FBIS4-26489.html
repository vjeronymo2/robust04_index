			<p>BFN     [Text] Canberra, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Beijing will continue  to encourage foreign business to invest in China.    Speaking at the Australia-China Business Council in  Melbourne  this noon, China's State Councilor Li Tieying said that there  would be no change in the preferential policies granted to  foreign-funded enterprises.    He also said that foreign-funded enterprises will gradually  enjoy the treatment granted to the Chinese people.    Li, who is also minister in charge of the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economic Systems, arrived in Melbourne  this morning for a nine-day visit to Australia.    "We will maintain the continuity of our foreign investment  policy by continuing to encourage foreign investment into  China," Li told the luncheon in honor of him by the council.    "China has always respected and protected the legal rights  and interests of foreign businesses," Li said. "Treatment  equivalent to that extended to Chinese nationals will be  gradually granted to foreign enterprises."    Talking about the newly-introduced reforms of foreign  exchange and foreign trade, Li said that a system of bank  foreign exchange settlement and sales would be introduced for  state-owned foreign trade enterprises.    "The existing practice will be maintained in regard to  foreign-funded enterprises, namely, they can retain their cash  accounts to facilitate their operation including import and  export," he added.    On the reform of China's taxation system, Li said that it  "does not, generally speaking, increase the overall tax burden  on foreign-funded enterprise."    "For some enterprises whose tax burden does increase,  corresponding compensation measures have been formulated to  allow for the full entitlement of foreign businessmen to the  preferential conditions set forth in China's laws and agreements  for cooperation in China," Li said.    Li stressed that "there have been changes in any of the  preferential policies regarding to foreign-funded enterprises."    The recent approval of China's foreign trade law will  provide  a better legal guarantee for foreign investment and trade  activities in China, he added.    China has so far approved 170,000 foreign-invested projects,  with the accumulated directed foreign investment exceeding 60  billion U.S. dollars and over 70,000 foreign-funded enterprises  already is [words indistinct].</p>

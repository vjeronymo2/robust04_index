			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Contracting-out body says law is discouraging bidders CONTRACTING OUT and market-testing of public services are in 'terminal decline', according to the trade association representing government contractors. Mr John Hall, director-general of the Business Services Association, said yesterday that regulations protecting the rights of staff whose work was contracted out were forcing many contractors to withdraw from bidding for public-sector work. He predicted that contracting out would 'wither on the vine' unless the legal uncertainties were reduced. The 25 per cent savings sought by ministers would not materialise unless contractors were free to reorganise work with fewer staff. Mr Hall told a conference on contracting-out in the public sector at the Confederation of British Industry that the ability of contractors to improve the efficiency of public services was being blocked by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations 1981. Where the regulations apply, the contractor is required to take over the staff currently doing the work on existing terms and conditions. While the regulations did not apply in every case, the uncertainty was deterring contractors from bidding, Mr Hall said. He added: 'I don't believe that any of us could have envisaged the difficulty which has been created by the incursion of Tupe into public-sector tendering.' Speaking at the same conference, Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, said that the government wanted to amend the European Community legislation. He said: 'We are discussing our proposals with other member states and are finding increasingly that other colleagues in Europe are taking a similar view to ours.' Mr Hall welcomed the government's efforts to amend the EC legislation. But he said that much more could be done to keep contracting-out alive while Tupe continued.</p>

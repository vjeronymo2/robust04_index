			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Survey of FT Traveller, Hong Kong (6): Paradise for hagglers  -SHOPPING: bargains about, but haggling in Hong Kong has been refined to an art form in which most western shoppers are timorous amateurs. says David Dodwell A PETITE, and well-dressed Chinese woman picked up a linen embroidered tablecloth in a bustling store on Kowloon's Granville Road, and gestured to the shopkeeper asking a price. After a long preamble describing the fineness of the work, and the hundreds of hours spent on it by needleworkers in Suzhou, he confided it would cost about HKDollars 6,000. There followed much sucking of teeth, accompanied by gestures of disbelief, and many minutes of commentary about how many shops sell such tablecloths, and how cheaply they are made in China. In the minutes that followed, the mysterious rituals of haggling unfolded. Voices were never raised. There was much smiling and laughing. There were many restatements of honourability, good faith and being a good customer. Promises were made about bringing more business to the shop by getting friends to come. There were inquiries about a better price if she bought two. Emphasis was placed on the fact she could pay in cash. It all took half an hour. Both seemed happy as a deal was sealed and the cloth gift-wrapped  - though the shopkeeper made occasional protests of how much money he was losing. When she emerged, she had in fact paid HKDollars 1,250. Haggling in Hong Kong has been refined to an art form in which most western shoppers are timorous amateurs. While certain shops stick to fixed prices, haggling is taken for granted in most of them, and most western shoppers miss out on the sport that for many Hong Kongers appears to be the principle point of any purchase: it is the travelling, rather than the arriving, that makes it all worthwhile. While the example of the tablecloth is real, it is rare in the width of the chasm that was breached by shopper and shopkeeper. I suspect she had an inkling of how much the shopkeeper had paid. It is nevertheless not rare for a realistic sale price to be half the marked price of any item, whether it is a stereo system or Gameboy, silk flowers or a piece of Paris fashion. Two important starting points ahead of a serious haggling session are to know what price you would have to pay for the same thing back home - including any tax the customs and excise might put on it as you try to slip inconspicuously through the green channel  - and to be willing to walk away. Once a shopkeeper scents your reluctance to walk away, he has an upper hand that you are unlikely to overcome. Other points to keep in mind are: Anything you set your eyes on in a street market might be fake, or stolen. The most obvious fakes are the Rolexes touted from folding tables in street markets like Temple Street in Kowloon. 'But this isn't a real Rolex,' a friend once protested as he weighed the offering in his hand. 'No,' replied the tout without embarrassment or hesitation: 'But real Seiko inside.' American Express cards are next to useless in the territory, claim some observers. Hong Kong shopkeepers hate the delay in payment, and the fee they have to pay, and will add at least six per cent to the price, even if a deal has ostensibly been sealed. While Hong Kong is not the bargain basement it once claimed to be, (for best prices, a shopper must nowadays be in Bangkok), there are still good reasons to shop here in earnest. As for electronic goods, the territory is among the first in the world to get its hands on new Japanese gizmos. You can be sure to find models in Hong Kong which are unlikely to arrive in shops back home for a year or two. This applies as much to cameras and camcorders as it does to personal organisers or portable compact disc players. Many factory outlets offer haute couture fashions at prices that would inflame trend-setting purchasers in Paris or Rome. This happens because quota limits for various countries often prevent the export of everything made for the big name fashion houses in Europe or the US. Factory outlets are dotted all over Hong Kong and Kowloon, and are listed in a booklet published by the Hong Kong Tourist Association, (see section on key facts for visitors). Leather goods, most made in mainland China, are beginning to be well styled, and cost a fraction of leather goods in Europe. Chinese arts and crafts are more difficult to guage. Prices are likely to be lower than in tourist outlets in mainland China, and the range of products available is unlikely to be matched elsewhere. But the territory provides a convenient hunting ground for many of the world's most expert and most avid collectors of Chinese arts  - and prices reflect this. Bargains can undoubtedly be found in areas like Holloway Road above Central, but it will take luck, patience, and a very good eye to trip over them. Myth has it that men should have suits tailored in Hong Kong. Needless to say, in 1986, the FT conducted a straw poll of 'best dressed men' in Hong Kong only to discover they all had their suits made elsewhere. Italy and London seemed then to be the preferred locations. It is nevertheless true that good suits can be made in the territory. Hotel concierges are probably the best source of tips on where to go. They are likely to be cheaper than from Savile Row, and if you either offer a suit you already own to be copied, or have the patience to have at least three fittings, money could well be saved. Perhaps the most daunting prospect for any newly-arrived shopper is to choose the direction in which to point. One can be forgiven for feeling the territory is wall-to-wall shops. At one end of the spectrum are modern, luxurious air-conditioned plazas full of Guccis and Ferragamos, and charging prices similar to those in Paris. These seem to be frequented mostly by Japanese tourists. At the other end of the spectrum are sweltering outdoor night markets with a powerful barrow-boy bustle about them. Air-conditioned shopping is practically well essential in the day time in summer. On Hong Kong island, the new Pacific Place is impressive, as is the nearby cobweb of Japanese department stores. In Kowloon, Harbour City and Ocean Terminal next to the Star Ferry offer miles of fascinating shopping, while the newly-opened Hong Kong Place in east Tsimshatsui claims to be the largest shopping complex in Asia. Out of doors, the liveliest single market is Temple Street in Mong Kok, which comes alive around seven in the evening, and goes on to midnight. Stanley Market on the south of Hong Kong island has lots of casual wear in western sizes. In Central, the tightly packed streets above Queen's Road  - like Li Yuen streets east and west  - offer handbags, scarves, sweaters, dresses, toys and imitation jewellery. The jade market in Kowloon is a popular destination, while the quest for handicrafts and fine art is concentrated on Holloway Road, Cat Street and Stanley Main Street. Chinese Arts and Crafts emporiums, owned by mainland Chinese, are dotted around the territory, and offer an immense range of goods from across the border. While Hong Kong is without question a haggler's paradise, it is also the home of 'caveat emptor.' Once bought, an item will only rarely be returnable to the seller if it is found to be fake or faulty. Shops carrying the Hong Kong Tourist Association symbol (a red junk in a circle) offer the highest level of reliability, but 'caveat emptor' remains the watchword of every sensible shopper in Hong Kong.</p>

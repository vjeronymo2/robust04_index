			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: National Savings puts rivals in the shade - Five-year investments HOW HAVE your investments performed over the past five years? Did you opt for safety or plunge headlong into exotic equities in the hope of gain? The table gives a quick guide to the returns that were available, and a yardstick against which you can measure the performance of your own portfolio. It shows how unfancied investments, such as boring old National Savings, have done better than most of the alternatives over the period. Had you sought advice in January 1987, the chances are that few experts would have recommended National Savings. For a start, equities were in the last year of a bull market and the exciting returns achieved during the early 1980s were luring many a private investor at the peak. Just as important was the fact that National Savings does not pay commission, so there was every incentive for advisers to recommend other, more lucrative (for them, at least) products. It is also true that, in the field of investment, even experts with years of experience can get it disastrously wrong. Few predicted the crash of October 1987 or the revival of inflation in 1988 and 1989. Fixed-interest investments were a better option than most equities over the past five years. Both a guaranteed income bond and fixed-rate National Savings beat most of the equity investments, and also the return from Pounds 10,000 invested with a major building society (Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's Gold account was used for the example). Those personal pension funds investing in fixed-interest securities also did well. Of course, you could have beaten fixed-interest returns by picking one of the best-performing unit or investment trusts. But, unless you were extremely lucky (or shrewd), the chances are that your return would have been nearer to the average trust performance - which lagged behind not only National Savings but also the building societies. Only 40 individual unit trusts out of 793 with a five-year record pipped index-linked National Savings over a five-year period. Your chances of picking one of those outperforming trusts were almost 19 to one. Investment trusts do rather better than unit trusts in the table, which explains part of their popularity with investors. But a good deal of this return has been due to the narrowing of discounts in the sector - in other words, share prices have risen faster than the underlying assets in the fund. This narrowing of discounts cannot be repeated on the same scale over the next five years and, indeed, there is always the chance that discounts could widen. Nevertheless, it is depressing for those who invested in a unit trust to discover that they did not beat inflation. (Not that those who picked a managed single-premium investment bond did much better). The history of the past five years shows how dangerous it is for investors to follow the dictates of fashion. In 1986, a record Pounds 5.2bn was invested in unit trusts, and total funds under management reached Pounds 32bn. Far too many investors probably bailed out right after the 'crash' of October 1987 - the classic case of buying at the top and selling at the bottom. Much publicity in the unit trust industry is given to those managers with the best-performing funds of the year - and those who sell trusts often focus on short-term performance. How would you have fared by backing the top-performing trust of 1986? Legal &amp; General Far Eastern was the star, turning Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 2,122 over the year. But had you invested at the start of 1987, your Pounds 1,000 would have dwindled to Pounds 939. The five-year audit shows just how pointless it is to look at one-year figures when choosing a unit trust. You should normally be prepared to hold on to these trusts for at least three to five years and, as we have seen, you might need to do so for longer before it becomes worthwhile. Of course, this table, as the advertisements say, is no guide to the future. Equities have outperformed fixed-interest and cash deposits over most five-year periods. The fact that private investors are so wary of equities at the moment could mean that this is just the time to be buying shares. But the nervous will find that National Savings should allow them to sleep profitably at night. Unit trust performance is shown on an offer-to-bid basis with income re-invested (source Micropal). Investment trusts are shown based on mid-market prices with income re-invested (source AITC). Cheltenham Gold account is shown after basic-rate tax. The best guaranteed income bond was offered by Liberty Life (source Chase de Vere).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FIVE-YEAR RANKING  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Percent Investment                                gain/loss  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Best investment trust (Tor inc shares)      173.9 Best unit trust (Newton inc)                144.4 Index-linked Nat.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Maintenance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index will be maintained by the CBOE. The CBOE may change the composition of the Index at any time, subject to compliance with the maintenance criteria discussed herein, to reflect the conditions in the global telecommunications industry. If it becomes necessary to replace a security in the Index, the Exchange represents that it will make every effort to add new stocks and/or ADRs that are representative of the global telecommunications industry and will take into account a security's capitalization, liquidity, volatility, and name recognition of the proposed replacement. Further, securities may be replaced in the event of certain corporate events, such as takeovers or mergers, that change the nature of the security. If, however, the Exchange determines to increase the number of Index component securities to greater than twenty-six or reduce the number of Index component securities to fewer than fourteen, the proposal provides that the CBOE will submit a rule filing with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Act. In addition, in choosing replacement securities for the Index, the CBOE will be required to ensure that at least 90% of the weight of the Index continues to be made up of stocks and ADRs that are eligible for standardized options trading. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  Finally, the CBOE will be required to ensure that each component of the Index is subject to last sale reporting requirements in the U.S. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Amendment No. 1,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 4. The CBOE's options listing standards, which are uniform among the options exchanges, provide that a security underlying an option must, among other things, meet the following requirements: (1) the public float must be at least 7,000,000; (2) there must be a minimum of 2,000 stockholders; (3) trading volume must have been at least 2.4 million over the preceding twelve months; and (4) the market price must have been at least $7.50 for a majority of the business days during the preceding three calendar months. See CBOE Rule 5.3. With respect to ADRs' in addition to the above standards: (1) the Exchange must have in place a comprehensive surveillance agreement with the primary exchange in the home country where the security underlying the ADR is traded: or (2) the trading volume in the U.S. markets where the ADR is traded represents (on a share-equivalent basis) at least 50% of the worldwide trading volume in the security underlying the ADR over the three month period preceding the date of selection of the ADR for options trading; or (3) the SEC must otherwise authorize the listing. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33554 (January 31, 1994), 59 FR 5622 (February 7, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See February 14 Letter,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Applicability of CBOE Rules Regarding Index Options <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except as modified by this order, the rules in Chapter XXIV of the CBOE Rules will be applicable to Global Telecommunications Index options and full-value and reduced-value Index LEAPS. Those rules address, among other things, the applicable position and exercise limits, policies regarding trading halts and suspensions, and margin treatment for narrow-based index options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Calculation of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE Global Telecommunications Index is a price-weighted index and reflects changes in the prices of the Index component securities relative to the Index's base date of January 2, 1992. Specifically, the Index value is calculated by adding the prices of the component stocks and ADRs and then dividing this summation by a divisor that is equal to the number of the components of the Index to get the average price. To maintain the continuity of the Index, the divisor will be adjusted to reflect non-market changes in the prices of the component securities as well as changes in the composition of the Index. Changes that may result in divisor adjustments include, but are not limited to, stock splits and dividends, spin-offs, certain rights issuances, and mergers and acquisitions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Index will be calculated continuously and will be disseminated to the Options Price Reporting Authority (``OPRA'') every fifteen seconds by the CBOE, based on the last-sale prices of the component stocks and ADRs. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  OPRA, in turn, will disseminate the Index value to other financial vendors such as Reuters, Telerate, and Quotron.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of the daily dissemination of the Index value, if a stock included in the Index has not opened for trading, the CBOE will use the closing value of that stock on the prior trading day when calculating the value of the Index, until the stock opens for trading.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index value for purposes of settling outstanding regular Index options and Index LEAPS contracts upon expiration will be calculated based upon the regular way opening sale prices for each of the Index's component securities in their primary market on the last trading day prior to expiration. In the case of securities traded on and through NASDAQ, the first reported sale price will be used. Once all of the component stocks and ADRs have opened, the value of the Index will be determined and that value will be used as the final settlement value for expiring Index options contracts. If any of the component stocks or ADRs do not open for trading on the last trading day before expiration, then the prior trading day's ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , normally Thursday's) last sale price will be used in the Index calculation. In this regard, before deciding to use Thursday's closing value of a component security for purposes of determining the settlement value of the Index, the CBOE will wait until the end of the trading day on expiration Friday.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

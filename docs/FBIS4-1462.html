			<p>BFN     [Text] Serious concern is developing over the delay in  carrying out the confirmation hearing of Mrs. Dorothy Musuleng  Cooper, the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] nominee  to the post of foreign minister to the LNTG [Liberian National  Transitional Government]. Mrs. Cooper should have been  confirmed this week along with two other NPFL nominees who have  already been confirmed and inducted into office for the  portfolios of information and agriculture. Although TLA  [Transitional Legislative Assembly] Speaker Morris Dukuly, has  said he is awaiting instruction from the State Council before  carrying out Madame Cooper's confirmation hearing, the statement  runs contrary to the prerogatives of the various parties to  present their nominees for the confirmation as already done by  the NPFL.    NPFL leader, Mr. Charles Gankay Taylor, has made it  expressly  clear that the Transitional State Council has no hiring or  dismissing power over any of the nominees of the various  factions. Mrs. Cooper, the first woman to be appointed to the  Foreign Ministry portfolio in Liberia, was recently nominated to  the post by NPFL in place of Mr. Momolu Sirleaf after a  contention from IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] over  the suitability of Mr. Sirleaf for the job.    A delay in carrying out Mrs. Cooper's confirmation  represents  a flagrant abuse of the conciliatory move by the NPFL to have  Mr. Momolu Sirleaf replaced for the post of foreign affairs,  considering that none of the various factions to the Liberian  Council is under a binding obligation of so doing to the seat of  another party to the Council. The delay tactic is another  bizarre attempt by the Monrovia group to stall the transitional  process leading to the holding of free and fair general and  presidential elections and restoration of lasting peace to  Liberia. The NPFL has vowed not to give in to any ploy that  will cause any further delay in the peace process. Liberian  women are also arguing that the delay in conducting confirmation  hearings of Madame Cooper is a manifestation of prejudice  against Liberian women who have distinguished themselves as  capable of assuming high office in the country.    News just in says the NPFL is taken aback by the delay in a  peace process, endangered by a Council of State negotiated for  and subsequently sworn in to accelerate the process of peace in  this country. The Council of State, in effect, has no authority  whatsoever to appoint ministers or heads of public corporations  and autonomous agencies. This is the exclusive domain of the  negotiating parties after the Cotonou Agreement. According to  an NPFL release, the chairman of the State Council is merely  first among equals. As such, the NPFL is therefore disturbed  that it is assuming the role of superstar, making decisions even  when only two of five council members are present. This is  totally unacceptable, according to the NPFL. Such a drift from  the Cotonou Agreement can only lead to a total breakdown of the  process, according to the NPFL statement. The NPFL leadership  then urged all peaceloving Liberians and the international  community at large to do whatever they can to make sure that  this Transitional Government is finally and totally seated and  functions.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Dublin 'forum' to speed Sinn Fein involvement The Irish government's proposal to establish a 'peace forum' - referred to in this week's joint UK-Irish declaration - is aimed at bringing Sinn Fein rapidly into a formal negotiating process after the IRA has announced the ending of violence. Senior cabinet ministers say Sinn Fein could be brought into the Irish forum 'very quickly' after an announcement. This would be before the exploratory talks the British government has offered the party, which would start after a three-month 'quarantine' period. The ministers also echoed the British government's view that a surrender of IRA weapons would not be a precondition to the involvement of Sinn Fein in talks. Mr Albert Reynolds, the taoiseach, told the Dail yesterday: 'The joint declaration was the first stage in the peace process. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could be absolutely vital to reaching a second stage, and to achieving a permanent cessation of violence. 'If we want to be realistic, we have to guarantee that there will be a political process, once violence is permanently ended. The forum could provide a useful input to wider negotiations.' The creation of such a forum was one of the main sticking points in the drafting of the joint declaration. Irish government officials say it was therefore decided to make it an Irish initiative, rather than a joint initiative with Britain. Mr Reynolds said the forum would be modelled on the New Ireland Forum, set up in 1983 on the initiative of Mr John Hume, the leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party in Northern Ireland, in which all the main parties in the Republic and the SDLP participated, but which the unionist parties in the north boycotted. Mr Reynolds said the new forum would be open 'to democratically mandated parties to provide a means to debate and devise appropriate alternative political strategies to violence'. Apparently acknowledging that unionist parties will not initially wish to be involved, he said the debate would take place 'among all strands of nationalism and hopefully a wider range of opinion, (and) in the aftermath of a permanent cessation of violence, could be a very healthy exercise in advance of resumed talks between all political parties, unionist and nationalist'. Dublin sees the forum as providing a 'bridge' to exploratory Sinn Fein talks with London and to subsequent wider talks involving all parties in Northern Ireland and the Republic. Dublin believes the move is necessary if Sinn Fein and the IRA are to accept the peace initiative. Issues of concern to Sinn Fein and the IRA, such as the future of IRA prisoners and the 'dumping' of arms, would be dealt with in these initial talks. Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, expressed reservations. 'A forum that does not contain representatives of both traditions cannot achieve the stated objective in the joint declaration to promote reconciliation. There is a risk that some form of institutionalisation of division may be established.' The Irish parliament later backed the joint declaration without a vote at the end of a day-long debate in the Dail. Winding up the Dail debate, Mr Dick Spring, the deputy premier and foreign minister, said he would brief fellow members of the EC's General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (30): Wall of money seeks bricks and mortar - The stock market values of companies in the UK have rebounded strongly. John Thornhill considers whether this turnaround will lead to a recovery in Europe / Sector Analyses - Property Even a cursory glance at the property companies in the FT500 list is enough to highlight the two most significant trends in the European market this year. The UK property sector has experienced a striking reversal of fortune. The stock market values of UK property companies have rebounded strongly, lifting Land Securities and MEPC far higher in the rankings and pushing four UK companies back into the list. By contrast, many segments of the property markets in mainland Europe have remained mired in recession with the one Dutch and two French companies included in the FT500 slipping further down the list. With hindsight, the turning point for UK property came when the pound fell out of the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992, enabling the government to cut interest rates. The surge in equities and the subsequent drop in long-dated gilts yields highlighted the comparatively attractive returns from property. The double-digit yields then available on prime property stimulated interest among institutional and overseas buyers. A wall of money, estimated at up to Pounds 10bn, began searching for a home in bricks and mortar. This wave of investment has resulted in a sharp decline in property yields. But, as usual, the stock market was quick to anticipate the trend. Property is inherently a lumpy, illiquid class of asset and shares are more readily tradeable. Since the pound's departure from the ERM, the quoted property sector has almost tripled in value to Pounds 15bn. Property companies have been quick to take advantage of this flush of enthusiasm. Many companies with heavy debts and stretched balance sheets eagerly sought the chance to tap the stock market for fresh funds. The biggest UK property companies raised some Pounds 1.4bn of equity finance, helping to expand the sector's market capitalisation and secure the company's dividend base. Britain's largest property company, Land Securities, has jumped 28 places up the FT500 rankings to 108. MEPC, which struggled during recession because of its exposure to the London office market, registered one of the largest rises in the list, climbing from 299 to 193. Four other UK property companies, which were among Europe's biggest 500 companies before recession struck, have returned to the rankings. British Land excited considerable interest in the sector by linking up with Mr George Soros, the hedge fund manager. Slough Estates, which concentrates mainly on industrial property, has seen activity pick up quicker than in previous recoveries. And Hammerson Property and Great Portland Estates are expected to show a marked improvement in asset values given their weightings in the commercial office sector. But although the investment and equity markets have rocketed, the underlying health of the property market has remained fragile. The worry for UK property companies is that the striking turnaround in sentiment has not yet been matched by a commensurate improvement in the fundamentals of the underlying property market. Many sectors of the market are still suffering the effects of the huge surplus of space that came on stream in the 1980s. Rents for many types of properties are continuing to fall and the worst-hit sectors, such as office property in the west end of London, have experienced a 60 per cent fall in rental levels since their peak in 1990. Office rents in many parts of the UK will remain under pressure as service companies shed staff to improve productivity levels. Employment levels in other parts of the economy may only pick up slowly. In mainland Europe, the effects of recession are still evident in many areas of the property market although it is difficult to generalise about various patterns in different sectors and regions. The Paris office market has fallen away sharply with overcapacity increasing and rental levels recording steep declines. But the two French companies in the FT500 rankings have remained largely immune from these problems given their exposure to the residential market. Both Sefimeg and Simco have provided a relatively safe haven for investors in the French property sector and have experienced only marginal falls in the rankings. That stability, though, may count against them in investors' eyes in the upturn when those companies more highly geared to recovery experience a faster rebound in earnings and asset values. A similar story may hold true for Rodamco, the Dutch property company, which has slipped only slightly in the rankings from 130 to 135. Its diversified international portfolio has given it protection in the downturn in mainland Europe. Earlier this month, Rodamco forecast unchanged net profits and dividends for the year and substantially lower write-downs on property, largely as a result of a positive contribution from its UK investments. Those investors brave enough to invest in the UK in the trough of recession have already seen substantial returns. If all the investment funds seeking a home in the UK cannot be absorbed, the braver souls may see attractions in picking up assets in the most cyclically depressed markets of mainland Europe.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Property companies by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                            FT500     Company                      dollarsm   Rank   Sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Land Securities                5246.7    108      161 2   Rodamco                        4213.0    135      161 3   MEPC                           2937.3    193      161 4   British Land                   1739.1    313      161 5   Slough Estates                 1478.2    362      161 6   Simco                          1396.4    386      161 7   Sefimeg                        1391.3    388      161 8   Hammerson Property             1360.1    394      161 9   Great Portland Estates         1000.4    475      161  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Greenspan ups interest rates Central banking is an art, not a science. In a country with a floating exchange rate and little faith in monetary targeting, it is an exceptionally difficult art at that. It is one that Mr Alan Greenspan's Federal Reserve has practised adeptly in recent years. But events this year suggest it may be losing its sureness of touch. The case for raising short-term interest rates once more had become very strong. Economic data since the surprise announcement, in early February, of a quarter of a percentage point increase have underlined the strength of the US economy. Revised figures have shown the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent in the last quarter of 1993, rather than the 5.9 per cent first reported. Retail spending is robust. Industrial production appears to be growing at an annual rate of 7-8 per cent this quarter, while the jobless rate, at 6.5 per cent, is already quite low. In addition, monetary policy has remained expansionary. The short rate of interest has been less than half the long rate; the absolute gap between the two has been more than 3 1/2 percentage points; and the short-term real rate of interest has been barely positive. Finally, the bond market decline since the last rate increase indicates anxieties about inflation that the Federal Reserve has failed to still. A prudent central bank, worried about its reputation and, indeed, about the sustainability of the recovery, would want to push bond rates down once more. The question then is not whether the Federal Reserve should have raised its rates, but rather by how much. What Mr Greenspan said yesterday was merely that the central bank would tighten reserves, an action that then increased the federal funds rate to 3.5 per cent. In its manner and its matter, this was the very least he could have done, particularly after last Friday's surprise meeting with President Bill Clinton, which was bound to renew doubts about the independence of the Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve may not have done enough. Monetary policy remains expansionary, while markets will still be waiting for Mr Greenspan's next shoe to fall. It might have been wiser to put interest rates at a more obviously 'neutral' level immediately. If rates were 4 per cent or more, nobody would expect them to rise in the near future and few would doubt that Mr Greenspan had already done enough. Sometimes central banks do indeed have to feel their way. But the US in early 1994 may need more decisive treatment.</p>

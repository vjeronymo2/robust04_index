			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Railway dispute intensifies after Acas talks fail Britain's rail dispute worsened last night after the conciliation service Acas failed to persuade Railtrack and the RMT transport union to return to the negotiating table. Both sides accused the other of intransigence as five days of exploratory talks failed to break the deadlock in the signalling staff dispute. The RMT executive announced it had called a further 24-hour strike for next week, on Friday August 12, and a 48-hour stoppage on Monday and Tuesday, August 15-16. The strikes will paralyse much of the rail network for five days over a weekend in the peak holiday season. These stoppages are in addition to today's 24-hour strike - the eighth in the present dispute - which starts at noon and ends at midday tomorrow. Railtrack said: 'This is the most disgraceful wrecking tactic we have seen from a union for a long time. It is a vicious action designed to cause the maximum disruption.' Mr David Armstrong, Railtrack's human resources director, described as a 'sham' the union's claim that it was willing to negotiate freely. 'The RMT has rejected every attempt to find a solution throughout the many weeks of this dispute,' he said. 'They have not made a single concession. Their posturing of the last few weeks has lost each of their members hundreds of pounds this summer and thousands in the future.' Railtrack hopes that many signalling staff will be horrified at what it sees as RMT's intransigence and will ignore the strike calls. About a third of the network is expected to run through today's strike. The company may seek to ballot signal staff to find out whether they will accept the current offer. Railtrack said the offer was a rise of 7.2 per cent on earnings between April 4 and October 1. From October 1 a restructuring package would increase basic rates by up to 26 per cent. Overall, the offer would improve earnings by up to 10 per cent. In the absence of RMT general secretary Jimmy Knapp, who is attending an international union conference in Switzerland, Mr Vernon Hince, the union's chief negotiator, accused Railtrack of a 'public relations exercise' in offering signal staff in the south west payments of up to Pounds 800 to work on strike days. He repeated that the union claim for an interim rise for past efficiencies had 'never been seriously addressed since June 8'. 'We are not going to sell the members short,' he said. British Rail said last night services would run for the first time from all of London's main line stations during the 24-hour stoppage that starts at noon today.

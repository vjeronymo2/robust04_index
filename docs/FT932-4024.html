			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pounds 500m tax refunds paid to Names LLOYD'S NAMES - individuals whose assets back the insurance market - have received more than Pounds 500m in tax refunds from the Inland Revenue in the past two years it emerged last night, Richard Lapper writes. The Earl of Caithness, a junior minister, said in a Lords written reply that Pounds 126.7m had been repaid in the 1991-92 tax year and a further Pounds 386.6m in 1992-93. These figures had been only partially offset by estimated tax income of Pounds 101.8m and Pounds 10.3m in the same two years. Names can set aside their Lloyd's losses against tax paid on other income. Losses for 1990, which the market reports in two weeks' time, are expected to amount to a record Pounds 2.5bn to Pounds 2.8bn, leaving Names with average losses of more than Pounds 100,000 each. The government introduced changes earlier this year allowing Names to set aside greater amounts in tax deductible reserves against future losses. The change will come into effect for the 1992 underwriting year. Lloyd's rules, Page 8</p>

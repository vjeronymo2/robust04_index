			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'SUN' AND SEE  </P> <P> In the process of deriding, among other things, the prose style of Paul  Rosenblatt's "The Sun in Capricorn" (Book Review, Jan. 21), Carolyn See,  herself, writes the following gems:  </P> <P> "On the other hand, the Watermark Press operates out of Wichita, Kan., and not  to denigrate Wichita in any way, but still, it's not the publishing capital of  the United States." And: "The author readily acknowledges that the idea for  this revolutionary came initially from a magazine piece written in 1970 by  Sanche de Gramont, and, beyond that, the revolutionary is 'in name and being,  work of the imagination.' "  </P> <P> It seems probable that the book in question deserves the dissection it has  received at the hand of Miss See, but surely a "dull scalpel" is a virtual  oxymoron, even if a "clumsy surgeon," unfortunately, is not.  </P> <P> FRED SCIFERS, DOWNEY  </P></p>

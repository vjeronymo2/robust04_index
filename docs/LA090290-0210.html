			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: 'NIGHT MOVES'  </P> <P> One of the most unjustly neglected movies of the '70s, this Arthur Penn film is  a stunning, stylish detective mystery in the classic Raymond Chandler/Ross  Macdonald mold. The investigation of a murder by a tough yet vulnerable private  eye (Gene Hackman) becomes a quest for his own identity and a pursuit for truth  that cuts through many layers of social strata and ends with a wry sense of  irony over the eternal treachery of human nature and one's own illusions. With  Jennifer Warren, Susan Clark and Melanie Griffith.  </P> <P> (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.)Kevin Thomas  </P></p>

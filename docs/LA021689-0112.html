			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> MAN CLEARED IN BOY'S DEATH  </P> <P> A District Court jury in Las Vegas has found San Diego data processor Howard  Lee Haupt innocent of a murder charge in the slaying of a 7-year-old California  boy at a state-line casino nearly 15 months ago. "I'm very pleased that the  justice system works," a visibly shaken Haupt said after the verdict was read.  Roxanne Harris, the mother of victim Alexander Harris, sobbed loudly and put  her head in her hands. The jury rendered the verdict after a five-week trial.  The Harris boy disappeared Nov. 27, 1987, from Whiskey Pete's casino on the  California-Nevada border southwest of Las Vegas. His body was found a month  later, and Haupt was arrested in the case a year ago.  </P></p>

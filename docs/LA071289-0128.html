			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BID TO CORNER SOYBEAN MARKET SPURS ACTION  </P> <P> The Chicago Board of Trade issued an emergency order Tuesday aimed at breaking  up an attempted corner of the soybean market, described by one analyst as "the  biggest market play since the Hunts'."  </P> <P> The exchange's board of directors ordered all traders holding commitments to  buy or sell more than 3 million bushels of soybeans for delivery this month to  reduce those positions by at least 20% each trading day through July 20, when  the July contract expires.  </P> <P> Analysts said the order would likely result in a sharp drop in the July  contract's price at the opening of trading today.  </P> <P> Board of Trade spokesmen would not identify the parties involved but confirmed  that the emergency resolution was designed to avert the crisis that would occur  if the supply of soybeans available for delivery was too small to satisfy the  contracts.  </P> <P> William Biedermann, director of research with Allendale Inc., a Chicago-area  futures brokerage, said the situation was rooted in a large foreign-based grain  company's accumulation over the past 1 1/2 years of about 30 million bushels of  soybeans -- enough to control the market.  </P> <P> "It's probably the biggest story since Bunker Hunt tried to squeeze silver,"  Biedermann said, referring to the alleged attempt by the Hunt brothers to  control the world silver market several years ago.  </P> <P> Futures are binding contracts to deliver or take delivery of a set amount of a  commodity at an agreed-upon price at a future date. A typical corner occurs  when a trader holding a large number of contracts to take delivery also owns so  much of the commodity that those on the other side cannot acquire enough to  honor their delivery commitments.  </P> <P> The artificial supply squeeze causes the price of the commodity to soar until  the player working the corner sells out at a huge profit.  </P> <P> July soybeans settled Tuesday at $7.26 a bushel, compared to $6.64 for  September delivery, a difference of 62 cents a bushel or $3,100 per  5,000-bushel contract.  </P></p>

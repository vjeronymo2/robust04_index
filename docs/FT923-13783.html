			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / International Company News: Elf, Sumitomo in Dollars 5bn gas study ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group and Sumitomo, the Japanese trading company, have launched a feasibility study for a joint Dollars 5bn gas liquefaction and distribution project at one of the world's biggest gas fields, in Qatar. They expect to start deliveries to Japan, Taiwan and South Korea at the end of the century from Qatar's North Field, which is big enough to to provide the Gulf emirate with large amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the next 200 years. Construction is due to start in 1996. Last year, Qatar attributed part of the North Field to Elf, representing an estimated 200bn cubic metres out of total reserves of between 4,500bn and 6,000bn cubic metres. The deal allowed Elf to supply 4m tonnes of LNG per year for 25 years. LNG still accounts for only a small percentage of world gas output. But it is expected to grow fast in the next few years in response to the growing environmental pressure for cleaner energy. The Elf-Sumitomo feasibility study will take up to 18 months and cover the construction of a plant in Qatar, tanker shipments to the Far East and the possibility of inviting other partners to help shoulder the costs. Elf, which is state-controlled, is to be operator of the project, which covers offshore production and liquefaction at a plant, to be based at the Ras Laffan industrial site. Sumitomo will be in charge of project finance and shipping and will will try to strike gas sales contracts with Japanese electricity utilities, needed before the project can start. Its financial strength makes Sumitomo a suitable partner for a project of this size, with its long lead time before the first sales. LNG delivery prices are agreed in advance with the buyers, unlike in the oil industry where prices are set after production. However, oil analysts estimate that Qatar's first LNG supply contract, signed in February 1991, under which Japan's Chubu Electrical Power is to buy 4m tonnes per year, is worth Dollars 630m annually. This gives an indicator of the possible value of the Elf-Sumitomo project. Most of Japanese utilities are already committed until the end of the decade, which is one reason why Qatar has been slow to find takers for long-term contracts. But energy analysts expect Japan's gas needs to grow as its nuclear energy expansion slows. Japan is also expected to import LNG from south-east Asia, other Middle East producers and Alaska. There has been talk of developing gas supplies from the Russian Far East.</p>

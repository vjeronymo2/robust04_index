			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Austria output falls by 8.2% Industrial output in Austria during December fell 8.2 per cent, confirming indications the economy lost momentum late last year, writes Ian Rodger in Vienna. In November, industrial production was down 2 per cent year on year, according to the government's statistical office. In December, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO) revised down its forecast of economic growth for 1993 from 2 per cent to 1.3 per cent; a WIFO official said this week that it would have to be revised downward again, perhaps to 1 per cent.</p>

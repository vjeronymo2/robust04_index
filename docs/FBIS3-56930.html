Not a term laid down by U.S. legislation  for the President's team, but the month for which the President  asked the Pentagon chief to continue carrying out his duties so  that the Defense Department would not be leaderless for a long  time following Aspin's resignation announcement. Wishing to  preserve continuity in armed forces leadership as well as the  combativity of his foreign policy team, a month ago Bill Clinton  picked a man who he regarded as a worthy replacement -- retired  Admiral Robert Inman. But a week before the U.S. Congress  resumed work (after the Christmas and New Year break) Inman  suddenly announced that he was turning down the post he had been  offered by Clinton.    If there were primarily political reasons behind Les Aspin's  resignation, caused by the secretary's disagreement with some  points in the President's course in both domestic and foreign  policy, then in Robert Inman's case it is all much simpler, and  more complex. Simpler because the retired admiral's reasons are  clear: He indicated his reluctance to tolerate the current  attempts in the press to sully his reputation, and it was not  inconceivable that the search for blots on his service record  would continue during the Senate hearings.    The difficulty in understanding Robert Inman's decision to  withdrawn from consideration for a federal government  secretaryship is due to such subtle matters as moral and ethical  purity and decency. That is, categories very difficult to  measure -- where do you find the relevant criteria? We know of  many cases where senior leaders, statesmen, and government  officials have continued to occupy their posts without batting  an eyelid even when beset by the gravest accusations. What  motivates them is their idea of duty to the people, to the  voters, and so on.    In fact, Inman is weighed down by considerations of moral  purity (strictly speaking, the accusations against him are not  that horrendous, particularly by our Russian standards -- merely  the tardy payment of Social Security taxes, not even concealment  of them). The admiral decided it was impossible for him to  weigh -- not on the scales of justice, but on the scales of  public opinion! -- the 30-year service record of a career in the  U.S. Navy and intelligence organs against the illusory benefits  of a secretaryship. Actually, he had admitted from the outset  that he had accepted President Clinton's offer not out of  ambition, and certainly not out of a desire for material gain.  Since his retirement Inman has had a pretty good life as head  of two electronics firms and then of the U.S. Federal Reserve  Service Bank in Dallas. A top-class professional who worked at  the top of the Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security  Agency, and CIA under various administrations without any party  bias, he agreed to take the Pentagon post entirely out of duty  to the country and the people.    So Les Aspin has not yet left the Pentagon building on the  banks of the Potomac. He will be staying there until President  Clinton picks a new candidate for defense secretary. It is hard  to predict who it will be. But one can speculate about the new  secretary's tasks. That is because Les Aspin, who is the first  to leave the Clinton administration fold, during his spell in  office managed to map out the main path of development for the  U.S. armed forces over the next few years. It is hard to say to  what extent this tallied with his personal views and beliefs,  nonetheless the strategic guidelines determined by him are  unlikely to be radically revised. Ultimately they are dictated  by entirely objective factors of both international and domestic  political life. First and foremost there are significant cuts  in the armed forces' numerical strength and arsenal, a  substantial reduction in the military budget, and, of course,  against this background, the safeguarding of a high level of  readiness of troops and naval forces for actions in defense of  U.S. national interests and for participation in multinational  peacemaking actions.</p>

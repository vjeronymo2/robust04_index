			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Leading Article: Value for money The disclosure in today's Financial Times of a report sharply criticising the use of external consultants by UK government departments is another example of poor value for money in the public sector. Spending on these outsiders, according to five scrutineers from the Cabinet Office, is often not properly identified in accounts, financial thresholds vary and contract terms are needlessly complex and inconsistent. Most alarming of all, though, is the finding that departments and government agencies could only identify Pounds 10m of savings to offset against the Pounds 565m paid to external consultants in 1992 - 93. While the report certainly demands a firm Whitehall response, it will also make salutary reading for private sector companies which form the bulk of consultants' client base. Most of the criticism is directed at ministers and public servants, but the conclusions will be read by some as an indictment of a profession with a poor image. That would be a pity. Management consultants are open to rebuke where they charge extravagant prices for simple off-the-peg solutions, or train junior staff at clients' expense. Their fees sometimes look like easy pickings - especially where they are invited in by companies which have already decided on a particular course of action but require the independence of an external agent to implement it. At this time of change, however, senior managers are more than ever in need of a detached point of view to help them set strategic goals, handle delicate 'downsizing' programmes, or upgrade their information systems. Consultants are playing - and will continue to play - a helpful role in the UK corporate sector's regeneration. One lesson of yesterday's report is about the responsibilities that lie with the client. Consultancy will almost certainly be money down the drain unless management is positive about the idea of external intervention, is determined to grasp the opportunities or resolve the problems which may be identified, clearly defines the goals at the outset, checks that the knowledge and expertise being hired is not already available inside the organisation, and forms a good working relationship between the insiders and outsiders working on the project. Ensuring that the outcome matches the goals - and establishing a value for money audit - are equally elementary procedures. Yesterday's report highlights contradictory attitudes within government: 'an attitude of suspicion and mistrust of consultants' in some corners of Whitehall on the one hand, and a seemingly naive faith on the part of some ministers that significant projects automatically require endorsement by outside consultancies on the other. The same mix of emotions can probably be found in the private sector: a more sensible assessment lies somewhere in the middle.</p>

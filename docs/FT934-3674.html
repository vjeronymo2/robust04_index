			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Roman Catholic shot in Belfast A Roman Catholic man was shot dead on the doorstep of his east Belfast home last night. The man, in his late 30s, answered a knock at the door of his home and was shot at close range by a lone gunman, the RUC said. The attacker made off on foot through the predominantly protestant area. The victim was taken to hospital but died soon after admission. There was no immediate claim of responsibility although the police said it bore the hallmarks of a loyalist sectarian attack.</p>

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses lower after unhappy afternoon Nuclear threats to Germany and Japan made by the Russian right-wing leader, Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, based on an old interview according to North German Radio in Hamburg, were reported as news early yesterday afternoon and not clarified until later. Bourses ended the day much less buoyantly than they began, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was marginally higher at one point but it saw the DAX fall 22.78 to 2,149.97 on the official session, and slide further to an Ibis-indicated low of 2,128.07 at the end of the post bourse. Turnover eased from DM9.4bn to DM9.2bn. Mr Thomas Nolten, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said that, at least in the morning and early afternoon, the market was using the Russian elections as an additional excuse to mark stocks down, and that short-covering in recent days had left the market with little resistance to small investment selling from German holders. US investors, said Mr Nolten, were out of the market, having driven the DAX through the 2,000 and 2,100 levels. That said, foreign investment favourites were particularly weak at one point or the other: Schering, the pharmaceuticals stock, was DM47.50, or 4.2 per cent lower DM1.073 on the session and Mannesmann, which peaked at DM401, closed DM8.50 below that at DM391.50 in the London afternoon. Elsewhere, profit-taking hit the banking sector with Commerzbank most prominent, fall DM9.50 to DM382.50 on the session and another DM3 to DM379.50 after hours. PARIS blamed profit-taking ahead of the expected Gatt agreement, programme selling from the US, and nervousness over Mr Zhirinovsky as the CAC 40 index dropped 39.81, or 1.8 per cent to 2,156.50. Mr Michael Woodcock, of Nikko Securities, was cautious over the Gatt deal and the apparent French victory on the film and television front, noting that Canal Plus, involved quite heavily in film production, fell FFr29 to FFr1,270 on the day. Big blue chips were hit later by Russia worries, Elf Aquitaine losing FFr16.70, or 4 per cent at FFr410.10. Elf's fall also reflected the government's decision to keep a golden share, and the veto, after its privatisation. ZURICH was unable to maintain its early momentum and the SMI index, which had posted record highs for the previous four sessions, shed 9.1 to 2,864.8. However, turnover was low, with a virtual absence of foreign demand. Analysts commented that lower interest rates still held the key to the market's further advance, suggesting that some investors were becoming uneasy about the impact of the strong local currency on corporate profits, particularly of the exporters. Blue chips were mostly lower: Nestle, the most active stock dipped SFr2 to SFr1,252. A SFr12 rise to SFr730 in Swiss Re certificates was attributed to recent changes in the capital structure. Baloise registered shares firmed SFr25 to SFr2,585 in response to the insurer's statement that it may raise the dividend. Georg Fischer, planning to close a loss making German subsidary, added SFr40 to SFr1,030. MILAN was subdued by technical considerations ahead of today's end of the monthly account, but the the Comit index managed a 3.32 rise to 591.77. Fiat continued in good form with a L41 rise to L4,355 attributed to investors focusing on prospects for 1994. Credito Italiano was steadier after Monday's profit-taking which followed the sharp post-privatisation surge. The shares eased L8 to L2,342. A L59, or 3.0 per cent to L1,499 in Olivetti was attributed to profit-taking. AMSTERDAM finished a quiet session at the day's lows in response to the weakness of Wall Street's opening and Frankfurt's late trading. The CBS Tendency index shed 0.6 to 139.3. ISTANBUL jumped 4.6 per cent in heavy buying, reversing four days of falls. The composite index added 798.3 to 18,143.5 as buyers were drawn back by the lower prices, and in reaction to an easing of lira overnight rates. ATHENS continued higher, bullish sentiment following the success of recent new issues continuing to feed the market: Aktor, the construction company was 267 times subscribed last week. The general index added 13.84 to 936.90.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by a Defense Ministry spokesman in Tirana </F> on 21 January; read by announcer -- recorded]    [Text] The newspaper KOHA JONE published an article today  with the bombastic headline "Massive Disarmament of the Albanian  Army," written by Martin Leka. This newspaper has published  such articles before with the aim of slandering and dismantling  the Army. Today's malicious article is false and does not  represent the reality in the present process of strengthening  and modernizing the Army.    We can neither speak nor think about the disarmament of  officers. The integration of our Army into the democratic  society we are building requires that officers, while in the  garrison, be properly equipped. When they leave the barracks or  training facilities to go into the city, they are citizens.    We are presently working to administer, preserve, nurture,  and maintain armament and military equipment according to  international standards. This is also an experience of all NATO  countries that apply the same practice. The suppositions and  insinuations for a drastic shortage and incidents on the part of  officers are as provocative as they are malicious.    With these lies and slanders, irresponsible correspondents  want to create panic, a shadow of doubt, dissatisfaction, and  division in the Army and among the people. However, Belgrade's  lackeys and their notorious newspaper KOHA JONE, enraged by the  achievements of our Army, especially the very successful meeting  with a U.S. Defense Department delegation, and, as it seems,  financed by Belgrade, are doing everything in their power to  reduce the value of the Albanian Army, which is certainly  progressing toward its uninterrupted strengthening.    The attacks by Enverists, Belgrade's lackeys, and other  antinational elements against the Army and national defense will  fail. The order in question is based on Law No. 74-96, dated 3  July 1991, Article 4 of the Law on Arms, and Decree No. 74-49,  dated 5 January 1991, as well as the order by the general  commander of the Armed Forces of the Republic No. 01, dated 13  May 1992, on the improvement of the performance of service in  inhabited centers.    Based on current law, the defense minister has the right to  issue orders and instructions on the maintenance,  administration, and preservation of armament and other military  equipment. These acts constitute a military secret. The  revelation, publication, and propagation of these acts are  convicted by law. For this reason, the defense minister has  initiated legal proceedings, says the Defense Ministry spokesman.</p>

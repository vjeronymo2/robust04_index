			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ion Cristoiu commentary: "Mircea Snegur Awakens Us to </F> Reality"]    [Text] At the end of last week, the attention of Romanian  press and political circles focused on the shocking statements  made by two of the leaders of the Republic of Moldova regarding  relations with Romania. The contents of their statements are  already known from the press. During a [5 February] meeting  organized within the current electoral campaign by the Civic  Alliance, an organization that supports, both in its political  and cultural activity, the president of the Republic of Moldova,  Mircea Snegur, stated that one should distinguish between what  is Romanian and what is Moldovan. Elaborating further on that  idea, the leader of the Democratic Agrarian Party of Moldova  [PDAM], Dumitru Motpan, at an electoral meeting held in the  locality of Cantemir, pleaded against the Republic of Moldova's  union with Romania, suggesting that the union should rather be  accomplished merely with a part of Romania, namely with Moldavia  [Romania's north-eastern region, bordering the Republic of  Moldova]. The two statements came as a surprise from many  points of view. First, because since that republic has gained  its independence, in August 1991, this has been the first time  that the Chisinau leaders have categorically rejected  unification with Romania. However, one cannot say that before  there have been no signs warning of the anti-unification stance  of these politicians, and, generally, the representatives of the  state power in the Republic of Moldova. Those signals have  actually intensified lately, parallel to the increasing pressure  from Moscow, intended to resurrect the former USSR. Although  the substantial economic, cultural, and moral support granted by  Romania was entirely accepted, the Chisinau authorities were  quite prudent, not to say awkward, in their public statements  made when receiving the gifts. One could clearly see that both  the president and the government were trying hard not to  irritate Moscow by advocating too extensive ties with Romania.  Even the "brotherly" meetings of Snegur and [Romanian  President] Iliescu were treated with a certain distance by the  Chisinau leaders. While the pro-presidential Romanian press  commented with lyrical enthusiasm, offering full-page reports  about the two presidents' bearhugs and kisses, the Chisinau  press and television viewed the same events with much more  coolness. This is how, lately, a kind of feeling was created, a  quite embarrassing one for us, Romanians, that the open  acknowledgment of our brotherhood is inconvenient for the people  across the Prut River, and that the process of tightening  Romania's ties with the Republic of Moldova is progressing owing  to our insistence, rather than that of the Chisinau leaders.  Nevertheless, this has been the first time that the union with  Romania has been rejected publicly in such an imperative tone,  and, especially, betraying an inexplicable anger against the  Romanians living in Romania.    Second, Snegur's and Motpan's statements are also shocking  because they reproduce, almost word by word, the Soviet stance  regarding the relations between Moldova and Romania. The thesis  according to which a Moldovan nation does exist, and that,  besides the citizens of the Republic of Moldova, it also  comprises the people that live in Romania's Moldavia, was one of  the theses that were most insisted upon by Moscow during the  time of the Ceausescu regime. Moscow used it as an instrument  not merely to discourage any tendencies favoring the  unification, but also as means to exert political and military  pressure [upon Romania]. Both the way in which it was  formulated and its logic indicated that the official Soviet  propaganda was using that thesis as a reason justifying a  possible military attack against rebel Romania.    Bucharest made great fuss about the statements of the two  Moldovan leaders. Political leaders representing all colors  expressed their indignation and engaged in fiery polemics with  Snegur and Motpan. They referred to [shared] culture and  history and they tried to find the real reasons behind the  statements of the Moldovan politicians. According to certain  opinions, we have to deal with two traitors who betrayed the  Romanian cause and sold their souls to Moscow from the very  beginning. According to others, the authors of the statements  are heroes who are willing to play this anti-unification role  precisely to safeguard the chances of unification, assuming the  risk of being considered traitors. As with so many other  complicated cases in history, we will probably learn much later  about the real reasons behind the statements made in the  Republic of Moldova. Until then, however, one thing remains  certain. The statements in question were made under the  circumstances of the electoral campaign in progress in the  Republic of Moldova. Unfortunately, that is a detail that  passed totally unnoticed by Romanian journalists and  politicians. Had they discovered its importance, the reasons  why Snegur and Motpan declared that they reject unification  would have faded to a fact of secondary importance. Because  what matters primarily is the fact that the statements were made  for electoral purposes. As is well known, all electoral  campaigns in political systems that allow for free ballots are  dominated by the candidates' efforts to anticipate the frame of  mind of the electorate. That is why all statements made during  electoral campaigns have a specific character. Intended to gain  as many electors as possible, they usually exaggerate the  assumed expectations of the electorate. That is why many of the  things stated during electoral campaigns are never implemented  after the elections are over. Thus, the stance adopted by the  two Chisinau leaders actually reflects the current public frame  of mind in the Republic of Moldova. Obviously, if the great  majority of the population would have favored unification with  Romania, no one could have afforded to make statements clearly  rejecting unification. Even the two politicians in question,  even if they had been bitter enemies of unification, would not  have merely avoided publicly rejecting it, but rather, they  would have even pleaded in favor of unification.    Even if that would have meant acting against their inner  convictions, they would have still been compelled to do so to  gain more votes. The fact that, at the peak of the electoral  campaign, Snegur and Motpan insisted on distancing themselves  from the cause of unification proves that, in reality, the  current public mind in the Republic of Moldova is against the  unification. Regardless of their private convictions regarding  the reunion of the country, the two politicians considered it  necessary to speak up against it in order to please the  electorate. Actually this is the most grave significance of the  statements made by Snegur and Motpan. In spite of the illusions  nurtured in Bucharest, they come to demonstrate that the great  majority of the population in the Republic of Moldova opposes  the unification.    Many people living on our side of the Prut River will  probably be astonished by such a frame of mind in Bessarabia.  Their astonishment is absolutely understandable. The issue of  Bessarabia has been preoccupying the Romanians not only  recently, but rather over the last several decades. Since 1944,  when Bessarabia was lost again [to the benefit of USSR], none of  the politicians or journalists has seriously examined the  psychological and moral state of the Romanians living across the  Prut River. During the communist regime, even in the Ceausescu  era, it was impossible to publicly approach that issue. News  about the state of mind of the Romanians over the Prut River  could merely be conveyed to the Romanians living in Romania  through underground channels. However, the use of that channel  inevitably led to the creation of a false image. During the  [Gheorghe] Gheorghiu-Dej era [late fifties, early sixties], that  image was influenced by the Soviet occupation [of Romania].  Hating that occupation, the Romanians had the impression that  the Russians prevented the Bessarabian Romanians from uniting  with us. Whoever dared talk about the fact that Bessarabia is an  ancient Romanian territory and that some day it might join the  mother country was exposing himself to deadly danger. Under  such circumstances, the fact that the discussion of the issue  was prohibited led to the following reasoning: The Soviet  occupation punishes the discourse on Bessarabia because the  Romanians on the other bank of the Prut River want to unite with  the mother country. That is absolutely false reasoning, because  it ignores the specific nature of the communist dictatorship,  namely that it always feels imperiled, even there where there is  no peril whatsoever. Actually, their prohibiting all  discussions on Bessarabia was not necessarily caused by the fact  that Moscow considered this the sole way to prevent the  unification of the Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova  with the mother nation. During the Ceausescu era, the false  image about the frame of mind of the Romanians across the Prut  River was nourished, as paradoxical as it may seem, by the  [Romanian] officials. Bucharest turned its conflict with Moscow  into a substantial political capital. Therefore it was quite  simple for it to hint at the fact that one of the reasons of  that conflict was precisely the issue of Bessarabia. As a  matter of fact, using the method of spreading misleading  information, the Securitate made enormous efforts to convince  the population that Nicolae Ceausescu would have liked to  achieve the unification, but could not because of the existence  of the Soviet power. It is no accident that after December 1989  the forces that feel nostalgic about Ceausescu began to  circulate the thesis according to which the fall of the dictator  was caused by the fact that, by the end of 1989, he had pointed  the issue of Bessarabia at Gorbachev. Unfortunately, in spite  of the past four years' climate favoring the freedom of opinion,  the position of the Romanians across the Prut River could not be  approached with sufficient lucidity either. Once a prohibited  subject, the issue of Bessarabia has become the favorite issue  of journalists and politicians. Under such circumstances, as a  reaction to the preceding situation, it was absolutely normal  that they would exaggerate certain facts in the Republic of  Moldova. In that sense, it is more than significant that  thousands of pages of minor lyrical writings have been dedicated  to the brethren across the Prut River and to their impetuous  struggle to reunite with the mother country. At the same time,  the issue of Bessarabia has also become the object of intense  political demagogy. The issue of unification has been used in  every conceivable way by all our political parties. While doing  so, no one seemed to care whether they really wish to unite with  us. As in the preceding period, it was inferred that the  Romanians living in the Republic of Moldova were impatiently  looking forward to their unification with the mother country,  but, alas, the realization of their dream was blocked by  Moscow's imperial policy.    However, a more lucid analysis would reveal clearly the  fact that current reality in Moldova is much more bitter than  the illusory things believed by Romanian public opinion and the  image offered by our political and journalistic demagogy. As  demonstrated by Snegur's and Motpan's recent statements made  during the electoral campaign, the Romanians across the Prut  River are not at all impatient to reunite with us. The causes  of that frame of mind are complex and profound. Their  exhaustive analysis would exceed 100 pages. That is why we will  briefly mention just a few of them, hoping that the day will  come when our journalists and politicians will approach the  reality in the Republic of Moldova with much less sentimentality  than they have until now. One of the causes is doubtlessly the  frightening Russification process the Romanian population across  the Prut River has been submitted to. That process did not  confine itself, as might be thought, merely to a communist-type  propaganda, pounding the people's heads, day in, day out, with  ideas about the existence of a separate Moldovan nation and the  Romanians having invaded their land. Russification was also  carried out by using more subtle propaganda methods. Thus,  using manifold channels, they nourished their sentiment of  belonging to a superpower. As paradoxical as it may seem, over  many years Russian imperial vanity did matter a great deal to  many Romanians. The fact that the Red Army posed a threat to  all of Europe and the Soviet Union was a superpower made them  believe that they could be as proud of it as the Russians.  After all, the Republic of Moldova was part of the superpower  called the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Russification was also  carried out by turning pro-Russian gestures into criteria for  deciding on an individuals' political and professional ascent.  It was enormously important, not just for one to become a boss,  but also to be admitted to university, to be married to a  Russian or to be able to speak Russian and know the Russian  culture perfectly. In the beginning, the Romanians complied  with these things with a certain duplicity. Little by little,  however, they adopted, without really meaning to, many elements  of Russian spirituality. Under such circumstances, in spite of  the odes written and recited in Chisinau or the statements made  by a handful of people belonging to the minority of  intellectuals, many Romanians living in Bessarabia view Romanian  spirituality, that is, actually their own spirituality, as  something that is strange to them. They consider reunification  with Romania not just as an act that is difficult to achieve  politically, but also psychologically and intellectually.    Normally, the statements made by the two personalities  should  have awakened us to reality. Unfortunately, as anyone can see  from the stances adopted by our journalists and politicians,  they did not manage to do so. Our illusions regarding the frame  of mind of the Romanians in Bessarabia still persist. And this  might have extremely grave consequences, even for the great  cause of our reunification.</p>

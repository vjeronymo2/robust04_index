			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Arts: Monkey business at the zoo - Television I confess to having initially felt sceptical about The Ark (BBC 2, Tuesday), Molly Dineen's four-part documentary of which the final episode will be screened next week. Even as a neighbour, the Zoo's fate had left me fairly cold beyond wondering in an idle way how much longer I will be able to watch gratis, from the canal path, the crazy gallops of the Arabian oryxes. It seemed that the elephant-traps were baited for any film-maker embarking on a documentary about the Zoo which has been staring down the barrel of a gun for two decades. Its imminent closure has generated a huge amount of press coverage right up to the eleventh hour, which is where the Zoo currently is. What could a necessarily out-of-date film about the zoo's travail possibly achieve? I have been confounded: The Ark has turned out to be a splendid example of documentary making at its most subtle and rigorously controlled. The dramatic pace is fierce, starting with the opening minutes showing the miserable anxiety of keepers, one third of whom faced the sack, to next week's final programme which will cover the inconclusive putsch of spring 1992. Not one trap has Ms Dineen fallen into. Few things lend themselves more to kitsch than shots of apparently mournful orang-utangs gazing round well-loved premises soon to be vacated for ever . . . And yet, the animals are kept on a tight leash and never allowed to steal the show, either from the human denizens of Regent's Park or from each other. Last night's episode focussed on the arrival of two new Giant Pandas. After a brief shot of the male panda tumbling winsomely about, we were back with the meat of the matter, what the zoo-people thought. To the marketing people, the giant pandas are a mini-boom to be milked for soft-drink promotions and for the momentary upturn in gate-money. To the young keeper in charge of invertebrates, a mission to breed the last members of a tiny species of snail is no less valid than the sentimentalised conjunctions of pandas. As London Zoo's Director David Jones negotiates between the German and Chinese authorities as to what should be done with any progeny of the happy couple, the Young Turks give their views. They see the brouhaha over pandas is merely another example of the world-wide hype and hypocrisy about saving species. 'The panda is a political football'; breeding pandas, we were told, is not in fact difficult if only governments would agree to pool their pandas. The Ark is, of course, a metaphor for Britain in the last 20 years, with the pandas rather neatly playing the role of the marriage of Charles and Di. Meanwhile, rot eats deep into the bowels of the Mappin Terraces and the aquarium. At the end of last night's programme, a group of academic Fellows of the Zoological Society (which legally owns the animals) has formed a secret compact with the more intellectual keepers. Their aim is to throw out the management team and derail its painfully-implemented survival package for the Ark. The irony of course is that these very keepers were the ones we saw in the first programme successfully reapplying for their jobs and for promotion because they were presentable, ambitious types, the kind of people who ought to relish being 'empowered' by running their own budgets. Next week's final episode sees the trap being sprung and the sympathetic Director failing to ride the tiger. For all that, of course the Ark has continued to drift but after Dineen's excellent series, who could remain wholly indifferent to its plight? Horizon; No Ordinary Genius (BBC 1, Monday) was a straight-forward exercise in hagiography, yet none the worse for that. Scientists know about the physicist Richard Feynman, who died in Los Angeles in 1988. They know about him partly for his achievements over an extraordinary breadth of fields, but partly too because of his whacky character. For many non-scientists, however, the name Feynman meant little beyond, perhaps, recalling that he was a Nobel prize-winner. At first it seemed a little over the top to devote two programmes to Feynman, but not by the time the time it reached the point where he was taking on NASA as the outsider, the loose cannon, on the Challenger Inquiry. At this time, Feynman was already seriously ill with the cancer which eventually killed him at the age of 69. We could have heard a little more about the zaniness of this free spirit, his infinite thirst for horse-play which is part of the scientific legend. However, the programme's real strength was the reminiscences of Feynman's scientist colleagues, quietly spoken men through whose words we got not only a vivid impression of the tireless genius of the man they admired, but also of the compulsion, even the sheer aesthetic pleasure, which drives the best scientists in their quest for understanding of the universe. 'Enough was enough. Armed force was out. Marxist agitation was in.' Timewatch, BBC 2's fortnightly history programme, last week dealt with the origins of the Provisional IRA. It aimed to be dramatic. Staccato commentary, to convey the drama. Not many dates. The result was banal. Like a tabloid newspaper. Pity really. The Sparks That Lit the Bonfire ought to have been a cracker, with notable interviews with leading Irish politicians in power at the end of the 'sixties, members of the Republic's armed forces who brought the guns and money into Ulster, and the men who watched the IRA split. As it was, the commentary was unbearably vague and silly, and matters were not helped by interventions from a terrible folk-singer. 'History took a fatal turn.' Quite so, but let us hope the same is not now henceforth true of the Timewatch series. Lack of editorial rigour seriously undermined BBC 2's lavish and long series, The Trouble with Medicine (Thursdays). Each programme strays hither and yon in its travels around the developed world. What should be a polemical inquiry into whether high-technology medicine regularly loses its way. This week The Magic Bullet was as prone to side-tracking as the rest. Fairly irrelevant to the grand theme were the Spanish herbalists frustrated by the law in their efforts to peddle concoctions of leaves. Ludicrously so was the encounter session, or some such gathering, of middle-class American women who we saw weeping (literally) over the sins of the big, nasty drug industry. What a very damp squib to lob at the drug manufacturers.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Davis Service Group 29% ahead to Pounds 10.9m Pre-tax profits at Davis Service Group increased by 29 per cent from Pounds 8.47m to Pounds 10.9m for the first six months of the year as the business services company reported a moderate upturn in trading. The headline figure was boosted by profits of Pounds 783,000 arising from a property disposal. Without this, the rise in underlying profits was 19 per cent, similar to the increase in turnover, which improved to Pounds 151m (Pounds 128m). Earnings per share of 7.51p compared with 6.51p last time, although adjusted for the property disposal, earnings were 6.74p, a rise of 3.5 per cent. A good proportion of the increase came from a full interim contribution from HSS Hire Services, which Davis bought 15 months ago. Mr George Boyle, finance director, said that otherwise the company's divisions had seen only a gradual improvement and that the recovery remained patchy. Elliott Group, which provides portable building units, showed sales slightly ahead, and Mr Boyle said the division's steel manufacturing capacity was being strengthened. In the linen hire business, firmer occupancy rates in the London hotel market were offset by weakness in the provinces. Workwear was also proving a tough environment. The support services arm, which undertakes cleaning and catering contracts, was affected by margin pressure, due mainly to government employment legislation in the public service sector. The interim dividend is increased to 2.87p (2.73p). Mr Boyle said he anticipated last year's final dividend of 7.98p would be maintained.</p>

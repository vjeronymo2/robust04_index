			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lyon, France, March 22 (AFP) -- Thousands of  students resumed anti-government demonstrations on Tuesday [22  March] after a day of violence on Monday in which 20 police were  injured and 57 people arrested in two French cities.    In Paris Tuesday, students protesting government plans to  cut  the minimum wage for young people climbed on railway tracks and  held up a train. Students blocked another train at Ferte  Bernard, western France.    A thousand students began demonstrating in this eastern city  on Tuesday and 1,000 at nearby Saint-Etienne.    Another 1,000 blocked a road bridge at Valence, stopping  traffic. Smaller demonstrations took place at Bourgoin-Jallieu  and Vienne, and in the Alps, at Chambery and Annemasse.    The worst violence occurred Monday night at Nantes, western  France, when several hundred youths fought for three-and-half  hours with riot police.    The youths, who moved in after a peaceful student  demonstration, hurled rocks and bottles at police. They  retaliated with tear gas and charged the attackers.    Twenty police were injured, authorities said, one of them  seriously when a paving stone broke his jaw, and 17 people were  arrested.    The violence broke out after a rally by 4,000 called to  protest alleged police brutality at an anti-government protest  last week. The youths set fire to garbage bins, ripping down  billboard posters and raiding construction sites for wood to  keep the flames burning.    In Lyon 40 young people were arrested after youths and  police  swapped stones and bottles for volleys of tear-gas. Forty shop  fronts were smashed and many cars seriously damaged, authorities  said. No one was reported hurt.    On Tuesday Interior Minister Charles Pasqua warned of the  risk of "serious incidents," adding "Anything can happen. We  can't send in the police against children of 13 and 15."    In Paris on Monday, trade union leaders held meetings with  Labour Minister Michel Giraud to discuss details of concessions  he offered to students last Friday, but they said they were  still unhappy with the changes.    But Giraud went ahead with the plan Tuesday, publishing a  decree which stated that young people with diplomas or  university decrees would be paid 80 percent of an ordinary  salary for 80 percent of working time, with 20 percent of  training. No qualified youth would be paid less than the  minimum wage, the decree said.    The independent trade union Force Ouvriere called  publication  of the decree "a provocation."    Initially, the government's scheme proposed that all youths  be paid 20 percent less than the minimum wage of 5,900 francs  (1,000 dollars) a month.    Hundreds of thousands of students and labor union supporters  staged protests last week all across France to denounce the  government plan, designed to fight France's record unemployment.  A national protest has been called for next Friday.    France has 3.3 million unemployed -- almost 12 percent of  the  work force -- of whom more than 750,000 are under 25.</p>

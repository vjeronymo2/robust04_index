While most people in a society with no democratic traditions  were not ideologically prepared for democracy, so were unsuited  to it, particularly the upper levels who were anxious about it,  the push toward democracy had already become a fact, leaving the  only possibility being to retreat to a second line of defense  and consider its rate of advance, which was logical.    In the course of drafting the Basic Law, the crux of the  political-system controversy was over whether democracy would  occur "fast," "slow," "more," or "less." During my time with the  Basic Law Drafting Committee in Guangzhou, I had responded to a  Hong Kong reporter's question on democrats and conservatives  that: Hong Kong's democracy dividing line is one of radical or  moderate democracy, not of democracy or conservatism (without  remembering the specific words, this was my general idea). But  this controversy certainly evolved into an intricate and complex  dispute between China and Britain and between China and Hong  Kong, becoming so complicated and confusing that it was hard for  the public to see the true facts.    China had designed Hong Kong's political reform pace  according to Deng Xiaoping's thinking on "general elections"  "proceeding step by step," which Britain had later essentially  accepted in [then Hong Kong governor] Wilson's public version of  "advancing gradually in due order," which Deng Xiaoping had  immediately endorsed publicly. This "advancing gradually in  due order" was a substitute term for "proceeding step by step."    Most democracy radicals were in the middle and lower-middle  levels of the middle (middle bourgeoisie) stratum, who were  calling for equality of upward mobility politically,  economically, and as to human values. Such calls gave no cause  for much criticism, as they needed to be designed into the  political system within the democratic framework of the Basic  Law needing to consider them. And most democracy moderates were  in the upper and middle-upper levels of society, quite a few of  whom had originally not endorsed a democratic political system,  but had later seen that democracy was unavoidable, so were  forced to meekly submit, while still being concerned about too  much or too fast democracy. The drafting of the Basic Law set  off new hopes that democracy would protect vested interests, or  even bring greater benefits and new enjoyments politically,  economically, and as to human values. So the "proceeding step  by step" or "advancing gradually in due order" principle for  practicing a democratic political system, gave consideration to  both democracy radicals and moderates, striving for a compromise  to reduce unrest.    But the varying degrees of mobilization of the various  social  strata was also a problem.    The situation in Hong Kong at the time was that while some  in  the upper, middle, and grassroots levels already had democratic  political and government aspirations, most people had not yet  been organized. But the lower and middle level's organized  "pressure groups" had already appeared in embryonic form.  During the Sino-British talks, all social forces, mainly the  middle level's lower-middle strata, organized various new social  groups, which gradually began to collaborate.    My own internal analysis at the time was that: The  situation was much like that of the initial inland anti-Japanese  struggle, in which various elements had organized guerrilla  forces, with those possessing a few guns acting as "commanders,"  and "commanders sprouting up like weeds" for a time. These  guerrilla forces grew, with the large eating the small, and the  strong gobbling up the weak, to gradually merge into a large  guerrilla force, and even into a "regular" army. And this group  development in Hong Kong could also take a similar path to grow  into a political party.    But as most of the upper bourgeoisie had not yet awakened,  while the middle and lower strata had already gone into action,  society lacked organized checks and balances.    As to Li Hou's proposal that the future Hong Kong SAR  Government practice "the separation of powers," this was based  mostly in Western nations on political-party politics, with  multiparty elections and majority-party rule. As these  governments had majority-party support in congress, they could  ensure that their political orders were passed. But Hong Kong  had no political parties, with the big and middle bourgeoisie  essentially not yet having organized. Even if they had  organized, it would have been hard to achieve the right climate  in a short period of time. Meanwhile, the democracy radicals  representing the middle and lower social strata were organized  in embryonic form (after the 4 June incident, the democracy  radical forces did certainly further expand to appear in a  political party form). I estimated at the time that the  continuation of this could very likely lead to a general  situation before 1997 of one-party legislation, with antagonism  after 1997 among the Chief Executive, the administrative sector,  and the Legislative Council, making it impossible or hard to  pass any bills, leaving nothing of the Hong Kong  administration's original efficiency, and touching off  political, social and internal-administration turbulence.  This meant that the "separation of powers" plan was out of  line with Hong Kong's realities. Before long, on 16 April  1987, Deng Xiaoping publicly disagreed in a meeting with the  Hong Kong [Basic Law] Drafting Committee with the "separation of  powers," showing that this idea of Li Hou and others did not  conform to the Central Government spirit.    Li Hou and Lu Ping also publicly stated at the time that  they  did not approve of the emergence of political parties in Hong  Kong. This [the emergence of political parties in Hong Kong]  was also out of line with Deng Xiaoping's thinking and Hong  Kong's realities. So when reporters asked me about Li Hou and  Lu Ping's statements, I could only respond that "those are their  personal views."</p>

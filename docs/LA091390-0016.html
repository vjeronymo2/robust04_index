			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Miss Pennsylvania, Hello: Talk show host Larry King apologized Tuesday for  saying Miss Pennsylvania Marla Wynne was the ugliest contestant in last week's  Miss America Pageant. King, a judge at the Atlantic City, N.J., pageant, had  said Monday Wynne did a "great ventriloquist bit" but that "the dummy was  prettier."  </P> <P> King said he spoke "in jest with no intention to offend."  </P> <P> Barry Buzz: Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry took his wife, Effi, to lunch  in a rare public appearance on Primary Election Day Tuesday, the day the city  began the process of electing his successor. Publisher Bill Regardie came over,  and Barry complimented him on his flashy tie, and Regardie took off the tie and  gave it to the mayor.  </P> <P> Stop the Presses: Barbara Bush praised Kitty Dukakis' autobiography, "Now You  Know," which chronicles the Massachusetts First Lady's struggle with drugs and  alcohol. Bush noted Dukakis' honesty: "I think she would have made a great  First Lady."  </P> <P> Roast: Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro joked that labor,  education and women's rights leader Mildred Jeffrey should write a book on her  "love-tough" activism and call it "Millie Dearest." The 78-year-old former auto  union leader, who was "roasted" in Detroit Monday, helped engineer Ferraro's  nomination. Former U.S. Rep. Bella Abzug laughed when a union official said:  "Wind up a Millie doll and she would hand out petitions . . . a Millie car  would . . . automatically steer for the nearest convention or meeting."  </P></p>

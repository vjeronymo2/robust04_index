			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's </F> ambassador to the United States, by Drora Perl, in his  Washington office `this week']    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Perl] How do you sum up  your first year as Israel's ambassador to Washington, and how do  you view the current situation compared to that of a year ago?    [Rabinovich] What is important is not that I have been in  this post for a year, but that it is the first anniversary of  the Clinton administration and Israel's relations with this  administration. I prefer to look at it that way.    It was a very good year for these ties, springing from the  administration's basically friendly approach and the  understanding formed between the two states on the peace  process. It is true that the understanding began in the final  months of the Bush administration, but it could not find  expression then because the administration was fighting  unsuccessfully for its political life.    Another factor is the chemistry, or the good relations,  between the President, the secretary of state, and other senior  officials in the U.S. Administration, with Israeli leaders. It  could perhaps be exemplified by the fact that when Foreign  Minister Peres visited Washington last week he almost did not  have to deal with bilateral issues, since these are being dealt  with and their situation is fine. That is perhaps the best way  to describe the relations at the end of the Clinton  administration's first year in office.    [Perl] What bilateral issues are you referring to?    [Rabinovich] A year and a half ago there was confrontation  over the loan guarantees and the aid was put into question. Up  to several months ago there were still restrictions on  technological cooperation between the two states, which did not  permit us to compete in the U.S. market. The current situation  is that we have received a package of aircraft -- F-14A's and  F-16's -- following the prime minister's visit here in November,  the refurbishing the Air Force's working fleet, the replacement  of its spearhead, and I can go on and on.    [Perl] Can we say that the main contributing factor is the  presence of a sympathetic administration which is ideologically  closer to the present Israeli Government, or to the existence of  the peace process, or to some combination of the two?    [Rabinovich] It is a symbiotic process in which the basic  sympathy and common outlook on the peace process and the fact  that the Middle East is viewed as one of the areas of success  for the administration's foreign policy, are all aspects which  feed on each other. You can perform an intellectual exercise  and try to give more importance to one of the elements at the  expense of the others, but I do not see any point in it.    [Perl] Is there a single component within the framework of  relations that makes up the backbone, and if it becomes  problematic then the entire system becomes problematic?    [Rabinovich] No, I think that one of the secrets of the  success of the special relationship between the United States  and Israel is that it is a basket containing various things, so  that even when part of the system does not function properly at  various times, it manages to survive thanks to its other parts.  There were times when the Pentagon or the White House were  friendlier than the State Department or the other way around,  and there were times that Congress was considered Israel's  safety net in the bilateral ties. The Jewish community is, of  course, a permanent asset. The international situation keeps  changing. In the '50's, for example, at the peak of the Cold  War, Israel was considered a burden. During the late '60's and  '70's it was an asset. Every time there was a dominant element  and other elements which had an impact on relations. That is  one of the secret of their charm.    [Perl] Assuming he is confirmed as deputy secretary of  state, how do you see Strobe Talbott's role in the peace process  and relations with Israel in view of the initial jarring notes  concerning his nomination?    [Rabinovich] His position (to date he has been the State  Department's ambassador-at-large for Russia and the former  Soviet republics -- author's note) should be given the same  importance that is attached to the role Dennis Ross plays in our  region. Talbott was successful in his job as a regional expert,  and a man who has been successful in one region should be  expected to do the same in another region or in another job. I  expect Dennis Ross to continue playing a leading and decisive  role in the Middle East, while Talbott sees to general  organizational and policy matters in the State Department, not  necessarily pertaining to the Middle East.    Clearly, the deputy secretary of state will also deal with  the Middle East, which is a key issue in the administration's  foreign policy. However, I believe that Secretary of State  Warren Christopher and Special Ambassador Dennis Ross will  continue to do most of the work in this region.    I do not want to make any personal comments about Talbott,  who is in the midst of a hearing and confirmation process.  However, I can say that our paths crossed in the year that he  has been doing this job and our work together was very pleasant  and effective.    [Perl] Upon assuming office, the Clinton administration  described its role in the peace process as that of a "honest  broker" or a "full partner." The description has not changed,  but the substance has. First there was an attempt to terminate  the separate rounds of negotiations in Washington and treat the  talks as one package, and now we are back to rounds of talks.  The latest round was held on the level of delegation heads and  as far away from the media as possible. The Americans were seen  working behind the scenes. Has the administration's role  changed and, if so, how?    [Rabinovich] Obviously, the role changed because the process  and circumstances changed. Clearly, after the signing of the  Declaration of Principles in Oslo and the ceremony in Washington  the peace process is not what it was before.    Looking back, the members of the peace team did a lot of  work  on the Palestinian track last spring in Washington. Some of  this work contributed to the success in Oslo. Oslo cannot be  explained without Washington. The situation has changed because  the main talks on the Palestinian track are being held elsewhere.    The administration does not get involved because it does not  want to become an arbiter between the Palestinians and us.  However, both sides update the administration and keep it in  the picture.    The administration is more active today on the Syrian track  than on the Palestinian one. As the peace process makes headway  and agreements are attained, I expect there will be other  developments and work procedures will change.    Indeed, the administration is no less involved today. The  President himself became involved in the Syrian track when he  met al-Asad in Geneva.    [Perl] The Americans submitted their own draft proposals on  the Palestinian track. Should we expect them to do the same on  the Syrian track?    [Rabinovich] They did that only when the sides solicited it.  We do not yet need it at this point, and the Americans will  definitely will not impose themselves by submitting compromise  proposals. [passage omitted]    [Perl] During his visit here last week, Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres mentioned for the first time that in view of "the  exorbitatnt price" the Syrians are demanding for peace, he  expects them to bring most of the Arab world into the circle of  reconciliation with Israel. Is this a new element in the  negotiations with the Syrians?    [Rabinovich] It is not a new element, but a new emphasis; by  way of making the best of a bad deal. In other words, if the  Syrians claim they are the key to a comprehensive agreement and  if they claim, quite justifiably, that they have influence over  other countries, a breakthrough with Syria should be expected to  lead to a reconciliation or to peace with most of the Arab world.    The Americans will definitely want to be involved in such a  process. They know about this idea, they think it is an  excellent one, and they will be happy to help.    [Perl] Has it been raised in the talks with the Syrians?    [Rabinovich] Not yet.    [Perl] Has al-'Allaf heard about it?    [Rabinovich] He most certainly has, seeing that it was  voiced publicly. However, it is too early to discuss it. We  will be able to discuss it in a more concrete manner when we are  closer to attaining an agreement. [passage omitted]    [Perl] Vice President Al Gore termed the meeting between  Clinton and al-Asad "a huge breakthrough." Dennis Ross said  this week that it was not a breakthrough but only "a beginning."  What caused the "amendment" of the U.S. assessment?    [Rabinovich] I believe perspective is a wonderful tool. Now  everybody sees Geneva in a different perspective.    [Perl] Was the reassessment caused by the death of al-Asad's  son, owing to the fact that it may have held up developments in  the aftermath of the meeting?    [Rabinovich] I do not think Basil's death changed the way in  which the Geneva meeting is seen. The effect of this  development cannot yet be assessed by anybody.    In the meantime, we have discussed the Geneva meeting with  the Americans. It is no secret that we were less enthusiastic  about it than the Americans. Now, with a perspective of three  weeks, they see it as the beginning of something rather than as  the middle or end of something.    [Perl] The negotiations resume next Tuesday. What can we  expect in the 13th round of talks with the Syrians?    [Rabinovich] President Clinton stated this week that Syria  must demonstrate its willingness and the seriousness of its  intentions with regard to peace with Israel. He was referring  to the so-called public diplomacy which should be part of the  negotiations.    The fact that the President made such a statement definitely  carries weight. The Syrians are not indifferent to what the  Americans say.    I definitely do not live with a sense of urgency. The  Syrians must elaborate on their position concerning the two  issues currently on the agenda: the security arrangements and  the time factor.    [Perl] In short, how would you sum up this past year and  what do you yourself wish for your second year?    [Rabinovich] I end this year with a good feeling. We made  many small steps as well as a major breakthrough. I would like  to see another major breakthrough this coming year.</p>

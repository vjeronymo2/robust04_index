			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / The Lex Column: Unravelling bonds There is something perverse about the weakness of European bond markets. Inflation is well under control in the main European economies. The continental recovery has barely started, while in the UK a sizeable output gap remains. The weak oil price hardly indicates general concern about inflation. The nervousness obviously reflects worry about the New York bond market, but that is only part of the story. There has also been a shift in sentiment among the large US hedge funds, which until recently have given bond markets an upward momentum of their own. Their leverage means they cannot afford much capital loss. It was time for them to start worrying when yields stopped falling at the turn of the year. The risks became all the greater after the Federal Reserve began to tighten. Since then, a vicious circle appears to have developed: the more bond prices fall, the more they are forced to sell. Such fickle investors may have deluded governments about the ease with which their deficits could be funded. Now comes the question of who will step into the breach. Domestic European investors show no real signs of selling, but they are reluctant to buy bonds yet because, probably rightly, they believe prices could fall further before the hedge fund sales are absorbed. Once the immediate storm is passed, judiciously timed cuts in short-term interest rates would help continental markets. That would encourage investors to shift out of time deposits, replacing some of the US liquidity which has evaporated. It would be a pity if the Bundesbank were constrained by a false concern that the bond market has been sending a message about inflation.</p>

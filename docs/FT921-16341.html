			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Money Markets: London rates ease MONEY market rates eased during the day as sterling held its own in the foreign exchanges. However, some nervousness at the close in London appeared to be due to uncertainty over the pound's long-term stability. The key three-month interbank rate reflected the general relief in the markets, edging lower to 10 3/4 - 5/8 - only marginally above the current 10.5 per cent base rate. The March short sterling contract also indicated a belief that rates will be held, standing at 89.35 in late trade. At this level, the market feels rates will remain the same for the immediate future. The Bank of England also pushed down lending rates in the money markets by offering to take a large chunk of the forecast Pounds 1.25bn shortage out before noon. In early operations, the bank bought Pounds 544m of Band 1 bills at 10 3/8 per cent, Band 3 bills at 10 7/32 per cent, and Band 4 treasury and bank bills at 10 1/8 per cent. It also offered a Pounds 730m 10-day repurchase agreement. Lending costs fell as low as 7 per cent after the bank's actions. However, when the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.45bn, lending rates shot up to 11 per cent. The bank stepped in with late assistance of Pounds 40m and overnight rates settled at 10 1/2 - 1/4 . The official reserve figures published yesterday indicated that the bank had been fairly subdued as far as intervention was concerned. After accounting for British Telecom receipts, interest payments, and Gulf receipts, the reserves suggested that the bank had intervened to the tune of about Dollars 180m in December. However, dealers were quick to point out that some of the intervention may come from deals done in previous months. In the US, Federal funds were trading at 4 3/8 per cent, above the Federal Reserves presumed target of 4 per cent. Dealers said year-end pressures and high treasury balances were behind the upward movement. In Germany, the Bundesbank offered a tighter than expected repurchase agreement - indicating that there would be no easing of monetary policy for some time. Liquidity did not appear to be a problem, however, and call rates held at 9.5 per cent. Dealers said the Bundesbank's minimum liquidity requirement for January was likely to be well below December's DM75bn.</p>

			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Indian budget for business ROLLING BACK decades of central, bureaucratic control in India is a huge task. The government of prime minister P. V. Narasimha Rao began it last year, under the stimulus of a balance of payments crisis. With foreign exchange reserves now restored, this year's budget was to provide the evidence that the attempt at reform was both serious and for the long term. A great deal was at stake when Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, unveiled the 1992-93 budget on Saturday. The government's determination to press ahead with reform is impressive. Dr Singh's budget has moved faster in some areas than might have been expected, and more slowly in others than might have been hoped. But the overall direction is clear: Dr Singh has maintained momentum. The opening of the Indian economy to the world has been accelerated. Tariffs are now to be cut, modestly at first, but with a commitment to bringing them down to levels comparable to those of industrialising developing countries. Dr Singh has taken a big step towards the dismantling of the licence 'raj', by removing licence requirements from most imports. His move towards rupee convertibility has also come sooner than expected. Financial markets Dr Singh's financial reforms seek to balance the diminishing role of the state by stimulating the flow of private capital. His measures - including removal of government control over stock issues, exemption of financial assets from wealth tax, indexing of capital gains for inflation, and considering permission of direct portfolio equity investment by foreign institutions - are good news for India's financial markets. In its encouragement of private enterprise and competition, this amounts to a radical budget. There are areas in which more explicit progress would have been desirable. Though the reduced role of government is unmistakeable - the reduction of the budget deficit from 6.5 to 5 per cent of GDP means general cuts in subsidies - the government has still to tackle the grossly overmanned and inefficient public sector: both state industries and the bureaucracy. Policy on closure of chronically 'sick' industries has advanced only a little, with allocation of capital for a National Renewal Fund. It continues to proceed cautiously on privatisation, selling only minority stakes and providing little incentive for improvements to their management and efficiency. Banking reform, urgently needed to underpin change, has only been partially addressed. Job losses Evidently, the government has not deemed it politically safe to take measures potentially causing large job losses when the economy is already suffering from measures taken last year to tighten liquidity and restrict imports. Economics and politics could yet derail the government. The biggest economic risk is that inflation will not fall as the government projects, forcing a renewed tightening of monetary policy. Hitting the targets for both higher growth and lower inflation would certainly be an achievement. Politically, Dr Singh is treading in a minefield, as was shown last week, when he was attacked for purportedly discussing budget secrets with the World Bank. The opposition parties, which so far have not had the will to unseat a government confronting problems that they would otherwise have to face, have recently been sharpening their teeth. Wholehearted support within the governing Congress party, which has overseen most of the years of central control and socialism, cannot be taken for granted. Yet Mr Rao and Dr Singh are engaged in nothing less than the transformation of India and the sloughing off of the fears left by colonial domination. A very long road lies ahead. It is in India's interest that they be allowed to continue upon it.</p>

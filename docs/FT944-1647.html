			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Equity Markets: News round-up - Copenhagen In a week largely bereft of results elsewhere, Denmark will have half-year results today from Danisco, the food and beverages, food ingredients and packaging conglomerate, and Radiometer, the medical measuring equipment maker. Daiwa Europe notes that Danish shares dropped in November for the fourth month running, but nearly reached stability after more pronounced weakness earlier. 'These declines, combined with an upward revision of our earnings projects, bring Denmark into the reasonable range of multiple valuations for 1995 and 1996,' Daiwa said.</p>

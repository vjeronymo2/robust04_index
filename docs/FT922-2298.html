			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash market were mostly unchanged yesterday, even though the Bank of England forecast a shortage in the morning that was smaller than dealers had expected. Rates remained unchanged because the shortage, initially forecast at Pounds 700m, proved difficult to remove. Many of the Bank of England's previous repurchase agreements are expiring this week, and the end of the second quarter is also approaching. As a result, many market practitioners require short-dated paper on their books for liquidity purposes. The authorities are unwilling to offer the short-dated repurchase agreements that the market would like, however, perhaps out of fear that this might misrepresent their policy on base rates. Instead the Bank continued Monday's practice of offering to buy the shorter dated Bands 1 and 2 at 9 7/8 per cent, Band 3 at 9 21/32 per cent and Band 4 at 9 19/32 per cent. Yesterday, the Bank bought Pounds 15m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 1m of Band 4 bank bills in the early round. Later, it purchased Pounds 13m of Band 1 bank bills, Pounds 37m of Band 3 bank bills and Pounds 5m of Band 4 bank bills. The forecast was revised down to around Pounds 550m at the start of the afternoon. The Bank bought Pounds 4m of Band 1 treasury bills and Pounds 257m of Band 1 bank bills, and provided late assistance of around Pounds 80m. One discount house trader said the Bank may have misjudged how 'sticky' the market still was when revising down the shortage so much in the afternoon. The overnight rate was still up at 11 1/2 per cent towards the end of trading. One-week sterling libor ended firmer at 10 1/2 per cent, one-month money stayed at 10 1/16 per cent and 3-month money closed at 10 per cent. Trading in sterling futures had a more bullish tone, possibly because the market was influenced by suggestions in two tabloid newspapers that the British prime minister was considering an early cut in base rates. September short sterling traded up 9 ticks to close at 90.25. December short sterling also traded up 9 ticks to end at 90.54. Both movements suggest that the market is back to believing there could be a half-point cut in base rates before the end of the year.</p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: SOLUTIONS TO INTESTINAL PROBLEMS  </P> <P> The advertising is delicately phrased in terms like "intestinal irregularity."  But a rose by any other name is still a rose, and constipation, however  discreetly described, is constipation. In this country, easing the problem is a  booming business. Over-the-counter remedies sell like hot cakes, even though  some carry risk of side effects.  </P> <P> Just as mouthwash, soap and deodorant ads can cause hitherto unconcerned  consumers to worry if their breaths or bodies don't smell fresh enough,  manufacturers of products to step up bowel activity may encourage us to  question whether we are as "regular" as we should be. If not, they hope we'll  turn to laxatives or stool softeners for relief.  </P> <P> But is the concept of "normal" bowel activity a valid one? And when  difficulties do occur, are drugs the solution? In both cases, the answer is not  always yes.  </P> <P> Now, a recent large-scale study under the leadership of Dr. James P. Everhart  of the National Institutes of Health, has gathered new and useful information  about our bowel habits. Two nationwide surveys, encompassing more than 10,000  people, were conducted 10 years apart in order to learn about bowel function  and how patterns changed over time.  </P> <P> At the first interview, subjects were asked three questions:  </P> <P>  -- Do you have trouble with your bowels that makes you constipated or gives  you diarrhea?  </P> <P>  -- How often do you usually have a bowel movement?  </P> <P>  -- During the past six months, have you used any medicine, drug or pills for  bowel trouble?  </P> <P> At the second interview, the first two questions were repeated and two more  asked:  </P> <P>  -- How often do you use a laxative or stool softener?  </P> <P>  -- Which of the following best describes your usual bowel movement: Normal,  loose or watery, or hard and very firm?  </P> <P> Findings revealed that women were more likely than men to report constipation  and infrequent bowel movements -- defined as three or fewer per week. Older  people who reported constipation were more prone to use stool softeners or  laxatives than were younger subjects who said they were constipated. Indeed,  the proportion who said at both interviews that they used bowel medication  increased from about 28% among the youngest group to nearly 58% in the oldest.  </P> <P> But -- perhaps because they did use these products -- older individuals also  were less likely than younger ones to have infrequent bowel movements.  Researchers noted that whites were more likely to have daily bowel movements  than were blacks (73% versus 64%). The reason for this finding remains  unexplained.  </P> <P> Impaired bowel function was associated with several factors, among them lower  educational level, depression and decreased physical activity. No link to fiber  consumption was identified, except at the extreme low end of intake, and then  only among men. Bowel functioning was unrelated to relative fatness, coffee and  tea consumption, smoking habits and, among women, to the number of children  they had or use of estrogens.  </P> <P> Statistics are interesting, but how do they apply to you? The first -- and  perhaps most important -- point is that "normal" does not necessarily mean  daily bowel movements. According to the study, many of us do not have daily  bowel movements. Yet a much smaller number reported constipation at both  interviews. Thus, normal bowel function spans a broad range, anywhere from two  or three movements a day to as infrequently as once in three days.  Constipation, therefore, must be understood in terms of what is normal for you.  </P> <P> As for the failure to find an association between fiber and bowel function,  that may well be explained by the generally low-fiber intake of the study  population. It does not mean that fiber isn't helpful in promoting normal bowel  functioning. Rather, ample evidence suggests that generous amounts of fiber --  in the form of fresh and lightly cooked fruits and vegetables, whole grains and  dried legumes -- contribute to maintaining a healthy bowel. So too does  drinking large amounts of fluid, as much as six to eight tall glasses a day.  </P> <P> Practically speaking, one of the most crucial revelations of this study was the  relationship between physical activity and bowel function. Sluggishness,  headache, a bloated, gassy feeling and general abdominal discomfort, as well as  hard feces that are difficult to pass, are symptoms that may not be  life-threatening but can cause a general malaise.  </P> <P> The link between impaired bowel function and low levels of physical activity  (which, in other studies, has been strongly associated with depression) is just  one more reason to exercise. In other words, if your bowel is sluggish, maybe  you need to exercise.  </P> <P> We suggest that people who worry about constipation conduct their own study.  Ask yourself three questions:  </P> <P>  -- What bowel-activity pattern is normal for me?  </P> <P>  -- Am I eating fiber-rich foods and drinking plenty of liquids?  </P> <P>  -- What is my exercise level?  </P> <P> By thinking in these terms, you may be able to work out a solution that lets  you skip a trip to the drugstore.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Putting Potatoes in Cold Storage  </P> <P> Question: My daughter saw me taking potatoes out of the refrigerator and  informed me that it was not the correct way to store them. She couldn't tell me  why I was wrong, just that I was. I've always kept them there to avoid  sprouting. Can you comment?  </P> <P> Answer: At refrigerator temperatures, the starch in potatoes gradually converts  to sugar. When cooked, potatoes with a higher sugar content tend to darken.  </P> <P> Control of the conversion of starch to sugar is important commercially, where  the optimal ratio of starch to sugar depends on how the potato is to be used.  For example, if it's going into a prepared food such as canned hash or beef  stew, the high temperatures used in processing could cause changes in flavor  and color.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if some browning is desirable, as in frozen French fries or  hash browns, then there must be enough sugar to allow the outsides to brown  without extensive heat. Similarly, the light brown color of potato chips is  dependent on adequate amounts of sugar. If sugar content of the potatoes rises  too high, though, the chips can burn or become too dark. In order to achieve  the correct sugar concentration, potatoes are sometimes stored under controlled  conditions for as long as three weeks.  </P> <P> But let's get back to your kitchen. You can minimize risk of sprouting by  storing potatoes in a cool, moist (but not humid) environment and by buying  only as many as you can use within a reasonable period of time.  </P> <P> Sprouting does not render potatoes unsafe. Just break or peel off the sprouts  before cooking.  </P> <P> Q: Our daughter recently visited a nutritionist who claimed that just by  looking in her eyes he could tell she was allergic to all dairy products and  wheat. He said if she didn't cut out these foods, then eventually she would get  colitis. He prescribed a B vitamin complex, an herb combination and a calcium  supplement. He charged only $5 for the exam, which made me wonder if he was on  the up-and-up or if he just gives these exams so he can charge a fortune for  the vitamins.  </P> <P> A: Your suspicions probably are right on target. From what you describe, he is  basing his prognosis for your daughter on some variation of pseudoscientific  practice sometimes called "irilogy." It's true that checking the eye, including  the iris, can be an important part of health examinations that go well beyond  the eye itself. However, irilogy carries the use of the eye for diagnosis to  unreasonable limits.  </P> <P> You mentioned that the supplements were expensive. That's not the only issue.  Safety is another. Some B vitamins can be toxic if taken in large doses for a  period of time. Similarly, the safety of herbal preparations depends on what  they contain and in what amounts. Most herb teas, for example, have not been  tested for safety.  </P> <P> But perhaps most important is that this man has placed your daughter on a  restricted diet for no scientifically acceptable reason. If your daughter does  have symptoms that suggest allergies, she may want to discuss them with her  physician. He or she may, in turn, refer her to an allergy specialist, who is  trained to make an accurate diagnosis and, if he finds an allergy, suggest a  diet plan.  </P> <P> Q: Is buckwheat the same as bulgur wheat?  </P> <P> A: No. Bulgur is a lightly processed form of whole wheat produced by  parboiling, drying and then breaking the whole-wheat kernels. It may be soaked,  seasoned and eaten without further cooking, or it can be cooked with broth as a  pilaf. It can also be cooked with water and served as breakfast cereal. Many  people like to add yogurt, dried fruits or nuts to it. In a Middle Eastern  version of meat loaf called kibbe, bulgur is mixed with ground lamb.  </P> <P> Buckwheat, on the other hand, is not a true grain cereal. As with bulgur, the  whole seed -- called buckwheat groats -- can be cooked and eaten by itself. But  it is often combined with noodles. In this country, most of the buckwheat we  consume is processed into flour and used in pancake mix.  </P> <P> When cooked, both buckwheat groats and bulgur are calorically similar,  providing about 200 calories per cup.  </P></p>

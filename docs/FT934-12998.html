			<p>931023 FT  23 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Mixed pickings in region as Nikkei revives THE decline of the yen against the dollar boosted the high-technology sector, and share prices gained ground on buying by arbitrageurs and financial institutions, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 average rose 85.41 to 20,264.83, an advance of 0.5 per cent on the week. The index opened at the day's low of 20,223.82 before rising to a high of 20,377.84 during the morning session. Volume rose from 228m to 317.2m shares, clearing the 300m level for the first time in five days. Gainers led losers by 605 to 400, with 180 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed 17.53 higher at 1,663.09 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 0.61 to close at 1,305.49. Traders said that active buying deterred investors, who had expected share prices to decline, from selling. In spite of the yen's fall against the dollar, foreign investors also refrained from selling shares. High-technology stocks were strong. Hitachi rose Y13 to Y863, Matsushita Electric Industrial Y30 to Y1,490 and Sony Y100 to Y4,900. Arbitrage buying supported banks. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y60 to Y3,340 and Sakura Bank gained Y30 to Y1,720. Brokers were also higher ahead of interim results, announced after the close: Nomura Securities rose Y40 to Y2,000 and Daiwa Securities gained Y50 to Y1,400. Pharmaceuticals, which had been strong recently on new drug developments, were among the few losers on the day. Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical fell Y20 to Y2,350 on profit-taking, while Dainippon Pharmaceutical lost Y30 to Y1,210. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 131.73 to 22,216.95 in volume of 29.8m shares. Export oriented stocks, including the electronics sector, were strong because of the weaker yen. Roundup EXCITEMENT, stagnation and retreat were all in evidence in the region yesterday. NEW ZEALAND hit another four-year high in thin and volatile trading dominated by buying in Fletcher Challenge. The NZSE 40 index closed up 10.71 at 2,098.11, 1.2 per cent higher on the week. FCL rose 12 cents to NZDollars 3.89, and turnover fell to NZDollars 46m from some NZDollars 70m. MANILA took profits on some blue chips and switched to second-liners, but the composite index still rose 13.53 to a new high of 2,260.99, 3.9 per cent higher on the week. TAIWAN climbed by 2.2 per cent in heavy trade on buying of speculative stocks by major participants, hopes for an interest rate cut and a good profit announcement by Cathay Life Insurance. The weighted index ended 85.28 higher at 4,052.38, 0.7 per cent up on the week, in turnover up from TDollars 19bn to TDollars 33.2bn. BOMBAY closed higher on short-covering by speculators after carry-forward costs were fixed at 1.75 to 2.25 per cent a month - lower than anticipated. The BSE index ended 37.0 higher at 2,720.0. HONG KONG continued the correction that began after a 3.1 per cent gain on Monday. The Hang Seng index closed 163.36, or 1.8 per cent, lower at 8,719.32, just 0.5 per cent down on the week, as turnover slowed further to HKDollars 5.60bn against HKDollars 6.84bn. Recently buoyant utilities were hard hit, with China Light losing HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 50, China Gas 70 cents to HKDollars 17.70 and Telecom 40 cents to HKDollars 15.50. AUSTRALIA saw big business in major banks, particularly ANZ and Westpac, and a lower gold sector, but the All Ordinaries index ended a mere 1.0 higher at 2061.4, 0.6 per cent down on the week, in turnover of ADollars 408.4m. Among banks, ANZ was up 7 cents at ADollars 4.07, Westpac 10 cents higher at ADollars 4.26 and CBA up 9 cents at ADollars 9.85. NAB slipped 8 cents to ADollars 12.38.

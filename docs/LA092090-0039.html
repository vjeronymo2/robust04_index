The developers of the mall, convinced that they could attract  such a store to the site, left space for it and included it in the project's  environmental analyses.  </P> <P> Had no store been wooed to the center, the space would have been used for an  office tower.  </P> <P> Bullock's announced its intention to locate a store in the mall earlier this  year, but because the company wanted it to be larger than had been planned, the  City Council was required to amend the project's original plan. The changes  include reconfiguring an adjacent parking structure and enlarging the project  by 115,354 square feet.  </P> <P> Through some creative financing, the city will end up paying Bullock's  construction costs with increased tax revenues and rental payments.  </P> <P> According to city documents, Bullock's will build the store at its own expense  but will sell it to the Haagen Co., the mall's developer, for no more than $33  million, the expected cost to Bullock's.  </P> <P> The city in turn will acquire the store from Haagen in return for a $33-million  promissory note that will be paid with a combination of rent from Bullock's,  sales tax revenues from a portion of the mall and a portion of increased  property taxes on the mall. If the city still owes money to Haagen in 2016, all  debts will be forgiven.  </P> <P> In addition, the city will pay for an $18.5-million parking structure with  increased tax revenues from the project.  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Steven Helvey said such deals are not uncommon.  </P></p>

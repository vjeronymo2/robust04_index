			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / International Company News: Soros joins Dollars 1bn fund investing in Asia Mr George Soros, the US investor and speculator, yesterday joined Peregrine Investments, a Hong Kong-based merchant bank, in the launch of a Dollars 1bn fund to invest in Asian infrastructure projects. This is the second fund in less than two weeks with which Mr Soros, who helped force sterling out of the European exchange rate mechanism in 1992, has been associated. At the end of January he partnered GE Capital, the financial services arm of America's General Electric, in arranging a Dollars 2.5bn fund to invest in power projects in the developing world. The Asian Infrastructure Fund will invest in power generation, transport projects and telecommunications systems in Asia and the Indian sub-continent. Peregrine said the fund had already identified potential investments worth Dollars 300m in China, India, Indonesia and three other countries. Mr Soros' partnership with Peregrine is a compliment to Mr Philip Tose, Peregrine's founder and chairman, who has built the brokerage into one of the most powerful forces in Hong Kong's and China's financial community. In addition to Mr Soros, who manages the Quantum Group of funds, the International Finance Corporation, the private finance arm of the World Bank, the Asia Development Bank, the Manila-based multilateral bank, and Frank Russell Company, a financial adviser, will contribute to the Dollars 400m to be raised for the fund.</p>

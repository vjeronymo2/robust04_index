			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> FESTIVAL BALLET BRINGS ASHTON 'ROMEO' TO MET  </P> <P> There are "Romeos" and there are "Romeos."  </P> <P> When it comes to Prokofiev's epochal ballet about Shakespeare's star-cross'd  lovers, numerous images spring to mind. For some it must be the ageless Galina  Ulanova floating with innocent passion through an ornate facsimile of Leonid  Lavrovsky's original Bolshoi production -- an achievement happily preserved on  film.  </P> <P> Others recall the romantic turbulence of John Cranko's version, as enacted  first by the Stuttgart Ballet and later by the Joffrey. Or the richly detailed  cinematic melodrama that Kenneth MacMillan concocted for the Royal Ballet and  subsequently revised for American Ballet Theatre.  </P> <P> The first "Romeo and Juliet" to be ventured by a Western company, however, was  Frederick Ashton's setting for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1955. Much admired  and yet quickly forgotten -- don't ask why -- it remained a staple of the  Copenhagen repertory for only a decade. Los Angeles saw it at Shrine Auditorium  in 1965.  </P> <P> Many authorities -- including Ashton himself -- feared this "Romeo" was lost.  Memories blurred with time, records proved faulty, notation dubious.  </P> <P> In 1985, however, Peter Schaufuss rallied the reluctant choreographer, then 81,  and some eager survivors of the original cast (most notably Niels Bjorn Larsen)  for a historic exhumation on behalf of the London Festival Ballet. New York got  to see the result Tuesday when the Festival Ballet -- soon to be renamed the  English National Ballet -- returned after a 10-year absence to open a two-week  engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House.  </P> <P> The result was, in many ways, a revelation. Ashton always was a man of taste,  restraint and precision. Luckily, he also was something of a poet.  </P> <P> Unlike his illustrious successors, he felt no need to treat "Romeo" as a  sprawling epic. He saw no need for verismo indulgences, for lusty harlot trios,  vegetable fights, prancing clowns or vast courtly maneuvers.  </P> <P> He preferred to focus on the plight of the central characters, stressing  lyricism over drama, intimacy over spectacle, abstraction over literalism. Most  important, he preferred to stress dance over surface theatricality.  </P> <P> He compressed the action boldly, and apparently had no qualms about cutting  bits and pieces from the magnificent score. Compared to Cranko and MacMillan,  Ashton may seem a bit cool, cautious and polite. That, however, makes his  interpretation no less poignant. On the contrary. . . .  </P> <P> This "Romeo" savors the virtue of intimacy, even in a 4,000-seat house, and  cherishes the order of classicism. The London production, with its stylized  designs by Peter Rice, honors the lofty Copenhagen model.  </P> <P> In the cool, hard light of 1989, the episodic structure may seem a bit dated.  Still, one can find timeless eloquence in the fluidity of the love duets, the  intricacy of the duels, the athleticism of the playful trios alloted the young  Montagues and the simplicity of the three tragic encounters in the Capulets'  tomb.  </P> <P> Although the Festival Ballet does not command the luxurious resources of its  more famous British counterpart, it serves Ashton with reverence, authority and  obvious conviction. At 40, Schaufuss is a manly rather than boyish Romeo, but  his noble ardor remains undiminished. Susan Hogard, his exquisite 21-year-old  Juliet, embodies vulnerable purity.  </P> <P> The nicely poised, not very British supporting cast is dominated by Maximiliano  Guerra as a splendidly dapper Mercutio and Nicholas Johnson as an appropriately  sardonic Tybalt. Matz Skoog (Benvolio) and Patrick Armand (Paris) look like  incipient Romeos.  </P> <P> Lynn Seymour, MacMillan's most feverish Juliet, has come out of  quasi-retirement to vitalize the reasonable agonies of Lady Capulet. She is  paired with an elegant Lord who happens to be an old chum from the Royal  Ballet, Alexander Grant. Freya Dominic bumbles sweetly as the Nurse  </P> <P> The only weak link in the performance Tuesday involved the wayward playing of  an obviously under-rehearsed pit band. Under the circumstances, one didn't want  to blame -- or assess -- the conductor, Graham Bond.  </P> <P> The audience at the Royal Gala Performance included Princess Margaret, who is  about to yield her position as official patron of the struggling, peripatetic  company to the Princess of Wales.  </P> <P> It is worth noting that, according to press materials distributed at the  performance, the latter has "spoken of her desire to write and choreograph her  own ballet." It is a bracing prospect.  </P></p>

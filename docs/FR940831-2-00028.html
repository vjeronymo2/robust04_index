			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section IV (Estimated Percent Consumption by End Use): No substantial changes from the 1991 version are anticipated. Definitions and instructions will be enhanced to clarify possible ambiguities among the categories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section V (Establishment Checklist): There are three subsections in Section V: Part A. Estimated Square Footage of Buildings, Part B. Energy Management Activities, Part C. General Technologies, and other parts concerning specific technologies relevant only to selected industries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIA and the Bureau of the Census jointly conducted a survey of MECS respondents for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness and comprehensibility of certain aspects of the 1991 MECS questionnaire. The results of the survey relating to Part A indicate that most respondents could provide an estimate of the enclosed square-footage without major difficulty. Accordingly, the 1994 MECS questionnaire will ask for those estimates. Those respondents who would still prefer to give an estimate within a broad category will be given that option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list for Part B will be expanded to include participation in certain Federal government programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's ``Green Lights'' and DOE's ``Motor Challenge.'' Third party sponsorship will be separated from Self-only participation as a column-header.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part C, the checklist for energy-saving technologies, will be expanded to include specific cogeneration technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Prospective respondents and other interested parties should comment on the proposed revisions. The following general guidelines are provided to assist in the preparation of responses. Please indicate to which form(s) your comments apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential respondent:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Are the instructions and definitions clear and sufficient? If not, which instructions require clarification?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Can the data be submitted using the definitions included in the instructions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. Can data be submitted in accordance with the response time specified in the instructions?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Public reporting burden for this collection is estimated to average eight hours per response. How much time, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information, do you estimate it will require you to complete and submit the required form(s)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F. What is the estimated cost of completing these forms, including the direct and indirect costs associated with the data collection? Direct costs should include all costs, such as administrative costs, directly attributable to providing this information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. How can the form(s) be improved?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> H. Do you know of any other Federal, State, or local agency that collects similar data? If you do, specify the agency, the data element(s), and the means of collection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a potential user:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. Can you use data at the levels of detail indicated on the form(s)?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. For what purpose would you use the data? Be specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. How could the form(s) be improved to better meet your specific needs?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D. Are there alternate sources of data and do you use them? What are their deficiencies and/or strengths?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> E. For the most part, information is published by EIA in U.S. customary units, e.g., cubic feet of natural gas, short tons of coal, and barrels of oil. Would you prefer to see EIA publish more information in metric units, e.g., cubic meters, metric tons, and kilograms? If yes, please specify what information (e.g., coal production, natural gas consumption, and crude oil imports), the metric unit(s) of measurement preferred, and in which EIA publication(s) you would like to see such information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EIA is also interested in receiving comments from persons regarding their views on the need for the information contained in the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments submitted in response to this notice will be summarized and/or included in the request for OMB approval of the form(s). They also will become a matter of public record. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Statutory Authorities:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 2(a) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.

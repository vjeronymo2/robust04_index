			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) </F> leader Alfonso Dhlakama by Luis Nascimento; place and date not  given; followed by interview with Mozambican President Joaquim  Chissano by unidentified correspondent; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Alfonso Dhlakama is accusing the  international community of neglecting Mozambique. In an  interview with Luis Nascimento, he accuses President Chissano of  wasting public funds.    [Begin recording] [Dhlakama] I am not happy, I am not happy,  because my party does not have infrastructures a party should  have. What we are complaining about is the promises made by the  international community, as well as our Frelimo [Mozambique  Liberation Front] brothers, who have not provided us with the  buildings that they had promised and that are contained in the  Rome agreement that we signed. Therefore, I am not happy with  the aid, the promises, because it all has been restricted to  promises and they have not been followed up.    [Nascimento] Within this context, are you going to keep  contact? Are you going to continue holding regular meetings  with President Chissano?    [Dhlakama] Of course, of course. I will be discussing with  him, for example, one of the issues pending. I will remind you  that, at the first summit we held back in August last year, I  had proposed that he, as head of state, should accept the  setting up of an economic and social council that might include  Renamo, Frelimo, and other, unarmed parties. That council would  supervise or control the use of state funds and would monitor  all foreign investment and keep control over all the state  funds. The government, through President Chissano, rejected  this proposal. I am waiting for him to come back so we can  resume this discussion because I am not happy because I know  that the government is using state funds, state vehicles, and  state buildings for its political activities. Therefore, I do  not understand how, at a time of transition like this, Frelimo  continues to control all state funds and makes use of them for  its own campaigning.    [Nascimento] You have been quoted by international agencies  as having said that Renamo may at any time suspend the  confinement of its troops if this situation, these government  delays, continue. Do you maintain that threat?    [Dhlakama] Well, I could have done it already, because  Frelimo has confined very few of its troops so far. The only  thing is that if I did that, I would be helping Frelimo  implement its maneuvers. Therefore we do not want to help those  Frelimo tactics. That is why we have not yet suspended troop  confinement, but Frelimo continues to not confine its troops.  [end recording]    [Announcer] Those were the Renamo leader's accusations. We  then listened to the Mozambican president. President Chissano  stated he will be talking to the Renamo leader and everything  will be sorted out:    [Begin recording] [Chissano] Because those questions have  been raised by Mr Dhlakama, I will answer him and because he  talked to the press that way, I do not know whether he will ask  me about those problems in the same way, I do not know.  Therefore I prefer to talk to him since he wants to talk to me.    [Unidentified correspondent] And as far as the delays in  confinement, the alleged delays by the government?    [Chissano] Well, as far as satisfying your curiosity is  concerned -- and his too and I will answer him -- but if you  want to ask me then I would tell you that we are dealing with  those matters in the appropriate places. Before I left  Mozambique, I met Mr. Ayello and other members of the CST [not  further identified], and subsequently I met with my aides and  was pleased to observe that some measures are being taken for  the troop confinement process to be speeded up because, after  all, this is simply a technical issue, not a political issue.  Well, at the time, there was a slowdown, but there may be, and  there really is already, a speeding up, which may increase.    [Correspondent] If there is no change, Mr Aldo Ayello said  it  today himself, the UN Security Council may react against the  Mozambican Government.    [Chissano] Of course, of course. There may be. From the  moment you can see there is bad faith from the government, I  will find it legitimate for you to be concerned. So far, there  has been no sign of bad faith, and therefore I feel optimistic  that it will all go well. [end recording]    [Announcer] Mozambique has already entered its preelection  campaign.</p>

However, Ames was  the last of the Mohicans -- a leftover who miraculously survived  the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the former Soviet  secret services. This is Oleg Kalugin's opinion, a former KGB  man who no doubt is knowledgeable on the subject of spies, not  only in his capacity as one of Moscow's former agents in the  United States, but also because from 1973 to 1980 he was the  head of the KGB's counterintelligence section.    [Cucurnia] Do you really believe, General Kalugin, that  someone here in Moscow, perhaps among Primakov's deputies,  betrayed Ames?    [Kalugin] It is difficult to name or point my finger at  anyone in particular. However, I certainly cannot rule out the  possibility that someone within our services passed on the  information to the Americans, also because, clearly, only very  few people, at the highest level within our services, have any  knowledge of these matters. As soon as you consider this  business you are immediately led to think that there might be a  traitor among this very small group of people.    [Cucurnia] You do not seem to be all that surprised by what  has happened.    [Kalugin] On the contrary, I was rather surprised by it  because, frankly speaking, I believed that our network of agents  in the West had been definitively routed. You must take into  account that, between 1980 and 1991, the KGB experienced the  most difficult period in its history, not only due to the fact  that its officials were fleeing to the West, but also due to the  many arrests among those of our agents who had gone over to work  for the United States.    [Cucurnia] Yet the Ames case shows that some important  outposts survived.    [Kalugin] As I was telling you, I was the first to be  surprised. Let us not forget, however, that Ames was apparently  recruited in 1985, when perestroyka was in its infancy, and the  radical change in United States-Soviet relations was still to  come. Clearly, Ames was one of the last remnants of an epoch  that is now coming to a close.    [Cucurnia] Do you think that Gorbachev first, and later  Yeltsin, knew that they could rely on such a high-placed agent?    [Kalugin] When I worked for the intelligence service, we  used  to make regular reports to Brezhnev on our agents in the West.  We always indicated the duties they fulfilled and their rank,  but we never mentioned any names. I believe this practice has  not changed. It makes no sense to fill the president's head with  names which, in themselves, mean nothing to him.    [Cucurnia] However, over the last few years the United  States  and Russia have repeatedly exchanged friendly declarations. Do  you think that it is proper to use the citizens of another  country for intelligence purposes, or perhaps, as Clinton says,  it would be best to limit recruitment to your own fellow  nationals?    [Kalugin] Let us leave hypocrisy to one side. The United  States has never renounced espionage, much less so in Russia. I  see no reason why Russia should. However, the fact remains  that, unlike what used to happen in the past, nowadays  intelligence operations do not pursue subversive objectives.  Nobody today can assert that the CIA wants to weaken Yeltsin's  position. Rather, the contrary may be true. Espionage,  however, has always existed and always will, even between  friendly countries.</p>

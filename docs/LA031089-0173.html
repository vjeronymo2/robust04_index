Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> WOODLAND HILLS SCHOLARS COMPETE  </P> <P> Nine students from Taft High School in Woodland Hills are being grilled in  mathematics, economics, science, language, literature and fine arts in  Bakersfield today as they defend their title of Academic Decathlon champions  against 44 teams from around the state. If they win the grueling 2 1/2-day  state competition -- which includes personal interviews, essay writing,  prepared and impromptu speeches and oral quizzes -- they will compete in the  national championships in Rhode Island next month. After winning the state  championships last year, the Taft team came in second place at the national  competition.  </P></p>

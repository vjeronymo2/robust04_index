It is the Department's intent to enter into a HUD/Private Owner HAP Agreement and Contract. HUD will then enter into a contract with an HFA or PHA that has jurisdiction over the geographic area in which the project is located. For a fee, the HFA or PHA will carry out certain administrative or ministerial functions that otherwise would be the responsibility of HUD as the Section 8 Contract Administrator. Any administrative fee payable to the HFA or PHA will not exceed 5 percent of the published 2 bedroom Fair Market Rent for Existing Housing for the area and will be payable out of the Section 8 contract and budget authority reserved for each project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (L) Project Construction and Completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Project construction, completion and cost certification requirements are contained in HUD Notice 94&hyph;19.

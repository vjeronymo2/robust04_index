			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Mood lifts in EC-US public procurement row A POSSIBLE solution to the dispute between the US and the European Community over telecommunications and other government procurement contracts was raised by negotiators yesterday based on 'comparable, effective and lasting access' to each other's markets, and equal treatment to each other's exporters. Negotiators agreed after two days of discussions in Washington that the EC could exempt US companies from rules which discriminate in favour of EC bidders for procurement contracts 'if we have comparable access to the US market'. They plan to meet again in Brussels on March 11. The clash over public procurement flared last month after the new US administration threatened to bar European companies from bidding for federal contracts in the US unless European procurement regulations favouring local manufacturers were dismantled. It set March 22 as a deadline for EC action. EC officials conceded in Washington after this week's discussions that there were 'obstacles in the way' of US companies competing for EC procurement contracts, but insisted that the market was opening up, and 'serious trade is being done'. But they also insisted that systemic differences made it difficult for US officials to recognise the obstacles that existed for foreign companies to compete for US procurement contracts. Among these are 'Buy America' laws used in some federal contracts, and by 37 state governments in the US; special monopoly privileges under which companies such as AT&amp;T operate; and the arbitrary use of design standards to keep foreign companies at bay. 'We are trying to find out whether two systems which are completely different in design - ours based on rules and regulation, and the US system based on private sector competition - can produce comparable results in terms of market access for foreign companies,' said Mr Jorn Keck, who headed the EC negotiating team in Washington. In response to US arguments that large US private sector telecommunications operators such as AT&amp;T, MCI-Sprint, GTE or the 'baby Bells', should not be subject to procurement rules because they are not government run, Mr Keck said: 'We don't care whether a company is private or not. What really counts is not ownership, but government regulation, and whether a company has special or exclusive rights. 'When you look at AT&amp;T, you see they are operating under special privileges, under monopoly conditions. We need to look at their procurement behaviour because it is not what you would expect in a free market.' Officials say they have agreed a text from which to continue negotiations on telecommunications contracts.</p>

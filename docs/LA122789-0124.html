			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> OPENING POSTPONED OF 'ANNIE 2' SHOW  </P> <P> Things aren't quite right with "Annie 2: Miss Hannigan's Revenge" at the  Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, so the show's director, Martin Charnin,  has postponed tonight's official opening until Jan. 4.  </P> <P> Spokeswoman Tiki Davies for the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., said, "It's  a humongous show and there are some technical glitches going on. It's happened  in other shows, and we've got to work everything out. It must be smooth and  perfect."  </P> <P> The preview performances that began Friday will continue until the new opening  night, Davies added.  </P></p>

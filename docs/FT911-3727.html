			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Leading Article: Listening to employees ANYONE seeking a lesson in the most productive ways to manage workers would be unlikely to look first to Britain. Failure to engage the skills and commitment of workers effectively has been a longstanding problem for industry. In the 1970s, the symptom of this British disease was industrial action. In the 1990s, it is unemployment caused by inability to contain wage growth. Mr Michael Howard, the employment secretary, nonetheless believes Britain has a story to tell. He yesterday praised companies for promoting employee involvement. Instead of following rigid European practice, companies were finding their own ways of raising productivity through worker involvement. Mr Howard's point is that British companies are already addressing this tricky issue without having to be forced to do so by the European Commission. He suggested that the Council of Ministers accepts a vaguely worded endorsement of worker participation in place of the Commission's draft directive on European works councils. This would avoid large employers having to establish European consultation mechanisms. Part of Mr Howard's motive was no doubt political. The government has played on its resistance to what it regards as the Commission's plan to smother the Single European Market in the red tape of the social action programme. Mr John Major has less taste for such public carping than Mrs Thatcher, but Mr Howard believes he is on firm ground, given the undoubted hostility of British employers to the draft directive. Overblown rhetoric The political motivation accounts for some of the overblown rhetoric. Companies employing more than 1,000 people and more than 100 in at least two EC countries would no doubt find it irritating to have to pay for regular pan-European briefing meetings. Many might question their value, but the directive would hardly force them into full-blown co-determination. One reason why the fears appear exaggerated is the long history of the directive. It is a descendant of more ambitious attempts to impose worker participation, including the Vredeling directive of 1980. But its roots are misleading: the European Commission no longer sees itself applying the German model across the Community. Most of today's debate revolves around the entirely valid objective of increasing managerial effectiveness and corporate success. Code of practice Mr Howard could do more to catch this mood. For example a code of practice on employee involvement has already been drawn up by the Institute of Personnel Management and the Involvement and Participation Association. Mr Howard should consider endorsing it. But such signals of encouragement to employee involvement are the limit of what governments should do. Legislation is not the right way to define or enforce good management practice. This is as true of employee communication as it is of the structure of company boards or the planning of a production line. Inflexible models of how managers should inform workers will not increase good communication. Much of this legislative intent at the European level is, in any case, clearly outdated. Not only European governments, but US management consultants now preach the virtues of involving employees in production systems and quality control; wise managements keep workers informed and listen to what they say. Japanese team-working methods and quality circles are among the clearest pieces of evidence that worker involvement can bring a financial pay-off. The market is thus already deciding in favour of involvement. Changes in working methods to suit more complex production processes are already making it more difficult to sustain a clear divide between managers and the managed. This is something for governments to encourage if they want to achieve economic success. It cannot be imposed through inflexible legislation, no matter how well intentioned.</p>

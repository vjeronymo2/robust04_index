			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Portugal (1): Braced for a period of turbulence - In 1991, after five years of spectacular growth, the economy slowed down markedly. This was seen as an uncomfortable reminder that the country remains vulnerable to changes in the international environment IT HAS been an eventful year for Portugal. The big event was last October's general election, which gave the ruling Social Democrats, led by prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva, their second consecutive absolute majority, and ensured that the country would have another four years of political stability. But now that the sounds of cheering have faded and promises of the political campaign have been forgotten, Portugal is having to confront gloomier prospects as the pressures of European Community integration mount. After five years of spectacular growth, the economy slowed down markedly in 1991 - an uncomfortable reminder that Portugal remains highly vulnerable to changes in the international environment. Investment slackened, growing 3.3 per cent in real terms - less than half the previous year's rate - and exports stagnated with a further deterioration in the visible trade balance. At the same time, the crisis experienced by traditional sectors in the economy, especially textiles and agriculture, has deepened. A painful restructuring is inevitable in both sectors, and more growth and investment will be needed to provide new jobs. While an annual growth rate of 2.7 per cent - down from an average rate of 4.5 per cent in the previous five years - was by no means negligible and still above the EC average, it was not enough to push real economic convergence with the Community's richer nations significantly forward. Similarly, inflation declined from 13.4 per cent in 1990 to 11.4 per cent last year, but that still left Portugal with an inflation rate more than twice the EC average. All of which points to the difficulties ahead for Portugal, in this second more exacting phase of its European integration. As the new reality sinks in, public expectations are adjusting abruptly. In the public sector, discontent has erupted into strikes and demonstrations against government attempts to keep wage rises at levels compatible with its 8 per cent inflation target for this year. After some hesitation, the government agreed to a basic 10 per cent pay deal for public administration employees. This will mean an overall increase in the public sector wage bill of around 14 per cent. Employers in the private sector will find it difficult to offer anything less, and this will increase pressure on wages. Increases in value added tax and a 36 per cent rise in government current expenditure, announced in this year's budget, will also have an effect on inflation. Economists calculate that the VAT increases alone will add between 1 and 1.5 percentage points to inflation this year, and, most analysts believe inflation is more likely to be 9 to 9.5 per cent. This presents the government with its biggest challenge: how to bring inflation down and maintain a high growth rate, at a time when its main trading partners are in recession. It will not be easy. 'If developments in the outside world continue to be negative, it will be impossible to maintain growth,' says Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, governor of the central bank. Yet success or failure on both fronts will determine whether Portugal achieves its ambition to be among the first countries to participate fully in, and to enjoy, the benefits of European economic and monetary union (EMU) in the second half of the 1990s. Well before that, the escudo will have to be brought into the exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system, though this will prove difficult as long as inflation remains high. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its latest report on Portugal, suggests that such a move could help to bring down inflation and curb the country's economic imbalances; but the timing and manner of entry will be a nerve-racking and politically sensitive choice for the government. An early entry into the ERM would lock in the escudo at a level close to or above its present high value - which would not be welcomed by exporters, who complain that they are suffering already from high interest rates. To delay for too long would undermine the government's convergence strategy; while a devaluation, either before or simultaneous with ERM entry, would have inflationary consequences, run counter to official commitment to exchange-rate stability, and be politically embarrassing. Convergence also requires greater budget discipline, and the government aims to reduce its deficit gradually over the next four years, to bring it into line with the Community average set for the final phase of economic union. The 1992 budget aims to cut the deficit from 6.3 per cent of gross domestic product to 5.2 per cent. This will be achieved mainly through higher revenues, made easier by tax reform and improvements in tax collection. A new state-of-the-art computerised and centralised tax-collection system makes tax avoidance much more difficult, and will increase revenues 'at the press of a button', according to a senior tax consultant. Critics would like the government to cut back more energetically on its own expenditures, rather than rely primarily on monetary measures to control inflation - which shifts the burden of good housekeeping on to the central bank and the private sector. Interest rates have been kept high in order to reduce internal demand, but with limited results. Private consumption has remained buoyant, while industrialists say the policy penalises them in the face of foreign competitors who can raise money more cheaply outside Portugal. Mr Tavares Moreira says the central bank does not want to tighten monetary policy any further. Officials say the government cannot reduce expenditures when it has to meet co-financing commitments for EC-backed development projects, and when it must make a huge effort to improve education and welfare. EC funds have played a crucial role in helping to modernise Portugal's economy and infrastructures. Between 1986 and 1990, Portugal received about Es550bn (Dollars 3.9bn) in EC funds, representing 6 per cent of total investment. The amount of EC aid available to Portugal is likely to rise substantially when the Community's next financial package of funds and budget are agreed later this year, including additional resources from the new 'cohesion fund' for poorer EC members. Portugal has won agreement in principle for a reduction in the proportion of government co-financing for EC projects, but it will still face heavy demands on its own resources. Interest rates have began to fall, though, at about 19 per cent for prime customers and above 26 per cent for general credit, they remain high by international standards. 'Everything is cheap in Portugal except money,' complained the recent headline of a popular daily newspaper. Some banks have started for the first time to publish prime lending rates for their best clients, thereby helping to make the market more transparent, but rates are likely to remain on the high side for the foreseeable future. The main beneficiaries have been the banks, though they are likely to feel the pinch as nominal rates decline - leading to a contraction in financial margins - and as operating costs rise. High interest rates alone do not cause high margins, but for many years the banks ran what amounted to an unofficial cartel to protect respective market shares (with the government's connivance as the bulk of the banking system was nationalised). Such cosy arrangements are coming to an end. With the liberalisation of the banking system, the arrival of private banks and, more recently, the privatisation of many state-owned banks, competition has risen significantly. The establishment of a European single market in financial services beginning next January, is an additional incentive. 'We have entered a period of turbulence,' says the president of a leading private bank. The description could well be applied more generally, as Portugal faces its first real test since it joined the EC in 1986.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Holesov, south Moravia, March 15 (CTK) -- Czech  Interior Minister Jan Ruml said today he would take all  necessary steps to prevent Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, chairman of  Russia's Liberal Democratic Party, from staying in the Czech  Republic.    Zhirinovskiy is expected to arrive on March 20 for a two-day  visit. He was invited by Miroslav Sladek's Assembly for the  Republic-Republican Party of Czechoslovakia (SPR-RSC) earlier  this year, two days after Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said  he hoped the Russian leader would not come to the Czech Republic.    The Czech Republic has no visa requirement for Russian  citizens, and as a member of Russia's parliament Zhirinovskiy  may also avail himself of his diplomatic passport, so that no  legal obstacles exist to prevent him from entering the country.    Nevertheless, Ruml said he would look into other  possibilities. "In the law on foreigners' stays on Czech  territory there is a passage I will make use of. It states that  a visit can be denied for a year if, among other things, it is  absolutely necessary for the state's security, the maintenance  of public order, the protection of health, or the rights and  freedoms of others.</p>

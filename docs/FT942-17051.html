			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / NUM is told S Wales mine will close British Coal plans to close Tower colliery, its last deep mine in south Wales, on April 15, executives told union officials yesterday. It said the pit would be maintained until it is offered for sale in parallel with the privatisation of other mines later in the year. A pithead meeting will be held on Saturday at which Tower colliery's 200 miners will decide whether to appeal against closure through the industry's review procedure. This could delay closure by up to nine months, but a vote to fight the shutdown is unlikely. British Coal said that all contracted and anticipated demand for coal mined in south Wales could be supplied from other existing sources. Mr Tyrone O'Sullivan, secretary of the Tower NUM lodge, accused British Coal of closing the pit 'purely to get us out of the way for privatisation'. He said British Coal was offering Pounds 7,000 per man on top of redundancy payments - the extra payment would be withdrawn if the men decided to go ahead with the review procedure. South-east Northumberland faces a total loss of 2,000 jobs during 1994 and the three following years on top of up to 1,000 jobs shed last year, says a report to be considered by county councillors today. Research by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants for the county council says recent closure and redundancy announcements in the county, especially in its industrialised south-east corner, have already put it on course to fulfil the highest predictions of coal-related job losses in the coming years. About half the 2,000 forecast job losses have happened in the past few months with the sudden closure of Northumberland's last pit, Ellington.</p>

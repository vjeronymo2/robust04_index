			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RYAN WHITE'S AIDS BATTLE TO BE TOLD IN BOOK  </P> <P> The story of Ryan White's battle with AIDS will be told in a children's book  its publisher hopes will help better educate the nation's youth about the  deadly disease.  </P> <P> White, who was the subject of persecution at his Indiana grade school five  years ago when he was diagnosed as having the disease, died Sunday a hero among  his peers. The 18-year-old White spent much of his time near the end of his  life answering volumes of mail from children wanting to know more about AIDS.  </P> <P> "He got maybe 1,000 letters a week from kids. Every time he appeared somewhere  the volume doubled," said Toby Sherry, a senior editor with Dial Books for  Young Readers, a division of E. P. Dutton in New York City. "Dial considers it  an important book, because kids will listen to another kid about AIDS.  </P> <P> White collaborated on the book with a writer who wished to remain anonymous,  Sherry said.  </P> <P> "We have not done a very good job educating our country about how AIDS is  transmitted -- especially with young people; who think they're immortal. It's  the first time a child who has AIDS is talking to other children" through a  book, she said.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, they will listen. To me, that's what's important about this book."  Sherry said.  </P> <P> "Ryan was an important spokesperson," Sherry added. "I never met him, but I've  seen him on TV and he was remarkable -- you were riveted. I think part of it  was because he had so much presence and his feet were on the ground and he was  so sensible, and I think kids really listened to him."  </P> <P> The book will be Ryan's story of the past five years, from the time he was  denied the opportunity to attend classes at a Russiaville, Ind., school near  Kokomo after he was diagnosed as having contracted the acquired immune  deficiency syndrome. He got the virus, as hundreds of hemophiliacs have,  through a tainted blood-clotting agent.  </P> <P> Sherry said the book, which was proposed by the White family, is expected to  run about 100 to 130 pages and have lots of photographs, which they feel will  help keep youngsters turning the pages.  </P></p>

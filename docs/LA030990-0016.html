			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JALEWALIA HELD TO 8; LA QUINTA LOSES, 39-36  </P> <P> Amy Jalewalia scored only eight points as the La Quinta High School girls'  basketball team lost to top-seeded Point Loma, 39-36, Thursday in a Southern  California Division II Regional semifinal at Point Loma.  </P> <P> Jalewalia, the second-leading girls' scorer in the state with a 34-point  average, fouled out on a charging call with 3 minutes 36 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> "She hasn't scored that low since her freshman year," La Quinta Coach Kevin  Kiernan said.  </P> <P> Said Jalewalia: "I was off. I tried to do too much. I was getting the shots, I  just got flustered, I guess."  </P> <P> Robin Rabello, a 6-foot senior center, scored a season-high 12 points, pulled  down 13 rebounds -- seven in the first quarter -- and had three steals for  Point Loma (29-3).  </P> <P> Point Loma trailed, 36-35, when Tyeast Brown scored off her own rebound and  gave the Pointers a 37-36 lead with a minute remaining.  </P> <P> Point Loma called a timeout, and after missed shots by both teams, Point Loma's  Stacy Wainwright was fouled with 13 seconds left, but she missed the front end  of the one-and-one. Rabello was in perfect position, grabbed the rebound and  scored to give Point Loma a 39-36 lead. La Quinta shot from three-point range,  but was way off target.  </P> <P> Point Loma meets Muir, a 58-44 winner over Ventura, Saturday in the Division II  final at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.

			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: Italian dealers still cautious despite rise in discount rate SOME stability returned to the Italian government bond market and the lira yesterday after the Bank of Italy's weekend increase in the discount rate by 1 percentage point to 13 per cent. However, dealers remained cautious about the outlook ahead of details of the government's planned emergency budget package announced on Sunday. The package, destined to help correct the overshoot in the budget deficit, which is now expected to reach at least L160,000bn this year, should involve a mixture of revenue-raising and cost-cutting measures, including a freeze on public-sector prices. Prices rose slightly at the long end of the market yesterday as banks digested the weekend news in relatively quiet trading. An early test of the confidence in the new government of Mr Giuliano Amato will come on Thursday, when L13,000bn of short-term Buoni Ordinari del Tesoro (BOT) will be auctioned. Auctions of longer-term fixed and floating-rate paper last week gave a taste of the market's growing frustration with the lack of action to curb the deficit. UK government bond prices slid yesterday as hopes for an early cut in interest rates were quashed. The Bank of England's actions in the money markets on Friday had left traders optimistic about the authorities' intentions of pushing down rates further to revive the flagging UK economy. But the Bank's market operations yesterday, and the weakness of sterling, killed off the more optimistic expectations. 'It would be a bit of a disaster to cut rates now,' said one observer as the DM/sterling rate fell from 2.889 to 2.885. 'The chancellor (of the exchequer) looks as boxed in as ever.' With little else to support gilts - and with little expectation of any positive news from the G7 meeting taking place in Munich - prices of most stocks fell by between one-third and a half of a point later in the day. The benchmark 9 per cent bonds due 2012, ended the day at 36 13/16 , close to the 36 at which they closed last Thursday, ahead of the Bank's actions. Meanwhile, 9 per cent gilts due 2008 lost  15/32 of a point to close at 101 7/32 , a yield of 8.82 per cent. As prices fell, the yield differential between UK and German 10-year government bonds climbed to 1.29 percentage point. GERMAN government bond prices remained largely unchanged yesterday as investors continued to wait for an outcome to the debate over the introduction of an interest income tax. 'People are worried about getting involved ahead of a potentially difficult decision,' one trader said. The market expects a tax of 30 to 35 per cent, but no erosion of bank secrecy in Germany. Any attack on secrecy could lead to some flight of capital from the banking system, unsettling the market. Despite the pause in the German government bond market's rally, many observers continue to remain optimistic about its prospects in the near future. US Treasury prices firmed at both ends of the maturity range yesterday as investors continued to buy government securities in the wake of last week's big interest rate cut. In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/32 at 104 3/8 , yielding 7.618 per cent. The two-year note was even firmer, up  3/16 at 101, yielding 4.450 per cent. Although confidence in the outlook for the bond market following the policy ease has been widely spread among investors, demand has been noticeably more robust at the short end than at the long end of the market - hence the bigger gains among two-year securities yesterday and the steepening of the yield curve. In the credit markets, the Federal Reserve arranged three-day matched sales with Fed funds trading at 3 3/16 per cent. The intervention, aimed at draining reserves from the market and pushing Fed funds higher, confirmed that the Fed's new target for the rate is 3 1/4 per cent. By late afternoon, however, Fed funds had eased to 3 1/8 per cent.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea [GFTUK]  issued an appeal to the South Korean workers today concerning  the existence of the workers which is now in a grave crisis due  to the South Korean authorities' anti-popular labour policy and  wage-curbing move.    The appeal charges that the Kim Yong-sam regime has been  brandishing the sword of fascist dictatorship against the  workers, branding their just struggle for the right to live and  democracy as "collective egoism".    It says:    Imposing "sharing of hardships" upon the working masses, the  traitor Kim Yong-sam, puppet, cut the yearly wage hike rate at  below 3 percent and is making no scruples of fascist crackdown  on the labor movement by invoking even the ill-named "emergency  arbitration power" of the period of "Yusin" dictatorship to curb  the struggle for a higher pay.    He has lifted to more than 3,000 million dollars, the  largest  ever, the burden share for the maintenance of the U.S.  occupation forces in South Korea and increased the military  spendings for the first year of his office to more than  10,000,000 million won, or up 9.6 percent from the previous  year, while suppressing the workers' just demand for a higher  pay at the point of the bayonet.    The appropriations of the puppet government's "budget" for  the socalled "welfare of the working people" account for a  meager one 300th of the military expenditures.    The miserable living conditions of the labouring masses  including workers cannot be improved, nor can the outrageous  deeds of the employers be removed as long as such dastardly  traitor, dirty turncoat and disgusting political prostitute Kim  Yong-sam the traitor is left in power in South Korea.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam, a trickster as cunning and  shameful  as an old fox is now is preaching "compromise" on one hand and  trying on the other to weaken your strength through ruthless  suppression and "ameriolation".    There should be no compromise with the clique of traitors.  No compromise, no hesitation, no submission is the way for you  to win in the struggle for a higher pay and the right to live.    The enemy pouncing upon you with a dagger between his  clenched teeth must be fought back with a dagger.    South Korean workers!    The season of struggle has come.    Rise daringly in the springtime struggle for a wage hike  excel.    Your demand will not be met through petitioning or  negotiations.    Kindle a fiercer flame of struggle to wreak the pentup  rancour of the forerunners who fell in struggle and to save the  people from distress! Rise up like mountains and demonstrate  the strong mettle of the working class!    You workers in South Korea must develop your struggle for  wage hike into an anti-U.S. struggle for independence and an  anti-fascist struggle for democracy if you are to lead a life  worthy of human being in a genuinely independent and peaceful  world.    Fight it out to bring down a stern sledge hammer on the head  of the Kim Yong-sam clique of traitors and establish a true  independent democratic regime in South Korea!</p>

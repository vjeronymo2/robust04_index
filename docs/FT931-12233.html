			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading TRADERS OF stock index futures reported a dull session after an early squeeze petered out, leaving the market to drift gently lower, writes Joel Kibazo. The first trade in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 was struck at 2,840, well below Wednesday's close of 2,854. But following a brief lull a squeeze developed as traders moved to cover short positions and the contract quickly moved ahead to 2,858. That strong demand ran out of steam mid-morning and thereafter March drifted lower, mainly due to a lack of trading activity, and helped to pull the underlying cash market down. March fell to the day's low of 2,829 over the lunch-time period and continued to drift during the rest of the afternoon, although a few bargain hunters were seen ahead of the close. The contract ended at 2,836, down 18 from its previous close and around 13 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. The lack of activity was clearly reflected in the turnover, which was a mere 6,299 contracts. In traded options, volume returned to more modest levels, reaching 29,033 lots. The FT-SE 100 option had 5,176 contracts traded. Asda was the most active among the stock options, with big selling of both the July 70 puts and the July calls. The closing total for Asda was 5,303.</p>

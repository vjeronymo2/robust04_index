			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Extremists threaten de Klerk with further attacks WHITE extremists in South Africa have threatened more attacks on President FW de Klerk during the campaign for next week's referendum, after a teargas bomb forced him to flee a campaign meeting on Monday night. The threats, issued by the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance Movement) (AWB), highlight the security risk involved in the style of campaigning chosen by Mr de Klerk: informal walkabouts in shopping centres and university campuses, and impromptu meetings with the public. A presidential spokesman said there would be no change in his programme despite the attack. Mr de Klerk is always flanked by several National party officials during his campaign strolls, but normally by only one plain-clothes security officer. (Others accompany his motorcade.) Whites and blacks alike crowd close to the president in cramped quarters, in an attempt to see him and shake his hand. Those accompanying his tour have expressed concern that such events provide ample opportunity for an assassin. Monday's attack, in which Mr Kobie Coetsee, justice minister, was temporarily blinded, was carried out during a meeting with students at the University of the Orange Free State in ultra-conservative Bloemfontein, where Mr de Klerk was campaigning for a 'yes' vote in next Tuesday's poll on political reform. A local National party official said he recognised the attackers as members of the AWB. They yelled 'Baboon, go back to the mountains' and 'Traitor go home' before lobbing the tear gas bomb. Mr de Klerk and his wife Marike were hustled out of the hall by security men without injury. Yesterday Mr Piet Rudolf, AWB spokesman, said Mr de Klerk could expect more such attacks, though he denied AWB involvement in the Bloemfontein incident. 'He cannot refer to the AWB as Nazis and fascists without expecting some revenge,' he said. Mr de Klerk had earlier used those terms in condemning the right wing, which is campaigning for a 'no' vote in the referendum. It was the first big disruption of his campaign since it began eight days ago. The attack highlights the degree to which reform depends on the security of two individuals, Mr de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress. Yesterday Mr Mandela was at pains to reassure whites, ahead of the referendum, that civil servants and security force members would not lose their jobs under an ANC government, though some might be retired on 'favourable and secure terms.' He said the ANC would not be influenced by Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's plans to nationalise white farmland. 'We will be influenced by our own conditions, not those of Zimbabwe,' he told local newspapers. 'Zimbabwe believes in a one-party state. We believe in a multi-party state.'</p>

			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC GETS CFA RIGHTS FOR 5 YEARS  </P> <P> Beginning with the 1991 season, all non-cable college football telecasts will  be limited to one network.  </P> <P> That is the essence of an agreement between ABC and the College Football Assn.  announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> No terms were announced, but industry sources said it is a five-year,  $210-million deal.  </P> <P> From ABC's point of view, it shows the network is still in the sports business.  </P> <P> ABC, over the last six years, has been shut out during negotiations for other  sports rights deals -- major league baseball, three different Olympics, the  NBA, and the NCAA basketball tournament.  </P> <P> ABC, once dominant in televised sports, had not acquired a major sports  property since Jan. 24, 1984, when it got the rights to the 1988 Winter  Olympics for $309 million.  </P> <P> Now CBS and NBC have been shut out of college football, except for bowl games.  </P> <P> From the viewer's point of view, there will be fewer games to choose from on  college football Saturdays after next season, although the smorgasbord on cable  television will remain intact.  </P> <P> CBS, which had held the rights to CFA games, had exclusive negotiating rights.  But CBS was not prepared to meet the CFA's asking price of more than $40  million a year.  </P> <P> CBS, a source said, offered about $32 million a season.  </P> <P> CBS will pay about $16 million in rights fees next season, the final year of  its current four-year deal with the CFA.  </P> <P> "We were not prepared to triple the rights fee, which was the price requested  by the CFA and apparently agreed to by ABC," Neal Pilson, president of CBS  Sports, said in a statement.  </P> <P> NBC's bid, the source said, was a little lower than CBS' offer.  </P> <P> ABC last fall signed contract extensions with the Pacific 10 and Big Ten  conferences that run through the 1996 season, one more than ABC's new contract  with the CFA.  </P> <P> So the Pac-10 and Big Ten are unable to offer their games to another network,  thus resulting in a logjam of games on one network.  </P> <P> The CFA consists of 64 Division I-A college football schools. They include the  members of the Atlantic Coast, Southeastern, Big Eight, Southwest and Western  Athletic conferences, plus 20 independents, among them Miami, Notre Dame and  Florida State.  </P> <P> Stephen Solomon, an ABC senior vice president, said: "There's one network that  will be covering it all. We think the opportunity for putting together all of  college football is a wonderful broadcasting opportunity."  </P> <P> Solomon said that ABC plans to televise 50-55 college football games over the  15-week season, but most of those will be shown regionally.  </P> <P> During 10 of those 15 weeks, there will be an overlap between the ABC's  Pac-10/Big Ten package and the CFA package.  </P> <P> Thus, West Coast viewers will get to see only a few of ABC's CFA telecasts.  </P> <P> "We haven't got an exact breakdown (on how things will work)," Solomon said.  "There will be some flexibility."  </P> <P> Solomon also said there will be some doubleheader dates.  </P> <P> ABC, on most Saturdays, will have to leave the 9:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. time  slots alone because of various conference packages. The Pac-10 package is  carried by Prime Ticket in Los Angeles, and those games are usually televised  at 3:30.  </P> <P> The Big Ten may be able to sell a 9:30 a.m. package to a Los Angeles outlet,  but the top games will belong to ABC and may not be shown here at all.  </P> <P> All of college football was included in one TV package sold by the NCAA until  June, 1984, when the Supreme Court voided it as a violation of antitrust laws.  </P> <P> Asked if things would be similar to the way they were before 1984, Solomon  said, "The difference now is you have all the cable packages."  </P> <P> The CFA already has a separate cable contract with ESPN, which is for $110  million over four years, 1991-94.  </P> <P> As for the new deal with ABC, David Ogrean, assistant executive director of the  CFA, said: "This was clearly the best deal for a variety of reasons. There's no  getting around that, in this marketplace, the bottom line is money."  </P></p>

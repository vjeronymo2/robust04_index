Saiget] </F>   [Text] Beijing, Feb. 17 KYODO -- China's growing coal  consumption poses a huge threat to the environment, a leading  Chinese official said recently, and things are bound to get  worse as the country struggles to generate enough energy to fuel  its booming economy.    "Our biggest environmental problem is coal. You cannot deny  that in the next 20 to 30 years coal use will continue to grow,"  Yang Jike, vice chairman of the environmental protection  committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC) said in an  interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    "We have lots of coal...To generate electricity it's the  cheapest," he said. "Coal is easy to get, you only have to dig."    China used between 1.1 and 1.2 billion tons of coal in 1993,  mostly for heating and generating electricity. Industry sources  predict China will consume as much as 1.5 to 1.6 billion tons by  the year 2000.    Coal burning emits several harmful air pollutants including  carbon dioxide (Co2), a major contributor to the global warming  or "greenhouse effect," and sulfur dioxide (So2), the main cause  of acid rain, which destroys the nutritional value of soil and  pollutes rivers and lakes.    "As far as I'm concerned, laws are the only way to restrict  the rapid development of the coal industry. We can also use  laws and regulations to encourage development of renewable  energy sources such as hydroelectric power, wind, tidal,  geothermal power and biogas, as well as nuclear power plants,"  Yang said.    The threat of excessive dependence on coal is of such a  serious nature that Yang sees the construction of nuclear power  plants and the environmentally controversial Three Gorges dam --  set to be the world's largest -- as necessary projects to limit  coal use in China.    Despite nearly universal ignorance of environmental concerns  among the general masses, Yang stressed the Chinese Government's  commitment to environmental protection, citing its signing of  the UN-sponsored framework convention on climate change and the  convention on biological diversity at the 1992 Earth Summit in  Rio de Janeiro.    The 1993 establishment of the NPC Environmental Protection  Committee places priority on environmental legislation aimed at  controlling pollution and protecting natural resources, he said.    New construction projects in China now must first have an  environmental impact statement approved, he said, while several  draft laws will lay down standards for solid waste disposal, air  and water pollution as well as standards for resource  exploitation.    China's environmental protection is an uphill battle against  not only the demands of rapid economic development and growing  energy use, but subject to the tremendous pressures of a  massive, largely uneducated agrarian population which feeds the  nation on only 7 percent of the world's arable land.    Chemical fertilizers, deforestation and indiscriminate  strip-  mining are leading to rapid soil erosion, while new highly-  productive seed varieties are diminishing genetic variety while  increasing the susceptibility of entire crops to a number of  destructive plant viruses.    Although Yang is careful to support the party's official  policy of fast, healthy and stable economic growth, "my own  opinion is that we don't want to develop too fast," he says.  "Ten percent growth is too fast. I hope we can control growth  to keep it below that level, ideally in the range of 6 percent."    "We are faced with a very critical environmental situation,"  Yang said. "Our challenge is to do our best to overcome this  serious situation," he said.</p>

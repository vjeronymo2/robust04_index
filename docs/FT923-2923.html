			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Bundesbank rate cuts buoy German bond markets EUROPEAN bond markets proved more sensitive to the Bundesbank's decision to lower the rate on its weekly securities repurchase tender to 9.20 per cent from 9.70 per cent, than to the  1/4 point cut in the Lombard rate. However, the Bundesbank's actions left the market in no doubt that it would put money market rates back up again if it felt the need to rein in inflation or money supply growth over the short term. The German bond market set the tone for the day, with futures jumping 150 basis points at one stage and cash bonds rising about 100 basis points. There was also buying interest in the Dutch market, which had lagged behind Bunds at the start. However, the markets lost their momentum as the day progressed. Investors were unwilling to chase the higher levels, preferring to keep their powder dry until after the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty on Sunday. The devaluation of the lira prompted some buying of Italian bonds in the morning, but selling by retail and institutional clients gathered momentum in the afternoon. FRENCH bonds opened 1 1/2 points higher and short-term paper went limit-up at the opening. But bond prices came off their highs on profit-taking, as investors reflected on the political motivation behind the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts. The September future jumped 1.04 to 107.56 with 180,596 lots traded. The French 2002 OAT was yielding 8.66 per cent against 8.82 per cent on Friday. DUTCH bonds attracted investors' attention as the market's slow start resulted in a widening of the spread between Dutch and German 10-year paper to 50 basis points. This prompted buying of the Dutch paper and by the close the spread had narrowed to 43 1/2 points. Dealers also reported a large buy order for the Dutch 15-year bond, which rose 1 3/4 points. The market was also boosted by the  1/4 point reduction in the Dutch official rates. The 8.25 per cent Dutch government bond due June 2002 ended 1.14 points higher at 101.35, while its yield fell to 8.04 per cent from 8.22 per cent. GILTS finished with gains of around 1 1/2 points, but were below the day's highs on profit-taking. Dealers said trading was orderly, though sterling's drop below DM2.80 at one point caused some doubts. Short sterling futures jumped in active trading. The December contract ended at 89.74 against a previous 89.13 and in a turnover of some 58,300 lots. Long gilt futures closed at 98 1/2 after 96 7/8 on Friday and after an early high of 98 15/16 . Volume was equally active at 61,600 lots. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent Treasury bond due 2003/07 was 116 5/16 , yielding 9.25 per cent, after the last close at 114 7/16 . ITALIAN bonds made early gains of up to 3 points, in the wake of the devaluation of the lira and lower money market rates, but drifted back on profit-taking by midday. Selling pressure increased in the afternoon as foreign investors decided to liquidate their positions and take their currency losses. IN New York, US government securities also moved higher on news of the Bundesbank's easing, although by lunchtime they were well below levels reached overnight in foreign trading. The benchmark 30-year long bond - which had reached 100 13/32 in overseas markets - closed at 99 7/8 , up   13/32 from Friday's close. At the end of last week, the US bond market was held back by technical considerations, as underwriting investment firms coped with a surfeit of new corporate debt issues. Yesterday, dealers suggested that the desire for some speedy profit-taking had capped the bond market rally, pushing Treasuries off the peak levels seen overnight.</p>

			<p><P> February 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> U.S.-JAPAN FIRMS AGREE ON FSX  </P> <P> Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and General Dynamics Corp., maker of the widely  used F-16 warplane, have reached final agreement on developing the FSX jet  fighter for Japan's air force, the Japanese company said today.  </P> <P> The joint project was approved in principle by the two governments last year  but has been plagued by U.S.-Japanese wrangling.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration pressured Tokyo into building the plane with an  American company rather than the Japanese developing the plane by themselves.  </P> <P> U.S. congressional opposition forced renegotiation of the deal as previously  laid out in a 1988 pact after critics said it would give Japan advanced U.S.  technology that it could use to compete in making commercial aircraft.  </P> <P> St. Louis-based General Dynamics, the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, is to  handle 35% of the $7-billion project to build 120 aircraft.  </P></p>

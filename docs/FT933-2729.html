			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Optimism declines in labour market A SLOW and patchy recovery is taking place in the labour market, yesterday's figures from the Department of Employment showed. The optimism of the spring, when unemployment fell for four successive months, has waned following the news of a 5,800 rise in unemployment last month, and a revised increase of 4,300 in July. The picture is not as bleak as it was at the end of last year, however. The jobless total, at 2.9m, is below that of eight months ago and the size of the workforce in employment had its first quarterly rise for three years in the second quarter. The seasonally-adjusted figures reveal that over the past six months unemployment fell by an average of 7,500 a month compared with a rise of 25,200 a month over the six months to February. The latest three months show a reversal of the trend, with the total climbing an average 1,800 a month. Unadjusted, the number of people out of work and claiming benefit rose 30,600 in August to 2.96m. This compares with rises of 71,500 in August last year and 67,600 in August 1991. One encouraging aspect of the figures was the news that the workforce in employment grew by 20,000 to 24.9m in the three months to the end of June. Employment levels had fallen in every quarter since the end of 1990, even at the beginning of this year when unemployment was falling. However, the number employed in manufacturing fell a seasonally-adjusted 11,000 in July compared with June and by 173,000 over the year to July. It fell 206,000 in the year to July 1992. The other main highlights of yesterday's figures were: The rise in the seasonally-adjusted jobless total was confined to women. Male unemployment fell by 2,000 in August compared with July while female unemployment rose 7,800. The number of people joining the count in August was 395,600, compared with 408,000 in the same month a year ago; 369,000 left the count compared with 346,000 last year. Unemployment rose in all regions other than East Anglia, the south-west and Scotland. The stock of vacancies at Jobcentres - about a third of all vacancies in the economy - increased by 400 in August to their highest level for over two years. Seasonally-adjusted vacancies have increased on average by 1,500 per month in the three months to August. The underlying increase in average weekly earnings in the year to July was 3.5 per cent, the same as the rate in June. Average earnings for manufacturing rose by 5 per cent in the year to July and for services by 2.75 per cent. Neither changed on the previous month. Wages and salaries per unit of output - unit wage costs - in manufacturing were 1.8 per cent lower in the three months to July than in the same three months a year ago. This compares with a fall of 2.1 per cent in the three months to June. Manufacturing output per head rose by 0.1 per cent in the three months to July compared with the previous three-month period. It was 6.7 per cent higher than the same period a year ago. The Department of Employment also released results of the spring Labour Force Survey, a survey of 60,000 households designed to give a fuller picture of the labour market. The survey, which uses the internationally-agreed International Labour Office definition of unemployment, found that 2.8m people were unemployed between March and May, a fall of 3.2 per cent since the previous quarterly survey. On this definition, 13,000 more people were unemployed than the average monthly number shown by the claimant count. The survey also said in the three months to May 24.8m people were in employment, a rise of 0.2 per cent since the previous survey and 5.5 per cent higher than spring 1984, when it was first produced.</p>

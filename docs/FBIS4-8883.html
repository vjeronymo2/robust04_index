			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Karlo Jeger: "The Confederation Will Be a Balkan </F> Superpower: It Will Build Ships, Manufacture Guns, Tanks, and  Aircraft!"]    [Text] The joint military industry of the confederation of  the Republic of Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina  will surpass the Serbian one in a matter of five years!    The formidable military potential of the former Yugoslav  People's Army [JNA] is what gave the Serbian conquest its main  strength. However, the Serbs also had supremacy because of the  military industry in areas under Serb control.    On the other hand, after the outbreak of Croat-Muslim  conflicts, parts of the military industry that remained under  the control of the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army were scattered and dissociated, severed  from sources of energy and raw materials. Just how much the  Serbs fear the possibility of these potentials being linked into  a unified technological process is evident from the fact that  they, after the first hints of Croat-Muslim unification, carried  out an air raid on the largest gun factory in the former  Yugoslavia -- Bratstvo in Novi Travnik.  <H5>  Overhaul of Supersonic Aircraft </H5>   At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens the  possibility of launching an enviable military industry.    Prior to the war, Croatia had almost no military industry  with the exception of shipbuilding. Here we need to mention the  Skorpik Repair Plant in Sibenik, the well-known large shipyards  in Split, Rijeka, Pula, and the Shipbuilding Institute  [Brodarski institut]. Although it will not be possible to  manufacture a missile launcher or submarine in the near future,  it will nevertheless be possible to manufacture smaller vessels.  Although very little is known and virtually nothing is said in  the public about this topic, it has nevertheless been announced  that Croatia has long since mastered the manufacture of weapons  in garages and workshops.    According to officially published data, the manufacture of  small arms includes the industrial manufacture of hand guns (PHP  -- Prvi hrvatski pistolj [the first Croatian hand gun] similar  to the Walther), sniper rifles (12.7 mm, 7.9 mm, and a third  variant of NATO caliber), and machine guns, copies of the  Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were experimental  projects. A superior variant of the Kalashnikov, similar to the  Israeli 7.62 mm (?Ghalib), is also manufactured. Moreover, also  in production are several types of mines and explosives, mortars  of all calibers with the appropriate and even very advanced  shells, recoilless guns and shells, as well as light portable  antiaircraft systems.    The achieved level of production guarantees the successful  mastering of the manufacture of other infantry automatic and  semi-automatic weapons. Hand grenades are also manufactured....    Infantry land mines [lezece mine] (20 types) are also being  produced.    The repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has been  revived very quickly. The same applies to the repair of guns  and howitzers.    However, the largest, already installed and internationally  renowned munitions plants of the possible future confederation  are in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The HVO in Vitez controls perhaps the largest European plant  manufacturing gunpowder, jet fuel [raketno gorivo], and  explosives. The Osa project, for which the problem was jet  fuel, has become a reality after the liberation of Vitez. The  production of high-quality jet fuel for all types and calibers  of multiple rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of  artillery, and all types of explosives can resume immediately in  the untouched factory halls of the Vitez plant. Even prior to  the Croat-Muslim conflicts, the production of gunpowder for  infantry weapons had been mastered in Vitez.... The  installation for the production of jet fuel for long-range Orkan  missiles alone has the capacity of 2,000 pieces per year.  <H5>  A Plant Worth $1 Billion </H5>   When the HVO took over the plant, some 4,000 finished  missile  charges, which should have been shipped to Iraq, were still in  the warehouse!    The value of the Vitez plant is estimated to be $1 billion.  Moreover, conserved within the plant perimeter, as a war  reserve, is a completely usable older version of a technology  line for the production of gunpowder, which can be assembled  quickly.    It is certain that the Serbs will not be able to achieve the  technological level of the Vitez plant for a very long time.    The HVO also controls the former Soko aircraft plant in  Mostar. Although the Serbs have rescued a part of the equipment,  with certain investments the plant could be renewed, if not for  the manufacture of whole aircraft, then for at least the  manufacture of parts for large international companies and  high-quality repair of aircraft. In addition to that, large  amounts of parts from which aircraft could be assembled have  remained in warehouses throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina (in  Busovaca, near Tuzla....). Moreover, there is a significant  amount of missiles in storage in Bosnia-Herzegovina that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army could not use. They are air-to-surface  missiles (Munja RZ-57).    The largest plant for the manufacture of guns and multiple  rocket launchers on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is in  Novi Travnik, under the control of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army.  The RAK-12, a copy of the Plamen, is manufactured in Croatia.  Apart from repairs of all types of artillery, the Novi Travnik  plant used to manufacture guns and howitzers of all calibers,  from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer. In preparation  for the manufacture of Kolos, equipment was installed for the  manufacture of 203-mm gun barrels. All types of mortars and  mortar shells were also manufactured. It needs to be said that  the manufacture of barrels is very important, since they are  being mercilessly used, and it is known they become worn down  through wear and tear. Mortars and mortar shells are  manufactured in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj.    The Bosnia-Herzegovina Army also controls a large repair  plant for infantry weapons.    The Slavko Rodic plant from Bugojno, currently under Serb  attack, manufactures all types of detonators, both for artillery  and aircraft weaponry. Although the Serbs have also developed a  plant for manufacturing detonators in Valjevo, they do not have  the capacity for manufacturing the most modern radio detonators.  Orkan missiles, which landed on Jastrebarsko [village in the  vicinity of Zagreb], were equipped with the poorer variant of  electronic detonators manufactured in Krusik in Valjevo, unlike  the ones manufactured in Slavko Rodic in Bugojno.  <H5>  Ammunition for NATO </H5>   In Konjic, in the vicinity of the underground command  headquarters built for the former Presidency of the Socialist  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the JNA General Staff, dug  deep into the ground is the Igman plant, which manufactures  ammunition. The technology of the plant is superior to that of  its twin, the Prvi Partizan Munitions Plant in Uzice, and it has  the capacity to manufacture several million pieces per month.  The fact that this plant used to manufacture ammunition for  NATO speaks for its quality. It manufactures all types of  ammunition up to 12.7-mm caliber. By using old shells, the  ironworks in Zenica has begun manufacturing ammunition of 105-mm  and 122-mm caliber.... There is a possibility that, by using  barrels from the one-time JNA warehouses, the Muslims in Novi  Travnik have managed to manufacture a Kalashnikov.    In Gorazde, there is a plant that manufactures cartridges,  the only significant segment of the military industry that did  not have a twin in Serbia. In Vitkovici near Gorazde, there is  a chemical plant that manufactures substances for the  manufacture of explosives.    If to this we add the former assembly line for assembling  tanks in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal  military industry will be enviable!    The Zenica ironworks can manufacture tin for armor and can  manufacture the cupola, while the engine can be bought.  However, it is even more important that it can produce fast  armored vehicles....  <H5>  All the Plants in Serbia </H5>   A significant amount of documents of the UNIS Institute for  special purposes production has remained in Sarajevo under the  control of the Bosniaks and Croats. Unfortunately, the Serbs  completely destroyed the Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which  specialized in the manufacture of sights.    The military industry of the former JNA was designed in such  a way that it could produce arms and all the material necessary  for the "national defense," completely independently and in  total isolation. Almost all the plants of the military industry  were located in the central mountain areas of the former joint  country. Such distribution was justified by the strategic needs  of conducting a national defense war, but at the same time  Serbia became completely independent and autonomous in  manufacturing arms, whereas the other republics were put in a  position of technological and productional dependence on each  other.    For example, plastic ramps for rocket launchers and engines  were manufactured at Kamnik in Slovenia, the gunpowder came from  Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosce.... The final  assembly was done in Prilep in Macedonia.    The explosives plant Slobodan Princip-Seljo in Vitez had  developed a technology for manufacturing plastic explosives, but  then the entire plant was trasferred to Ivangrad in Montenegro.  Until 1992, its integral capacity exceeded the requirments of  the rump "Yugoslavia" by four times. At the same time, the  former federal army built parallel plants on the territory of  Serbia and Montenegro wherever it was possible.    For example, the "twin" of the Vitez Gunpowder and  Explosives  Plant was the Prva iskra plant in Barici in Serbia; the twin of  the aircraft plant Soko in Mostar is Utva in Pancevo; the Slavko  Rodic detonator plant in Bugojno has a twin in Krusik in  Valjevo; the Konjic ammunition plant's twin is Prvi partizan in  Uzice; the pyrotechnics plant in Gorazde has two twins: Krusik  in Valjevo and Sloboda in Cacak. The FAMOS engine plant in  Sarajevo also had two twins: the Engine Industry [Industrija  motora] in Rakovica near Belgrade and FAP in Priboj.    The Zrak plant in Sarajevo, which manufactured sights, had a  twin in the Teleoptik plant in Belgrade.    The Military Medical Academy [VMA] in Banjica [Belgrade  district] dealt with all aspects of military medicine --  development of medical care, surgery in war, and protection from  nuclear, chemical, and biological arms.    All these institutions were equipped with the most  sophisticated equipment and technology. The centrifuge at  Batajnica [military airport near Belgrade], for studying pilots'  behavior under extremely hard flight conditions, alone cost over  $1 million.    Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those  manufactured in industrial plants at home, and imported weapons,  were also tested near Belgrade -- in the Air Force Center for  Experiments [Vazduhoplovni opitni centar] in Batajnica, and the  Infantry Center for Experiments [Opitni centar kopnene vojske]  in Nikinci in Srijem. Moreover, there was a Technical Center  for Experiments [Tehnicki opitni centar] on Prevlaka, from which  the Serbs managed to withdraw the equipment and transfer it to  the Montenegrin side.  <H5>  The Supersonic Aircraft -- Out of the Question! </H5>   The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the  remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. However,  despite being almost fully equipped in terms of technology, the  Serbs still have not managed to renew the manufacture of all  types of weaponry.    The manufacture of the Orao [Eagle] aircraft has been cut  short and is no longer mentioned. There can be no question of  developing the new supersonic aircraft. That task proved to be  too hard even for the entire military industry of the former  Yugoslavia, and it is too hard for the present Serbian industry.    The manufacture of Gazelle SA-341/24L helicopters also has  not been revived, that used to be manufactured on French license  in Mostar. Informed sources claim that the Serbs cannot even  master the overhaul of a MiG-21, which used to be done in Velika  Gorica, despite the fact that they have taken with them the  greater part of the machinery and special tools, completed new  assembly halls in Pancevo that measure three kilometers, and  constructed a new runway adjacent to the plant....    Almost all of the internationally renowned engineers and  craftsmen from Soko, who, apart from fulfilling the requirements  of the former army also worked for major international aircraft  corporations like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier.... have remained  behind in Mostar. The same happened in the case of the Velika  Gorica Repair Plant [Remontni zavod].    On the other hand, the greatest achievement of the Utva  [Wild  Duck] aircraft plant in Pancevo was the manufacture of light  propeller planes Utva-75. The serial production of the  propeller- powered Lasta [Swallow] training aircraft never even  got off the ground in Pancevo. Moreover, there can be no talk  of an independent serial production of jet planes for as long as  the sanctions are in place.    The Serbs did not even try to revive production for navy  requirements. Even the existing vessels in Boka are under a  thick layer of rust.  <H5>  Vessels Under Thick Layers of Rust </H5>   In addition to the plants for infantry requirements that  were  already on their territory prior to the outbreak of war, the  Serbs have managed to replace the plants they lost in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. The majority of the Serbian military  industry is located along the East and West Morava Rivers, and  in Belgrade, while another part is in Bosnia under the control  of Karadzic's forces.    The Crvena Zastava Institute [Zavodi Crvena zastava] from  Kragujevac is the strongest point of the Serbian military  industry. All types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft guns up  to 40-mm caliber are manufactured there. The latest of their  products are the 9-mm hand gun (the production of which has been  transferred to the SARID 13 plant in Smederevo), a 12.7-mm  sniper rifle, and a 40-mm infantry grenade launcher.    Also manufactured there is the Kragujevac automatic rifle,  fashioned on license after the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian  soldiers have named "ciganka" [gypsy].    Krusik from Valjevo manufactures all types of light  armor-piercing missile systems, and the licensed guided  armor-piercing missiles AT-2 and AT-3. They are also planning  to manufacture an AT-4. Prior to the war, they also  manufactured Strela-2M, a light portable antiaircraft system,  and preparations were underway for the licensed production of  the Igla, another light antiaircraft system.    Moreover, guided 128 mm air-to-surface Munja missiles and  57-mm BR-1 missiles are manufactured in Valjevo.  <H5>  The Serbs Have Run Out of Money! </H5>   According to unconfirmed information, rockets for the  Plamen,  Oganj, and Orkan multiple rocket launchers are also manufactured  in Valjevo.    All types of infantry ammunition is manufactured in the Prvi  Partizan plant in Lucani near Cacak, while gunpowder for  infantry ammunition is produced in the Milan Blagojevic plant.  The main manufacturer of jet fuel is Prva Iskra from Baric.    The strongest Serbian munitions plant in Bosnia is in the  UNIS complex in Vogosca, where all types and calibers of  artillery ammunition are produced.    According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to  revive the production and repair of 100-mm and 125-mm tank guns,  and repair of all other types of artillery pieces.    In a recent brief statement issued by the Supreme Council of  National Defense, it was stated that the army would only finance  priority projects that are of vital significance for the defense  of the country, and salaries and pensions of officers. All  investments and new projects will be discontinued. The recent  strike of the workers from the Crvena zastava plant implies that  Milosevic's promise that the Kragujevac plant would work, if  need be, in three shifts, is going to be very difficult to  fulfill.    Toward the end of 1993, the entire Serbian industrial  production dropped to some 30 percent of its pre-war level.  Half of this production was military production for the purpose  of keeping the conquered territories in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Pitiful salaries, insufficient for even bare survival, have  led to a massive departure of the highly qualified cadres, who  primarily moved overseas. The people with a technical education  were joined by experts from numerous military technical  institutes and plants.    The second important point is a standstill in the  development  of almost finished projects, and an end of investments into new  weapons' technology. Serbia simply no longer has any money for  this.    The substantial military-technical documentation, stored in  Belgrade, will simply become outdated. The immense knowledge in  the field of production of arms and military hardware, paid for  with the money from all the republics of the former Yugoslavia,  will become completely useless.</p>

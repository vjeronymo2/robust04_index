			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Community day of peace takes place in Northern Ireland TENS of thousands of people took part in a community day of peace in towns across Northern Ireland yesterday in a powerful call to loyalist and republican terrorists to abandon their campaigns of violence. Up to 30,000 people participated in the biggest demonstration, in Belfast. Thousands more attended 11 rallies held in other towns. The event was organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in response to a perceived groundswell in the community in favour of a fresh effort at reconciliation. The Confederation of British Industry encouraged companies to allow employees to attend demonstrations. A 'vote for peace' telephone line received more than 100,000 calls. In Dublin Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, led members of the Dail in observing the minute's silence. At about the same time shops, offices and businesses throughout the republic halted for a minute's silence.</p>

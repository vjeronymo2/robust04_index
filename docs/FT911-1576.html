			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Third party enters the calculation / Assessment of Thursday's local elections A new prime minister with a social conscience worn on his sleeve rather than on the sole of his shoe is not enough. Nor, after the local election results, can the Conservatives be sure that another point or so off the mortgage rate will renew Mr John Major's lease on 10 Downing Street. The focus yesterday understandably was on the spectacular surge in support for the Liberal Democrats. It would be churlish to begrudge the indefatigable Mr Paddy Ashdown his triumph. By-election victories in Eastbourne and Ribble Valley followed by a 20 per cent share of the vote on Thursday have confirmed that he has rescued his party from the oblivion threatened by its split with Dr David Owen's Social Democratic party. Dr Owen, who has never disguised his contempt for his erstwhile Liberal partners, has been left a supplicant at the doors of Conservative Central Office. The message emerging from the clatter of claims and counter-claims yesterday was that Mr Major could well lose the next general election. Mr Ashdown could end up helping Mr Neil Kinnock to replace him. At least one cabinet member was prepared to acknowledge that the bookmakers were justified in quoting Labour and the Conservatives as evens to emerge as the largest party. The unspoken thought in the back of ministerial and opposition minds was of a hung parliament. There will be no election until the autumn at the earliest. Mr Major is impatient for a new mandate. He hates the constant comparisons with Mrs Margaret Thatcher. He will go to the country in October if he can. But he is not so impatient that he can ignore the fact that his personal popularity has so far failed to persuade the voters to forget and forgive. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, refuses to speculate on the election date. But just as in recent weeks he has quietly been dishing the idea of June, so now he will emphasise that 1992 is a real option. The results this week were much worse than he had expected. Central Office's private polling - like the published opinion surveys - completely missed the surge in Liberal Democrat support. The final tally of losses was twice the 400 to 450 Mr Patten had prepared for. He can make a plausible case that the losses were damaging but not necessarily devastating. Depending on which samples you believe Labour had a lead of between 3 and 6 points in the national share of the vote. But exit polls suggested that in a general election, the government would have emerged with a slight lead. Mr Major started with a number of handicaps. His property-based alternative to the poll tax was announced only two-thirds of the way through the campaign. The economy is in the trough of the recession. Real incomes have been squeezed and most households have yet to see the Pounds 140 reduction in poll tax bills. The unfortunate timing of job losses at two NHS hospitals allowed Labour to put the health service high on the agenda in the crucial last few days. Senior ministers predict that the watershed in their fortunes will come on Friday May 17. Labour could well overturn the 10,000 Tory majority in the Monmouth by-election on the previous day. But Mr Patten and his colleagues are focusing on the publication on the Friday morning of the retail price index for April. It will show recorded inflation crashing down from more than 8 per cent to about 6 per cent. A cut in mortgage rates should follow. From then on, Mr Patten's scenario shows the economic news consistently improving. Inflation will be down to 4 per cent or below by the Autumn; mortgage rates will probably fall for a second time; the buoyant level of earnings of those in work will put real money into voters' pockets. Mr Major the ditherer will emerge as the prime minister who is unafraid to take tough decisions - but who then delivers on his promises. The government will begin to stake out its election battleground. Labour's policies on spending, taxation, the trades unions and defence will be the targets. The Tory assessment of Mr Kinnock's performance is similarly sanguine. The Labour leader, the argument runs, has been holding all the cards but he has failed to make a decisive breakthrough. Disenchantment with the government may persuade its supporters to lodge a protest vote with the Liberal Democrats, but they can be won back. Exit polls taken on Thursday lend credence to this view. They suggest, for example, that the Conservatives would retake Ribble Valley in a general election and that the Liberal Democrat share of the vote might fall to 15 per cent. It is a credible thesis and if there was dismay among Conservative MPs yesterday, there were few signs of the despair which gripped them last year. But the thesis ignores the vital importance in politics of momentum. After this week's voting, Mr Kinnock and Labour still hold the initiative. They will not relinquish it easily. In the House of Commons Mr Kinnock looks the more confident of the two leaders. The inferiority complex which dogged him when he faced Mrs Margaret Thatcher across the despatch box has gone. Mr Major, as he showed this week when under fire over the health service, has yet to find a rhythm. His responses to the opposition's attacks were brittle and unconvincing. The prime minister's aides can point to opinion polls showing him a far more popular choice in the country than Mr Kinnock. But that ignores the impact of parliamentary performances on the morale of their respective supporters; and sooner or later perceptions at Westminster tend to percolate into the public consciousness. There are other reasons for Labour cheer. If inflation is set to fall rapidly, unemployment is likely to rise just as fast over the next few months. Meanwhile Labour has demonstrated that it can win large numbers of votes in the south where the recession has been biting deepest. The Conservatives cannot take comfort from the surge in support for the Liberal Democrats. If Mr Ashdown's success was repeated in a general election, it would have little impact on the number of Liberal Democrat seats at Westminster. But it could severely damage the Conservatives by handing victory to Labour in large numbers of southern marginals. During the 1980s the rise in third-party support did much to keep the Conservatives in power. The parallels this week look closer to the rise in the Liberal vote in 1964 and 1974. On both occasions, it let Labour in. Mr Major can still win the general election. So too can Mr Kinnock.  --------------------------------------------------   TOTAL NUMBER OF COUNCILLORS ELECTED  --------------------------------------------------                     1987    1991   loss/gain Conservative       5,201   4,066    -1,135 Labour             3,075   3,747      +672 Alliance/Lib Dem   1,744   2,494      +750  --------------------------------------------------                SHARE OF VOTES  --------------------------------------------------              *estimates of votes              recorded on Thursday  --------------------------------------------------                            1987   1991* Conservative                40%    34% Labour                      31%    37% Alliance/Lib Dem            27%    21%  --------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Washington Apricot Marketing Committee met on May 16, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenditures of $13,602, which is $1,216 more in expenses than the $12,386 amount that was recommended for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.00 per ton of fresh apricots, which is a decrease of $2.50 in the assessment rate. In comparison, the 1993&hyph;94 assessment rate was $2.50 per ton. The Committee unanimously recommended bringing forward its reserve fund of $22,170 to pay budgeted expenses for the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year as an alternative to charging handlers an assessment rate. Shipments of fresh apricots are estimated at 5,200 tons. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $8,568, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington Cherry Marketing Committee met on May 17, 1994, and unanimously recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenses of $100,213 and an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of sweet cherries. In comparison, 1993&hyph;94 budgeted expenses were $139,313, with an approved assessment rate of $3.00 per ton. This represents a $39,100 decrease in expenses and a $2.00 decrease in the assessment rate from the amounts recommended for the current fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The assessment rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 40,000 tons of cherries, would yield $40,000 in assessment income. Adequate funds exist in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $74,695, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Washington-Oregon Fresh Prune Marketing Committee met on June 1, 1994, and recommended 1994&hyph;95 expenses of $18,760, which represents a $8,042 decrease in expenses from the $26,802 that was recommended for 1993&hyph;94 fiscal year. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $1.00 per ton of fresh prunes. In comparison, this is $2.00 less than the $3.00 per ton assessment rate that was approved for the previous fiscal year. Shipments of fresh prunes for 1994 are estimated at 6,500 tons, which would yield $6,500 in assessment income. Adequate funds exist in the Committee's reserve to cover additional expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funds in the reserve at the end of the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year, estimated at $22,800, will be within the maximum permitted by the order of one fiscal year's expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major expense categories for the Committees are for the administration of these marketing orders and for fresh prune research and sweet cherry market development activities. Administrative expenses include those for salaries, travel, and office operations. The stone fruit marketing Committees share office expenses, based on an agreement among the Committees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including information and recommendations submitted by the Committees and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule as hereinafter set forth will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553, it is also found and determined upon good cause that it is impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to give preliminary notice prior to putting this rule into effect and that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  because: (1) The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis; (2) the 1994&hyph;95 fiscal year for the Committees began April 1, 1994, and the marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable apricots, sweet cherries, and fresh prunes handled during the fiscal year; and (3) this interim final rule provides a 30-day comment period, and all comments timely received will be considered prior to finalization of this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 922 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Apricots, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 923 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Cherries, Marketing agreements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 7 CFR Part 924 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Marketing agreements, Plums, Prunes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 7 CFR parts 922, 923, and 924 are amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

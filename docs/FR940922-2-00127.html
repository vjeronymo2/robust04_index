FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance Harmonisation and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized regulatory requirements for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of Harmonisation is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite Harmonisation initiatives to be developed with input from both regulatory and industry representatives. FDA also seeks input from consumer representatives and others. ICH is concerned with Harmonisation of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Commission, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Researchers of America, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the ICH sponsors and the IFPMA, as well as observers from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  At a meeting held on March 23 and 24, 1992, the ICH Steering Committee agreed that the draft tripartite guideline entitled ``Draft Tripartite Guideline for the Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products'' should be made available for comment. Subsequently, the draft guideline was made available for comment by the European Union and Japan, as well as by FDA (see 58 FR 21086, April 16, 1993), in accordance with their consultation procedures. The comments were analyzed and the guideline was revised as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  With this notice, FDA is publishing a final guideline entitled ``Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products.'' This guideline has been endorsed by all ICH sponsors. The guideline addresses the generation of stability information for submission to FDA in NDA's for new molecular entities and associated drug products. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  This guideline may be useful immediately to applicants submitting NDA's to FDA. Sponsors submitting future applications may be asked to explain any differences from the approach suggested in this guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Additional ICH stability documents will be appended to this harmonized guideline when they have been finalized. FDA intends to update its 1987 guideline entitled ``Guideline for Submitting Documentation for the Stability of Human Drugs and Biologics'' to incorporate the new elements arising from the ICH process and other changes in stability testing that have occurred since 1987. For example, the updated guideline may include information and guidance on stability issues for investigational new drug applications, stability parameters for different dosage forms, recommendations for statistical analysis, stability testing for generic drugs, stability testing for biological and biotechnological products, and stability data presentation formats. Certain aspects of the updated guideline will also apply to products subject to licensing under the Public Health Service Act (biological products) and submitted to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Until the 1987 guideline is updated as needed and ICH sections are incorporated, FDA intends to provide both the ICH harmonized guideline, as contained in this notice, and the 1987 FDA guideline when information pertaining to stability testing of human drug and biological products is requested. At a future date, FDA may issue a new guideline publication that combines the guideline contained in this  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice with a revised 1987 FDA guideline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In the past, guidelines have generally been issued under &sect;10.90(b) (21 CFR 10.90(b)), which provides for the use of guidelines to state procedures or standards of general applicability that are not legal requirements but that are acceptable to FDA. The agency is now in the process of revising &sect;10.90(b). Therefore, this guideline is not being issued under the authority of &sect;10.90(b), and it does not create or confer any rights, privileges, or benefits for or on any person, nor does it operate to bind FDA in any way.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  As with all of FDA's guidelines, the public is encouraged to submit written comments with new data or other new information pertinent to this guideline. The comments in the docket will be periodically reviewed, and where appropriate, the guideline will be amended. The public will be notified of any such amendments through a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Interested persons may, at any time, submit written comments on the guideline to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. The guideline and received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the final guideline follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Stability Testing of New Drug Products and Substances <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 -->  ICH Harmonized Tripartite Guideline Endorsed by the ICH Steering Committee at Step 4 of the ICH Process, 27 October 1993 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Preamble <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The following guideline sets out information on stability testing for a Registration Application within the three areas of the EC, Japan, and the USA.

The degree of variability of individual batches affects the confidence that a future production batch will remain within specification until the retest date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  An acceptable approach for quantitative characteristics that are expected to decrease with time is to determine the time at which the 95 percent one-sided confidence limit for the mean degradation curve intersects the acceptable lower specification limit. If analysis shows that the batch to batch variability is small, it is advantageous to combine the data into one overall estimate and this can be done by first applying appropriate statistical tests (for example, p values for level of significance of rejection of more than 0.25) to the slopes of the regression lines and zero time intercepts for the individual batches. If it is inappropriate to combine data from several batches, the overall retest period may depend on the minimum time a batch may be expected to remain within acceptable and justified limits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The nature of any degradation relationship will determine the need for transformation of the data for linear regression analysis. Usually the relationship can be represented by a linear, quadratic, or cubic function on an arithmetic or logarithmic scale. Statistical methods should be employed to test the goodness of fit of the data on all batches and combined batches (where appropriate) to the assumed degradation line or curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The data may show so little degradation and so little variability that it is apparent from looking at the data that the requested retest period will be granted. Under the circumstances, it is normally unnecessary to go through the formal statistical analysis but merely to provide a full justification for the omission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Limited extrapolation of the real time data beyond the observed range to extend expiration dating at approval time, particularly where the accelerated data support this, may be undertaken.

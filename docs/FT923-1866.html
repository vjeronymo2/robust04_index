			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Maastricht - The Economic Fallout: Estonians hold first free elections THE Republic of Estonia, the smallest of the former Soviet republics, yesterday voted for a parliament and president in the first free elections in the country since before the second world war. The 1.6m population had a choice among four candidates for the presidency, which will be a directly elective one only this time, and which is envisaged as having limited powers. Two of the candidates - Mr Arnold Ruutel, the current and long-serving chairman of the Supreme Council, and Mr Rein Taagepera, a university professor who has spent much of his life in the US - are moderate nationalists. Both Mr Lennart Meri, the former foreign minister, and Mrs Lagle Parek, a former political prisoner, take a radical nationalist stance. Mr Ruutel commanded a consistent lead in pre-election polls, in spite of his past as a senior communist. However, the election has been made controversial by the exclusion of voting under the new citizenship rules of over a third of the electorate. The 660,000 eligible to vote all had to show that they were directly descended from pre-war Estonian citizens, a measure which excludes nearly all the Russians and other former Soviet nationalities who emigrated there after 1945. Mr Nicolai Medvedev, head of the commission on Russian-Estonian relations, said in Moscow at the weekend that Russia was now concerned about a nationalist government trying to create a 'mono-ethnic state' in Estonia.</p>

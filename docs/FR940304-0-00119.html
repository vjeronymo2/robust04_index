			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Section 279.10(g)_Used Oil Introduced Into Crude Oil Pipelines or Petroleum Refining Facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 279.10(g)(1)_Used Oil Introduced Into Crude Oil Pipelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The September 10, 1992, final used oil regulations provided an exemption at &sect;279.10(g) from management standards for used oil that is placed directly into a crude oil pipeline (see 57 FR 41613). Today's rule replaces &sect;279.10(g) with &sect;279.10(g)(1) which clarifies the original intent of the pipeline exemption. Section 279.10(g) of the September 10, 1992, final rule provided that ``Used oil that is placed directly into a crude oil, oil or natural gas pipeline is subject to the management standards of [part 279] only prior to the point of introduction into the pipeline. Once the used oil is introduced to the pipeline, the material is exempt from the requirements of [part 279].''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is concerned that the phrase, ``placed directly into a crude oil or natural gas pipeline,'' can be literally interpreted to apply more narrowly than the Agency had intended. EPA understands that it is standard practice to first mix small amounts of used oil, typically less than 1%, with crude oil in stock tanks, production separators or other tank units that are connected via pipeline to the petroleum refining facility (i.e., pre-pipeline units). It was not EPA's intent to exclude used oil that is mixed with crude oil in these pre-pipeline units from the &sect;279.10(g) pipeline exemption. Rather, EPA intended to include this practice within the meaning of ``direct insertion.'' Because used oil is typically inserted into the petroleum pipeline through these pre-pipeline units, to exclude these units from the pipeline exemption would effectively render the exemption meaningless. Clearly this was not EPA's intent. Today's rule revises the language of the exemption to clarify that used oil may be inserted into the pipeline via pre-pipeline units (which contain crude oil) exempt from the requirements of part 279. It should be noted here that the &sect;279.10(g)(1) pipeline exemption established by today's rule is limited to pipelines that convey crude oil from off-site locations to the petroleum refining facility. The exemption does not apply to pipelines that convey crude oil from one on-site location within a petroleum refinery to another. If such on-site piping contains used oil, it is exempt only if it qualifies under &sect;&sect;279.10(g)(2)&hyph;(5) discussed below. Also, if processing of the used oil is performed prior to mixing with crude oil in these pre-pipeline units, such processing remains subject to the part 279, subpart F standards for used oil processors and re-refiners. Used oil that is generated and stored at the pipeline is subject to the used oil generator standards prior to mixing with crude oil. Used oil that is transported to the pipeline and immediately mixed with crude oil or stored for less than 24 hours prior to such mixing is subject to all Subpart E transporter standards except for &sect;279.45 which applies to transfer facilities. Used oil that is transported to and subsequently stored at the pipeline for more than 24 hours and less than 35 days prior to mixing with crude oil is subject to all the part 279, subpart E transporter/transfer facility requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 279.10(g)(2)_Storage and Transportation of Mixtures of Used Oil and Crude Oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 279.10(g)(2) of today's rule expands the used oil management standard exemption to include: (1) Mixtures of used oil and crude oil containing less than 1% used oil that are being stored at the petroleum refining facility or in discrete units remotely located from the pipeline, as long as the mixture is destined for the refinery and inserted prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking; and (2) mixtures of used oil and crude oil containing less than 1% used oil that are being transported (via truck, rail, or vessel) to the petroleum refinery or the pipeline for insertion into the petroleum refining process prior to crude distillation or catalytic cracking. The former exemption provided at &sect;279.10(g) did not apply either to mixtures of used oil and crude oil that are stored at the petroleum refinery or in remotely located units, or to the transportation of mixtures of used oil and crude oil. The previous, more narrow exemption was based on the assumption that used oil was placed directly into the pipeline (or into units directly connected to the pipeline as previously discussed). EPA assumed that the mixing of used oil and crude oil occurred at the point at which used oil was inserted into the pipeline. EPA has since learned, however, that mixing frequently occurs at exploration and production sites that are remotely located from the pipeline or the petroleum refinery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

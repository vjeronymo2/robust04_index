			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLUMBIA S&amp;L CHIEF SPIEGEL OUT AT YEAR END  </P> <P> Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Assn. chief Thomas Spiegel said today he would quit  as chairman and chief executive on Dec. 31, blaming the collapsing junk bond  market that has sent the Beverly Hills-based thrift reeling.  </P> <P> Under the leadership of Spiegel, a former Wall Street trader, Columbia had  invested more heavily than any other thrift in junk bonds, and turned big  profits on them until recently. Its assets zoomed from $400 million in 1974 to  more than $13 billion this year.  </P> <P> He said he would become a consultant to Columbia, devoting all his time to  creating a subsidiary into which the high-yield, high-risk securities can be  spun off, and allowing a new leader to recreate Columbia as a more traditional  lender.  </P> <P> Under new laws, thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through separately  capitalized affiliates rather than using government-insured deposits.  </P> <P> Columbia also said that because of problems with those investments, it will be  unable to meet the tougher requirements for risk-based capital contained in the  thrift bailout bill signed in August by President Bush.  </P> <P> Spiegel, who was paid $5.6 million in 1987 and $4.1 million last year, said the  soured junk-bond market made his full-time attention to creating the new  subsidiary a matter of urgency.  </P> <P> Columbia said it already had begun interviewing potential successors.  </P> <P> Spiegel, a friend of junk bond wizard Michael Milken, angered federal thrift  regulators for years by amassing Columbia's huge portfolio of junk bonds. He  also is known for his close ties to political figures, and set up the junk bond  investment for former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho that forced the Democrat  to resign last May.  </P></p>

			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Users warn on N-power levy LARGE energy users warned yesterday that proposals to reduce the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy on electricity bills would not be substantial enough or speedy enough to solve the problems facing industry. Mr Mike Brogden, chief executive of ICI Chemicals and Polymers, said he was encouraged that the industry regulator Offer and the generator PowerGen - both of which have called this week for a cut in the levy - accepted that power prices were uncompetitive. He said: 'However, I am also disappointed that the solution being proposed is far too small, and on a timescale which will not solve the serious problem on energy costs.' The 11 per cent levy was imposed on all electricity bills after the privatisation of the fossil-fuel generators to subsidise the higher costs of other sources of electricity. More than 95 per cent of the levy goes to Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator. Mr Brogden has told Offer and the Department of Trade and Industry that ICI's chlor-alkali business on Merseyside, which is one of the biggest consumers of electricity in the UK. has faced increases in electricity costs of almost 60 per cent since April last year. This had made it increasingly uncompetitive with producers in Europe and North America, and had brought cuts in production. Mr Ian Blakey, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said he was pleased that Offer was 'prepared to listen'. He said, however, that a reduction in the nuclear levy did not go far enough and industry should be the principal beneficiary of any reduction in prices.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei turns lower as trusts take profits ACTIVE profit-taking by investment trusts and corporate investors eroded morning gains, and the Nikkei average slipped below 19,000, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index lost a net 85.22 at 18,963.16 after a day's high of 19,089.14. It set a low of 18,853.24 in the afternoon, but then improved as share prices recouped some of their losses towards the end on bargain hunting by individuals. Volume declined from 678m shares to 620m and falls finally led rises by 550 to 489, with 135 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 2.48 to 1,452.54, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dipped 3.48 to 1,155.06. Traders said sentiment was still firm. Foreigners have been leading buyers of late, although some remain sceptical over economic recovery. 'Everyone is afraid of missing a rally,' said one analyst. For example, foreign ownership of Sumitomo Bank's tradable shares - those not held by stable shareholders - has risen from 18 to 63 per cent. Daily average trading volume for March is expected to top 400m shares for the first time since September 1991. Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said about one-half of recent activity had been generated by dealers. At corporate level, a front page article in a local business daily, saying that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was considering raising local rates on regular phones, boosted Nippon Telegraph and Telephone by Y34,000 to Y875,000. The rise pushed up other telecom-related shares, Kyowa Exeo adding Y100 at Y1,090 and Fujikura gaining Y65 at Y838. Tsumura, the largest manufacturer of Chinese medicines, was the top performing stock, advancing by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,430. Reports that it has found an anti-Aids drug among Chinese herbal medicine preparations encouraged speculators. Green Cross, a speculative favourite, moved ahead Y60 to Y1,370. Financial institutions were lower on profit-taking. Industrial Bank of Japan lost Y40 to Y2,520 and Sakura Bank slipped Y20 to Y1,310. In Osaka, the OSE average put on 41.22 at 20,388.14 in volume of 37m shares. Retail and electronics issues were higher. Nintendo, the video game maker, gained Y170 at Y9,760. Roundup SOME OF THE Pacific Basin markets put on strong per-formances yesterday. HONG KONG took heart at political developments, although late profit-taking trimmed gains from futures-linked buying. The Hang Seng index ended 83.59, or 1.3 per cent, higher at 6,406.49, having peaked at 6,442.43, in turnover of HKDollars 3.91bn. News that the Executive Council had not decided on a date for submitting the Hong Kong governor's democratic reform bill to the legislature added to the advance. Lower than expected government land auction prices came too late to be reflected in the market and properties made a strong showing. Cheung Kong rose 20 cents to HKDollars 22.90, Henderson Land added 60 cents at HKDollars 19.10 and Hysan was 20 cents higher at HKDollars 14.70. Swire Pacific, whose property unit took a stake in the biggest lot sold, rose 75 cents to HKDollars 33.25. AUSTRALIAN stocks rallied after data showed a higher January current account deficit, but most of the gains were subsequently given up and the All Ordinaries index closed just 1.2 ahead at 1,678.2 in turnover of ADollars 296.6m. BHP eased 2 cents to ADollars 14.86 after saying that a 24-hour strike in its steel division had cost about 20,000 tonnes in lost production of raw steel. Great Central Mines, the diamond and gold explorer, climbed ADollars 3 further to ADollars 18 on strong US interest. MANILA edged higher in quiet trading and the composite index rose 8.30 to 1,448.40. PLDT firmed 5 pesos to 900 pesos. Late the previous day President Fidel Ramos had ordered an investigation into the ownership of shares to resolve a long-running dispute between the government, the family of the former president, Ferdinand Marcos, and two other prominent local families over ownership of a holding company which has 24 per cent of the shares. TAIWAN closed sharply higher on buying triggered by the Formosa Plastics group's announcement on Monday that it would soon begin building its long-delayed USDollars 7.5bn naphtha cracker. The weighted index rose 144.05, or 3.1 per cent, to 4,750.70 in fairly active turnover of TDollars 59.54bn. The plastics sector added 4.1 per cent in response to the developments and Formosa strengthened TDollars 2.70 to TDollars 45. BOMBAY continued its retreat under year-end selling pressure, the BSE index finishing 74.12, or 3.3 per cent, lower at 2,202.78.</p>

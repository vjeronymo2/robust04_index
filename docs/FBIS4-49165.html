			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 3 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton said today that he does not wish to withdraw the Most  Favored Nation (MFN) status from China.    "If we were to withdraw the most favored nation status from  China, it would undermine what I hope to see in terms of our  relationship," Clinton told CNN from Atlanta, Georgia.    "And it would be detrimental to the economic progress of  China and to the standard of living which has come to so many  millions, indeed hundreds of millions of Chinese people," he  added.    The President claimed that what he had sought to do is "to  find a balanced way for our two countries not simply to be  partners, but to restore our genuine friendship" by trying to  establish conditions that would permit that partnership and that  friendship to go forward.    "Those are the criteria I set forward in order to continue  the Most Favored Nation status next month," he said.    "I will say we have made real progress in our relations with  China" in many areas, Clinton said, but "we still have a way to  go."    He stressed that "I would work personally very hard to work  out our differences so that we could go forward together."    Clinton also claimed that human rights is very important to  the United States and there are some issues that the United  States has an extra responsibility to stand up for: human  rights, non-proliferation and other things.    "I am doing it in the spirit of genuine reconciliation and  hope that in the next month our two great nations can work this  out," the President said.</p>

Narasimha Rao, today warned that the balance between religion  and politics, which are distinct and separate spheres, is under  challenge as never before. "Freedom of religion does not imply  freedom to misuse religion for political ends," he said while  opening an international conference on `religion and politics'  here.    Cautioning the people against divisions of majority and  minority on the basis of religion, he said the polarisation with  a religious focus was sought to be turned into "political  polarisation for party advantage."    "This obviously violates the basic secular structure of the  Constitution under which democracy operates. The line between  the two is thus abundantly clear and needs to be enforced in  whatever manner necessary," he stressed.    Organised by Rajiv Gandhi Institute for Contemporary  Studies,  under the aegis of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, the conference has  drawn distinquished scholars from India and abroad. The Human  Resource Development Minister, Mr. Arjun Singh and Ms. Sonia  Gandhi, chairperson of Rajiv Gandhi Foundation, attended the  conference.    Mr. Rao said religion has and will continue to have a  profound influence on the way people think, feel, act and react.  This influence could not be wished away but the issue had to be  examined with an empathetic understanding of human nature and  evolve solutions in consonance with it.    Three key points: Highlighting three important  aspects, Mr. Rao said that first the Constitution had the  necessary clarity to specify the domain of religion in respect  of politics and to take care of any transgressions. Second,  freedom of religion does not imply freedom to misuse religion  for political ends and this needs to be specifically spelt out.  Third, our ancient civilisation provides a sound base on which  to build a model for regulating the interaction of religion and  politics.    Dwelling upon religious tolerance in Indian society, Mr. Rao  said a liberal outlook was the distinctive feature of our  civilisation. "This is a remarkable example of a society, and a  polity, in which there is a wide range of religious communities  that co-existed over long centuries," he said.    Brushing aside as "romantic" suggestions that the  co-existence between diverse religious communities had been  entirely free of social violence and communal strife, Mr. Rao  said the dominant characteristic of religious interaction within  Indian society is that of tolerance and harmony.    It would be appropriate for scholars to explore how our  religious and political leaders were able to create in the past  a durable, liberal society within a multi-religious polity.  Pausing upon his reflections, the Prime Minister added that  while life is taken as comprehensive, its various aspects have  also been developed separately, each with an autonomy which  makes it free and unaffected by the other to a great extent.  "This could be a form of the separation of religion from  politics, which has been achieved quite naturally and  spontaneously. Neither has questioned the other, nor interfered  with the other. There appears to be no time when an adversarial  relationship developed between religion and the political  process."    Paying rich tributes to Mahatma Gandhi whose 46th death  anniversary was observed today, the Prime Minister said it was  tragic that this apostle of non-violence met his end at the  hands of a religious fanatic. "In the manner of his death we  have a demonstration of the difference between faith and  fanaticism and of the damage that religious fanaticism can  inflict."    `Disturbing develoments': Stressing the need to  examine the relation between religion and politics urgently  because of certain disturbing developments in recent years, Mr.  Rao expressed disdain over the divisive influence of religious  fanaticism on the international scene. "Today, when a scholar  proposes that the next major conflict in the world will be on  religious lines, people listen with attention. Forty years back  such a thesis would have been dismissed out of hand," he said.    In his keynote address, Mr. Arjun Singh said the foundations  of the Constitution rest upon the sanctity of liberal  institutions and also upon the freedom of religious worship. The  imperative to strike a meaningful balance between religion and  politics to avoid disruption of social order and human progress  is universally recognised, he said.    In her brief opening remarks, Ms. Sonia Gandhi, touched upon  the universality of Indian culture. She said the beauty and  profundity of Indian culture was that it had received and  welcomed several faiths and was home to several major religions.</p>

This was announced by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey  Krylov in an interview with INTERFAX.    He noted that the Russian troops stationed in Latvia and put  on high alert following the incident did not leave their base  area and did not undertake any aggressive actions.    According to Sergey Krylov, this gross and unprecedented  action was possibly aimed to provoke Russia into taking  retaliatory measures. It is regrettable that it took place at  the time of the Russian-Latvian talks in Riga, when progress had  just emerged on the key aspects of the issue of Russian troop  pullout.    The diplomat stressed that Russia is not intent on tough  confrontation and is not interested in seeing the talks  disrupted. He also noted that the incident in Riga coincided  with the NATO summit in Brussels. "It is not ruled out that  Russia's sharp retaliatory moves could have become a weighty  argument for Latvia in favor of the earliest possible accession  to the North Atlantic alliance." The deputy minister suggested  that this was precisely the design by the action's organizers.</p>

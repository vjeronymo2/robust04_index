Sixty-seven small,  shallow, operationally induced cracks have been discovered in  the ferruginous pipes of the feed-water system filled with  mildly radioactive water, a spokesman for the Schleswig-Holstein  Energy Ministry confirmed in Kiel today. The cracks, which were  caused by extensibility corrosion, are to be repaired through  restoration work.    Three cracks had already been discovered in the welding  seams  of the austenitic steel of the nuclear reactor during a series  of special surprise tests carried out within the framework of  fuel exchange of fuel rods last September. The plant, which is  situated east of Hamburg, has been shut down since August 1993.  The test of 876 seams in the ferruginous system was ordered  when a leak was discovered in the feed-water system.    The nuclear plant of Brunsbuettel, which is just as  important  for the production of electricity for Hamburg, was also shut  down in the summer of 1992 because of numerous cracks. The  restarting of both reactors cannot yet be foreseen, according to  the ministry.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Survey of European Finance and Investments - Portugal (7): Independence strengthened - Patrick Blum discusses the central bank's changing role SINCE 1984, Portugal's financial system has been through more change than any other sector of the economy. New private banks and financial institutions sprung up from nowhere to become leading players on the domestic market, offering new services, using more modern methods, and bringing fresh ideas to shake the complacency of the state-owned and state-run banking establishment. Deregulation gradually helped open up markets and the economy to international market forces. Liberalisation was given a further push by European Community membership and the need to meet requirements for financial services and institutions. By 1992, Portugal will have to comply with the bulk of EC directives on the liberalisation of the financial system except for short-term capital movements for which it has won a reprieve likely to last for another two to three years. The Banco de Portugal (central bank) which for years after the 1974 revolution had been little more than a conveyor belt for Finance Ministry edicts has not escaped the movement for reform, winning a new, more independent lease of life. It is now undergoing a programme of important changes that has already strengthened its independence and improved its operations. Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, the bank's governor, says that within three to four years the reform will be completed and the bank will have radically changed structures. 'At the end of that period we'll have a structure composed of six main departments organised on the basis of the essential functions of the bank, compared with 19 departments when we started with the reform, and 12 departments now,' he says. The six departments will be responsible separately for economic research, the money markets, foreign exchange operations, banking supervision, staff and administration, and issuing currency. Each one will have its own director. The streamlining of functions will be accompanied with a streamlining of staff which will be reduced from about 3,000 at the start of the reform almost two years ago (now 2,300) to about 2,000 employees. But at least as important for the bank are the reforms outlined in a draft law approved last autumn enhancing its autonomy. While Portugal's central bank will not be as independent as Germany's Bundesbank, it will be more independent than the Bank of England or the Banque de France. In the past, the central bank was independent only in theory. It was described as the country's issuing bank, responsible for foreign exchange regulations and currency management, as well as for the orientation and control of monetary policy, but with an important proviso: that it would carry out all these functions 'within the guidelines' established by the Finance Ministry. And while it could give its opinion on monetary and fiscal policy, in practice the last word always belonged to the government. The bank was essentially an administrative, and at times, political, instrument of government. In what was a highly regulated financial environment the central bank acted as a gendarme to ensure that the minutiae of economic and monetary policy dictated by the Finance Ministry in great detail was properly enforced. Under its new statutes, it has won far greater freedom of action and is required to fulfil its functions 'taking into account' government policies. It 'collaborates in defining' monetary and exchange rate policy and 'keeps a watch over the stability of the financial system'. It advises on monetary and financial policy, and is responsible for supervising the monetary, financial and foreign exchange markets. It is also no longer obliged, as in the past, to lend funds to the government. It was not uncommon for a government suddenly pressed for cash to ask the bank for the money. This was a convenient way for governments to hide part of their indebtedness and raise money cheaply since interest rates were set administratively. The bank could argue, but in practice it could not reject a government request for credit. The bank's management and the position of its governor have also been strengthened and given greater responsibilities. In the past the bank's only authority was its collective management board of which the governor was an administrative chairman, but under the new statutes the governor's role and authority have been enhanced.</p>

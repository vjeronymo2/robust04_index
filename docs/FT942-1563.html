			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: India clears way for private forestry boost - Moves to allow wood-based industries to join in the replanting effort India, which is far from achieving its target of bringing at least one-third of the total land area under tree cover has finally seen the merit of allowing the wood based industries to start forestry plantation in degraded forest land. Captive plantation by industries calls, however, for major amendments to the national forest policy of 1988. Mr Kamal Nath, minister of environment and forests, had given manufacturers of paper, plywood and viscose fibre to understand that the government will allow them to take large tracts of degraded forest on leases of at least 30 years to grow an ideal mix of long and short maturing trees. The lessees will also have the right to grow cash crops in among the trees. Of India's total waste land of nearly 160m hectares, the share of degraded forest is about 40m ha with a crown density of less than 20 per cent. The National Wastelands Development Board was given a target to bring 5m hectares under tree plantation every year. But the resources at its command have not allowed the board to plant on more than 2m hectares a year. According to Mr SP Goenka, president of the Federation of Indian Plywood Industry, the induction of the private sector into forestry plantation would not only 'ease the pressure on the government, which is short of funds, but it would also create millions of job opportunities in the Indian villages'. The forestry plantation industry, a totally new concept in India, will create jobs for three workers a hectare. So the policy initiative would appear to have the potential to create 120m jobs. As the forest cover in India is barely 12 per cent and forestry productivity is only one-fifth that of Europe, the government has imposed severe restrictions on the procurement of wood and bamboo by industries. It is, however, the demand for fuel wood by the poor villagers and illegal felling of trees to make room for food production that have actually played havoc with Indian forests. The government has sought to give relief to the wood-based industries by allowing them to import timber, pulp and waste paper. Some paper and plywood manufacturers have gone in for social and farm forestry by establishing direct contact with the farmers, as allowed by the 1988 forest policy. According to the Indian Paper Mills Association, 'the social and farm forestry cannot be a dependable source of raw material for the industry since the farmers are free to sell the trees to anybody'. Mr Goenka says the success of private sector participation in forestry plantation will call for an 'attitudinal change of the official agencies at the federal and state level. The government financial institutions should be ready to provide adequate funds by accepting mortgage of trees'. Tree plantation has a seven year cycle. If the private forestry plantation work is flagged off soon, then the Indian wood based industries, which have not seen much growth in recent years, will have the confidence to plan for new capacity. India could also emerge as an important exporter of wood and wood based products within ten years, says Mr Goenka.</p>

A presidential  decree to this effect is expected after the New Year Holidays.    A well-placed source does not rule out that Yeltsin may  modify the proposals, drafted by and large by First Vice-Premier  Yegor Gaydar and his team.    According to a presidential spokesman, candidates to a  reformed government have been asked to decide where to work: in  parliament or in the council of ministers. Although, formally,  the presidential decree on the possibility of alternating  ministerial job with parliamentary activity is still in effect,  future cabinet members have been told that such alternation  would be inexpedient.    It is assumed that the Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin  will have four deputies, one or two first assistants among them.  Yegor Gaydar will retain the post of first vice-premier. It is  not clear yet whether the current first deputy Oleg Soskovets  will keep his rank or become an ordinary assistant.    Anatoliy Chubays and Boris Fedorov are regarded as the most-  likely candidates to yet another two vice premier vacancies.  However, vice-premiers will most probably be barred from  combining their posts with ministerial jobs. Fedorov is  currently Finance Minister, and Chubays is in charge of the  State Property Committee.    According to information from other sources, the situation  with Fedorov is not fully clear. It's not ruled out that he may  merely become finance minister and quit the post of vice-premier.    These sources regard as virtually settled the issue on the  resignation of the current Vice-Premiers Aleksandr Shokhin and  Sergey Shakhray.    They believe that First Deputy Premier Vladimir Shumeyko may  resign, if he is nominated to the office of Speaker of the  Federation Council - the new Parliament's Upper House.    The number of ministries is planned to be cut down to 30  with  those reduced to be transformed into state committees. As a  result of the reform, the cabinet's staff is to be slashed by  20-30 percent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santo Domingo, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Several coinciding  reports indicate a Dominican soldier shot to death a young  Haitian man today as several Haitians tried to cross the border  into the Dominican Republic to purchase supplies. The victim  was identified as July Jean, 24, who was hit in the temple by a  bullet.    In initial explanations to reporters, Army spokespersons  have  said July Jean and several other Haitians tried to attack an  Army soldier who shot his rifle while trying to defend himself,  seriously wounding the man. The young man was taken to Mella  Hospital in Dajabon, where he died. The victim lived in the  township of Juan Jimenez, near Dajabon.    Hundreds of Haitians come to the border everyday in an  attempt to dodge patrols and enter the Dominican Republic in  search of food, fuel, and medicine.    July Jean is the second Haitian to die within the last 10  days. The first was an unidentified young man of just under 20  years of age, also shot by a Dominican Army soldier.    The recently intensified embargo against the military regime  ruling in Port-au-Prince includes fencing off the land and sea  borders around Haiti. The line dividing Haiti and the Dominican  Republic, the two Caribbean nations that share the island of La  Hispaniola, is 300 km long.    Santo Domingo reluctantly agreed to deploy Army troops to  control the region. The request came as a result of pressure  from Washington, following numerous reports of contraband,  especially fuel, crossing the border. The flow hampered the  effects of the blockade to dislodge the Port-au-Prince regime  and reinstate deposed President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>

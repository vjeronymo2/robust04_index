			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Silver market retreats to seven-month lows Silver prices dropped in London yesterday to the lowest levels for nearly seven months following a sharp plunge in New York late on Friday caused mainly by heavy trade selling. The silver price was 'fixed' in London at Dollars 5.05 a troy ounce, its lowest since January 28. It was also nearly 3 per cent below Friday's 'fix' and 12 per cent below this year's peak of Dollars 5.74 3/4 an ounce reached on March 24. The price recovered slightly to close in London last night at Dollars 5.06 1/2 , down 6 cents from Friday's close. Dealers cited various technical factors for Friday's drop in the price for September delivery on the New York Commodity Exchange. Silver's failure to break through the technical resistance level at Dollars 5.20 an ounce had disappointed some speculators, they said. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, suggested that silver was more likely to fall below Dollars 5 an ounce in coming months than rise to the Dollars 6 some US hedge and commodity funds were said to be targeting earlier this year. 'There are signs that the Swiss and the Arab syndicates are begining to feel that a more aggressive short selling technique may pay dividends in coming weeks,' said Mr Arnold in Merrill's latest Base &amp; Precious Metals Report. The Swiss seemed to be aiming to drive down the silver price first to Dollars 5.15, then to Dollars 5.07 and finally Dollars 4.95 an ounce. Mr Arnold forecast that in the next two or three months silver would trade between Dollars 4.50 and Dollars 5.60 an ounce.</p>

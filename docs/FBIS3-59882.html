An end to the uncertainty of the new recruits. Enough of  "the slave market" in the courtyard of the Absorption and  Classification Center, to the bargaining between the corps of  the army and "the fresh meat" that is unloaded from the buses.    Next week, the first class of recruits, of which a portion  already knows where it is going in the army even before it sets  foot in the Absorption and Classification Center, will be on its  way. The other part, which does not yet know, will still go  through the old route. In February, so they are hoping in the  IDF [israel Defense Forces], everything will change, everything  will be new.    The IDF worked for years with a method that was not  examined,  but became a norm. The method was called "the orders method":  every candidate for defense service (Mashlab) received sometime  in 11th grade "the first order," that white envelope with the  army stamp. He opened it, understood that the end of youth had  arrived, and ran immediately to his buddies.    The Mashlab was called to report to the Mobilization Bureau  and to go through the first of the seven circles of Hell, at the  end of which he would get a personal number and he would become  a soldier in the army of the Jewish people.    Afterwards, after a few months, the Mashlab--the high-school  pupil who had not yet lost his long hair and the  earring--received "the second order," another nail in the coffin  of youth, and he again made his way, with some scorn, to the  Mobilization Bureau. The goal this time--psychotechnical  examinations, medical examinations for evaluation, with a female  soldier only a few months older than he but who thinks that she  is at least as smart as God.    On the basis of these examinations, a profile was determined  for the Mashlab (another number, mightily fateful) and the Kaba  (quality group), and afterwards he was given a mobilization  date. With these statistics, the recruit arrived at the  Absorption and Classification Center (generally after a massacre  of a haircut), to the meeting with the classification officer.  On the way, he went through the chain of becoming a soldier,  which included injections, a photograph with a number,  fingerprints, and one unavoidable question: "To whom to you wish  to bequeath the money if, heaven forbid..."    In that discussion with the classification officer, which  generally lasted a minute and a half (depending on the patience  and the length of the line), the impatient classification  officers would present the frightened recruit the possibilities  before him. For example: artillery, armor, or combat  engineering. The recruit had only to rank these possibilities by  preference. That is exactly how it worked, but around this rapid  and nervous process they wrapped high-sounding words like  "consideration for the desires of the soldier and the  requirements of the system."    The chief of the Manpower Branch of the general staff, Major  General Yoram Ya'ir, was the first one, who during the past year  set a target before his people: to change the clumsy, outmoded,  and wasteful method of classification and mobilization.    Ya'ir brought a new idea, which was intended to make the old  method more efficient, to spare the young soldier the tension  and the uncertainty, and to spare the IDF system the traffic jam  in the Absorption and Classification Center. In the previous  method, the recruit was sometimes forced to wait a number of  weeks until the completion of the quota required for opening  basic training. Meanwhile, the recruits would carry out  "interesting" busy work such as painting the trees in the  Absorption and Classification Center or repainting the curbs. A  pleasure.    A deep and fundamental change was made in the new method,  which begins to go into operation, as was stated, next week. The  basic idea: instead of examining the recruit's preference only  in the Absorption and Classification Center, the stage of the  questions and the clarifications will be carried out several  months before induction. A form, with a summary of his data and  the possibilities open to him, will be sent to each recruit at  home, just like the registration process for university.    Under the heading "The Mobilization Method Mobilizes for  You," the recruit is asked to specify the unit to which he  prefers to be called, the classification is carried out  afterwards, and in the end each recruit receives a notice of  where he has been assigned. This happens a few months before  induction.    Maj. Gen. Ya'ir, the father of the method, presented it to  Prime Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to Chief  of Staff Ehud Barak, and the two approved it. There were those  who raised an eyebrow and asked why did they wait with it for so  many years. Where were all of the geniuses before that.    In the IDF they say that the new method will make it  possible  for the military to get an overall picture of the recruits and  will prevent pressure on the Absorption and Classification  Center. The end has come for the era of lobbying by the members  of the various service arms to entice the soldiers with worn-out  image films, presented by smiling paratroopers, that hid the  blood, the sweat, and the tears.    The commanders of the units to which they will be mobilized  already await the recruits who will arrive next week at the  Absorption and Classification Center. The commanders will  accompany them throughout the process, and will reduce, so it is  hoped, their tension. Those recruits who will seek to challenge  their attachment to an armored company and who will prefer to  serve in the IDF spokesman's film unit, for example, are  promised a hearing. The answer also is promised. (Army, baby, do  not deceive yourself. Armor!)    The military is saving tens of millions of shekels through  the new method. After the run of the test program in the  November mobilization, it will continue also in the following  mobilizations.    And if you, those who have not yet been drafted, receive the  questionnaires at home in these days--sit quietly, think for a  moment, fill out the questionnaires carefully, and cross your  fingers. Hard. You are next in line.</p>

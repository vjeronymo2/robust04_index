			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 103 AND ROXANI GILLESPIE  </P> <P> A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 103, for relief from high auto  insurance rates. However, the insurance commissioner is exempting major  insurers, at least until the completion of a proposed 10-year study of what  Voter Revolt's leaders have termed "cooked books." The commissioner and many  state legislators suggest a "no-fault" alternative, which, however, the  majority voted down.  </P> <P> A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 99, taxing our tobacco  purchases specifically to provide badly needed funds for our state's failing  system of trauma-care centers. Although the tax has been raised on cigarettes,  the Governor reshuffled the budget with the result that our hospital systems  receive little or none of the increased revenue. The sick, injured, and dying  are shuffled from one emergency room to another all around town.  </P> <P> A majority of Californians voted for Proposition 65, for controlling our  exposure to toxic chemicals. However, the Governor exempted all chemicals but  those found carcinogenic in tests on humans, and labeling on individual  products, as required by that law, went unenforced. We are told to call "hot  lines" now found to be inadequate.  </P> <P> I love our country, but I understand why most of our citizens do not vote.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS EVAN DRENKOW  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

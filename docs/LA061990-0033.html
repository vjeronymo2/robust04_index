			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL BOARD MOVES TO TAKE AMBASSADOR HOTEL;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: REPRESENTATIVES OF DONALD TRUMP, OWNER OF THE SITE, SAY THEY'LL GO  TO COURT TO BLOCK BUILDING OF A HIGH SCHOOL ON THE MID-WILSHIRE PARCEL.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Unified School District trustees voted Monday to begin condemnation  proceedings to take over the Ambassador Hotel, despite a prediction by a  representative of Donald Trump that the developer will win a suit to prevent  the district from building a high school on the site.  </P> <P> Barbara Res, executive vice president for Trump Wilshire Associates, told the  board the $73 million that the district is offering for 17 acres of the 23-acre  site is far below the up to $200 million the developer believes the property is  worth.  </P> <P> She accused the board of "fiscal irresponsibility" for choosing to build a  school on "some of the world's most expensive property," and predicted that the  Trump organization will prove in court that the environmental impact report for  the project is inadequate.  </P> <P> The district, Res said, "will be embroiled for years in litigation it cannot  win."  </P> <P> She also accused the board of "sabotaging" efforts to revitalize the  Mid-Wilshire area by building a school that would drive away businesses. She  predicted "no school will ever be built on the Ambassador site."  </P> <P> But School Board President Jackie Goldberg accused Trump of putting his  interests ahead of the welfare of the 3,000 children in the area who spend up  to three hours a day on buses because there is no classroom space for them in  their neighborhood.  </P> <P> Another school board member, Roberta Weintraub, wondered why Trump was so  opposed to selling the property when he could use the money to pay off his  growing debts.  </P> <P> "Tell him to settle his problems in New York," Weintraub said to Res and Trump  attorney, Kevin Brogan. "Stay there and let us get on with the show."  </P> <P> By a unanimous vote, the board approved a resolution certifying its intent to  condemn the land under its eminent domain power and seek the money to pay for  the property. The district can take over the property, but only if it proves in  court that it paid the fair market value.  </P> <P> Richard Mason, an attorney for the district, said it will not seek to condemn  the property until the board has the financing. The State Allocation Board last  month approved $50 million for the project, and district officials say they  will attempt to borrow the rest of the money.  </P> <P> The condemnation vote was previously postponed to allow Trump Wilshire  attorneys to provide information on how they reached their conclusion that the  property is worth the $150 million to $200 million.  </P> <P> Goldberg asked Brogan if he had the information, but the Trump attorney  replied: "We'll do our talking at 111 N. Hill St.," referring to the address of  the County Courthouse where the battle will now move.  </P> <P> For the last five years, district officials have searched for a site for a high  school to serve the students now being bused to other neighborhoods at a cost  of nearly $6 million a year.  </P> <P> The Trump organization, which wants to build a 125-story complex on the  Ambassador site, has refused the district's offer for the property.  </P> <P> The 69-year hotel, which closed a year and half ago, was home to the famous  Cocoanut Grove night club and, in its heyday, served as an elegant backdrop for  Hollywood celebrities, movie moguls, royalty and U.S. presidents.  </P></p>

Mr.  'Arafat told the United Nations Human Rights Commission in  Geneva that he would hold further talks with the Israeli foreign  minister, Shim'on Peres, in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.  However, Israel has played down hopes of a final agreement on  implementing Palestinian self-rule. The Israeli prime minister,  Yitzhaq Rabin, said time was needed to overcome differences,  while one official said an accord could be weeks away.    Mr. 'Arafat said on Monday [31 January] that a total  agreement had been reached at talks in the Swiss resort of  Davos, but that Mr. Peres asked for more time to study details  of the text. In his speech to the Human Rights Commission he  said the Palestinians were still suffering abuses in the  occupied territories.</p>

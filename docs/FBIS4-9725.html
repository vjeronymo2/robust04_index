			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Early Morning" newscast] </F>   [Text] At the time they welcomed Ernesto Zedillo into the  electoral campaign as PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party]  presidential candidate, the Socialist People's Party [PPS] and  the Mexican Democratic Party [PDM] said they hope Zedillo will  stick to the agreements signed by Luis Donaldo Colosio.    [Begin recording] [PPS Deputy Leader Cuauthemoc Amezcua] We  hope he will make a great and responsible effort to follow up  and fulfill the democratic agreements signed by eight political  parties.    [PDM President Marcelo Gaxiola] Dr. Zedillo's taking up  Colosio's banner and making a public commitment to follow the  same course should be hailed and regarded as positive. [end  recording]    Both the PPS and PDM coincided by saying evidently, the new  PRI candidate is at a disadvantage in relation to the other  candidates and that, for this reason, he must make a greater  effort to catch up and recover lost time.</p>

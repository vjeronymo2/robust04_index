			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Letter: BR should use leasing finance to buy British Sir, The chancellor's announcement in the Autumn Statement that Pounds 150m of leasing finance would be made available for British Rail to acquire new trains provided a lifeline to British railway rolling stock manufacturers whose order books have been hit by the uncertainty caused by railway privatisation. Richard Tomkins reports ('InterCity bids for Pounds 150m to lease trains', March 30) that BR is deciding whether to use the finance to lease suburban trains for London commuters or for InterCity 225 trains for services between London and Manchester. If the order is for commuter trains it would probably go to ABB Transportation - the only British company that has the ability to build modern aluminium-bodied carriages. If the money is used for InterCity trains the order will go to GEC Alsthom. GEC does not manufacture carriages in Britain and, with past orders, it has bought in body shells from abroad. I believe the order should be for commuter trains. The Cannon Street train crash report said that the 30-year-old rolling stock used on the Cannon Street line should be replaced quickly for safety reasons. If, however, British Rail opts for the InterCity order it should encourage GEC to buy its body shells from ABB to ensure that the Pounds 150m is used, as intended, to keep British rolling-stock manufacturing in business. If this does not happen British train building will go the way of the British motorcycle industry and we will, in future, always have to buy trains from abroad, adding even more to our trade deficit.

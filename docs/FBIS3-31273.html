The F-16 crashed while the pilot was attempting to make an  emergency landing in the former Yugoslav republic bordering  Italy though it was not immediately known why.    Planes at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization base in  Aviano have been patrolling Bosnian skies for months and are  among those that would be used should NATO go ahead with its  threat to launch air strikes on Bosnian Serb forces besieging  Sarajevo.</p>

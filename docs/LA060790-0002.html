			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AL MARTINEZ: A HAPPY LITTLE BLIGHTER  </P> <P> When I first meet Gerry Robinson he is carrying a guitar. Even before we can  shake hands, he strikes a note, flashes a blinding smile and sings, "Al  Martinez is a very good wri-ter and no doubt a happy little bligh-ter." Then he  says, still smiling, "What is it you write?"  </P> <P> We are in the middle of a busy television studio and I am not expecting anyone  to suddenly jump in my face and start singing. I feel as if a fly has just  landed on my nose.  </P> <P> Also, how can the guy say I'm a very good writer when he doesn't know what I  write? And even if I am a pretty good writer, I am sure as hell no happy little  blighter.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, I am intrigued enough by Robinson to ask, with some hesitation,  what it is he does. I asked that of a murder suspect once and he replied, "I  kill people." Actually, he was a plumber, but he killed people on the side. A  plumber-killer.  </P> <P> Robinson says: "You could say Gerry is the fastest song-writer in the world.  You could say Gerry makes people feel good."  </P> <P> I haven't quite caught his first name and think he is talking about someone  else.  </P> <P> "No," I say, "what do you do?"  </P> <P> This perplexes him, and the megawatt smile dims slightly.  </P> <P> "That's it," he says. "Gerry writes songs. He's an instant song-maker."  </P> <P> I suddenly realize, My God, he is talking about himself in the third person!  Does Martinez have a column here or what?  </P> <P> Robinson, as it turns out, not only writes instant personalized songs about  anyone who happens to be around, but also composes motivational music for  businesses like the May Co.  </P> <P> They are happy, bouncy little tunes often piped through the store before it  opens. Their lyrics admonish the company's employees to be proud, friendly and  . . . well . . . perky.  </P> <P> "It pumps 'em up," Robinson says eagerly. "It gives 'em spirit."  </P> <P> As an instant song-maker, he performs at conventions and celebrity parties. A  promotional brochure includes photographs of him with people like Bob Hope and  Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> "Those are just some of the celebrities Gerry has strolled for," he says. He  sees himself as a strolling troubadour. "Don Rickles is another. You can say  Gerry has roasted a roaster."  </P> <P> The brochure says, "Call me, I'll make up a song for you right on the phone!"  It lists testimonials from those who have hired him, including this modest  tribute from State Farm's Dal Eisenbraun: "No end of fun."  </P> <P> "That's pretty good," I say, studying the brochure.  </P> <P> Quick as a striking cobra, Robinson sings, "Martinez says it's pretty good and  he ain't playin' Hol-ly-wood."  </P> <P> "Gerry doesn't talk," he says cheerfully. "Gerry sings."  </P> <P> We are in his Marina del Rey apartment a few days after our initial meeting.  Robinson is a small, compact man of 38 who combines the ebullience of a  chipmunk with the smile of a game show host.  </P> <P> He began making up songs on the toilet at about age 12, he says, while his  mother shouted "What's going on in there?" from another room.  </P> <P> It was a long trip from the toilet to the spotlight, but Robinson made it. Now  his favorite place to make up songs is in bed. A bachelor, he occasionally  hosts overnight guests of the opposite sex.  </P> <P> "Sometimes after making love," he says, "Gerry feels so good he sings!"  </P> <P> But, hey, wait. It isn't just singing sex Robinson wants to be famous for.  Think of him as a Master of Motivational Music.  </P> <P> "Made-up songs are gone in two minutes," he says, speaking through his smile.  The man is all teeth. "But motivational music is forever."  </P> <P> He plays a tape of the tune he and colleague Steve Duboff wrote for First  Federal Savings &amp; Loan. You could polka to it. "At First Fed-er-al we're  proud to say the best is yet to come, yes, the best is yet to come . . ."  </P> <P> As the music plays, Robinson lifts a finger to indicate a No. 1 standing and  pumps it up and down to the beat.  </P> <P> He is wearing an electric blue polo shirt, blue jeans and shiny black jodhpur  boots. There is something about him that reminds me of a manager I had when I  sold men's clothes for J.C. Penney.  </P> <P> He would gather us together just before the store opened and do a retail  version of Knute Rockne. Win this one for men's apparel. Afterward, we prayed.  </P> <P> I ask Robinson to make up a song about the L.A. by God Times. He does, but  can't think of anything that rhymes with Metro, which is the department I work  for.  </P> <P> It's just as well. We'd probably have to sing it every morning and Martinez  can't take perky tunes in the workplace.  </P> <P> He's a fussy little blighter.  </P></p>

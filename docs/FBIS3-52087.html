The president said this in exclusive statements to ULTIMA HORA.    The chief of state said that at first he did not agree with  the privatization of the National Cement Industry (INC), but now  he approves of the privatization of all public companies.    "The problem is that we are living with a budget we did not  prepare. We did not have a manual to help us through the  transmission like, for example, Bolivia. When we speak of  privatizing the public companies we are not speaking of five  companies. We will privatize everything except the Lopez  Palace," the president said.    He added that the privatizations must not be carried out  haphazardly, but that a special philosophy must be adopted for  each case. "For example, in the case of the INC -- which is  just one company -- some say that a small part of it should be  privatized, some say only its administration should be  privatized," he stated.    The president favors privatizing the INC but not its  quarries, maintaining government control on that part of the  activity.    Wasmosy said his government wants a social market economy  and  equal opportunities for all.    He mentioned the possibility of sending to Congress a  general  privatization bill to include both the public companies with  deficits and all the public institutions without exception,  specifying the privatization philosophy to be adopted in each  case.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 14, BNS -- Estonia is in every respect  ready for the removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski, Ago  Tiimann, secretary of the Estonian delegation for talks with  Russia and head of the military issues working group, told BNS.    Tiimann said the dismantling of the Paldiski reactors is the  only military issue under discussion at the negotiations "on  which (the delegations) have been working closely together."    "To date, everything has proceeded as planned and in  accordance with agreements," Tiimann claimed.    Russia has more than once announced that it is prepared to  start removal of nuclear fuel from Paldiski already in April and  complete it by June.    Tiimann said all possible safety and security measures will  be taken during the operation, which is the reason why the dates  and the route will not be made public.    Russia plans to use for transporting the fuel new, TK-18  type  containers, which have never before been used for this purpose.  The authorities are going to test the containers in March to  find out if they meet safety standards.</p>

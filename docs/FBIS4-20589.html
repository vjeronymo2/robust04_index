Because the  borides have an availability as a functional electronic  material, rapid progress has been made in recent years. Although  synthesis method and evaluation method on crystals and thick  films have been studied,[.sup]1-3[/] analytical methods for  the evaluation of synthesized borides are not established. We  have prepared a series of oxide standards for the analysis of  impurities in the boride,[.sup]4[/] and have determined the  impurities in the synthesized boride crystals and thick films.    A series of oxide standards containing impurities of  0.0018-0.2080% Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn were  prepared by  adding measured quantities of standard solutions containing the  above elements to X-ray fluorescently pure B, P, Zr and Ti  solutions.[.sup]4[/] After the solutions were evaporated to  dryness in a crucible on a hotplate, the precursor of the oxide  standards were heated with an electric furnace to 600C for  12 hours at a constant heating rate of 50C/hour.    Calibration curves related log I/C and log E were obtained  by  the X-ray fluorescence method with the standards mentioned  above. Where I is X-ray intensity, C is concentration of  measured impurities, and E is X-ray energy. Standard deviation  and coefficients of correlations of the curves were  0.0082-0.0128 and 0.990-0.999, respectively. It was found that  crystals of TiB[.sub]2[/] and ZrB[.sub]2[/] synthesized by  the zone refining method had less impurities than those of  powder type raw materials.  References    1. Y.

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / DAF may pull out of van venture DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker, is facing serious problems over the future financing of its joint venture with Renault of France for the production of a new range of light commercial vehicles. DAF, which is in its third year of heavy losses, must decide soon whether to press ahead with the planned investment of around Pounds 100m at its van plant at Birmingham in the UK. No official decision has been made, but it is understood that Renault is making contingency plans for DAF's withdrawal from the joint venture, which could put at risk the long-term future of DAF's Birmingham plant. DAF and Renault formed a joint company, Van Technology, in 1990 to develop and engineer a new generation of medium/heavy vans. Under the terms of the joint venture the two companies were to make separate investments at their respective van plants in Birmingham and at Batilly in eastern France for the production of the new vehicle, which was due to start in 1994/95. DAF insisted yesterday that vans remained a part of its 'core business activity'. It said that reports in France that it wished 'to abandon this market segment' were 'entirely without foundation'. It said 'work on the joint van project with Renault is continuing as scheduled. This involves a large team of engineers from both DAF and Renault based in Birmingham.' The UK plant has a workforce of nearly 2,000 including production workers and engineering staff. The scale of DAF's financial problems has already forced it to seek a 'strategic alliance' for its mainstream truck operations, with talks currently under way with Mercedes-Benz, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz of Germany and the world's leading truck maker. DAF said in the autumn that it hoped a new partner would provide fresh equity. This hope appeared to be dashed last month when Daimler-Benz ruled out any move to take a shareholding in the Dutch vehicle maker. According to DAF, the van project with Renault involves a total investment of around Pounds 500m, of which some Pounds 250m comprises spending by Van Technology on design, development and tooling.</p>

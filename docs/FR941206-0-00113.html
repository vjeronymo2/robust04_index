			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Operators may not require the subscription to any tier, other than a BST, as a condition for subscribing to an NPT. Further, operators may not require subscription to an NPT as a condition to subscribing to a CPST. We believe that restricting the ability of operators to link the purchase of NPTs and other CPSTs will maximize subscriber choice and foster competition between NPTs and CPSTs. These buy-through restrictions will not apply, however, to cable operators that, prior to October 5, 2002, lack the capacity to offer BSTs and NPTs without also providing other intermediate tiers of service. See 47 CFR 76.921. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Apart from the foregoing limited, specific requirements, operators will have complete flexibility to offer programming services on an NPT. Thus, the Commission's NPT rules provide that operators may offer the same programming services on NPTs as are on one or more BSTs and CPSTs so long as they do not state or imply that any such channel is available only on an NPT. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operators may add any channel to an NPT that was previously on a BST or CPST if the channel was dropped from the BST or CPST before September 30, 1994. If a channel was offered on a system on a BST or CPST on September 30, 1994, however, the channel may not be moved to an NPT unless the operator waits at least two years from the date the channel is dropped from the BST or CPST. However, operators may offer new channels (i.e., channels first offered on a system after September 30, 1994) on CPSTs before moving them to NPTs, subject to the conditions outlined in this Report and Order. The flexibility to move new channels to NPTs will keep the prices for CPSTs from becoming unreasonable and will create additional capacity for new services on CPSTs. This capacity should help create opportunities for programmers to establish an audience for their new channels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If after initially electing to offer an NPT, a cable operator decides that offering an NPT is no longer desirable, the cable operator is free to drop the tier upon proper notice to subscribers. An operator that drops an NPT may reestablish that tier at a later time by complying with the conditions outlined above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission's conclusion that the rates at which cable operators choose to offer NPTs will not be unreasonable reflects its consideration of the statutory factors that it must consider in establishing criteria for determining whether a rate for a CPST is unreasonable. As explained above, the Commission believes that the rates charged for NPTs will be constrained by the rates charged for BSTs and CPSTs. The rate standards for BSTs and CPSTs were set directly by analysis of the factors the 1992 Cable Act instructs the Commission to consider. The Commission believes that the rates charged for NPTs must be competitive with the rates charged for CPSTs or consumers will decline to subscribe to NPTs. Therefore, the rates charged for NPTs will reflect the Commission's analysis of the statutory factors because cable operators will have to offer NPTs at prices that are attractive in comparison to services subject to benchmark or cost-of-service regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. A La Carte Package Offerings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the 1992 Cable Act, video programming offered on a per channel or per program (a la carte) basis is not subject to rate regulation. 47 U.S.C. 543(l)(2). In the April 1993 Rate Order, 58 FR 29736 (May 21, 1993), the Commission held that it would not regulate packages of otherwise exempt per channel or per program services so long as: (1) The price for the combined package does not exceed the sum of the individual charges for each component of service, and (2) the cable operator continues to provide the component parts of the package to subscribers separately. The Commission stated that the second condition would be met only when the per channel offering provides subscribers with a realistic service choice.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 29746. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the Second Reconsideration Order, 59 FR 17943 (April 15, 1994), in order to address concerns that some packages established by operators in response to rate regulation were not consistent with the 1992 Cable Act and Commission regulations, and the fact that other offerings raising similar concerns could be initiated in the future, the Commission provided 15 interpretive guidelines for determining whether an operator's collective offering of a la carte channels should be accorded regulated or unregulated treatment. The Commission also determined that packages of a la carte channels offered prior to April 1, 1993, (the date it adopted the Rate Order) would be accorded unregulated treatment. This limited ``grandfathering'' of packages available on April 1, 1993, was intended to avoid elimination of discounts that were available to consumers and clearly were not offered to evade rate regulation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 17951&hyph;17952. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, on November 17, 1993, the Commission issued 16 letters of inquiry to various cable operators, and on December 13, 1993, it issued another 35 letters of inquiry, most of which addressed the issue of removal and repackaging of channels. On February 22, 1994, the Commission issued 11 letters of inquiry to cable operators that, among other things, asked operators to justify a la carte offerings that may be inconsistent with the Commission's rate regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Clinton lines up tax cut targets: Energy and transport departments to bear brunt of government savings Senior members of the Clinton administration yesterday outlined the details of about Dollars 24bn in spending cuts and departmental rationalisation designed in part to finance the Dollars 60m middle class tax cut proposals unveiled last week. President Bill Clinton also announced that he had ordered Vice President Al Gore to expand the existing 'reinventing government' programme under his direction, and to produce further proposals within 90 days. He repeated that any tax cuts had to be paid for in order not to increase the federal deficit. The bulk of finance for his proposed tax cuts comes from the Dollars 52bn generated by continuing for two more years the freeze on discretionary spending. Over the weekend, some prominent Republicans had agreed that it would be wrong to sacrifice deficit reduction on the altar of tax cuts. Mr Gore said consideration had been given to abolishing several government departments and agencies, as demanded by some Republicans, but that the 'reform option' was the better approach. However he pledged to 'make government work better and do less' and 'to trade interference for opportunity'. Dr Alice Rivlin, the budget director, said the time had clearly come to 'sort out roles and missions'. Basic questions to be addressed included: 'Should the federal government be doing all these things? Should it be making all these decisions? Should it be handing out all these specific little grants?' The brunt of the Dollars 24bn five year hit is being borne by the departments of energy (Dollars 10.6bn) and transport (Dollars 6.7bn), with smaller slices from the budgets of housing (Dollars 800m), and two agencies which serve the federal government machine  - the general services administration (Dollars 1.4m) and office of personnel management (Dollars 30,000). A further Dollars 4.5bn of spending cuts remain to be identified. Mr Federico Pena, the transportation secretary, said his department would see its staff cut roughly in half from 106,000 to 54,000 over five years, with the 40,000 employees at present involved in air traffic control coming under the auspices of a new government corporation. But 10 separate departmental divisions would be consolidated into three, and 30 existing loan programmes, each with their own rules and criteria, would be reduced to three as well. Mr Henry Cisneros, secretary of housing, said 60 loan programmes to cities would be consolidated into three broad block grant categories. The energy department, described by Mr Gore as a relic of 'the Opec and Cold War' period, would achieve its savings by privatising the naval petroleum reserve in California and through a variety of management and contracting changes. The proposals outlined yesterday will form part of the administration's 1995-96 budget, to be presented early in the year. Republican control of Congress means that changes to this will be made. All those who followed Mr Clinton and Mr Gore to the dias said they were determined to make the relationship between Washington and state and local authorities work better. But Dr Rivlin added a warning to some of the more fervent Republican disciples of government cuts: 'There are some things which must remain federal'.</p>

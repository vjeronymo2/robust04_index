			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower as Hong Kong closes at record high THE turmoil in Russia undermined enthusiasm for stocks, and the Nikkei index closed marginally lower as investors remained on the sidelines, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei fell 18.70 to 20,264.43 with most investors reluctant to take large positions until the response of other markets to the Russian crisis became clear. The index fell to the day's low of 20,151.32 in the morning session, in tandem with the futures market which lost ground on news of the military confrontation in Moscow. However, late arbitrage linked buying supported share prices and the Nikkei rose to the day's high of 20,283.93 on late bargain hunting. Volume fell to 180m shares from 362m. Declines led advances by 591 to 372, with 214 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged down 0.06 to 1,634.03 while, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,263.23. Index-linked buying by institutional investors supported share prices. One trader said that the Nikkei would have advanced further in a continuation of Friday's strong performance, were it not for the Russian situation. Investors' interest centred on semiconductor-related issues following reports that electronics manufacturers were boosting output of 16-megabit chips. Nikon rose Y25 to Y915 and Tokyo Electron gained Y110 to Y3,030. Sharp jumped Y70 to Y1,550 on firm shipments of its camcorder. Other consumer electronics makers were also strong, with Sony up Y50 to Y4,610 and Matsushita Electronic Industrial gaining Y20 to Y1,450. Investigations by the Fair Trading Commission of menswear discount retailers triggered heavy selling of Aoki International and Aoyama Trading. Aoki fell Y100 to Y5,500, and Aoyama failed to trade due to the lack of buyers. Pharmaceuticals were lower on profit-taking following the recent bout of buying ahead of annual medical conventions. Sankyo fell Y10 to Y3,000 and Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical lost Y40 to Y2,410. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 35.92 to 22,251.94 in volume of 18.1m shares. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets found a diverse series of influences on trading. HONG KONG shrugged off the latest inconclusive round of Sino-British talks on the colony's future as foreign demand, beginning with US institutions and spilling over to UK and Chinese funds, took shares to a record high close. The Hang Seng index added 68.10 or 0.9 per cent to 7,744.32, after an intraday high of 7,763.87, in relatively thin turnover of HKDollars 3.72m. AUSTRALIA saw the political turmoil in Russia fuel a sharp rise in gold stocks and push the overall market to a higher close, but with a holiday in New South Wales, trade was otherwise dull. The All Ordinaries index added 4.2 to 1,977.0 in turnover of ADollars 165.31m. The gold marker surged 42.5 to 2,006.6 with North Flinders rising 20 cents to ADollars 12.50, Newcrest up 17 cents to ADollars 4.02, Plutonic up 10 cents to ADollars 7.00, and Homestake up 7 cents to ADollars 1.65. MANILA turned sharply lower as banks with big common trust fund (CTF) holdings sold shares to meet a new 10 per cent reserve requirement, which took effect yesterday. The composite index shed 55.01 or 2.8 per cent to 1,904.54. The peso's fall last week prompted the central bank to impose capital requirements on CTFs, which pool small deposits for investment in high-yielding securities like T-bills and stocks. NEW ZEALAND, devoid of any strong overall influence, meandered through thin trade to a slightly higher close. The NZSE 40 capital index rose 6.35 to 1,946.36 in turnover of NZDollars 18.7m. TAIWAN closed narrowly mixed after late bargain-hunting emerged to offset early losses triggered by Russia's political crisis. The composite index ended 1.62 lower at 3,808.24, after an intra-day low of 3,785, in very slow turnover of TDollars 9.72bn. SEOUL fell prey to a wave of profit-taking in reaction to last week's pre-Chusok holiday rally, although some late bargain-hunting helped prices up from their lowest levels. The composite stock index shed 4.50 to 715.05. SINGAPORE, easier for much of the day, picked up towards the close as hopes rose for political stability in Russia. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 4.97 higher to 2,023.07 after trading in negative territory for much of the day. KARACHI closed sharply higher on rumours that the former reformist prime minister, Mr Nawaz Sharif may win in tomorrow's general elections. The KSE index rose 14.68 to 1,357.05.</p>

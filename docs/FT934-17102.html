			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Money Markets: Tension eases THE BUNDESBANK had to inject short-term funds into the cash-starved German money markets yesterday, only a day after it had withdrawn a large tranche. The move helped to ease the tight conditions hanging over the market from the end-of-month liquidity shortage. Early in the day call money had risen as high as 7.12 per cent, but after the Bundesbank's move it dropped back to 6.95 per cent. Dealers said the withdrawal on Thursday of some DM10bn of 'section-17' money had raised tensions, coming after DM8.5bn was drained in the week's repo. Wariness in the markets of early rate cuts were underpinned by comments from Mr Hans Tietmeyer - who assumed the presidency of the Bundesbank yesterday - that the authorities need to be cautious about inflation. In the London money market the overnight lending rate moved as high as 9 per cent in the early afternoon after only a small amount of cash was injected into the system at lunch time. But after the Bank of England relieved a Pounds 1.6bn shortage by Pounds 1.18bn in afternoon operations, the overnight rate drifted back to around 6 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of Pounds 400m. 'It has been a long, volatile and quite confusing week,' said one discount house trader. 'Liquidity has got a little polarised in the market and activity has been quite hard to interpret.' Generally, the market has been waiting for the Tory conference next week and the Budget in November. Few in the market expect a rate cut to emerge from the conference, but dealers are eager for hints as to what Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, intends to do on monetary policy. It is also waiting to get a better measure of the new president of the Bundesbank although few are expecting much to change. 'There are a lot of balls in the air, and I think most people are agnostic at the moment,' said one trader. 'We are now in for a boring period with wild days on the overnight.' Short sterling came off the highs of the early part of the week. The December contract traded for most of the day at around 94.35. The three-month interbank rate finished the day at 5 31/32 -5 29/32 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWER TECHNIQUE FOR DETECTION OF BIRTH DEFECTS CALLED SAFE  </P> <P> A recently developed technique for early prenatal detection of birth defects is  generally "safe and effective," but is slightly riskier and more prone to  failure than amniocentesis, a more widely used technique usually performed  later in pregnancy, according to a new study being published today.  </P> <P> The federally sponsored study of about 3,000 women aged 33 years or more found  that the increased risk of fetal loss associated with the newer technique,  chorionic villus sampling, was 0.8% higher than that associated with  amniocentesis. An accurate diagnosis of fetal chromosomal abnormalities such as  Down's syndrome was obtained 97.8% of the time, compared to 99.4% of the time  with amniocentesis.  </P> <P> Chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, is "here to stay" but "it will not replace  amniocentesis," said Dr. Lawrence D. Platt of County-USC Medical Center, an  expert practitioner of the two techniques who was not involved in the new  study.  </P> <P> Chorionic villus sampling is performed during the third month of pregnancy. The  tissue for laboratory analysis is obtained from the placenta, the connection  between the fetus and the mother, which contains cells that are almost always  genetically identical to those of the fetus.  </P> <P> Amniocentesis is usually performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of  pregnancy, although some obstetricians are doing the procedure earlier. In this  technique, fetal cells and fetal proteins from the amniotic fluid, the liquid  that surrounds the fetus, are analyzed.  </P> <P> Platt said chorionic villus sampling "clearly carries the advantages of earlier  prenatal diagnosis," such as reduced patient anxiety and decreased risk to the  mother when a birth defect is detected and an abortion carried out.  </P> <P> But he cautioned that chorionic villus sampling also suffered from some of the  "inherent limitations" of earlier diagnosis, such as a small increased risk of  miscarriages, an increased number of uncertain diagnoses that require further  testing and an inability to detect problems that do not manifest themselves  until later in pregnancy.  </P> <P> Another drawback is the inability of chorionic villus sampling to detect neural  tube birth defects, such as anencephaly and spina bifida. In addition, some  parents may elect to terminate pregnancies for non-medical reasons, such as sex  selection. Such terminations are rare when the sex of the baby is not learned  until later in pregnancy.  </P> <P> There were 25 elective abortions of "chromosomally normal" fetuses in the  chorionic villus group, including about 15 for sex selection, compared to two  such elective abortions in the amniocentesis group, according to the study.  </P> <P> Many within and outside the medical community object strongly to parents  aborting a pregnancy because a fetus is not of the desired sex. Some medical  centers have policies against performing prenatal diagnostic techniques for sex  selection.  </P> <P> Results similar to those in the new U.S. study were found in a Canadian study  of 2,787 women that was published in the Lancet, a British medical journal, in  January.  </P> <P> The Canadian study had the advantage of randomly comparing the two procedures,  while the American study did not; according to the new report, the primarily  well-educated private patients who were studied at UC San Francisco and six  other major medical centers resisted a "vigorous effort" to randomly assign  them. Instead, they were given a choice between the techniques.  </P> <P> Platt and another expert in maternal-fetal medicine said the data from both  studies underscored the need for women to seek medical care early in pregnancy  and to discuss with their physicians the pros and cons of the increasingly  complicated array of prenatal diagnostic tests.  </P> <P> They also predicted that publication of the study would accelerate a trend  toward wider availability of chorionic villus sampling.  </P> <P> Chorionic villus sampling "is a viable alternative to amniocentesis in the  hands of experienced people," said Dr. John Williams III, the medical director  of the Prenatal Diagnostic Center of Southern California, a private facility in  Beverly Hills. Williams, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at  UCLA, said he performs 15 to 20 procedures a week at his center, which along  with UC San Francisco is one of the busiest CVS facilities on the West Coast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> L.A. Performance Rate  </P> <P> Over the last two years, about 1,500 of these procedures have been performed in  Los Angeles, compared to more than 22,000 amniocenteses, Platt said. An  estimated 50,000 to 60,000 of the procedures have been performed worldwide,  according to Williams.  </P> <P> Some insurers, such as Kaiser-Permanente of Southern California and Blue Cross  of California have covered chorionic villus sampling since late last year.  Others, such as Blue Shield of California and Medi-Cal, the  government-supported insurance program for the poor, do not cover the procedure  because they consider it experimental.  </P> <P> In addition, physicians offering the procedure must receive specific approval  from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because the catheters, or thin  sterile tubes, through which the sampling is performed are considered  experimental and none is approved for marketing. About 30 physicians nationwide  are estimated to have such authorization.  </P> <P> When asked about the status of the catheters, a knowledgeable FDA official said  that they are likely to remain under investigation for some time. To date none  of the companies that manufacture them have requested marketing approval and  submitted the necessary data for review, the official said.  </P> <P> Chorionic villus sampling was developed in the early 1980s. During the  procedure, the catheter is inserted into the uterus through the vagina under  the guidance of an ultrasound machine. A small amount of placental tissue is  then removed through the tube. The procedure can also be performed by inserting  a needle into the uterus through the abdomen.  </P> <P> Preliminary results of the sampling are available within a day and final  results -- which require culturing cells in a laboratory -- within one to two  weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles is about $1,300 to $1,400, Platt said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Level of Discomfort  </P> <P> During amniocentesis, a needle is inserted into the amniotic fluid through the  abdomen, also under ultrasound guidance. Because the fetal cells must be grown  extensively in a laboratory, complete test results are usually not available  for several weeks. The total cost in Los Angeles ranges from $800 to $1,100,  Platt said.  </P> <P> Both procedures take 10 to 30 minutes to perform. According to Platt, the level  of patient discomfort is similar, although he said the majority of patients  seem to find chorionic villus sampling less painful.  </P> <P> Both techniques are most frequently used to screen for Down's syndrome and  other chromosomal abnormalities, which are most common in mothers aged 35 or  older. As part of the chromosome analysis, the sex of the baby can be  determined as well. The techniques can also be used to screen for inherited  genetic diseases, such as Tay-Sachs disease, cystic fibrosis, muscular  dystrophy and sickle cell anemia.  </P> <P> The new study was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development in Bethesda, Md.  </P> <P> Results in 2,278 women who had chorionic villus sampling were compared to those  in 671 women who had amniocentesis.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rate of Losses  </P> <P> The total rate of pregnancy losses, including spontaneous abortions,  termination of abnormal pregnancies, stillbirths and neonatal deaths, was 7.2%  in the group that underwent chorionic villus sampling and 5.7% in the group  that had amniocentesis. The highest rate of pregnancy loss followed chorionic  villus procedures in which multiple attempts to obtain placental tissue were  required.  </P> <P> After adjustment for differences in the ages of the mothers and the fetuses --  which influence the expected rate of fetal loss -- the researchers said the  "total loss rate" for women in the chorionic villus group exceeded the rate for  the amniocentesis group by 0.8%.  </P> <P> The most common symptoms after the procedures were cramping and spotting; these  were more common in the chorionic villus group. None of the pregnant women  suffered serious infections, although such infections are known to be a rare  complication of chorionic villus sampling.  </P></p>

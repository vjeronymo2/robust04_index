			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Finance Bill: Bill to implement Lamont's Budget proposals - The Finance Bill was published yesterday.  The Treasury issued the accompanying guidance, describing the intention of each of its 208 clauses and 23 schedules ALCOHOLIC LIQUOR DUTIES Clause 1 and Schedule 1 introduce new rates of duty on beer, wine, made-wine and cider from 16 March 1993. The new rates of duty represent an increase of 5 per cent on the rates of duty previously charged. They also implement the requirement of Article 20 of EC directive 92/83/EEC in respect of wine and made-wine of an alcoholic strength exceeding 22 per cent by imposing a new increased rate of Pounds 19.81 per litre of alcohol in the wine and made-wine. * Clause 2 provides for a new rate of duty for beer end product duty, when it is introduced. It replaces the duty rate of Pounds 10.60 per hectolitre per cent of alcohol in the beer (set by section 7(1) of the Finance Act 1991 for the new system) with Pounds 10.45. * Clause 3 extends the definition of beer without changing its duty liability. The new definition of beer includes any liquor which is made or sold as beer or as a substitute for beer and is of a strength exceeding 0.5 per cent alcohol by volume. The previous definition had only included such drinks that exceeded 1.2 per cent alcohol by volume. Beers exceeding 0.5 per cent but not exceeding 1.2 per cent alcohol by volume will not be liable for excise duty. * Clause 4 and Schedule 23(1)(1) provides for the repeal and amendment of certain sections of the Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 (ALDA), which allow for the refund of excise duty in specified circumstances. Repeals a requirement for brewers to produce certain records. * Clause 5 and Schedule 23(1)(2) implement the requirements of the EC directives on the holding and movement of products subject to excise duty (92/12/EEC) and the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol (92/83/EEC) by prohibiting the blending or mixing of two or more alcoholic liquors outside of an excise warehouse or permitted premises, except in specified circumstances. * Clause 6 and Schedule 23(1)(3) implement a requirement of EC directive 92/83/EEC on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol by increasing the quantity of spirit which may be mixed with wine in an excise warehouse from six to 12 litres of alcohol and reducing the permitted upper strength limit of the resultant mixture to 22 per cent alcohol by volume. * Clause 7 implements the requirements of Articles 8 and 12 of the EC directive on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol (92/83/EEC) by extending the definition of sparkling wine and made-wine in Schedule 1 of ALDA. * Clause 8 implements a requirement of Article 27.1.(a) of the EC directive on the harmonisation of the structures of excise duties on alcohol (92/83/EEC) by extending the appropriate references to methylated spirits in ALDA to include 'denatured alcohol'. * HYDROCARBON OIL DUTIES Clause 9 increases by 10 per cent the rates of duty on hydrocarbon oils (including the rebates for certain oils) with effect from 6pm on 16 March 1993. * Clause 10 applies hydrocarbon oil duty to mineral oil fuel substitutes, to be designated by order, at the duty rate of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil or road fuel gas. * Clause 11 and Schedule 23(1)(4) introduce duty on other fuel substitutes, chargeable when they are set aside for use as motor fuel or as an additive or extender in motor fuel. * Clauses 10 and 11 bring UK law into line with EC law, which provides a wider definition of chargeable oils and extends duty to non-hydrocarbon fuel substitutes. In both cases, chargeable substances will be designated by order (to be made shortly after royal assent), and the duty rate applicable will be that of the equivalent hydrocarbon oil or road fuel gas. The clauses supersede existing provisions charging petrol substitutes and power methylated spirits. * Clause 12 and Schedule 23(1)(5) provide for excise duty to be charged on the volume of oils corrected to a temperature of 15 degrees centigrade, and for corresponding adjustments to duty rebates and refunds. This change is in line with EC law. Regulations made under the clause will prescribe the method of adjusting volume. The provisions will take effect on an appointed day, expected to be in October 1993. * TOBACCO PRODUCTS DUTY Clause 13 amends the rates of duty on tobacco products with effect from 6pm on 16 March 1993. * Clause 14 amends the definition of hand-rolling tobacco for duty purposes, in line with EC law. The borderline between hand-rolling tobacco and pipe tobacco moves from a cut width of 0.6mm to 1.0mm; and for anti-avoidance reasons other tobacco of a kind used for making cigarettes is brought within the hand-rolling description. * GAMING MACHINE LICENCE DUTY Clause 15 increases by 20 per cent most rates of duty on gaming machines for licences for any period beginning on or after 1 May 1993. Rates for 10p and 20p-play small-prize machines and 5p jackpot machines rise from Pounds 375 to Pounds 450; and rates for 10p and 20p-play jackpot machines rise from Pounds 960 to Pounds 1,150. The clause makes no change to the Pounds 150 rate for 5p small-prize machines. * Clause 16 abolishes the duty on 5p small-prize gaming machines for licences for any period beginning on or after 1 November 1993. The clause makes extensive consequential amendments to the Betting and Gaming Duties Act 1981, because small-prize machines will then be subject to only a single rate of duty (on machines costing more than 5p per play), and because 5p jackpot machines will remain liable to duty. * VEHICLES EXCISE DUTY Clause 17 raises the main VED rate for private and light-goods vehicles from Pounds 110 to Pounds 125 (Section (7) (b)). The other sections raise the related rates for motorbikes, taxis, some farmers' and showmen's vehicles, and vintage private and light goods vehicles in the same proportion, rounded to the nearest Pounds 5. * Clause 18 raises the duty for heavy goods vehicles which carry exceptional loads in two stages, the first after 16 March 1993, to Pounds 4,250, and the second from a day which the secretary of state appoints. The intention is to raise the tax rate to Pounds 5,000 from the date of the first unified Budget. Clause 19 links duty for trade plates for motorcycles, and for all other vehicles to the main duty rates for cars and motorcycles respectively. Trade plates duty will thus change automatically when these main rates change in future. Clause 20 puts duty treatment of vintage (pre-1933) motorbikes on same basis as that of vintage (pre-1947) cars by dropping the engine capacity and weight restrictions. Around 1,000 vintage motorbikes will pay only Pounds 15 duty (previously Pounds 30). Clause 21 provides powers to modify the current complex lorry VED legislation so as to simplify its presentation. An order will be published after royal assent showing the new presentational structure. Rates for farmers' and showmens' lorries will be expressed as multipliers of main lorry rates, thereby obviating the need to produce several similar tables of rates. The clause does not permit any rate to be increased by the new order. MISCELLANEOUS DUTIES Clause 22 implements sections of EC directives 92/108/EEC and 92/12/EEC. In common with the other member states of the EC, the UK is introducing measures to extend to excise duties the provisions for mutual recovery of VAT debts, and for mutual assistance through the disclosure of information for VAT. * Clause 23 enables the secretary of state for transport to refuse to issue a vehicle excise licence for an unregistered vehicle which has been brought into the UK unless he is satisfied that any VAT and customs duty due on the vehicle has been or will be paid or remitted. * LOTTERY DUTY Clause 24 introduces a new excise duty on lotteries, primarily intended to cover the National Lottery due to start in 1994. The clause establishes the normal chargeable event as the sale in the UK of a lottery ticket or chance; excludes bingo from the duty; and exempts existing lawful lotteries run for the benefit of charities, local authorities etc.* Clause 25 sets the rate of duty at 12 per cent of the gross stake. Clause 26 enables regulations to be made for deferred payment of duty, and for advance payments on account. Clause 27 provides for duty payment by the lottery promoter, or under regulations by another responsible person (for the National Lottery this will be the main licensee). It also provides for recovery of unpaid duty; and creates a summary offence for failure to pay. ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT Clause 28 gives responsibility for the care and management of the duty to the commissioners of Customs and Excise and provides for administrative regulations, and penalties for their breach. Clause 29 defines the chargeable person (for the National Lottery this will be the main licensee) and requires them to register; provides for regulations on registration; and creates an indictable offence for running a dutiable lottery while unregistered. Clause 30 applies the 'revenue trade' provisions of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979, which include the power to estimate duty due and the obligation on traders to keep and preserve records. Clause 31 creates indictable offences for fraudulent evasion of lottery duty and false declarations. Clause 32 extends the offence provisions to directors and similar officers of bodies corporate that commit offences. Clause 33 provides for forfeiture of any goods involved in fraudulent evasion. Clause 34 provides immunity from lottery offences for any person acting on the instructions of the commissioners. Clause 35 provides for evidence, by certificate of the commissioners, concerning registration, returns and payments. Clause 36 makes lottery duty a preferential debt in insolvency. Clause 37 provides for disclosure of information between the commissioners, the Gaming Board and the secretary of state (and through him, the director-general of the National Lottery). Clause 38 permits regulations and orders to be made by statutory instrument. Clause 39 excludes lotteries from the scope of pool betting duty. Clause 40 contains definitions; applies the lottery duty provisions of the Act to lotteries promoted on behalf of the Crown; and ensures that the imposition of duty on an unlawful lottery does not legitimise the activity. Clause 41 provides for commencement orders (the provisions are likely to come into effect in late 1993). Schedule 23(1)(7) makes consequential repeals. VALUE ADDED TAX Clause 42 and Schedule 23(II)(1) provide that supplies of fuel and power for domestic, residential and charity non-business use shall cease to be zero-rated for VAT. The clause also provides that from 1 April 1994 the rate of VAT applying to such supplies shall be 8 per cent and that from 1 April 1995 the standard rate shall apply. * Clause 43 and Schedule 23(II)(2) abolish the discount for high business mileage in the fixed scales used for charging VAT on fuel supplied for private mileage in business cars. It ensures that the VAT scales remain the same as the income tax scales for taxing fuel as a benefit in kind. * Clause 44 and Schedule 23(II)(3) allow the second supply of goods in a triangular transaction by a supplier belonging in an intermediate member state, and the supply of goods installed or assembled in the UK by a supplier belonging in another member state, to be treated as an acquisition by the UK customer, thereby relieving the supplier of the need to register for VAT in the UK. * Clause 45 prevents fraud, by stipulating that a standard rated supply of gold will be treated as a taxable supply by the buyer as well as by the seller for the purposes of registration for VAT, and that the buyer must account to Customs and Excise for the output tax on behalf of the supplier. It also allows, by order, extension of this special system to other specified goods, and services related to these goods. * Clause 46 amends the provisions covering appeals to the Value Added Tax tribunal concerning input tax recovery. It makes provision that such appeals are to succeed only if the commissioners have acted unreasonably in refusing tax recovery. * Clause 47 changes the circumstances where the gift of a sample does not give rise to a supply for VAT purposes. It also expressly provides that where a number of identical or substantially similar items are given as samples to the same person, only one of the items is deemed not to be supplied. It ensures that no output tax charge arises in respect of business assets which are put to a private or other non-business use, unless the taxpayer has been entitled to prior deduction of input tax in respect of them. * Clause 48 reduces the qualifying waiting period for VAT bad debt relief to six months. * Clause 49 and Schedule 2 (consequential repeals are listed in Schedule 23(II)(4)). Misdeclaration penalty under section 14 of the 1985 Act (paragraph 1 of Schedule) revises the base and yard sticks against which a single misdeclaration made on a VAT return is measured. A new flexible penalty base capable of adjustment for misdeclarations and voluntary disclosures is introduced. It uses the total tax managed by the business (eg total VAT on purchases plus total VAT on sales in the period) instead of the net tax payable under the current arrangements. It provides for the commencement of the paragraph by Treasury order. * Misdeclaration penalty under section 14A of the 1985 Act (paragraph 2 of Schedule) revises the base against which repeated misdeclarations made on a VAT return are measured. It also outlines the criteria which must be fulfilled before a penalty for repeated misdeclarations can be activated. It provides for a penalty of 15 per cent of the tax that would have been lost in the period that is subject to a penalty. The penalty base for repeated misdeclarations is the same as that to be used for single misdeclarations - the total tax managed by the business. It provides for commencement by Treasury order and termination of any outstanding penalty liability notices issued under the current regime. * Mitigation of penalties (paragraph 3 of Schedule) outlines how Customs and the VAT tribunals are to mitigate penalties under the Finance Act 1985. It also entitles VAT tribunals to restore a penalty reduced by Customs. It defines those matters which are not to be taken into account in determining the level of mitigation*. Interest on tax etc. recovered or recoverable by assessment (paragraph 4 of Schedule) amends the circumstances in which interest on underdeclared VAT is to be assessed. Interest is normally payable back to the date of the introduction of interest in April 1990 or to a later date if the misdeclaration was subsequent to it. The effect of this paragraph is to limit the interest liability to the latest three years only, where this period would otherwise have been exceeded. It provides for commencement of the paragraph by Treasury order. * Default surcharge (paragraphs 5-7 of Schedule) provides from 1 October 1993, for the issue of a surcharge liability notice when a person first defaults on either furnishing a VAT return or paying the tax due; makes a person liable to surcharge in respect of the next payment default for an accounting period; removes the liability to surcharge where a person is in default for an accounting period but there is no tax outstanding for that period; provides for the rate of surcharge to increase only where there is a payment default; and introduces a new first rate of surcharge at 2 per cent. Surcharge assessments at the two lower rates will not be issued unless they are for Pounds 200 or more. Also reduces from 1 April 1993 the highest rate of surcharge from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. * Clause 50 and Schedule 23(II)(5) amend the Value Added Tax Act 1983 by deleting three references concerning the valuation and collection of car tax due on chargeable vehicles brought to the UK from other EC countries, following the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993. Since car tax was abolished on 12 November 1992, the legislation was never needed. INCOME TAX CHARGE, RATES AND ALLOWANCES Clause 51 reimposes income tax for 1993-94 with the same rates as in 1992-93. The threshold for higher rate tax is unchanged, at Pounds 23,700 of taxable income, but the lower rate band is increased by Pounds 500, to Pounds 2,500 of taxable income. * Clause 52 sets the personal and married couples' allowances for 1993-94 at the same level as for 1992-93. The additional personal allowance (mainly for single parents) and the widows' bereavement allowance, which are linked to the married couple's allowance for those aged under 65, are also unchanged. * CORPORATION TAX CHARGE AND RATE Clause 53 sets the main rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1993 at 33 per cent. Clause 54 sets the small companies' rate of corporation tax for the financial year 1993 at 25 per cent. It also sets, at one fiftieth, the fraction used in calculating the marginal rate (currently 35 per cent) for companies with profits in a band above that to which the small companies' rate applies. INTEREST: GENERAL Clause 55 sets the limit on loans qualifying for mortgage interest relief at Pounds 30,000 for 1993-94 (the same as for 1992-93). The clause will have effect from 6 April 1993. * Clause 56 gives entitlement to mortgage interest relief on a loan originally used to buy a borrower's old home as though the loan had been used to buy a new home if, when the borrower moves, the new home is substituted for the old home as security for the loan. The clause will have effect from 16 March 1993. * Clause 57 gives entitlement to mortgage interest relief where a borrower leaves his home. Where the property is put up for sale, interest relief will be available on a loan used to buy it, or on a loan to an elderly person used to buy a life annuity, for up to 12 months after the property has ceased to be the borrower's only or main residence. In the case of a home purchase loan, the clause replaces rules that required the borrower to take out a loan to buy a new home. The clause will have effect from 16 March 1993. * Clause 58 introduces specific powers for the Inland Revenue to recover amounts overclaimed by lenders operating the Miras (mortgage interest relief at source) scheme. * Clause 59 makes a technical amendment to the tax deduction at source rules to ensure that all UK deposit-takers can pay interest without deduction of tax to people who are not ordinarily resident in the UK and who have made a declaration to that effect. An Inland Revenue press release was issued on 21 January 1993. Clause 60 provides for extension of the circumstances in which the taxes acts prevent a deduction from profits for loan interest that exceeds a commercial rate of return. This is linked to the new rules on foreign exchange gain and losses (Clauses 122-167 below). The clause will apply where a loan advanced in one currency is repayable by reference to another currency, and the interest charged is excessive by reference to the amount repayable. * INTEREST ETC. ON DEBTS BETWEEN ASSOCIATED COMPANIES Clause 61 begins a set of provisions which provide that interest (or equivalent return) payable within multinational groups to UK resident companies on certain loans made by UK resident companies will be taxable as it accrues rather than when it is paid and will apply to all interest accruing from midnight on 31 March 1993. The clause sets out the conditions (including in particular the relationships necessary between relevant parties) which if satisfied mean that a debt may become a qualifying debt and be subject to the provisions of the proposed legislation. * Clause 62 details various conditions, relating primarily to the terms of the debt, which if satisfied may exempt a debt from these proposals. If interest is payable at intervals of 12 months or less, bears a constant fixed relationship to a standard published rate or published index of prices and the debt is either redeemed within 12 months of its creation or the amount payable on redemption (excluding interest) does not exceed the consideration given for it, then the debt will be exempt from these provisions. Alternatively, if it can be shown to the inspector's satisfaction that the charging to tax of interest on an arising as opposed to on an accrual basis was not a main motive for the arrangements and that those terms would have been agreed on an arm's-length basis, the debt may also be exempted. * Clause 63 sets out provisions which will apply to qualifying debts which have the characteristics of debts on accrued income securities. By reference to the provisions of the accrued income scheme (Sections 710 to 728 of the Taxes Act 1988) it establishes both a time and a method for determining the quantum of chargeable income deemed to arise in relation to such debts. * Clause 64 similarly sets out a time and a method for determining, by reference to Schedule 4 to the Taxes Act 1988 (deep discount securities), the chargeable income that will be deemed to arise in respect of qualifying debts which have the characteristics of deep discount securities. * Clause 65 details the provisions which will apply to those qualifying debts having the characteristics of debts on deep gain securities, determining the chargeable income that will be deemed to arise by reference to the provisions of Schedule 11 to the Finance Act 1989 (deep gain securities). * Clause 66 introduces measures to avoid any double charging which could result from the interaction of these provisions with existing arrangements relating to accrued income securities, deep discount securities and deep gain securities. * CHARITABLE DONATIONS Clause 67 reduces from Pounds 400 to Pounds 250 the minimum limit for charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Gift Aid scheme, from 16 March 1993. * Clause 68 increases from Pounds 600 to Pounds 900 the annual limit for charitable donations qualifying for tax relief under the Payroll Giving Scheme, from 6 April 1993. * Clause 69 gives relief for an employer's voluntary contributions to a charitable agency's costs of running the employer's payroll giving scheme when calculating the employer's business profits for tax purposes. An Inland Revenue extra-statutory concession currently ensures tax relief in these circumstances. The statutory relief applies to expenditure incurred on or after 16 March 1993. The extra-statutory concession continues to cover expenditure up to that date. * BENEFITS IN KIND Clause 70 sets the car benefit scale charges for 1993-94. * Clause 71 sets for 1993-94 the scales for assessing the benefit of fuel provided by employers for private use in company cars and removes for 1993-94 and subsequent years the reduction in the charge for 18,000 or more business miles a year. * Clause 72 and Schedule 3 replace the car benefit scale charges by a new measure of the benefit of a car available for private use. This is 35 per cent of the price of the car, with discounts for business mileage and for older cars. The price of the car is defined as its published list price if it has one or, if not, the notional price which would have been published as the list price for the car. The price of the car is increased for accessories provided when the car was first made available. The price of certain classic cars is their market value. * Clause 73 and Schedule 4 replace the existing rules for taxing employees' private use of a company van with a flat rate scale charge of Pounds 500 (Pounds 350 for vans which are four or more years old) on which employees will pay tax. The schedule contains provisions for allocating Pounds 500 (or Pounds 350) per van among employees who share a van or a number of vans. Employees sharing a van will be able to opt to pay tax on Pounds 5 a day for each day on which they use a shared van. These new arrangements are to come into effect on 6 April 1993. Inland Revenue press releases * and 14 April 1993. Clause 74 exempts from tax from 6 April 1993 the benefit employees have from commercial vehicles weighing more than 3,500 kilogrammes unless the vehicle is used wholly or mainly for the employee's private purposes. * Clause 75 exempts in-house sports and recreational facilities from tax as a benefit in kind. It exempts facilities provided by employers generally. The exemption is to take effect from 6 April 1993. * Clause 76 and Schedule 5 introduce an exemption for removal expenses and benefits paid on behalf of, reimbursed to or provided for employees who are obliged to relocate with their job or in order to start a new job. The exemption is limited to Pounds 8,000 and applies to payments made and benefits provided before the end of the tax year following the year in which the job is changed or the new job started. The Treasury are given the power to increase the limit by order. Employees are not required to dispose of their existing homes to qualify for exemption. The types of payments and benefits eligible for relief are set out in the Schedule. The Treasury are given the power to amend by regulation the types of payments and benefits which can be eligible for relief. The exemption is available to employees who start their job at a new location after 5 April 1993. Inland Revenue press releases * and 14 April 1993. TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS Clause 77 reduces the income tax charge on dividends (for dividends paid after 5 April 1993) from the basic rate of 25 per cent to the lower rate of 20 per cent, and brings in an ordering rule so that dividends are treated as the top part of a taxpayer's income, so that higher-rate taxpayers continue to be liable to tax at the higher rate of 40 per cent on dividends above the basic rate limit. These changes will also apply to foreign dividends and stock dividends (shares received as an alternative to a cash dividend). Clause 78 sets the rate of advance corporation tax (ACT) for distributions made after 5 April 1993 and before 6 April 1994 at 22.5 per cent of the value of the distribution and the ACT payable on it. It provides for the rate subsequently to be linked to the lower rate of income tax. It also provides for the value of the tax credit accompanying a distribution to be reduced from 25 per cent of the value of the distribution and the tax credit to 20 per cent for distributions made after 5 April 1993. Clause 79 provides that charities which receive dividends from UK companies and are entitled to claim payment of the accompanying tax credit will also be entitled to claim special payments on a sliding scale for a transitional period of four years from 1993-94. The special payments will ease the transition to the new reduced value of the tax credit. * Clause 80 and Schedule 6 make consequential amendments to existing legislation to take account of the changes in the taxation of distributions. Clause 81 stops a company from carrying back ACT to set against corporation tax liabilities of an earlier period in some circumstances when the ownership of a company changes. It applies to changes of ownership on or after 16 March 1993. CHARGEABLE GAINS Clause 82 provides for the annual exempt amount for 1993-94 to be held at Pounds 5,800: the annual exempt amount for most trustees will be Pounds 2,900. * Clause 83 provides for the base month for indexation of the CGT annual exempt amount to be changed from December to September with effect from 1994-95. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. Clause 84 prevents capital gains falling out of charge where shares are exchanged for certain debentures which are outside the capital gains charge. It applies to exchanges on or after 16 March 1993. * Clause 85 enables regulations to be made to modify the capital gains tax rules when people subscribe to a PEP by transferring newly issued shares, or shares emerging from an approved all-employee share scheme, into the PEP. The regulations, to be made shortly after royal assent, will apply where the shares transferred form part of a larger portfolio. They will make clear that the transfer does not affect the computation of future gains on shares which remain outside the PEP. * Clause 86 adds two new EC agricultural quotas for ewe and suckler cow premium to the list of assets which qualify for capital gains tax rollover relief with effect from 1 January 1993. It also creates a new power for further assets to be added to the list of qualifying assets by Treasury order. Clause 87 and Schedule 7 introduce a new relief which allows capital gains tax to be deferred where shares in an unquoted trading company are sold and the gains are re-invested in other qualifying unquoted trading companies. They also relax the qualifying conditions for capital gains tax retirement relief. The shareholding condition is reduced from (broadly) 25 per cent down to 5 per cent and some full time working employees are brought into the relief (previously restricted to directors). These measures will apply to disposals on or after 16 March 1993. * Clause 88 and Schedule 8 restrict the set-off of capital losses brought into a group of companies as a result of a company joining the group. The restriction will apply to losses set off against gains arising on or after 16 March 1993 where the losses came from a company which joined the group on or after 31 March 1987. The changes will end the practice of 'capital loss buying' where by capital losses are bought in from other companies which have nothing to do with the purchasing group's own activities and where the purchasing group does not suffer the economic loss involved.* Clause 89 allows a de-grouping charge which arises when a company leaves a group with assets on which there is a deferred charge to be treated as arising at the beginning of the accounting period in which the company left the group. It applies for accounting periods ending on or after 1 October 1993. Clause 90 corrects an error that arose on the consolidation of the capital gains legislation in 1992. It will permit the special capital gains rules about the transfers of UK insurance business to operate as they did before consolidation if a non-resident company is involved. (Inland Revenue press release 17 July 1992.) Clause 91 defers the starting date for the charge on annual deemed disposals by life assurance companies of holdings in unit trusts etc. The charge will now apply to periods beginning on or after 1 January 1993. It amends the transitional provisions under which assets otherwise caught by the charge can be exchanged without immediate tax consequences for other assets. It also amends the relief for assets which were held as backing for investment linked business on 1 April 1990. Inland Revenue press release 30 December 1992. CORPORATION TAX: CURRENCY Clause 92 contains the basic rules that a company's trading profits or losses are to be computed and expressed in sterling for tax purposes. This clause and clauses 93-96 are linked to the new rules on foreign exchange gains and losses (at Clauses 122-167 below). * Clause 93 enables regulations to be made to allow the profits or losses of a trade to be computed and expressed in a currency other than sterling in certain circumstances. * Clause 94 allows currencies other than sterling to be used in computing and expressing the profits or losses of different parts of a trade in certain circumstances. * Clause 95 sets out how regulations on using a non-sterling currency for computing profits and losses are to be made and what they can include, and gives some related definitions. * Clause 96 extends the use of currencies other than sterling for computing trading profits or losses to the controlled foreign company legislation which imposes UK tax on UK companies that control foreign companies in low-tax areas. * OVERSEAS LIFE INSURANCE COMPANIES Clause 97 and Schedule 9 amend, in the case of UK branches of overseas life companies, various provisions affecting their liability to corporation tax. They will be modelled more closely on the provisions generally applying to UK branches, but with special modifications which recognise the particular features of life insurance business. Double tax relief will be available for foreign tax paid on the income and gains arising on the life and other long-term business of the UK branch. (Inland Revenue press release of 16 December 1992). Clause 98 amends in the case of UK branches of overseas life companies the rules according to which the assets of a life insurance company are categorised for tax purposes. The assets of the UK branch will be separated from other assets of the company. Clause 99 entitles overseas life companies to tax credits in respect of most dividends from UK companies, where the income forms part of the life assurance business of the UK branch. Companies will also be able to make a claim to treat these distributions as though they were profits chargeable to corporation tax and so set off management expenses and various other deductions. These provisions will apply for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992. Inland Revenue Press Release of 16 December 1992. Clause 100 provides that in computing the UK branch income of overseas life companies, the exemption from tax usually available to non-residents on particular types of foreign source investment income is overridden. Additionally, where income on Treasury securities which is free of tax to residents abroad arises to the UK branch, the tax deductible management expenses are restricted. These provisions have effect for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992. Clause 101 and Schedule 10 modify, in the case of UK branches of overseas life companies, the special rules for calculating life insurance company trading receipts, and the share of the profits attributable to the policyholders. The modifications ensure that only the income and gains related to the branch activities are taken into account and provide alternative rules where the necessary figures are not available in returns submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry. The changes take effect for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992. Clause 102 and Schedule 11 modify, in the case of UK branches of overseas life companies, various provisions relating to the calculation of companies' chargeable gains. These modifications are consequential on the changes to the scope of the charge on capital gains made under Clause 97 and on the changes in Clause 91 to the rules governing the deemed disposal of life insurance companies' holdings of unit trusts. They apply for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992. Clause 103 changes the definition of an overseas life insurance company so that it is tested according to where it is resident for tax purposes rather than where its head office is situated. The clause, which applies for accounting periods beginning after 31 December 1992, also repeals the provisions which are made redundant by the measures in Clauses 97-102. APPROVED SHARE OPTION SCHEMES Clause 104 provides that the amount of the capital gain on which a company is chargeable to tax when it grants a share option to an employee under an approved share scheme will, with effect from Budget day 1993, be the amount, if any, actually paid for the option by the employee.* Clause 105 prevents a double charge, to both income tax and capital gains tax, arising in certain circumstances when an employee sells shares which he received through a share option scheme set up by his employer. The clause takes effect from 1 January 1992, Inland Revenue press release of 14 April. INDEXATION: MISCELLANEOUS Clause 106 maintains at Pounds 75,000 for 1993-94 the maximum level of earnings for which pension provision may be made with tax relief. It disapplies the indexation provisions which would otherwise have operated.* Clause 107 provides for the base month for indexation of the main income tax allowances, the basic and lower rate limits, and the earnings cap for pensions to be changed from December to September with effect from 1994-95. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. The clause also corrects a flaw in the indexation formula for the pensions earnings cap. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS ABOUT RELIEFS Clause 108 provides an exemption from tax for outplacement services provided to employees who lose their jobs. It also ensures that employers paying for counselling services get a tax deduction for their payments. The exemption is to take effect for employees made redundant on or after 16 March 1993 or, for employees made redundant before then, for services bought on or after 16 March 1993.* Clause 109 extends from five years to seven the period for which businesses can claim relief for revenue expenditure incurred before the start of trading. It also brings within the scope of the relief certain expenditure by companies which is treated as a 'charge on income'. This applies mainly to interest paid other than to a bank operating in the UK. These charges are not currently included in the category of expenditure which qualifies for pre-trading relief. The extended time limit applies to those who start to trade on or after 1 April 1993. The changes on charges apply to charges paid on or after 1 April 1993.* Clause 110 fills gaps in the existing relief available for the restoration and preparation of waste disposal sites. The clause adds authorisations for the disposal of radioactive waste to the lists of relevant licences, which in turn determines who can qualify for the reliefs, and it extends the relief for site preparation to any expenditure which is incurred before trading starts. For anyone starting to trade on or after 1 April 1993 such expenditure will be deemed to have been incurred on the first day of trading and in the course of carrying on the trade.* Clause 111 denies entitlement to relief under the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) to individuals who obtain loans which are connected with shareholdings they acquire through the Scheme. It applies for shares issued on or after 16 March 1993. Clause 112 makes clear that with effect from periods of account ending after 5 April 1993 tax relief will be due only for sums actually paid by employers into occupational pension schemes and not for provisions or accruals in respect of such pay-ments. It also ensures that no deduction can, in any event, be allowed for sums paid into schemes after 5 April 1993 to the extent that provisions in excess of contributions actually paid have already been allowed for tax purposes. Press release with draft clause 30 March 1993.* CAPITAL ALLOWANCES Clause 113 introduces the new temporary 20 per cent initial allowance for industrial buildings announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be available for new buildings contracted for in the year ending 31 October 1993 and brought into use by the end of 1994. Inland Revenue press releases of 12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14 April 1993. Clause 114 and Schedule 12 introduces the new 20 per cent initial allowance for agricultural buildings announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be available for new buildings contracted for in the year ending 31 October 1993 and brought into use by the end of 1994. Inland Revenue press releases 12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14 April 1993. Clause 115 and Schedule 13 introduces the 40 per cent first year allowance for machinery and plant announced in the Autumn Statement. This will be available for expenditure incurred in the year ending 31 October 1993. Inland Revenue press releases of 12 November 1992, 21 December 1992 and 14 April 1993. Clause 116 clarifies two points in the provisions which limit allowances for machinery and plant leased within the first 10 years of its life to non-residents not liable to UK tax. The changes make it clearer how the provisions operate and have effect from Budget day.* Clause 117 amends existing provisions which allow connected persons to elect to treat the sale of certain assets as having taken place at tax written down value. It extends the scope of these provisions to qualifying hotels, commercial buildings in enterprise zones and scientific research assets; and allows elections only where both parties are entitled to capital allowances. The changes have effect from Budget day.* MISCELLANEOUS Clause 118 amends the rules for UK companies which control foreign companies. It provides that (subject to certain exclusions) such UK companies will be liable to UK tax on profits of the foreign company arising on or after 16 March 1993 where the overseas tax paid by that foreign company is less than three quarters (previously one half) of the tax that would be payable if it were resident in the UK. Clause 119 and Schedule 14 make a number of changes to the legislation which introduces Pay and File for companies in October this year. The amendments relate to the transitional periods which straddle the change over date from the old system; the circumstances in which claims to relief may be made by members of groups; the payment of interest or repayment supplement where losses or Advance Corporation Tax are carried back to earlier years; and allow companies to authorise people other than the company secretary to sign documents for tax purposes. Clause 120 provides a power to make regulations about the repayment to a friendly society of tax suffered on the investment income of its tax exempt activities. It applies only to societies which are not wholly exempt. The first accounting period to which the regulations may apply is that commencing on or after 1 January 1994.* Clause 121 amends the legislation requiring government departments to deduct tax from certain payments, most particularly PAYE from wages and salaries. It ensures that for 1993-94 onwards tax not deducted for earlier years, and not otherwise recoverable, can be obtained from the government department. It also brings government departments within the scope of interest and penalty legislation where relevant. EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES Clause 122 and Clauses 123 to 167, with Schedules 15 to 18 introduce new rules for the taxation of companies' foreign exchange gains and losses. Exchange differences on qualifying assets and liabilities and forward contracts to buy and sell currency are to be recognised for tax purposes as they accrue (the translation basis) and taxed or relieved as income receipts or deductions. Clause 122 sets out how exchange gains and losses on qualifying assets (broadly monetary assets - currency, debts and certain shares) and liabilities are to be calculated.* Clause 123 sets out how exchange gains and losses are to be calculated on a forward contract to buy or sell currency.* Clause 124 sets out modified rules for calculating exchange gains and losses on a debt which varies in amount. A debt may vary in amount when part is repaid, or when an additional tranche is borrowed.* TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES Clause 125 provides for exchange gains and losses on assets, liabilities and currency contracts used for the purposes of a trade to be taken into account as receipts and expenses of that trade.* NON-TRADING GAINS AND LOSSES Clause 126 and Clauses 127 to 130 contain the rules for dealing with non-trading exchange gains and losses.* Clause 127 includes the charging provision for net non-trading exchange gains.* Clause 128 sets out the rules for relief of any excess of non-trading exchange losses over non-trading exchange gains.* Clause 129 ensures that net exchange losses carried forward to a later accounting period are available for relief in that later period only against exchange gains.* Clause 130 sets out how relief for excess non-trading exchange losses under clause 128 interacts with other provisions of the Taxes Act 1988.* ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION Clause 131 and Schedule 15 provide for the amount of an initial exchange gain or loss to be found in accordance with a method of calculation (the 'alternative method') which allows exchange differences to be left out of account to the extent that they arise on assets, liabilities or contracts held or owed in exempt circumstances, debts or currency representing income that cannot be remitted to the UK or liabilities which are matched with certain non-monetary assets under a matching election.* MAIN BENEFIT TEST Clause 132 denies relief for exchange losses on a foreign currency loan where the accrual of an exchange loss is the main benefit, or one of the main benefits, that might be expected to arise from borrowing or lending in the particular currency.* ARM'S-LENGTH TEST Clause 133 provides for the 'ring-fencing' of exchange losses on a loan made or received by a company which is entered into otherwise than on arm's-length terms. Such losses will in general be available for relief only against future exchange gains arising on the same loan. The application of the clause is however limited in certain circumstances.* Clause 134 provides for the ring-fencing of exchange losses on a forward currency contract which is entered into otherwise than on arm's-length terms.* Clause 135 deals with the situation where exchange losses are carried forward, under Clause 133 or 134, for set-off against future gains on an asset, liability or contract, and there is a change in the local currency of the trade. The clause provides for the losses to be translated into the new currency.* DEFERRAL OF UNREALISED GAINS Clause 136, together with Clauses 137 to 140, allows companies to defer taxation of unrealised exchange gains on long-term capital borrowings and advances where those gains form a significant proportion of the taxable profit.* Clause 137 sets out the rules for deferral of unrealised gains which are the subject of a claim under clause 136 above.* Clause 138 defines the 'amount available for relief', which determines the maximum amount in respect of which deferral can be claimed under clause 136.* Clause 139 deals with the situation where deferral is or has been claimed in relation to an asset or liability used for the purposes of a trade or part of a trade whose basic profits and losses are computed in a currency or currencies other than sterling.* Clause 140 provides supplementary rules relating to the deferral provisions in clauses 136 to 139.* IRRECOVERABLE DEBTS Clause 141 deals with the situation where all or part of a debt owed to or by a company is regarded as irrecoverable. The nominal amount of the debt is deemed to be reduced by the irrecoverable amount.* Clause 142 deals with the situation where a debt has been treated as reduced under clause 141 because all or part of the amount previously regarded as irrecoverable becomes recoverable. The amount which becomes recoverable is to be treated as a new debt or as an increase in the nominal amount of an existing debt.* CURRENCY CONTRACTS: SPECIAL CASES Clause 143 deals with the situation where a currency contract is terminated early, so that there is no acquisition or disposal of currency under the contract. It provides for a balancing adjustment to be made to recover or give relief, depending on the circumstances.* Clause 144 ensures that where a currency contract is closed out by means of a reciprocal currency contract, no exchange gains and losses are recognised from the closing out date on either contract, and the first contract is treated as having been terminated, without delivery or acquisition of the underlying currency, at that date.* EXCESS GAINS OR LOSSES Clause 145 provides for a balancing adjustment to be made on an asset or liability ceasing to exist where net exchange gains have been taxed but there is an overall loss, not otherwise taken into account for tax purposes, on the asset or liability, or net exchange losses have been relieved but there is an overall gain, not otherwise taken into account for tax purposes, on the asset or liability. The detailed rules are to be set out in Treasury regulations.* LOCAL CURRENCY TO BE USED Clause 146 defines 'local currency' for the purposes of computing exchange gains and losses under Clauses 122 to 125.* EXCHANGE RATE TO BE USED Clause 147 sets out rules for determining the exchange rate to be used in translating amounts or values into a company's local currency.* Clause 148 adapts the rules for determining exchange rate in Clause 147 to cover debts which vary in amount.* INTERPRETATION: COMPANIES Clause 149 identifies the companies ('qualifying companies') to which the new rules on taxation of foreign exchange gains and losses apply.* INTERPRETATION: ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND CONTRACTS Clause 150 defines the assets and liabilities ('qualifying assets and liabilities') which are within the scope of the new provisions on exchange gains and losses.* Clause 151 sets out rules to determine when a company becomes or ceases to be entitled to an asset for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and losses on the asset.* Clause 152 sets out rules to determine when a company becomes or ceases to be subject to a liability for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and losses on the liability.* Clause 153 contains explanatory provisions to identify debts by reference to the facts and to deal with debts that do not legally come into existence.* Clause 154 explains when a company is treated as holding a forward contract to buy or sell currency for the purpose of calculating exchange gains and losses on the currencies to be exchanged under the contract.* INTERPRETATION: OTHER PROVISIONS Clause 155 defines translation times and accrual periods, by reference to which exchange gains and losses are calculated under clauses 122 to 124.* Clause 156 defines the 'basic valuation' of an asset or liability which is within the scope of the new provisions on exchange gains and losses.* Clause 157 defines the nominal currency of each type of asset and liability to which the new provisions apply.* Clause 158 sets out rules to determine the settlement currency of a debt.* Clause 159 sets out rules to determine the nominal amount of a debt which is outstanding at any particular time.* Clause 160 defines the local currency of a trade.* Clause 161 contains various interpretation provisions for the purposes of Chapter II. MISCELLANEOUS Clause 162 and Schedule 16 provide that the new rules for taxing foreign exchange gains and losses are to apply from the first day of a company's first accounting period to begin on or after an appointed day. Where a qualifying asset, currency contract or qualifying liability is held or owed on the commencement date the company is to be treated as if it became entitled or subject to the asset, contract or liability on that date. Regulations will provide transitional rules for such items.* Clause 163 allows a 'just and reasonable' adjustment to be made where a company changes its accounting date, and hence its commencement day under clause 162(7), for the purpose of securing a tax advantage.* Clause 164 contains miscellaneous provisions concerning orders and regulations.* Clause 165 allows regulations to provide special rules for the treatment of exchange differences in respect of assets and liabilities held by insurance companies.* Clause 166 and Schedule 17 provide that qualifying assets currently subject to capital gains tax will cease to be so.* Clause 167 and Schedule 18 make various amendments to the taxes acts to accommodate the effects of the new provisions on foreign exchange gains and losses.* LLOYD'S UNDERWRITERS ETC MAIN PROVISIONS Clause 168 provides that the profits from the underwriting business of a Lloyd's member are to be chargeable to income tax as trading profits. It also sets out the years for which underwriting losses can be set off against general income. Clause 169 sets out the general rules for deciding for which year of assessment the various categories of profit or loss arising from an underwriting business are to be brought into account. Clause 170 and Schedule 19 continue the arrangements for assessing and collecting tax on underwriting profits arising from a member's syndicates and from the funds in which his premiums received are invested ('premiums trust funds'). MEMBER'S TRUST FUNDS Clause 171 treats assets in premiums trust funds as acquired and disposed of each year, with the exception of certain UK securities where an exemption applies for particular non-resident holders. Clause 172 and Schedule 20 provide the tax arrangements for the new special reserve fund. Tax deductibility is available for up to 50 per cent of a member's profits transferred to reserve each year subject to an overall fund value limit of 50 per cent of the member's overall premium limit. Income and gains on assets within the fund will be free of tax. Withdrawals from the fund will be required, notably, to meet losses and where the member ceases underwriting, and will be treated as trading income. The new reserve will apply from 1992-93. The clause and schedule also provide for the winding up of the existing special reserve fund, for which the last year will be 1991-92. Clause 173 provides that the gains or losses on the disposal of assets in funds other than a premiums trust fund or the new reserve fund, continue to be subject to capital gains tax and are not brought within the computation of trading profits. OTHER SPECIAL CASES Clause 174 sets out that relief for payments ('reinsurance to close' premiums) which one syndicate makes to its successor to take over its outstanding liabilities is available to the extent that the payments are fair and reasonable having regard to the liabilities transferred. Clause 175 provides rules giving relief for payments and charging receipts in respect of loss insurance and of the new Lloyd's High Level Stop Loss Fund. It also provides relief for payments made to transfer to someone else a member's rights and liabilities in respect of business he has underwritten. Clause 176 enables the board to make regulations setting out the extent and manner of deductibility for accountancy fees payable by members in respect of their underwriting business. MISCELLANEOUS Clause 177 provides that the final year of assessment of a member's underwriting business is generally that in which his deposit at Lloyd's is repaid, subject, in cases of death, to the final year not being later than the year in which the underwriter dies. Clause 178 sets out that profits from an underwriting business are to constitute earned income for tax purposes. This applies to profits assessable after 1992-93. Clause 179 removes an extended time limit (which is no longer necessary) for Lloyd's underwriting agents in relation to a claim for a deduction against profits for a year in respect of emoluments paid after that year. It has effect for periods of account ending on or after 30 June 1993. SUPPLEMENTAL Clause 180 enables the board to make regulations on specified matters affecting the taxation of members, and provides for regulations made under legislation which is being repealed to continue to have effect where appropriate. Clause 181 makes a number of consequential amendments to references in other provisions of tax legislation affecting Lloyd's members. Clause 182 defines various terms used in the legislation. OIL TAXATION Clause 183 abolishes petroleum revenue tax for oil and gas fields given development consent on or after 16 March 1993 ('non-taxable' fields) and makes amendments so that expenditure can be apportioned as appropriate between those fields and fields within the charge to the tax.* Clause 184 reduces the rate of petroleum revenue tax from 75 per cent to 50 per cent from 1 July 1993 and makes adjustments to the limit on interest payable on repayments of petroleum revenue tax arising where losses are carried back. Those adjustments reduce the limit in line with the rate reduction and correct an anomaly in the existing rules which discounted advance petroleum revenue tax in calculating the limitation.* Clause 185 disapplies the petroleum revenue tax rules relating to returns and information for fields ('non-taxable fields') outside the charge to petroleum revenue tax and introduces a PRT version of the corporation tax powers in Section 20 of the Taxes Management Act 1970, to request specific information from taxpayers and third parties. Schedule 21 is a PRT version of the taxpayer safeguards in Section 20B of that Act.* Clause 186 abolishes relief against petroleum revenue tax paid by 'taxable' fields for expenditure incurred on or after 16 March 1993 on exploring for 'non-taxable' fields and then appraising them, subject to transitional arrangements. These arrangements allow continued relief against the income of existing fields provided that expenditure is incurred within two years of 16 March 1993 under a contract for exploration and appraisal in force before that date, or the expenditure is necessary for the completion of the obligation under that contract. Expenditure incurred after a break clause in a contract could have been triggered, or after exercise of an option, will not get the transitional relief.* Clause 187 provides for the situation where an asset is used in connection with a field outside the charge to petroleum revenue tax (a 'non-taxable field') either before or after it is used in connection with a field within the charge to petroleum revenue tax (a 'taxable' field), so that relief against petroleum revenue tax may, as appropriate, be restricted. This clause also ensures that receipts from asset disposals, or from third-party use of assets, are limited or charged to PRT at market value, as appropriate, to prevent artificial reduction of petroleum revenue tax liability by transactions between connected parties.* Clause 188 introduces, for claims received after 16 March 1993, a definition covering the time when expenditure is incurred for petroleum revenue tax purposes. The definition is based on when the claimant has an unconditional obligation to pay, provided that the amount of expenditure incurred is not disproportionate to the extent to which the contract has been performed. There is an extra, temporary, test to discourage the use of 'front-end loaded' procurement contracts to obtain 75 per cent PRT relief on future supplies of assets or services. This clause also clarifies the effect of an existing anti-avoidance rule (the 'restriction to cost' rule) limiting relief for expenditure in transactions between connected persons to costs incurred under the latest arm's length transaction. That clarification includes a separate new definition of when such costs are incurred. It applies to connected-person transactions on or after 16 March 1993.* Clause 189 introduces provisions preventing expenditure incurred after the end of a six-month chargeable period getting relief against petroleum revenue tax in that, or any earlier, period (other than by carry-back of losses). The provisions apply to claims received after 16 March 1993 or, in the case of exploration and appraisal expenditure, costs incurred after 31 March 1993. Clause 190 makes a number of changes to the treatment for petroleum revenue tax purposes of receipts from asset disposals or third-party use of assets and to corresponding payments. Fields providing services will not benefit from the tariff receipts allowance when tariffs are paid from a field outside the charge to petroleum revenue tax (a 'non-taxable' field). Foreign fields, or foreign parts of fields, will be treated broadly in line with UK fields. And payments from participators in 'taxable' fields to connected persons in 'non-taxable' fields will not be allowed relief against petroleum revenue tax.* Clause 191 facilitates double taxation relief from PRT chargeable on receipts arising from the use by UK oil fields of assets connected to foreign fields, but situated in the UK or on the UK continental shelf.* Clause 192 defines terms used in previous clauses and provides that the Board of Inland Revenue will be able to make any amendments to decisions on expenditure claims and to tax assessments that are necessary following enactment of the provisions in Clauses 183 to 192 (inclusive).* INHERITANCE TAX Clause 193 sets the inheritance tax threshold for the year 1993-94 at Pounds 150,000. Clause 194 provides for the base month for indexation of the inheritance tax rate bands to be changed from December to September with effect from 1994-95. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. Clause 195 extends fall in value relief to investments which are cancelled within 12 months of the date of death and to investments quotation of which is suspended at a date 12 months after death. The change applies to deaths occurring on or after 16 March 1992. Clause 196 extends from three to four years after death the period during which houses or other real or leasehold property may be sold and the sale price substituted for the value at death. The change applies to deaths occurring on or after 16 March 1990. Clause 197 allows the special commissioners to refer to the Lands Tribunal questions as to the valuation of land. STAMP DUTY Clause 198 increases the threshold for the 1 per cent stamp duty on sales of land, buildings and certain other property from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 60,000. It also increases from Pounds 300 pa to Pounds 600 pa the rental limit for premiums under new leases to benefit from the threshold. The increases take effect for documents executed on or after 16 March 1993 (providing they are not stamped before 23 March 1993).* Clause 199 puts right an anomaly in the application of stamp duty to houses purchased in England and Wales under the 'rents-to-mortgages' scheme being introduced by the Housing Bill. It ensures that the stamp duty threshold will apply to houses purchased under rents to mortgages in the same way as to properties purchased in the wider market.* Clause 200 makes provision similar to clause 199 for stamp duty in respect of the parallel scheme, 'rent-to-loan', being introduced in Scotland.* Clause 201 provides enabling powers for the Treasury to make regulations as to the method by which stamp duty is denoted. Current legislation requires the use of 'impressed' stamps. This provision does not affect the amount of duty payable on a transaction. Inland Revenue Press Release of 14 April 1993 'Stamp Duty: Method of Stamping'. MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL Statutory effect of resolutions etc Clause 202 amends the rules for giving immediate (but temporary) statutory effect to changes to income tax, petroleum revenue tax, supplementary petroleum duty, VAT and duties of customs and excise on the passing of a resolution by the House of Commons. The clause also brings corporation tax within the scope of these rules. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. Clause 203 allows, if an appropriate resolution is passed by the House of Commons, assessments to be made to corporation tax for a financial year at rates which are lower than the rates for that year charged in an Act. This applies for the financial year 1993 and subsequent years. Clause 204 amends the rules for resolutions giving immediate (but temporary) effect to changes in stamp duty. This follows the decision to move to a November Budget. MISCELLANEOUS Clause 205 amends the rules for determining whether individuals who are in the UK for a temporary purpose only are resident for tax purposes. It abolishes the rule that those who have accommodation here available for their use are resident for any year in which they visit this country. This change takes effect from 6 April 1993 and will apply for both income tax and capital gains tax purposes.* Clause 206 ends the liability to gas levy (subject to the approval of the secretary of state for trade and industry and the Treasury) where a pre-1975 petroleum revenue tax exempt contract is terminated on the grounds that continued supply has become uneconomic. In those circumstances the rule allowing up to 5 per cent of cumulative production from the field to be sold outside the contract without liability to petroleum revenue tax also ends. Clause 207 and Schedule 22 makes provision to amend the Government Trading Funds Act 1973. It permits opening capital to be financed by reserves, enables public dividend capital to be used to finance any expenditure by a trading fund and make consequential amendments to trading funds borrowing limits. Clause 208 this clause allows for technical changes to the arrangements for issuing gilt-edged securities. The changes are purely internal to the public sector and have no implications for the gilt market as a whole. *indicates a press release issued on Budget Day, 16 March 1993.</p>

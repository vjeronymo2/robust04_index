			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Electronics: Bull To Invest Heavily </F> in `Facilities Management'"; as released by Brussels Euroscope  EIS Database]    [Text] The troubled French public electronics group, Bull,  which is shortly to receive 8.6 billion FF [French francs] in  fresh funding from the State, is ready to invest a "significant"  amount in computer services, including the creation of a  European company consolidating its interests in management of  business computer systems, known as "facilities management".  Bull will have a 51&percnt; stake in this European company,  known as  Athesa International and headed by the former Director of  EDS-GFI [the French subsidiary of the world's top software  house], Jacques Tordjman, while the other 49&percnt; will be  distributed among three as yet unnamed other French companies.    Discussions with potential partners should be completed  before the end of January, according to Mr Tordjman, who added  that the ideal combination would be two manufacturing firms and  one bank. While declining to specify the amount of initial  capital this holding company would possess, he indicated that it  would be "significant" enough to allow the purchase of business  computer systems.    Athesa International will begin operating in 1994, with a  total turnover of about 1.2 billion FF, and will take over  Bull's internal computer concerns (which employ over 300 persons  and alone represents a contract of from 500 million to one  billion French franc, according to Mr Tordjman. Athesa will also  absorb the 400 million FF initial turnover of its only  subsidiary, Athesa France, which is held in equal parts by Bull  and Cisi [International Company for Data Processing Services]  and is responsible for managing CEA's [Atomic Energy Agency]  computer systems.    Other subsidiaries are expected to be established in other  European countries, probably starting in England, where  facilities management is the most highly developed. Bull will  seek to create companies jointly with local partners.    Mr Tordjman also announced that Athesa would create a New  Technologies Institute to retrain computer operations staff  taken on by Athesa with the acquisition of a client's business  computer systems. Such transfers are often perceived as threats  by the employees concerned.</p>

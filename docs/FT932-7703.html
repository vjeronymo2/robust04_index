			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Laing seeks Pounds 39m in placing - Funds needed for privately-financed infrastructure projects JOHN LAING, one of Britain's biggest construction groups, is raising Pounds 39m, part of which will be used to invest in privately-financed European infrastructure projects. The company is a member of joint ventures bidding to construct a privately-financed road toll bridge across the Firth of Forth in Scotland and a toll bridge across the river Tagus in Lisbon, Portugal. It is currently building a toll bridge across the river Severn, between England and Wales, in the joint venture with GTM Entrepose, the French construction group. Laing is raising the cash through a placing and offer to shareholders of 40.2m of 6.4 per cent convertible cumulative preference shares. The issue is being handled by Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Shareholders are being offered 9 convertible shares at Pounds 1 each for every 20 ordinary shares held. The company, which made a Pounds 11.6m pre-tax profit last year following a Pounds 65.3m loss in 1991, says it needs the money to increase its involvement in private infrastructure projects. It will also be used to to expand Laing's overseas contracting business, particularly in the Far East and to expand its private housebuilding operations from south-east England, where it currently operates, into the Midlands. Laing says it is also looking at opportunities in continental Europe through its recently formed Societe Europeenne de Construction joint venture with GTM Entrepose of France, NCC of Sweden and Strabag Bau of Germany, Laing had net cash of Pounds 34m at the end of April, but this excluded Pounds 125m of guarantees, performance bonds and letters of credit which increasingly are being sought by UK and international construction clients. The group said that increased demand for performance bonds and the requirement of a strong financial base to bid for private infrastructure projects had persuaded it to increase shareholders' funds through a preference issue rather than raise debt, despite its strong cash position. Mr Martin Laing, chairman, said: 'The increasing requirement for contractors to provide performance guarantees means that balance sheet strength is, and will continue to be, a competitive consideration in securing new business.' Performance bonds of up to 10 per cent of a contract's value mean that large amounts of capital can remain tied up in jobs that have already been completed, putting increased strain on balance sheets. A shortage of construction work in the UK meant that customers have been in a much stronger position to demand performance guarantees.</p>

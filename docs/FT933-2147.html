			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Social Democrats pick compromise leader THE SOCIAL Democratic party, the largest group in Japan's coalition government, yesterday chose Mr Tomiichi Murayama as its new chairman in an election highlighting party members' unease at their alliance with conservative parties. Mr Murayama, 69, was backed by most factions within the SDP, formerly the Japan Socialist party, but 33 per cent of members did not vote and 22 per cent of the voters supported a far-left candidate, Mr Masatoshi Ito, who opposes political reforms proposed by the coalition. Before standing in the election, Mr Murayama had criticised the reforms, but he has agreed to offer public support for four bills which the coalition government hopes to push through during an extraordinary session of parliament, which began on Friday. Mr Murayama replaces Mr Sadao Yamahana, who resigned after the SDP's poor showing at a July election, when it lost votes to newer parties and saw its representation cut from 134 to 70 in the lower house of parliament. Since the election, party members have disagreed over whether traditional left-leaning policies, including support for totalitarian North Korea, should be replaced or whether the party was losing supporters because of the move towards the middle ground. Mr Murayama was a compromise candidate who had not planned to stand for the leadership until pushed by more pragmatic leaders, who feared that a candidate too closely linked to the pro-reform group of Mr Yamahana could lose. However, Mr Murayama had joined a pro-reform group in 1972, when he opposed the attempts by the far left to take control of policy-making. The son of a fisherman, he was elected to local government after serving as a representative of a fishing co-operative in the south of Japan. He has chaired study groups which have defended Japan's ban on rice imports and his links to fishing co-operatives mean that he will be under pressure to take a stand against other proposals to liberalise food im-ports. After his election yesterday, Mr Murayama said the SDP would continue to support the coalition government and to reform itself. But Mr Ito argued that the unexpectedly large number of votes he received 'gives me a strong foundation on which to fight against political reforms'. While Mr Murayama pledged support for the coalition, he also campaigned against Japan's 3 per cent value added tax, which several other members of the seven-party coalition want to increase to as much as 10 per cent. The SDP also differs with most of its coalition partners on defence issues, including Japan's quest for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. Mr Murayama will be repeatedly torn between his loyalty to SDP policy and the need to hold the coalition together.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / People: Scottish Enterprise picks economics professor The new chairman of Scottish Enterprise, the government's economic development body for Scotland, is to be Professor Donald MacKay, probably Scotland's best known economist. He will succeed Sir David Nickson in January. MacKay, 55, has held professorships at Aberdeen and Heriot-Watt and he remains honorary professor at the latter university. In 1976 he founded the economic consultancy Pieda, which operates from Edinburgh, Reading and Manchester. He has been an economic consultant to the Scottish Secretary since 1971, writes an economic column in The Scotsman with a free market orientation and presents studies for Pieda clients lucidly and with a smile. His most recent was an assertion of the case for preserving the Rosyth naval dockyard in Scotland against its rival Devonport, in which he accused the Ministry of Defence of advancing 'a quite extraordinary and unacceptable argument.' Just before the general election he produced a study undermining the economic arguments for a Scottish parliament and for Scottish independence. He is a less emollient man than Nickson, 63, who presided over the breaking up of the Scottish Development Agency, where he became chairman in 1989. The SDA was transformed into Scottish Enterprise, which consists of a core body and 13 local enterprise companies. Nickson guided the government in making Scottish Enterprise a viable organisation, and soothed the anguished brows of the SDA's top executives, many of whom however left. Prof MacKay is a non-executive director of Grampian Holdings, the industrial mini-conglomerate. Sir David Nickson, who is to devote more time to his business interests, is chairman of the Australian-owned Clydesdale Bank.</p>

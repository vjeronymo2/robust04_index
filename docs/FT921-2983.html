			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Linde beats trend with pre-tax rise LINDE, the diversified German industrial company, managed to beat off the worst effects of the worldwide economic slowdown last year, with a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to DM528m (Dollars 315m). Based in Wiesbaden, near Frankfurt, the company is the world's biggest producer of fork-lift trucks, having bought Lansing Bagnall of the UK four years ago. Its other activities include industrial gases, heavy plant manufacture, and refrigeration systems. Group turnover in 1991 increased by 14 per cent to DM6.9bn. Although new order inflow was 8 per cent lower at DM6.8bn, Linde said there was an increase of 10 per cent to DM5.8bn when the plant division - which booked an unusually big DM1.1bn order in the previous year - was excluded. The dividend is being maintained at DM15 a share, as indicated by Mr Hans Meinhardt, the chief executive, last November. Fresenius, the German pharmaceutical and medical products group, has acquired the fusion solutions, dialysis solutions, and irrigation solutions activities of BASF.</p>

			<p><P> November 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVENTIVE SCHOOLS GIVE TIRED CHEERS THE OLD COLLEGE TRY;  </P> <P> SPIRIT: THOUGH USC AND UCLA REMAIN TRADITIONAL, YELL SQUADS ACROSS THE COUNTRY  DELIGHT CROWDS WITH WITTY AND IRREVERENT CHANTS.  </P> <P> While USC quarterback Todd Marinovich may throw unexpected bombs to receivers  in Saturday's game against UCLA, the cheerleaders from both schools won't vary  from close-to-the-vest routines which advisers at both schools call  "traditional." UCLA cheerleaders will urge thousands of rooters to spell out  B-R-U-I-N-S. USC yell leaders will implore one side of the Coliseum to chant  "Go" and the other to bellow "Trojans."  </P> <P> It's not that way everywhere. Yell leaders at many colleges are more irreverent  than the staid Bruins and Trojans, delighting crowds with witty and inventive  cheers.  </P> <P> While fans at Occidental College in Eagle Rock scream "O-X-Y," male yell  leaders roll in the dirt in front of the grandstand to spell the letters.  </P> <P> If that doesn't rouse anyone, yell squad captain Amy Muller says she can always  rely on a poem which is a crowd favorite.  </P> <P> Oo oo ooga ahh  </P> <P>  Ah ah ooga ahh  </P> <P>  Igge igge igge oh  </P> <P>  Ah ah ooga ahh  </P> <P>  Go Oxy! rah, rah, rah.  </P> <P>  The yell which brings tears to the eyes of alumni, however, is "Io Triumphe,"  pirated from Albion College in Michigan in 1903.  </P> <P>  Io Triumphe! Io Triumphe!  </P> <P>  Haben, swaben, rebecca le animore  </P> <P>  Whoopy, whoopty, shellerdy veridy;  </P> <P>  Broomdy, Ralldy, eyedy pa  </P> <P>  Honeka, heneka, wack-a wacka;  </P> <P>  Hob, bob, boldibara, boldibara,  </P> <P>  Con slomaday, hob, dab, rah!  </P> <P>  O.C. RAH!  </P> <P>  There is also some funny business going on at nearby California Institute of  Technology in Pasadena.  </P> <P> When the Beavers' club team hosts the Pasadena Police Assn. Saturday, the  police may need a decoding unit to understand the Caltech rooters fearsome  traditional chant:  </P> <P> Cosine, tangent, secant, sine  </P> <P>  Logarithm, logarithm, hyperbolic sign,  </P> <P>  3-point-1-4-1-5-9  </P> <P>  slide rule, slide rule  </P> <P>  Tech, Tech, Tech.  </P> <P>  The Yale University marching band also trumpets its intellectual achievements.  When the Bulldogs play an opponent of questionable academic caliber, the  musicians yell "Two, four, six, eight. We can count to eight."  </P> <P> The band also plays fight songs by incomparable composers. Cole Porter, class  of 1913, wrote "Bulldog," containing the immortal line, "Bulldog! Bulldog! Bow,  wow-wow," and "Boola Boola," which includes the verse:  </P> <P>  Boola, Boola, Boola, Boola,  </P> <P>  When the Bulldog gets poor Harvard  </P> <P>  She will holler Boola Boo.  </P> <P>  Charles Ives (1898) weighed in with a drinking song, "Here's to Good Old  Yale/Drink it down, drink it down," not to be confused with his later complex,  modernistic pieces.  </P> <P> Many other unusual yells dot the country. When the Fighting Gobblers of  Virginia Tech score, a mechanical turkey gobbler on the scoreboard warbles.  </P> <P> Rooters for the University of California Irvine Anteaters add "Zot" after  spelling out "U-C-I," a throwback to the same word the anteater in the BC  cartoon uses when its tongue reaches its prey.  </P> <P> At Massachusetts Institute of Technology, secure rooters display a cavalier  attitude toward opponents' successes, yelling:  </P> <P>  That's all right.  </P> <P>  That's OK.  </P> <P>  You're gonna work  </P> <P>  For us someday."  </P> <P>  Unfortunately the Southern Arkansas Muleriders, the Arkansas Tech Wonder Boys  and the University of Akron Zips report no unusual cheers, and some schools,  such as Stanford University, have no organized cheers at all.  </P> <P> "We haven't had them since the 1960s," said Stanford spokesman Joel Shurkin,  explaining that counterculture students voted out cheering.  </P> <P> "I've been here 10 years and I've seen one cheer and that was an ad hoc job  during the big game with Cal . . . They've tried. God knows they've tried. But  with limited success. There is no sign of them ever coming back."  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Inch Up: The Treasury sold $8.4 billion of new three-month bills  at an average discount rate of 7.74%, up from 7.67% last week. Another $8.4  billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 7.79%,  up from 7.68% last week.  </P> <P> The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.00% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,804.40 and 8.22% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,604.00. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the average yield for  one-year T-bills, the most popular index for making changes in adjustable rate  mortgages, fell to 8.24% last week, down from 8.36% the previous week.  </P></p>

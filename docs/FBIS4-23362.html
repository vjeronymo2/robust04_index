			<p>BFN     [Text] The national consultative meeting of the 22  political parties belonging to the Group for Solidarity  [Groupement Pour la Solidarite, GPS] which started on 25 May  ended yesterday at the Tiama Hotel. During their talks, the GPS  members deliberated on particular proposals they can use to make  government reconsider its position on foreigners' ability to  vote. They also made suggestions to enable the Ivorian  Government to positively review the issue of financing political  parties. Mr. Koman Achi, GPS's chairman, comments on  foreigners' right to vote.    [Begin Achi recording] No sensible and responsible Ivorian  can accept a law whose sole aim is to guarantee the election of  one man, but which in essence constitutes a serious threat to  civil peace in our country and in the whole West African  subregion. There is no country in the world where foreigners  are authorized to vote to elect the president of the Republic.  What prompts Cote d'Ivoire to make an exception to this rule?  Are we more democratic in Cote d'Ivoire than other people  around the globe?    Cote d'Ivoire's political parties are convinced that the law  conferring the right for foreigners to vote will be passed if it  is presented to parliamentarians at the National Assembly.  Therefore, the political parties have decided to do some  housecleaning themselves. They have made proposals on methods  for party funding. The proposals will soon be submitted to the  head of government and the president. [end recording]</p>

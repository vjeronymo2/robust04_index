			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Minimum pension may be scrapped: Proposals part of government campaign to reduce state benefits and ease private sector's involvement PROPOSALS to scrap the Guaranteed Minimum Pension, which helps protect the value of millions of occupational pensions against inflation, are being considered by the government. The move is being examined as part of the government's desire to roll back state-provided benefits and to make it easier for the private sector to fill the gap. Whitehall officials have been meeting pensions industry experts over the past few months to discuss possible replacements. Employers are currently required to provide a Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) for workers who choose to contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps). These guaranteed pensions rise by three per cent a year to protect pensioners against inflation. Although many pensioners in occupational schemes receive more than the GMP, the system provides a floor as well as a mechanism which ensures most schemes uprate benefits annually. GMP acts as a safety net for pensioners whose scheme assets fail to provide enough to cover their promised benefits. It ensures that they at least receive the minimum amount guaranteed by the original 1978 legislation which established the state pensions scheme. Without these rules Maxwell company pensioners might have been left penniless. The pensions industry has argued that GMP, introduced before most occupational pensions offered inflation-linked increases, is no longer needed to protect pensioners' interests. It is also, they say, an administrative nightmare. If the government were to stop GMP entirely it would be attacking a cornerstone of old-age provision in the UK. Shifting responsibilities from the state to individuals or to employers is one of the most controversial elements in the government's longer-term efforts to cut the rising social security budget. Employers whose schemes contract out of Serps earn rebates of National Insurance contributions and in return, promise to provide minimum levels of benefit for their scheme members. From 1988, employers promise to increase the GMP portion of pension annually by three per cent, and for those whose service has been interrupted to uprate the GMP portion at seven per cent per year for each year until the pension is drawn. The pensions industry is urging the government to address the GMP issue when it publishes its recommendations on equalisation of state pension ages for men and women because GMP, available to men and women at different ages, must also be equalised. A Department of Social Security spokesman said: 'The government is aware that employers feel there are problems with administering the GMP and that they would like to see simpler alternatives introduced. 'However, if GMP were to be abolished there would have to be alternative contracting out arrangements to ensure the system operated properly and that the pensions positions of individuals was protected.

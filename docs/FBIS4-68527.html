			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Turchenko: "Revenge of the Embezzlers; </F> The `Filippov Case' at the Parliamentary Hearings"]    [Text] On 19 April, the State Duma Committee on Security  under the chairmanship of Viktor Ilyukhin held parliamentary  hearings, "On Cases of Gross Violation of the Tax and Labor  Legislation Allowed by Officials of St. Petersburg and Russia."  The investigation was triggered by the appeal of the former  chief of the state tax service in St. Petersburg, Dmitriy  Filippov, to the chairman of the State Duma.    The Committee on Security performed a preliminary  investigation of the questions raised in the appeal, and  presented for review a packet of documents testifying to the  fact that a number of state officials are inflicting tremendous  loss upon the economic security of Russia, and counteracting the  receipt of considerable ruble and currency revenues by the  federal and state budgets. The St. Petersburg State Tax Service,  which was headed by Dmitriy Filippov up until 9 October 1993,  uncovered these facts. This seriously affected the interests of  commercial structures, joint enterprises and the state property  fund, which had been concealing huge profits from taxation,  directing them not their intended purpose but in the interests  of enriching private individuals and foreign states. Under their  pressure, Filippov was dismissed from his duties on 9 October  1993.    As evident from the report prepared for the hearings by the  Committee on Security, Filippov's dismissal was facilitated by  Mayor A. Sobchak, RF Goskomimushchestvo [Russian Federation  Committee on State Property] Chairman A. Chubays, former Acting  Prime Minister Ye. Gaydar, former RF Minister of Finance B.  Fedorov, and the chief of the Russian State Tax Service, V.  Gusev.    Members of the Committee on Security, Viktor Mironov,  Aleksey  Sarychev, Vladimir Baryshev (all representatives of "Russia's  Choice") immediately made efforts to undermine the parliamentary  hearings, citing various excuses. Their desire to narrow the  problem to an elementary labor conflict whose review, they said,  was not within the competency of the Committee on Security, did  not find support among the overwhelming majority of the deputies.    Both sides of the so-called "labor conflict" were presented  at the parliamentary hearings. Unfortunately, the  representatives of the St. Petersburg procurator's office which,  according to the facts uncovered by Filippov, had instituted the  criminal case, were unable to be present at these hearings.    "It all began," Dmitriy Filippov told the deputies, "as soon  as our service undertook a serious investigation of the joint  enterprises. Our hair stood up on end! As it turns out, many of  them are created primarily through Russian currency credits,  using our cheap work force. But the products are shipped abroad,  leaving the currency profits in foreign banks and not even  paying tax to Russia. This is double and triple robbery of the  state. The Russian-Swiss enterprise `Europa-Hotel' `bilked' our  budget out of $24 million. The Russian-Finnish enterprise  `Lenraumamebel' shipped 90 percent of its finished product for  sale in Finland, where the money earned was used in the  interests of the Finnish economy. And there are many such  examples in the documents which were submitted. Our service was  able to return part of the dollars. But then the pressure  started from the mayorality and the government. They said we  were hindering the investment of foreign capital. But tell us,  please, where are the investments?!"    "There was even greater pressure exerted by the power  structures when we undertook an investigation of the property  fund. It became apparent that a large part of the money obtained  from privatization does not go to the budget, but is used in the  circulation of commercial banks for preferential 2-percent  credit. In other words, here too there is a gigantic rip-off of  the state and stuffing of the pockets of businessmen, who are  protected by state bureaucrats. As soon as they sensed a threat  to themselves, they dismissed me from my duties on 9 October of  last year. In the words of the deputy chief of the State Tax  Service, the reason for my dismissal was a letter from Sobchak  and pressure from Gaydar. In his conversation with me, Sobchak  did not hide the fact that he had sent such a letter because, he  said, there had been great pressure exerted on him from the  government of Russia, and Chubays played the most active role in  this."    "The capital's Sverdlovsk Rayon Court reinstated me to my  position. But then a directive from Chernomyrdin appeared,  regarding the elevation of its status to the level of deputy  chief of the RF State Tax Service. Appointed to this position  was a specialist in... agriculture. I was once again dismissed  due to staff cut-backs, even though there were no cut-backs. I  again filed a claim with the Sverdlovsk Rayon Court, where a  hearing will be held on this case on 26 April."    The chairman gave the floor to the chief of the RF State Tax  Service, V. Gusev. He spoke at length about the general problems  of the department, but did not have the courage to approach the  question of the "Petersburg conflict." Only the specific  questions of the deputies forced him to do so.    "On what grounds did you dismiss Filippov in October of  1993?"    "The court reviewed this question and rescinded my order. I  have nothing to add to the court's decision."    "Was there pressure exerted upon you?"    "I do not recall such a thing..."    "What was the reason for Filippov's second dismissal?"    "On 26 April there will be a trial on this matter. It will  clarify everything."    "But can you explain the motive for your second order?"    "The trial will be held on 26 April, and this will be  clarified at that time."    That is the level of explanations given by the official...    The members of the committee, who carefully studied tens of  documents on the question under review, were for the most part  synonymous in their opinion. Stanislav Govorukhin spoke bitterly  of the fact that the Petersburg "Russia's Choice" reflected,  like the world in a drop of water, the entire grave criminal  situation in which Russia finds itself. Under the guise of  investments and all kinds of privatizations, it is being  plundered on an unprecedented scale. And, if there are not  enough people in the Duma willing to oppose this, then the  imminent collapse of the state is inevitable.    No less bitterness resounded in the words of Yuriy Vlasov as  he spoke about that most outrageous situation which has arisen  in the state mechanism of Russia: He who steals or helps to  plunder the country gets respect and a position, while he who  courageously stands up in defense of state interests is cast  aside by the system. If the Duma is unable to defend Filippov,  he stressed, then there can be no discussion of its capacity to  stop the plunder of the country.    The previously mentioned representatives of "Russia's  Choice"  once again tried to obstruct the parliamentary hearings. They  called for the committee not to make any decision, to wait for  the trail, or at least to create a parliamentary commission.  However, the decree was adopted by an overwhelming majority of  votes. It contains a proposal to the head of the RF government  for immediate reinstatement of Dmitriy Filippov to his duties.  It recommends that, in the first half of 1994, the Russian State  Tax Service conduct an investigation into the activities of  Goskomimushchestvo. A packet of documents on cases of gross  violation of the tax and labor legislation will be forwarded to  the procurator general for resolution of the question of  bringing the guilty parties to responsibility. It was decided  that the problems raised at the parliamentary hearing should be  brought to the plenary meeting of the State Duma.</p>

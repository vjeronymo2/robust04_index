			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 5 (XINHUA) -- A new hydro power  generating unit with a capacity of 300,000 kw went into  operation last Saturday [4 Jun] at Geheyan Hydro Power Station  in Hubei Province.    Funded by a Canadian loan of 108 million U.S. dollars, the  Geheyan Power Station, a major peak and frequency modulation  power plant in the central China power grid, will have four  generators with a total generating capacity of 1.2 million kw.  The newly added generating unit was jointly designed by China  and Canada and built in Harbin, northeast China.    Two units which had gone into operation earlier, were built  by Canada.    The construction of the Geheyan Station is now in its final  stage.</p>

Gorbachev touting a Minnesota-made vodka will be  changed during the Soviet president's visit to the Twin Cities next month, a  liquor wholesaler said today.  </P> <P> "Civically, we feel it's our part to welcome him respectfully," said Mitchell  Johnson, president of Johnson Brothers Wholesale Liquor Co. of St. Paul.  </P> <P> Johnson Brothers had earlier approved the billboard campaign for Minnesota-made  Karkov vodka. The billboards show a likeness of Gorbachev holding a bottle of  Karkov under the caption "The Party's Over," a reference to the Communist  Party's problems.  </P> <P> The 38 billboards dot the Minneapolis-St. Paul area and were planned to be up  until mid-June. Gorbachev is scheduled to visit the Twin Cities for six hours  on June 3 after attending summit talks with President Bush in Washington.  </P></p>

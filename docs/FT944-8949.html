			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Everest Foods shares up 13p after AGM Shares in Everest Foods rose 13p to 69p after the annual meeting was told that the potato chip producer would return to previous levels of profitability. Mr Bob Gilbert, chairman, announced that strong demand for an expanded product range had led to increased sales and 'acceptable margins' in the core business. Everest, which also owns Ashfords, the food distributor, reported a 47 per cent decrease in pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.1m in the year ending May 31. The dividend for the year was cut to 2.5p (3.7p). A move to low-cost economy products by supermarkets had affected margins in the frozen chips business. Mr Gilbert said the group was currently realising the effect of efficiencies introduced in the manufacturing processes. This would improve profitability despite the rise in potato prices which had resulted from a potato shortage.</p>

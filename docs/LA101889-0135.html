			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING / FINANCE  </P> <P> Because of a disagreement with directors over the planned growth of US  Facilities Corp., Robert J. Percival has stepped down as vice chairman and  chief operating officer of the Costa Mesa insurance holding company.  </P> <P> Percival will remain on the board as a director and, under his employment  contract, will act as a consultant for the next two years, said Rosemary  Mulligan, a company spokeswoman.  </P> <P> George Kadonada, US Facilities chairman and president, will assume Percival's  duties while the company looks for a replacement.  </P> <P> Mulligan said the board was dissatisfied with the company's lackluster  performance and wants to improve the firm's growth.  </P> <P> Meantime, the company bought 112,000 shares -- about 3% -- of its common stock  from a shareholder and retired the shares. Mulligan said the price paid for the  shares earlier this month was attractive to the company, but she refused to  reveal any other details.  </P> <P> The company said the stock purchase was unrelated to recent turmoil in the  stock market.  </P> <P> The company operates USF RE Insurance Co., a property and casualty reinsurance  company, and US Benefits Inc., an underwriting manager for excess group medical  stop-loss coverage.  </P></p>

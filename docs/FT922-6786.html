			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Providing motorway services Two management contracts, together valued at around Pounds 10m, have been awarded by Forte to the P&amp;O company BOVIS CONSTRUCTION to build and fit out two Welcome Break motorway service areas, both of them in Scotland. The larger will be built on the M74 at Gretna Green and the other, at Abington, Lanarkshire, is at the junction of the A73 and M74. Work has already started at Abington and completion is due in December. The Gretna Green project begins this month with completion in spring 1993. At Abington, the client is Forte Welcome Break, part of Forte, while at Gretna Green it is Forte Welcome Break in association with BP. The Gretna Green project involves the redevelopment of the Welcome Break services area on the northbound carriageway of the M74, together with the extension of a Travelodge. A new and larger amenity building of 25,000 sq ft will provide two restaurants, together with shops, a tourist information centre and staff quarters. Other Bovis works include the construction of an extensive road network giving access from and to the M74, together with parking for 250 vehicles. At Abington, there is a similar specification building, of 16,000 sq ft, again containing two restaurants, a shop and rest rooms/toilets. Bovis will also manage the construction of a 56-bedroom Travelodge. Outside there will be parking for up 230 vehicles.</p>

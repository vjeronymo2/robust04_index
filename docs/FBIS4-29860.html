			<p>CSO     [Editorial Report] The 20 May Seoul CHUNGANG ILBO on page  2 reported that a meeting was held on 9 May between the Ministry  of National Defense (MND) and the ruling party's Special  Committee for Promoting National Competitiveness. At the  meeting, the ministry revealed several plans that it is ready to  implement to support a nationwide effort to raise the country's  "competitive edge." One of the MND plans is to open a military  technical college. The ministry believes the school will not  only teach soldiers the skills needed to "manage and maintain"  highly technical military equipment and weapons, but also  provide future technicians for the country, since all graduates  of the school will be fully licensed. The ministry hopes that  the school, which will be open to all soldiers who pass a basic  test, will be an added incentive for re-enlistment. The  ministry intends to finalize its plans for the school by  November, by which time it hopes to have obtained approximately  50 billion won for the school.    Another of the ministry's plans involves issuing  technicians'  licenses to ex-military personnel. Under the plan, anyone who  acquired technical skills while in the military will be exempted  from taking all or a portion of the required national  technicians' tests. Currently, there are 194 technical fields  requiring licenses. The ministry plans to come up with  additional fields, such as aerial photography, fire prevention  equipment installation, auto works, etc.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bujumbura, 25 Apr (AFP) -- Six or seven Burundian  soldiers, including four officers, were arrested yesterday after  a an attempted coup d'etat in Bujumbura, diplomatic and military  sources disclosed. The situation in Bujumbura seemed "quite  normal" this morning, a diplomat in the Burundian capital said.    According to the Burundian Army headquarters, this attempted  coup was planned by "very few Army elements, who were  immediately neutralized, thus preventing them from rallying  other soldiers to their cause." Four officers and two or three  other ranks were arrested while four others have reportedly  fled, the same sources added. The officers arrested are said to  be from the Higher Institute of Senior Military Officers. They  are currently under interrogation. [passage omitted]</p>

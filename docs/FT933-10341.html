			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank calms the market THE Bundesbank surprised foreign exchange dealers for the third time in seven days yesterday by bringing down the cost of borrowing short-term funds in its wholesale money market, writes James Blitz. The German central bank may have had a strong domestic reason for making the move, because the fall in call money would have made the old repo rate of 6.90 per cent too unattractive for banks. Some dealers, however, suggested that the move may have been intended to help out the other currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, several of which could still come under heavy selling pressure now that their old floors have been removed. The French franc yesterday stabilised against the D-Mark, closing in London at FFr3.485 from a previous FFr3.505. France's determination not to cut its intervention rate yet has settled the market. But there is little reason for a cut in the intervention rate, while three-month interest rates remain nearly 2 percentage points above the intervention level. Dealers said such huge quantities of French funds were removed from the market during last Friday's intervention, that the Bank of France had to add liquidity before a rate cut became meaningful. Denmark and Belgium continued to take more active measures to support their currencies' D-Mark parity, ignoring all thought of easing monetary policy. The Belgian franc was the victim of a modest attack of selling, falling to a new low of BFr21.6424 to the D-Mark. Again, the Belgian central bank intervened in the market to help the currency back to a close of BFr21.33. The amount of intervention was described by one dealer as being comparatively modest. The Danish krone appreciated sharply, ending at DKr3.9750 per D-Mark, having been as low as DKr4.0467 at one stage. But this was at the cost of Monday's rise in one-month krone to 25 per cent, which yesterday had overnight borrowing at 250 per cent. Spain, however, showed yesterday that a cut in interest rates can help the currency to appreciate because dealers are prepared to put a higher premium on economic growth than interest rate returns. The Bank of Spain reduced its repo rate from 11 per cent to 10 1/2 per cent, which led to a sharp rally in the peseta from Pta83.17 per D-Mark to a close of Pta81.48 in London. Sterling was mostly unmoved by yesterday's events, closing a pfennig up at DM2.5650. But the dollar continued to fall sharply, finishing more than a pfennig down on the day at DM1.7050. In New York the US currency ended trading at DM1.7075. Dealers speculated that the pressure on the dollar may result from selling of the currency by central banks which will need to repay the Bundesbank with D-Marks for its help with intervention.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Ethiopia's former rulers on trial Ethiopia's former Marxist rulers were put on trial yesterday, charged with genocide and crimes against humanity during a 17-year dictatorship which ended with the overthrow of Col Mengistu Haile Mariam in 1991. It is the first time an African government has attempted to make a former regime accountable for human rights violations, and its conduct may provide a model for nations such as Rwanda and Liberia. Col Mengistu, who lives in exile in Zimbabwe, and 20 officers of his military junta are being tried in absentia. Attempts by the transitional government to obtain their extradition have failed as the accused face the death penalty if found guilty. The 45 former officials who appeared before the central High Court in Addis Ababa yesterday were charged with ordering the killings and disappearances of more than 2,000 identified people. From 1974 to 1991 tens of thousands of Ethiopians were murdered, tortured or disappeared.</p>

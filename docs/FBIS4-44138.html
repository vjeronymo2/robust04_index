			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, June 24 (AA) -- President Suleyman Demirel  received Selim Sadak and Sedat Yurtdas today in the presidential  palace.    The two are the members of the Democracy Party (DEP) which  was banned by the Constitutional Court last week. The court in  its decision also decided to strip the 13 DEP deputies from  parliament membership.    Shortly after the decision, the State Security Court chief  prosecutor, Nusret Demiral, announced that Sadak and Yurtdas  were to be detained.    However, acting parliament speaker Kamer Genc said in  response that the two deputies can not be detained unless the  court's decision is received by parliament.    Among all this controversy, the two deputies participated in  a parliamentary session and asked an appointment with the  president.    After the meeting which was closed to the press, Sadak said  they briefed the president on the problems which would emerge  after the closure of DEP and the removal of their immunity for  prosecution.    `We conveyed to the president, the concerns about the  non-representation of the southeastern people in parliament,'  Sadak said.</p>

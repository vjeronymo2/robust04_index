			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Central bank moves to protect peseta THE BANK of Spain yesterday announced emergency measures to protect the beleaguered peseta against currency speculators, effectively freezing trading in the peseta in a thinly disguised reintroduction of exchange controls eight months after they were abolished. The measures, termed as technical by the central bank, force institutions purchasing foreign currency against the peseta, or buying pesetas, to deposit a sum equivalent to the transaction, interest free, with the Bank of Spain for a year. The Bank said the action was necessary because of the 'volatility, speculation and disorder' in the currency markets. 'The measures are absolutely temporary and will be in force solely during the period of (currency market) instability, Mr Miguel Martin, deputy governor, told a press conference last night. Mr Angel Sanchez, chief currency trader at Banco Santander de Negocios, said: 'We were expecting something on these lines but the measures are much tougher than we had feared.' In Brussels, European Commission officials said they were looking at whether the Spanish government's moves were legally in line with its EC commitments, but would not be drawn into any premature judgment. Spanish officials in Brussels took the more relaxed view that by the time the Commission makes up its mind, the government may have beaten back the speculators. Irish officials in Brussels have pointing to the relative success of Dublin's use of its remaining exchange controls, which last week and on Monday, they say, burnt some speculators who were unable to cover short positions. The Spanish development was a clear blow to those who were selling pesetas short and who had gone 'long' on foreign currencies, particularly to those taking one to three-day positions. Banks, both domestic and foreign, are understood to have done considerable business in recent days by buying against the peseta. An indication of the scale of speculation came with the Bank of Spain's additional order that the foreign exchange positions taken by domestic banks could not exceed 7 per cent of their assets. Anything above that level would also have to be matched with a deposit in a non-interest bearing Bank of Spain account. The peseta, which began trading in the EMS yesterday at Pta71 to the D-Mark, closed at Pta68, moving from the bottom to the top of the ERM grid. Analysts said, however, that the fate of the peseta remained intimately tied to that of the French franc and to the future of the EMS. The Bank of Spain was seen to have erected a temporary defensive barrier while it awaited developments over a possible general realignment that would necessarily involve the peseta. With its move the Bank averted raising official interest rates, which remained yesterday at 13 per cent.</p>

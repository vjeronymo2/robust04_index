			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS: WOODBURY UNIVERSITY;  </P> <P> VETERAN ARCHITECT LOUIS NAIDORF TO HEAD PROGRAM  </P> <P> Woodbury University's architecture program will take on a new staff design with  the appointment of veteran architect Louis Naidorf as chairman.  </P> <P> The architect, whose work ranges from architecture and urban design to research  and design methods, succeeds Donald Conway. Naidorf, 61, who will take over the  post June 18, is an architect at the Santa Monica architecture firm Ellerbe  Becket and will continue working there part time.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Powers Doud, vice president of academic affairs at the college,  said: "We are delighted that a professional of such distinction will be leading  the architecture program. His distinction speaks for itself, including the 40  years professional experience at Ellerbe Becket, his academic background . . .  and his extensive teaching experience."  </P> <P> His principal architecture projects include the Hyatt Regency in Dallas, the  Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, the restoration of the California  State Capitol in Sacramento and the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.  </P> <P> During the past 18 years, Naidorf also has become increasingly interested and  involved in the education of architects.  </P> <P> He has been an instructor, guest critic, seminar coordinator and lecturer at  architecture and design programs at UCLA, USC, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San  Luis Obispo, the Southern California Institute of Architecture and the Otis Art  Institute of Parsons School of Design.  </P> <P> "I want to give students the confidence to provide both art and function  without compromise in the design of their buildings," Naidorf said.  </P> <P> Naidorf has won numerous professional awards and is widely published in  professional journals.  </P> <P> </P> <P> COLLEGE of the CANYONS  </P> <P> Neighbors Protest Board's Plans for Swap Meets  </P> <P> Neighbors of College of the Canyons in Valencia have gathered more than 500  signatures on a petition protesting a recent decision by the college's  governing board to allow a swap meet to use the campus on weekends.  </P> <P> A contract between the Santa Clarita Community College District Board of  Trustees and swap meet organizers has not been signed, but the meets were to  begin the first weekend of July. The trustees had requested minor changes in  the proposed contract when they endorsed the on-campus swap meets recently.  </P> <P> Thirty homeowners attended a trustees meeting last month, and many said the  swap meets would bring additional traffic, noise and trash to their  neighborhood and would cause the value of their homes to drop.  </P> <P> Trustee Michele Jenkins said the audience was the largest she had seen at a  meeting in five years.  </P> <P> "I believe a swap meet would cause a severe environmental impact," said Alan  Zada, director of the Valencia Summit Homeowner Assn. He said post-swap meet  trash would line the area's streets.  </P> <P> Nazareth Chobanian, one of the swap meet organizers, said the area would be  cleaned up after each week's event. Residents whose homes face the college said  they paid up to $30,000 more for their homes because of the view they have of  the campus. Several said locating a swap meet there would decrease the value of  their homes.  </P> <P> The homeowners acknowledged that the college needs to raise money and offered  to develop alternative sources of funds.  </P> <P> College Supt.-President Dianne Van Hook assured homeowners that their views  would be considered before trustees decide whether to sign the final contract  with the swap meet organizers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PIERCE COLLEGE  </P> <P> Rodeo Back in the Saddle Again After 4 Years  </P> <P> The 34th annual Pierce College Intercollegiate Rodeo, which last month returned  to Pierce after a four-year absence, came off virtually without a hitch,  according to its organizer.  </P> <P> "This has been, without a doubt, the finest rodeo in the 19 years I've been  here," said Ron Wechsler, an animal science instructor who is in charge of the  rodeo.  </P> <P> A small protest by about a dozen animal-rights activists didn't affect the  two-day rodeo, attended by 10,000 people. The rodeo was held May 11 and 12. The  rodeo's hiatus had resulted because the college had been unable to secure  liability insurance for the event.  </P> <P> Five college teams, from as far away as Nevada, competed in eight events during  the weekend. West Hills College of Coalinga, which is ranked first nationally,  won the meet. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo finished second.  </P> <P> The Pierce team placed third overall and was led by saddle bronc rider Richard  Bucher. Bucher, who is ranked second in the West Coast Intercollegiate Rodeo  Assn., won a second place on one of the rodeo's two nights and placed fourth  overall. Pierce's Michelle Morrison won second place in the Girl's Barrel Race  and also placed fourth overall.  </P> <P> Though he characterized the rodeo as a success, Wechsler said he is unsure  whether it will become an annual event.  </P> <P> "It's not easy to get funding with all the cutbacks" at Pierce, "but we did it  and it worked well," he said.  </P> <P> The rodeo grossed about $30,000, but the net profit from the event is not yet  known. Profits will go to support agriculture programs at Pierce.  </P></p>

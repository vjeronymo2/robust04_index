History  is not unipolar, but is based on a number of contradictions,  such as the contradiction between dream and reality. Every  current reality was once a dream, and no matter how satisfactory  the current reality is, it also has its dream that it wants to  fulfill. The logic of history is that it is in a constant state  of evolution. So despite ups and downs in human progress, the  final outcome is this inevitable evolution. There is also a  conflict of interests between classes, nations, generations, and  between the new technologies and their acquired values on the  one hand, and the prevailing inherited values on the other. Any  strong blow to a new world order will come from a conflict of  interests, cultures, beliefs, and ambitions between North and  South and East and West.    Overlooking these facts will make the "New World Order" a  mere assumption, a proposal, or an aspiration. Even in one  family, which consists of only a few individuals, it is very  difficult to devise a way to reconcile the separate aims,  conflicting desires, and different concerns of its members, let  alone a situation on a worldwide level. Mankind with all its  diversities and vast areas is too big to contain in any  crucible, and to melt and mould on any fire.    The problem with the United States is that it is formulating  its policies in isolation of history, because it is a nation  without history.    The gangster system, which is prevalent in the underworld of  U.S. cities, in making money, and attaining high position --  including even the presidency -- has left its imprint on U.S.  policy, where might is right.    This feeling of power has eliminated the bipolar world  order.  To the United States, the world now is a hand-mill turning  around one pivot, which is the United States of course.    There has always been ignorance of time, conflict between  opposite sides, and of other party or parties.    There has always been the feeling that using force or  threatening to use force is sufficient to make the United States  assume the role of a deity in Greek mythology.    Force of arms can hammer out a new world, where all people  are slaves and where the United States rules supreme on its  throne forever. The UN Security Council, with its big and small  states, is that world, and a knock from its chairman's mallet is  sufficient to make things happen.    But no one seems to think that compared to the world, the  Security Council is just a tiny drop in an ocean. How many  billions on our global earth are suffering, dreaming, or fed up  with their lives? They all seek freedom, food, and honor, and  they all believe that these aspirations are their legitimate  right and that it is their duty to work hard in order to attain  them.    How can we combine the casinos of Las Vegas and Monte Carlo,  the cafes of the Champs-Elysees, and the winter resorts of  Switzerland with the camps of the Palestinians, the villages of  India, the alleys of Manila, the famine areas of Somalia, the  mine that exploded from the bag of history in Yugoslavia, the  internecine fighting in Afghanistan, and the search for potato  roots in the debris of the Soviet Union? Indeed, how can we  combine all of these in one context or formula? Can they, in  their "New World Order," cancel the conflict of interests  between the United States and Japan; or between Britain and  Germany; or between them and the sharks of the EC states? Can  they solve ethnic, religious, and racial problems and the border  problems existing since World War I? Can they feed all the  hungry, or make all people equal in hunger and poverty? They  cannot. So how will this world order look? Let us assume that  they can do all that. But this would mean that they have  defeated the purpose of establishing the New World Order, which  is to place their interests above the interests of all the other  states.    There remains power. The United States, with all its air and  naval fleets, ground forces, armies, missiles, security organs,  media, the additional strength of its allies and agents, its  funds, and the funds of its oil-rich allies, could not make the  people of Iraq -- a country small in area and population --  budge an inch from its position. So what was the use of this  power?    Iraq remained as it wanted, not as they wanted it to be. The  same thing happened in Lebanon and is happening in Somalia,  although at a much-reduced level. The world's garment is  tattered and its body is exposed to the winds and sun. No  system is big enough to handle the tragedies of the universe or  to stem their natural flow.    Shaping world destinies in closed chambers means creating  delusions.</p>

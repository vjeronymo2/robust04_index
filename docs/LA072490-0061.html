			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> CSUN CAMPUS NEAR CAPACITY FOR FALL  </P> <P> The Ventura branch of Cal State Northridge is virtually full for the fall  semester and has stopped accepting undergraduate applications for all but one  program.  </P> <P> "Right now, we have more students than we have classes for," campus director  Joyce Kennedy said.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I find it kind of alarming. It focuses on the enormous need in  Ventura County for additional opportunities for higher education."  </P> <P> Applications are usually accepted at least until Aug. 1. Increased demand has  forced officials to move the deadline up in recent years, officials said.  However, applications for the undergraduate health education program will be  accepted until Aug. 1, as well as applications for some graduate programs.  </P> <P> Last semester, the campus had space for the equivalent of about 370 full-time  students. That will increase to about 450 for the 1990-91 school year, Kennedy  said. About 1,100 mostly part-time students are enrolled at the campus.  </P> <P> That projected growth will not be sufficient to accommodate the students  seeking to enroll, Kennedy said.  </P> <P> Estimating that the deadline for the spring, 1991, semester could be as early  as September, school officials urged students to apply as soon as possible.

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / Irish electricity jobs to go The ESB, Ireland's state electricity company, plans to shed 2,900 jobs, nearly one third of its workforce, and has given trade unions until the end of next month to agree a five-year rationalisation programme. The programme, intended to cut costs by IPounds 100m, was drawn up after a review of the ESB by consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. The bulk of the jobs, 1,475, are to go in power generation, with another 1,000 jobs to be lost in customer services and 400 in head office administration. McKinsey concluded that the ESB was efficient in the areas of fuel purchase and fund management but it did not match international standards of efficiency in other areas. The ESB trade unions said they would seek fewer redundancies. They opposed McKinsey's approach of comparing the ESB with larger more efficient North American utilities. The ESB shake-up is the latest in a series of crises at Irish state-owned companies.</p>

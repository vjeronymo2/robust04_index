			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Big challenges for new Algerian leader Gen Lamine Zeroual, sworn in yesterday as Algeria's sixth head of state, faces huge challenges on the economic and political fronts during his first weeks in office. Gen Zeroual, who retains his defence portfolio, will have to decide whether to attempt dialogue with the banned Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Secret talks between senior officers and representatives of FIS have come to nothing, and Mr Ali Benhadj, one of the more fiery FIS leaders, has written from prison that nothing is possible until 'those who suspended the elections two years ago and spilt the blood of Moslem children are brought to trial'. Some in the military are convinced that a genuine attempt to talk provides the only hope of separating moderates from the more revolutionary fundamentalists, such as the Armed Islamic Group who have claimed responsibility for the killing of foreigners and foreign wives of Algerians. Some officers fear that without dialogue there could be a risk of widespread regional and factional violence. Others are wary of dialogue, as they believe fundamentalist supporters would make them pay a heavy price for the repression they have suffered for the past two years. A policy of dialogue is supported by the most respected lay opposition leader, Mr Hocine Ait Ahmed, who leads the Front des Forces Socialistes. He says the army holds 'the keys' to the future but must talk to all political parties, not only the FIS. He suggests it should share power with civilian parties, a position the military has not agreed to since independence 33 years ago. A further argument in favour of dialogue is that negotiations are well advanced with the International Monetary Fund on a package of economic reforms. So are talks to lighten the burden of foreign debt payments which in 1994 will absorb all Algeria's foreign income. Mr Redha Malek, who was confirmed as prime minister yesterday, has made public his wish for agreement with the IMF ever since he took taking office last August. Senior European and US observers do not believe it will be possible to sell further austerity to a population which has suffered five years of declining living standards and civil strife, if minimum political consensus is not achieved. Gen Zeroual's father was an imam (preacher), and Mr Malek's a cadi (Moslem judge). Their background and credentials may help their efforts towards building a consensus. Much of the initial support for the FIS came from young Algerians despairing at the corruption and inefficiency of a command economy which, for a quarter of a century was run by one party, the National Liberation Front, with army backing. This despair was shared by millions who were opposed to the methods and aims of the 'Party of God' but who in the past two years have refused to support the government because of its failure to enact economic reforms. Some of Algeria's western partners, such as Spain and the US, for two years now have consistently argued that dialogue, however hard, and economic reforms provide the only hope of averting civil unrest. The French government, most notably Mr Charles Pasqua, minister of the interior, has been blunt in support for the regime. But the comment of Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, this month, indicating that the status quo was untenable, suggests France may be shifting its ground. Those who remain opposed to talking with the FIS argue that a 'moderate' fundamentalist is a contradiction in words. Yet the more radical Islamic groups are known to despise the FIS, which when allowed to operate legally was never monolithic in its views and behaviour. Even Algerians opposed to the FIS know there must be a difference between religious fanatics trained in Afghanistan and the average young Algerian despairing at the prospect of no job and no housing.</p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: S Africa budget good first step to let both rich and poor prosper Sir, Your front page caption concerning the South Africa budget (June 23) should not have used the phrase wealth tax, which sets exactly the wrong tone in describing what the budget is attempting to achieve. Your leading article ('South Africa's balancing act') is far clearer. The device of a levy on normal income tax has been used by the South African government in the past and to good effect. In this instance, the budget recognises the legitimacy of a one-off call on the pockets of those with high incomes for a specific step change in the economic infrastructure. The fact that those with high incomes tend to have high wealth could be used to describe any progressive income tax as a wealth tax, and this is not what South Africa is trying to achieve. The new government is clearly determined to develop an economy where both rich and poor prosper and this budget is an excellent first step. However, there is a major pitfall in the principle of increasing dividend distribution tax while simultaneously reducing corporation tax. This will encourage corporate managements to retain surplus earnings rather than distribute them to shareholders. There is mounting criticism of the interlinked and takeover-proof nature of South Africa's major corporations which therefore have no true accountability to their owners as they would in Britain and the US. This has already led to a tendency for reinvestment of shareholders' funds in self-aggrandising projects with low marginal return on capital, and there is danger that the increased dividend tax will be seen as government support for this tendency. Any such criticism could be rapidly nailed by trade and industry minister Trevor Manuel's forthcoming review of investment policy. A more deregulated capital market, with open competition for corporate control as exists elsewhere, would enhance the return on capital of existing assets and encourage inward foreign investment, which is currently restricted to froth on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Major corporations are only going to come to South Africa with serious capital if they perceive a proper market for corporate control.

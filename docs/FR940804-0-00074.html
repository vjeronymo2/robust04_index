			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA has revised &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) in several ways. First, EPA has removed the offset sanction table from the rule and decided to provide the public information on areas that will be potentially subject to sanctions in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice. As EPA makes clear elsewhere in this paragraph and the rule, the sanctions automatically apply in the timeframes prescribed under &sect;52.31(d), unless EPA determines that the State has corrected the relevant SIP deficiency forming the basis of the finding. The EPA never intended the inclusion of areas in a table in this rule to be necessary for sanctions to apply automatically. The EPA does believe that it must provide the public with as accurate information as possible on areas that may face sanctions and has elected to do so through notices in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  rather than through a table in the body of the rule. Substantively, there is no difference in the sense that areas will face sanctions in the timeframes prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) regardless of whether they are listed in a table in the rule or listed in a separate notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, EPA has added the clause ``in the timeframe prescribed under &sect;52.31(d) of this section on those affected areas subject under &sect;52.31(d) to the offset sanction of this section.'' As noted above, sanctions apply automatically regardless of whether there is a table in the rule listing the areas subject to sanctions. Thus, this change was made to make it clear that the sanctions apply within the time frames set forth in &sect;52.31(d). To further clarify this point, a second change to proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) was to delete ``following'' in the clause referencing the offset ratio for pollutants and their precursors. The reason for this change is because the table has been deleted and thus no areas will be listed. The first sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to require that the 2 to 1 offsets be achieved for the pollutant or pollutants and any precursors for which the finding is made. (For further discussion of this issue, see section II.B.2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has added a second sentence to &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i). This sentence is partially derived from &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) of the proposed rule. The purpose of moving this sentence was to alleviate redundancy in the proposed rule. The first sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) appeared to echo proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) by stating that offsets must be achieved for the pollutant(s) and its (their) precursors for which the finding was made. Therefore, EPA has not included the first sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) in the final rule and has moved the second sentence of proposed &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iv) to final &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i). The sentence now located as the second sentence of &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) continues to provide that if the underlying finding is not specific to one or more pollutants and their precursors, then the offset sanction shall apply to all pollutants and, as relevant, their precursors for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section 173 of the Act. (See section II.B.2. for further discussion of pollutant applicability of the offset sanction.) This provision, of course, would apply to any area (nonattainment, attainment, or unclassified) that is the subject of the finding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its entirety, then, &sect;52.31(e)(1)(i) now provides: (1) That the emission offset sanction applies within the time specified in &sect;52.31(d), even though the rule now contains no offset sanction table; (2) that the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be 2:1; and (3) that the offset ratio shall apply to the one or more pollutants and their precursors for which the &sect;52.31(c) finding was made or to all pollutants and their precursors (for which the area is subject to the new source requirement of section 173 of the Act) if the finding was not pollutant specific.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA has added new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(ii) to specifically address the issue of findings made with respect to ozone and its two precursors, VOC and NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . This was discussed generally in the preamble to the proposed rule at page 51276, footnote 18, although no specific language was included in the proposed rule. The Act establishes requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, some of which are specific for either VOC or NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . However, since the general assumption is that both precursors are critical to ozone formation, EPA believes that even though a finding may be specific as to one ozone precursor, the offset sanction should apply for both precursors. However, there are two exceptions to this general requirement, both of which are based on the Act. First, affected areas that are designated nonattainment for ozone but that are not classified as marginal, moderate, serious, severe or extreme, are not required to achieve offsets under section 173 for NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The second exception is for affected areas that have received a NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exemption from the NSR requirement pursuant to section 182(f). These two exceptions and the rationale for them are discussed in section II.B.2. above. A new &sect;52.31(e)(1)(iii) sets up a similar provision with respect to PM&hyph;10 precursors, which is also discussed in more detail in section II.B.2. above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

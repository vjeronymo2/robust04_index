			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Iraq moves on missiles IRAQ agreed yesterday to activate UN surveillance cameras at two missiles sites, thereby clearing the way for a resumption of talks that could lead to the lifting of an oil embargo, agencies report from the United Nations. Iraq's ambassador, Mr Nizar Hamdoon, said Iraq had told the UN Special Commission, in charge of dismantling Baghdad's dangerous weapons, that the cameras could be activated at any time. He said his government had 'agreed to activate the cameras as a sign of good will' and they could be turned on any time the special commission wanted. Mr Rolf Ekeus, commission chairman, had linked the activation of the cameras to continuing arms talks with Iraq.</p>

			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Letter: Tax solution to inequality Sir, Michael Prowse's article, 'No easy answers to job questions' (July 21), points out that the American solution to unemployment is dependent on rising inequality - a solution which is not favoured in Europe. This was juxtaposed with your leader on the environment ('Clarifying the green agenda'), which correctly points out that the cost of measures to limit damage to the environment has pushed environmental concerns down the political agenda. Surely the answer is easy. Tax the pollution caused by the excessive consumption of the affluent and subsidise those that are less affluent and less polluting.

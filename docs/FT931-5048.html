			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Domestic buyers wary ahead of Budget AFTER a further reduction in yields for long-dated gilts, bond specialists are starting to ask how long the good times will last. The indications are that during February - a bumper month for gilt prices - steady demand from overseas institutions, particularly in the US and Germany, have been a big stimulant for the market. But domestic investors are likely to be wary about any big gilt purchases before next week's Budget. They will also be looking for any surprise weakness in the monthly figures for producer price inflation due out tomorrow. General sentiment in the gilt market was boosted by expectations about an imminent cut in key German interest rates coupled with stronger sterling and a favourable UK inflation outlook. A surprise 24 basis-point cut in Germany's 14-day repurchase rate announced on Friday added weight to views that the Bundesbank's decision-making council will reduce its discount and Lombard interest rates at its next meeting on March 18. The June gilt future, which broke through 107 on Friday, is thought likely to continue its recent rise. At Friday's close, 15-year gilt yields were down about 25 basis points on the week to around 7.8 per cent in a continuation of the marked reduction in yields since late January. According to many specialists, gilt gains are likely to lag slightly behind the German and French markets, with the yield spread between 10-year gilts and bunds widening by just a few basis points over the next week or two. Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, says that the Treasury is likely to end the 1992-1993 financial year overfunded to the tune of about Pounds 4bn, due partly to a higher-than-expected surplus on the fiscal account in January. However, much attention will focus on the public sector borrowing requirement for February, due to be announced on Budget day, which some believe could be extremely high. Worries about the PSBR in 1993-1994 - thought likely to be at least Pounds 50bn, as opposed to the likely figure of roughly Pounds 35bn to Pounds 37bn for 1992-1993 - are likely to be a prominent feature of market operations over the next two months. During this period gilt yields at the long end could easily rise on account of fears that a large level of funding will pull down prices. Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the London office of the Japanese bank Yamaichi, is among the relative pessimists who think yields may not have much further to fall at the long end. 'I am concerned about the level of yields at this end of the curve,' Mr Richardson said. 'In the past three weeks there has been nothing to dent the market's view that inflation in the UK is under control. But further out we could see inflationary pressures starting to build up. The level of funding envisaged for 1993-1994 will not be a problem - as long as all the other factors are under control, of which inflation is one.' Many analysts believe that on Budget day, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce a new programme of gilt auctions which will ram home the implications of the large volume of funding around the corner. It could be that after this the appreciable rally in the gilt market, which was a prominent feature of 1992, will start to peter out.</p>

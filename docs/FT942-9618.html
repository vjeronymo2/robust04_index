			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Copper and coffee stir up a froth Froth and frenzy returned to the commodity markets yesterday as US investment funds piled in with more buying orders. Their efforts helped boost copper's price on the London Metal Exchange to its highest level for 14 months, nickel was at a 15-month peak and aluminium reached a 22-month high. At the same time, coffee prices soared to a fresh five-year peak. The rush in the metal markets started after the LME reported its copper stocks had dropped, by 21,700 tonnes to 424,700 tonnes, the lowest for a year and 31 per cent below the 16-year peak in February. Copper for delivery in three months jumped another Dollars 60.50 a tonne by the close yesterday to Dollars 2,179 to end the week Dollars 151.50 ahead. The red metal also moved into backwardation, when a premium is charged for immediate delivery. On the New York Commodity Exchange by midday copper had burst through the psychologically-important Dollars 1 a lb (Dollars 2,204 a tonne) level to Dollars 1.40. Mr Viktor Bielski, analyst at Bain &amp; Co, part of the Deutsche Bank Group, suggested the copper price rise was to some extent supported by market fundamentals. Demand was high in the US, recovering in Europe and doing well in Asia. LME stocks were probably down to a level where all freely-available metal had gone. In recent years, banks and other financial institutions have made a modest profit by buying LME stock and negotiating with warehouses special, low, rents for storing it for up to three years. Mr Bielski suggested a great deal of the remaining copper in LME warehouses was tied up by this type of deal. He also suggested that copper might go to Dollars 1.05 a lb (Dollars 2,314 a tonne) in the present rally but 'Dollars 1.10 would unlock the metal held under financing agreements.' The investment funds' computer-driven operations also put nickel in their sites yesterday, sending the price through various chart resistance points and driving the LME three-month price up by Dollars 432.50 a tonne to Dollars 6,367.50, up Dollars 590 a tonne or nearly 10 per cent over the week. The funds also brought aluminium to the party for the first time in this rally. Three-month aluminium closed at Dollars 1,353 a tonne, up Dollars 24.50. Aluminium was ahead only by Dollars 20.50 a tonne over the week. The sky appeared to be the limit for the coffee market this week. The London market has been spurred by strong New York buying where the price for arabica coffee futures broke through 100 cents a lb. The International Coffee Organisation composite coffee price reached 104 cents per lb which led the members of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries to say they could begin to release 4m bags held as part of their retention scheme. Brazil sanctioned on Thursday the sale of some of its stocks held as part of the scheme. But even so, supplies are likely to remain tight. Coffee stayed on the boil yesterday. Traders said there was little fresh news but there was heavy fund buying. New York again set the tone, helping to push the July futures price on the London Commodity Exchange up another Dollars 100 a tonne to Dollars 1,990. Second-month prices subsided later as traders took profits and settled back to Dollars 1,956, up Dollars 66. Cocoa futures rose this week in the wake of coffee, but traders said the rise was driven mostly by speculative activity. Yesterday, buying dried up once July peaked at Pounds 972 a tonne. Prices tumbled later to close unchanged at Pounds 955.  -------------------------------------------             LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS           (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------------- tonnes  ------------------------------------------- Aluminium         +19,800   to  2,646,657 Aluminium Alloy      -860   to     36,940 Copper            +21,700   to    424,700 Lead               +2,600   to    345,725 Nickel               -420   to    132,516 Zinc               +2,357   to  1,157,332 Tin                   +65   to     27,905  -------------------------------------------</p>

During an interview that lasted more than an hour with Cuban  Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, Kellenberger said he was also  interested in learning about the dispute between the United  States and Cuba. He expressed his government's sympathy with  the complex situation the Latin American country is experiencing.    The Cuban foreign minister, who made a technical stop in  Bern  before beginning his tour of five African nations, told PRENSA  LATINA that, although informal, his stay had been very important  and fruitful for the development of future bilateral ties.    Besides his meeting with Kellenberger, who is also the  political director of the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs,  the Caribbean minister met with Heinrich Reimann, the ambassador  and chief of the Department of African, Middle East, Asian, and  Latin American Affairs at the Swiss Foreign Ministry.    He visited the parliament of the Swiss Confederation, where  he was briefed on that body's organization.    Local authorities expressed their willingness to hold talks.  In response, Robaina invited the secretary of state to visit  Havana.    Switzerland and Cuba are working on a bilateral agreement to  promote and protect investments, similar to those Cuba has  signed with other European countries.    The Cuban foreign minister saw Nicolas Imboden, the  ambassador of the Federal Department of Public Economy [name and  title as received], before concluding his brief stay in this  capital. Imboden, who is also in charge of commerce and  investment, expressed his interest in some sort of trade  exchange with Cuba.    Robaina gave interviews to BERNER ZEITUNG, the leading  newspaper here, and Radio Switzerland International.    The Cuban minister will arrive in Ghana on Sunday, on the  first leg of a venture through Africa that will take him to the  People's Republic of Angola, then on to Zimbabwe, Zambia, and  finally Namibia.</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television How do we dare treat young doctors as we do, expecting them to take life and death decisions while working 80 hours a week? Most of us must surely come into contact with hospitals from time to time, and thus know what is going on, in a way that is not merely theoretical. Yet nothing changes. The last episode in BBC2's remarkable documentary series Doctors To Be (7.50) shows how disillusion and bitterness have replaced excitement and idealism in the eight years since the 10 young doctors began their training. Also coming to an end tonight is 'Allo 'Allo, that extraordinary repository of English prejudices. Italians are amorous cowards, Germans are ludicrous prigs, the French can speak English only with the most absurd accent, and the English as represented by the officer class are brainless. Repeats will run for the rest of our lives (8.00 BBC1). Witchcraft (9.00 BBC2) described as a period thriller, is yet another modern fiction straddling the centuries. Witches, witchfinders, and adultery are the chief ingredients, and the stars, in a Cotswold setting, are Peter McEnery, Lisa Harrow and Alan Howard.</p>

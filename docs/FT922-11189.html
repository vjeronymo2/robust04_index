			<p>920427 FT  27 APR 92 / Flood pumps up fears of urban disintegration: The state of America's infrastructure When a quarter of a billion gallons flooded out of a damaged tunnel into the basements of downtown Chicago recently - shutting down offices, department stores and futures exchanges alike - many city managers held their breath. Was this the latest, most devastating manifestation of the fissures opening in America's ageing urban infrastructure - after the collapse of the Mianus River Bridge on the Connecticut Turnpike that killed three motorists; after the cracking concrete that forced the city of New York to shut down its Williamsburg bridge in 1988; after the rupture of a 36-inch water main that flooded four blocks of central Washington earlier this year? For those who have long complained of the dwindling flow of federal money for urban investment projects, the Chicago flood seemed an omen of potential disasters in store for other cities, even though the particular circumstances of the accident had little direct relevance to other cities. 'My judgment is that you can find in almost every major American city that this (infrastructure) is close to crisis,' says Dr Robert Wood, a professor at Wesleyan University and former secretary of housing and urban development under President Lyndon Johnson. But advocates of increased public investment have been crying wolf for a long time now, and warnings tend to fall on deaf ears. Total public spending on infrastructure in the US has declined steadily as a proportion of gross national product, from 3.6 per cent in 1960 to 2.6 per cent in the mid-1980s, according to statistics compiled by Apogee Research, a Maryland organisation that specialises in the sector. The effects of this decline in spending appear to show up in reviews of the physical condition of existing infrastructure. The US government says 22.6 per cent of the nation's 576,508 bridges have structural deficiencies, and in New York state the proportion rises to is 61 per cent. Sewers built 80 or 100 years ago in east-coast and midwestern cities are near or past the end of their normal life, while lead waterpipes need replacement. Population growth has brought many roads to saturation point, and heavier-than-expected traffic has shortened the life expectancy of the road paving. Looked at another way, however, the picture is less depressing. Over the same 25-year span in which infrastructure spending has fallen in relation to GNP, according to Apogee, annual infrastructure spending has increased by more than 50 per cent in constant dollars, and has kept pace with population growth, remaining remarkably steady at about Dollars 400 a head. Mr Richard Mudge, Apogee's president, warns that engineering-based assessments of the need for infrastructure investment, such as surveys of structurally deficient bridges, can be misleading. 'It used to be in the early 1980s that everybody who wanted to invest in infrastructure did needs studies - they went out and counted potholes. But that misses the original motivation for infrastructure investment, which they recognised in the 19th century, which was that it is a vehicle for growth,' he says. 'Assessing physical condition is important, but you must then step back and see whether you need that road or that bridge.' Mr Joseph Casazza, who has been public works commissioner for Boston since 1968, says he believes his city is doing reasonably well in keeping its capital stock in shape. 'There's no question I have concerns, there's no question the city is old, but I don't perceive a public safety problem where we are going to have to close a bridge or something,' he says. Boston's bridges, however, are Mr Casazza's biggest worry. 'A lot of them are 85 years old, a lot have come to the time when they should be replaced,' he says. One bridge, built in the days when the vessels passing underneath were 60 feet wide, spans a 100-foot channel. Today, new vessels with double hulls to guard against environmental disasters are 95 feet wide, and can barely squeeze through. Like other forms of public spending, however, investment in infrastructure is suffering from a tight fiscal squeeze. The federal government, with an expected deficit of Dollars 400bn this year, has cut back on its grants to states. The states themselves have almost all faced their own fiscal crises in the last two years, and are passing on to their cities a smaller portion of the money they receive from the federal government. 'In the last couple of years, states have done a lot of temporary budget cuts. There is now a realisation that we have a fairly long-run structural fiscal problem,' says Mr Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association. This fiscal strait-jacket is unlikely to be loosened in the near or medium term. City managers know that they will have to continue to survive on limited budgets. As Boston's Mr Cassaza says: 'When it's a public safety issue, you don't have meetings and write memos, you just go out and fix it, and somehow you find the money.'</p>

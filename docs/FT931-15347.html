			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Rover faces EC fine over discounts ROVER may be fined by the European Commission for restricting the discounts some of its dealers could offer customers in 1989 and 1990. The British car maker has offered to pay compensation. The restriction breaches EC competition policy and could lead to prosecution under Article 85 of the Treaty of Rome. However, the Commission said yesterday no formal charges had yet been brought against Rover over the discount restrictions. It therefore dismissed suggestions that Rover could be facing a fine of Pounds 2.5m and a bill for compensation of up to Pounds 65m. The British Aerospace subsidiary is already involved in another dispute with the Commission, which wants repayment of Pounds 44.4m government aid granted to BAe when it bought Rover in 1988. Rover Group refused to comment on the discounts issue yesterday. But it does not dispute that the restrictions occurred. It has offered compensation of Pounds 500,000 but this so far has proved unacceptable to the Commission. Rover's case is that the restrictions were imposed between late 1989 and early 1990 by several UK regional offices which were unaware they breached EC rules; that they were imposed without the knowledge of Rover's board; that they affected relatively few transactions; and that they were stopped as soon as the board became aware of them. The Commission acknowl-edges that Rover itself brought the matter to Brussels' attention in 1990. Whether the Commission does decide to institute proceedings is expected to depend on the outcome of discussions over compensation. The Commission cannot compel Rover to pay compensation, but an offer from the car company which it regarded as inadequate could have a strong bearing on the size of any fine it might impose. Any decision on proceedings will be in the hands of Mr Karel Van Miert, Sir Leon Brittan's successor as competition commissioner. Mr Van Miert will also decide when and if there is to be further EC action to make BAe repay the Pounds 44.4m government 'sweeteners' for BAe to take over Rover in 1988.</p>

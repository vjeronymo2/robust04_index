"We have created a system of  multi-stage political consultations on problems of the European  and world politics," Kozyrev said, adding that he was grateful  to Ireland for its assistance in finalizing an agreement on  full- scale cooperation with the European Union.    Both Russian and Irish foreign ministers unanimously  approved  the level reached in the relations between the two countries,  describing it as a very good and even excellent level and  expressed confidence that bilateral relations would successfully  develop.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Thou shalt not cook the books God, of course, can see through the tricks of creative accountancy. But many of his servants on earth cannot and have resolved to do something about it. The effects of woodworm nibbling the pews and the depreciation of collapsing spires may be shown in the accounts of English cathedrals for the first time following the creation of a new working party. The Association of English Cathedrals has set up a group to report next year on how to present financial information regarding the 42 Anglican cathedrals in England fairly and consistently. This follows an analysis of their accounts which showed that there are as many divergent and incomparable practices as there are cathedrals. Mr Peter Burnham of accountancy firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, chairman of the working party, said the matters to be considered included the valuation and depreciation of cathedrals and related property, and the treatment of legacies and donations. One senior member of the Archbishop's Commission on Cathedrals, which was set up in 1992 to consider matters including management, said yesterday: 'Cathedral accounting is disgraceful. It's a fascinating aspect of medieval life. They get up to every trick in the books.' He said the most scandalous practice was the use of 'off-balance sheet finance' and 'concealment by canons' to hide in undeclared trusts the true wealth of cathedrals from the attention of the church hierarchy. The Cathedrals Measure of 1963 required accounts to be audited and published. But it provided no guide-lines, and the Church commissioners do not examine the accounts in any detail. Equally important, medieval law dictates that the dean and canons of a cathedral, once appointed, form a 'corporation spiritual' immune even from the power of visiting bishops. Mr Burnham said: 'They are accountable only to God.' Mr Malcolm Hoskins of Touche Ross, a member of the working party who has audited a cathedral in the past, said, perhaps rather inappropriately: 'Cathedrals are ancient buildings that need a hell of a lot of work (for their upkeep). 'Like any other charity, if anything the incentive is not to appear too financially healthy.'</p>

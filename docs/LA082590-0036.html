			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEL MAR;  </P> <P> AARON GRYDER MAKES TRIP 'HOME' TO RIDE NO MARKER IN CABRILLO 'CAP  </P> <P> Aaron Gryder spent a good part of Friday in the air. So, what else is new?  </P> <P> The jockey, who recently turned 20, has been a travelin' man in 1990.  </P> <P> When Gryder climbs aboard No Marker in today's $326,300 Cabrillo Handicap, it  will mean he has ridden in 10 states this year -- California being added to New  Jersey, New York, Illinois, Washington, Kentucky, Nebraska, Minnesota, Michigan  and Kansas.  </P> <P> No doubt, this will be the most welcome stop on Gryder's itinerary. The West  Covina-born rider's family will be present this afternoon, and his professional  memories of Del Mar are quite pleasant.  </P> <P> The meeting's leading apprentice in 1987, a few months before he led everybody  at Hollywood Park's fall season, Gryder has developed into a solid journeyman.  </P> <P> His numerous excursions have produced several stakes victories, and he was the  leading rider at Churchill Downs in Louisville during its recent meeting, which  ended July 2. Currently based at Arlington, near Chicago, he has 15 victories  there after starting late and being away much of the time.  </P> <P> Although he's enjoying himself, Gryder is looking forward to the day when he  comes to Southern California for good.  </P> <P> "There's no place like home," he said. "I'd like to come back, but I'm not sure  when. It might be in a couple of years or when I think the time is right. I  feel like I want to prove to myself, that I can go all over and be successful.  It's not easy going in unknown. Fortunately, things have gone very well, and  people have accepted me wherever I've gone.  </P> <P> "Leading the meeting at Churchill Downs helped make people notice me.  Arlington's the first meeting I've repeated, and it's nice to see that the  people who gave me mounts last year are anxious for me to ride for them again  this year. I'm happy. When you're winning, that helps you to be happy."  </P> <P> No Marker has long been a favorite of Gryder's. The 6-year-old roan son of Grey  Dawn II provided the then 17-year-old jockey with his first stakes victory in  the 1987 Tell Handicap at Oak Tree.  </P> <P> More recently, No Marker won the Stephen Foster Handicap at Churchill Downs on  June 23, then, three weeks later, took the Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at  Longacres, near Seattle.  </P> <P> Two weeks ago, the Patricia Johnson-trained horse was a distant second to  Dispersal in the Canterbury Cup in Minnesota. Now, continuing his tour of the  United States, No Marker will meet a Cabrillo field lacking in quality.  </P> <P> With Criminal Type, Lively One and Quiet American all missing for various  reasons, the starting co-highweights at 116 pounds are No Marker and Notorious  Pleasure, who is probably a better horse on the turf.  </P> <P> So, this could be a good spot for Gryder to have a profitable homecoming. But  his horse ran poorly on this track last year, finishing last in an allowance  race on Sept. 1 after being fifth of seven entered in a sprint almost a month  earlier.  </P> <P> "I was really excited when Patty (Johnson) called me and asked me to come out,"  Gryder said. "I haven't seen my family since Christmas, and I'll stay for a  couple of days before I go back to Arlington Park.  </P> <P> "I've won five races on No Marker. He's a better horse now than he was in 1987  when I won my first stakes on him. You have to give a lot of credit to Patty  Johnson the way she's been able to keep him in top form.  </P> <P> "He fires every time. When he was second to Disperal (by six lengths), he ran  well. Dispersal was just a better horse that day."  </P> <P> After losing his apprentice allowance, Gryder held his own locally for a while,  but when the situation went sour, he decided to work in Northern California.  </P> <P> Looking back, Gryder thinks he might have been too hasty in his decision. "I  got too antsy and jumped the gun," he said. "I probably made my decision too  quickly. Maybe I was used to winning more, but I was still riding for  (trainers) like Charlie (Whittingham), Craig Lewis and Eddie Gregson, and when  you ride for people like that you know it's going to turn around."  </P> <P> After spending several months in the Bay Area, Gryder hooked up with agent  Harry Hacek and they made their way to the Midwest, but both stay on top of  what's happening in California. "I'm still keeping in touch with everybody and  I still have some clients," Gryder said.  </P> <P> Besides No Marker and Notorious Pleasure, eight other older horses were entered  in the Cabrillo, at 1 1/8 miles on the main track.  </P> <P> The other scheduled starters are Charlatan III, who won the Orange County  Handicap at Los Alamitos a week ago; Double Quick, fourth in the same race  after battling on the pace; Royal Reach, who has six career victories, five on  the turf; Silver Circus; Rogue's Realm; Lowell; Miserden, and Bosphorus.  </P> <P> This field would have seemed to be easy pickings for Quiet American, who upset  Bayakoa in the San Diego Handicap three weeks ago. However, trainer Gary Jones  decided to wait for Belmont's Woodward Stakes and a match with Criminal Type.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Fifteen 3-year-old fillies were entered Friday in Sunday's $167,900 Del Mar  Oaks. Included in the field for the 1 1/8-mile grass race are Nijinsky's Lover,  Orlanova, Slew of Pearls, and foreigners Adorable Emilie, Native Twine and As  If. . . . Del Mar will simulcast the $250,000 Longacres Mile Sunday. The stake  will be shown between the sixth and seventh races locally. Among the  participants are Annual Date, who will be ridden by Gary Stevens; Abergwaun  Lad, with Robbie Davis; and T.V. Screen, with Vann Belvoir. . . . Gorgeous, who  has been idle since winning the Bayakoa-less Vanity Handicap at Hollywood Park,  will make her next start in Belmont's Ruffian Handicap on Sept. 22.  </P></p>

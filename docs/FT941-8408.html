			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Finance and The Family: A sector in need of facts - John Cuthbert continues his analysis of UK growth unit trusts and argues that more data is needed The UK growth unit trust sector contains very different types of funds. Despite appearing under the classification 'growth,' for example, there are funds distinguished better by their specialisation and unique risk/return signatures than by a growth approach to investment. Last week, I divided the sector into specialist funds - such as recovery and special situations funds which pursue growth with a twist - and non-specialist funds. I argued that specialist funds were not really growth funds at all. The second class of funds in the sector, the non-specialists, can, by contrast, be described as growth funds. The problem here is that the notion of growth has two meanings. On the one hand, it refers to the fund's aim: the growth of capital. And, indeed, all these funds pursue this aim. On the other, however, growth also describes a distinct investment approach: the purchase of stocks with earnings growth rates higher than the market average. This is an exacting standard for which, sadly, few funds qualify. The question here is: which notion of growth is the more valuable guide? The answer depends largely on exactly what you think sector classification is for. My view is that sector labels are a way for investors and advisers to compare relative performance. Only funds with the same characteristics (these help to explain the way their price behaves) and orientation (something which comes through in the risk/return profile) should be lumped together - in which case, the specialist class of funds should be split into three new sectors: aggressive growth, cautious growth and growth. Aggressive growth funds would be those which pursue a true 'growth' investment approach - stocks with high rates of earnings growth. Cautious funds would include the six (Axa E&amp;L British Excellence, Gartmore British, Henderson Best of British, Invesco Ruperts Children's, Mercury British Blue Chip and TSB British Growth) which retain a virtually constant exposure to the 100 biggest (FT-SE 100) stocks, as well as a further group which retain a core bias towards FT-SE stocks. The new Growth sector would contain a group of more independent funds which trawl the whole market for the best buys. Reclassification alone, however, will not do. Many funds, aggressive and growth alike, often pay over the odds for growth stocks. Likewise, many cautious funds often conduct extra growth sorties into the ranks of medium-sized and smaller companies. Both factors can change a fund's risk and character considerably. So, we also need some way in which these characteristics also can be made apparent. My recommendation is that Autif, the investment fund trade body, should insist that all unit trusts (and not just growth funds) disclose five things: average price/earnings ratio, average price/book ratio, five-year earnings growth rate, their size relative to the FT-A All-Share index, and fund composition by stock size (small, medium and large). If this is done, many of the problems that arise from attempting to second-guess the true character of benighted funds would have a solution. A fund which displayed a high p/e relative to the market, for example, would raise the suspicion that the manager had paid over the odds. If a cautious fund, which should have market average earnings growth, suddenly produces earnings growth well above this, this boost might suggest that it has become less cautious. Recent history points also to the value of such information for portfolio planning. The most successful UK equity strategy over the past four years would have been holding FT-SE stocks with high earnings growth in the two years up to Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in 1992 - and then shifting into undervalued medium and small-sized companies immediately thereafter. But without disclosing more information, this type of portfolio planning - essential to beat the market - will remain whimsy. Whatever Autif decides, we should stick to risk-adjustment of total returns as the performance standard. Risk-adjustment provides us with a way of assessing if the causes of a fund's performance include managerial ability or if they are just the exclusive product of risk. This works by applying a minimal standard for performance. It requires that the total returns of active managers beat a passive measure (that is, one where no managerial decisions are involved), such as the FT-SE A All-Share. But because managers could beat the All-Share simply by increasing risk, they should demonstrate also that they can better the All-Share on a risk-adjusted basis. Of the 74 non-specialist growth funds with five-year histories that I surveyed, only eight make the grade - that is, their performances are of a sufficient size to suggest that something more than mere risk has been at work. Of these eight, none has achieved this through a strict growth strategy. The majority blend their selections into a mix of stocks with higher-than-average earnings growth rates and stocks which are undervalued. The non-specialist class, however, is dominated by three funds - Pembroke, Gartmore British and AIB Grofund - the consistency of which, relative to the All-Share, indicates clearly that superior managerial ability is at work. Surprisingly, there is very little to chose between these funds in terms of risk, so the differences in the risk/return scores are due mainly to total returns. Whether the performance of these funds continues in the same way depends on their present average p/e and earnings growth rates. Without this information, the future of these funds is a matter of conjecture. It is time, I think, to recognise that a sector of this size, and the Pounds 12bn of investors' money sunk into it, should be both reclassified and strengthened by the disclosure of further information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- Years are December 31st to December 31st. NB The five year total is based upon monthly percentage changes so does not sum to the five year-on-year totals. The Benchmark column shows the arithmetic difference between the fund's return and the index's return. The BM or benchmark ratio expresses the percentage non-cumulative total return outperformance over the FT-All Share by the fund over the five years. Risk is total risk or volatility. Total risk is measured by the standard deviation of monthly returns over five years to Dec 31, 1993. Risk relative to sector is each fund's standard deviation divided by the sector's average standard deviation of 4.74. Risk/return is the division of the five year average monthly total return by the five year standard deviation of monthly returns. The five year risk/return figure for the All-Share Index is 0.29. Return data, offer-to-offer, net income reinvested to December 31 1993.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: HSW.

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / People: European representation expands on board of media group Aegis Aegis group, the pan-European media planning and buying specialist, has appointed Kai Hiemstra, 55, right, as an executive director on the group's main board. The move has a special flavour to it: 'We could count on the fingers of one hand the numbers of German nationals who are non-executives on the board of British companies. To appoint a full executive director like this is quite unusual,' says the German-British chamber of commerce in London. An experienced advertising figure, Hiemstra is founder and chairman of HMS Media Service, based in Wiesbaden, Germany. HMS has grown into Germany's largest media buying and planning specialist, with a 12 per cent market share. While there is a sprinkling of Germans on various boards in the City, the ranks thin somewhat outside the financial world. Among the better-known are Gertrud Hohler, founder of an eponymous firm of management consultants in Germany, who has been a Grand Metropolitan non-executive director since 1992. The year before, Ellen Schneider-Lenne, of Deutsche bank, joined ICI, in the same role. John von Spreckelsen, chief executive of Budgens since May 1991, is German-born. Martin Kohlhaussen was a non-executive at Tiphook until March this year, and the former Volkswagen boss, Carl Hahn, is a non-executive with BP. Most famous perhaps is Dieter Bock, joint chief executive at Lonrho. Hiemstra's elevation bolsters the group's European outlook; the board now has representatives from the US, France, Switzerland, the UK and now Germany. 'It's a genuinely European board,' says Aegis, 'where all group business is conducted in English.' Aegis acquired 50 per cent of HMS in 1988, the remaining half in 1993, when the billings of HMS represented 30 per cent of the total for the Aegis group.</p>

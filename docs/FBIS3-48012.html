			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  answered a question put by KCNA today regarding the on-going  negotiations between the DPRK and the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA] in Vienna.    Negotiations on the continuity of safeguards are now going  on  between an official of the DPRK Embassy in Austria and an  official of the Secretariat of the IAEA.    The negotiations were arranged according to an agreement  between the DPRK and the United States.    As already reported, at the DPRK-U.S. contact held in New  York toward the end of last year, the U.S. side officially  manifested its will to suspend the Team Spirit joint military  maneuvers, a test nuclear war, as part of the measures for  removing nuclear threat to the DPRK, and we decided to accept  inspection for the continuity of safeguards in conformity with  our special position after the temporary suspension of the  effectuation of our withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty  [NPT].    What we decided to allow is not routine or ad hoc inspection  pursuant to the obligation under the NPT, but inspection merely  for the continuity of safeguards conforming to our special  position.    We proposed a scope of inspection enough to guarantee the  continuity of safeguards at the current negotiations with the  IAEA.    The IAEA should show an affirmative response to defining the  scope of inspection commensurate with the guarantee of the  continuity of safeguards at the negotiations, as agreed between  the DPRK and the USA.    As we have already declared, the issue of routine and ad hoc  inspection under the safeguards agreement shall be resolved  smoothly, if the third round of the DPRK-USA talks are held and  an agreement is reached on the package solution.    Therefore, there will be no ground for the IAEA Secretariat  to refuse to respond to our reasonable proposal, if it is  interested in the solution of the nuclear issue and the  guarantee of the continuity of safeguards on the Korean  peninsula.    We make it clear that, if the continuity of the safeguards  fails to be guaranteed due to the absurd assertion of the IAEA  Secretariat, we cannot be held responsible for it and the  responsibility lies with the opposite side which complicated the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.</p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Neepsend ahead First quarter results of Neepsend, the Sheffield-based tool, metal processing and DIY products group, were ahead of budget and significantly up on last year at this time, Mr Peter Barker, chairman, told the annual meeting. Every effort was being made to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the disposal of surplus property assets, he said. 'Success in this area would serve to improve profitability and bring our gearing down to a more appropriate level.' Mr Barker said trading in all areas was still tough, but the company was budgeting for a profitable year.</p>

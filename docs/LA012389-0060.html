			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 49ERS GET TAYLOR-MADE FINISH;  </P> <P> CROSS GETS BAILED OUT IN FINAL GAME;  </P> <P> 49ER CENTER MAKES SOME MISTAKES, BUT GOES OUT A WINNER  </P> <P> Randy Cross' name won't pop to mind when the 1989 Super Bowl is recalled years  from now, and that's just fine with Randy Cross.  </P> <P> "I made some mistakes today," the San Francisco 49ers' 13-year-old center said  after the 20-16 victory over Cincinnati on Sunday. "But I went from goat to  glory, so I'll be nothing but a little footnote to this game."  </P> <P> Cross, who announced this week that this Super Bowl, his third, would mark the  end of his playing career, made three mistakes that almost helped swing the  decision to the Bengals.  </P> <P> Two minutes into the second quarter, his snap was to the right of holder Barry  Helton and foiled a 19-yard field goal try by Mike Cofer that would given the  49ers a 6-0 lead.  </P> <P> Two San Francisco possessions later, on a first down play from the 49ers' 21,  Cross was called for a 10-yard holding penalty that put the team in a hole. The  49ers were forced to punt from their 12-yard line, and 6 plays later the  Bengals tied the game, 3-3, on a 34-yard field goal by Jim Breech.  </P> <P> With 1:22 left in the game, his 10-yard penalty for being an ineligible  receiver forced the 49ers into a third-and-20 situation at the Cincinnati 45. A  27-yard pass play from Joe Montana to Jerry Rice and Montana's 10-yard  touchdown pass to John Taylor bailed out Cross.  </P> <P> "I'm going out literally on top, No. 1, and getting to go on and lead my life,"  Cross said. "I can't thank those other 46 guys enough."  </P> <P> Cross said he never got down on himself, even after several plays went against  him.  </P> <P> "I'm very much an optimist, so I was walking up and down the sideline grabbing  anybody I could and telling them, 'You've got to believe we're going to do it,'  " he said. "You've got to believe it.' "  </P> <P> He was effusive in his praise of Montana, who at age 32 becomes the oldest  49er.  </P> <P> "There's nobody in history that you'd want to have as quarterback in a drive  like that other than Joe Montana," Cross said. "Those who might've thought he  had a peer might have to reconsider now. He's the biggest winner I've ever been  associated with."  </P> <P> It was the confidence exuded by Montana, Cross and some other veterans that  several players cited as critical during the winning rally.  </P> <P> "From the very first 10-yard penalty, I made a comment to (guard) Guy McIntyre,  'Why not do it the hard way?' " Cross said. "By those last 3 or 4 plays, we  were just positive we were going to find a way to get in the end zone."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The National Assembly has passed a bill  approving Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok's appointment. The  appointment was passed with 170 of 180 ruling-party votes in  favor. The following is a report by Ko Tae-hyon from the  National Assembly:    [Begin Ko recording] Yi Yong-tok's appointment as prime  minister was approved at 1850 [0950 GMT] by the National  Assembly session attended only by lawmakers of the Democratic  Liberal Party [DLP]. The appointment was passed with 170 of 180  DLP votes in favor. The National Assembly session adjourned  immediately after the prime minister's appointment was approved.  Therefore, the 167th ad hoc National Assembly session was also  automatically closed. [passage omitted]    The session began at 1833 with only the DLP lawmakers  present. After the session began, Speaker Yi Man-sop said that  he could not let the government administration vacuum continue  and that, in his neutral position, his conscience forced him to  proceed with the voting on the bill on approving the appointment  of the prime minister. Speaker Yi then announced that the  voting began.    At that time, some opposition party lawmakers who were in  the  assembly hall yelled at Speaker Yi asking for permission to ask  questions but the voting continued. [passage omitted]    The session was scheduled to begin at 1400 today but the  ruling and opposition parties agreed to postpone the session  four times to seek a compromise regarding the appointment of the  prime minister and the National Assembly's [Sangmudae]  investigation.    Speaker Yi Man-sop notified the Democratic Party at 1730  that  if the Democratic Party did not let him know whether to accept  the speaker's mediation proposal by 1800, he would unilaterally  begin the session in virtue of his rights as the speaker.    The session was delayed for another 20 minutes because the  Democratic Party asked for more time but it did not respond to  Speaker Yi's mediation proposal. Speaker Yi entered the hall and  announced the beginning of the session at 1820. [end recording]  [passage omitted]</p>

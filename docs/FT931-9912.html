			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / 1,600 Daf job losses 'imminent' ABOUT 1,600 jobs are expected to be cut at Leyland Daf, the UK subsidiary of the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch commercial vehicle maker, in a first round of redundancies that will probably be announced tomorrow. The UK workforce of Leyland Daf, which collapsed into administrative receivership last week, totals about 5,500 with 2,200 in Leyland, Lancashire, and 2,000 in Birmingham. Union leaders who held talks with the receivers yesterday said last night that they believed the first redundancies at the company's plants were 'imminent'. The receivers warned earlier this week that job losses were 'inevitable'. Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop, the joint administrative receivers, warned yesterday that the refusal by a small number of component makers to resume supplies to the UK Leyland Daf plants were jeopardising the resumption of production. 'A handful are still refusing to supply,' said Mr McKillop. that was even though all suppliers appointed since the company went into receivership would be 'paid in full as an expense of the receivership'. The failure of Leyland Daf had been 'an extremely serious problem' for many suppliers, admitted Mr Talbot. However, he called on suppliers 'to think very carefully about the consequences of their actions'. He added: 'It is very important that production at the Leyland Daf plants is maintained and the company's manufacturing is stabilised'.

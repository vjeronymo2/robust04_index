Police said 200 peasants  who organized into a village defense group because of their fear of reprisal by  the Maoist-inspired insurgents ambushed 20 of them near Cochas, a town 30 miles  northeast of Huancayo. After capturing the better-armed but outnumbered rebels,  the peasants decapitated the nine.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) This Act provides that benefits paid under this Act are exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States, including that under a Federal tort liability statute (5 U.S.C. 8116(c)). It extends to derivative claims, subsequent malpractice for treatment of a covered injury, injuries for which there is no scheduled compensation, and employee harassment claims for which other remedies are available (42 U.S.C. 2000e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Is from a federal civilian employee based on a allegation of a violation of some employment right or is otherwise one for which the rules governing federal civilian employment provide a comprehensive remedy. Such claims often allege emotional distress or psychological injury as a result of the alleged misconduct. Administrative remedies under the civil service regulations are the employee's exclusive remedy. Bush v. Lucas 462 U.S. 367 (1983). This exception does not bar third party indemnity claims. When there is doubt as to whether or not this exception applies, the claim should be forwarded through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS, for an opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (t) Is for the personal injury or death of an employee including nonappropriated fund employees, for whom benefits are provided by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (33 U.S.C. 901&hyph;950). An employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality is covered by the Act (5 U.S.C. 8171). This is exclusive for covered employees, similar to that under the FECA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (u) Is for the personal injury or death of any employee for whom benefits are provided under any workmen's compensation law if the premiums of the workmen's compensation insurance are retrospectively rated and charged as an allowable, allocable expense to a cost-type contract. (See &sect;536.28 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;25.) If, in the opinion of an approval or settlement authority the claim should be considered payable (for example, the injuries did not result from a normal risk of employment or adequate compensation is not payable under workmen's compensation laws), the file will be forwarded with recommendations through claims channels to the Commander, USARCS who may authorize payment of an appropriate award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Is for taking of property as by technical trespass or overflight of aircraft and of a type contemplated by the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, or otherwise constitutes attacking. (See paragraph 2c of AR 405&hyph;15 and DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraphs 8&hyph;46, 8&hyph;74, and 8&hyph;75.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides in part ``*&blank;*&blank;* nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Claims for takings without just compensation are actionable under the Tucker Act (28 U.S.C. 1346(a)(2) and 1491, Appendix A., 24 Stat. 505 (1887)). Prior to referring a claimant to a Tucker Act remedy, the applicability of the procedures under AR 405&hyph;15 should be considered by referral to appropriate Corps of Engineers authorities. (See DA Pam 27&hyph;162, paragraph 8&hyph;75.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (w) Is for damage from or by flood or flood waters at any place (33 U.S.C. 702c). This exception is broadly construed and includes multipurpose projects and all phases of construction and operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (x) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury occurring directly or indirectly as a result of the exercise of performance of, or failure to exercise or perform, any function or duty by any Federal agency or employee of the Government to carry out the provisions of the Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950 during the existence of a civil defense emergency (50 U.S.C. Appendix 2291&hyph;2297).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (y) Is based solely upon a theory of absolute liability or liability without fault. Either a negligent or wrongful act is required by the FTCA, and some type of malfeasance or nonfeasance is required (Dalehite v. United States, 346 U.S. 15 (1953); Laird v. Nelms, 406 U.S. 797 (1972)). Thus, liability does not arise by virtue either of United States ownership of an inherently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dangerous commodity or of engaging in extra-hazardous activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (z) Is for patent or copyright infringement. (See AR 27&hyph;60.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (aa) Claims for damage to property of a State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia caused by ARNG personnel engaged in training or duty under 32 U.S.C. 316, 502, 503, 504, or 505 who are assigned to a unit maintained by that State, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia will not be paid without the express approval of the Commander, USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (bb) Is for damage to property or for any death or personal injury arising out of the activities of any Federal agency or employee of the Government in carrying out the provisions of the Federal Disaster Relief Act of 1954 (Public Law 93&hyph;288, Sec. 403, 88 Stat. 143). The Act requires the local beneficiary (State or local government) to hold the Government harmless and to assume the defense of all claims arising from the removal of debris and wreckage from public or private property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (cc) Arises from activities that present a nonjusticiable political question. The courts search for six factors, as follows, any one of which is grounds for dismissal:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A commitment of the issue to a coordinate branch of Government by the text of the Constitution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) A lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The impossibility of deciding without a policy determination calling for non-judicial discretion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The impossibility of undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of respect for coordinate branches of Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) An unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The potential for embarrassment from multiple pronouncements by various departments on one question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.76  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Claims under other laws and regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any claim that may be settled under any exclusive or specific authorization discussed in DA Pam 27&hyph;162, chapter 8, will be settled under such authority in preference to settlement under this chapter. Guidance concerning application of this policy will be obtained from USARCS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.77  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Procedures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

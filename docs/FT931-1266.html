			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: IBM shares fall on worries over pricing and succession SHARES in International Business Machines fell sharply in New York yesterday afternoon, apparently as a result of growing concern about pricing pressures on the computer-makers's mainframe business. IBM's stock closed Dollars 3 1/8 lower at Dollars 51 1/8 on heavy trading of more than 3.2m shares. IBM said its policy was not to comment on the stock's activity. Traders said investors also appeared disappointed by reports that Mr Louis Gerstner, chairman of RJR Nabisco, the US food and tobacco company, had emerged as a leading candidate for the top job at IBM amid rising speculation that IBM could shortly name a new chief executive officer. Mr Michael Metz, an analyst at Oppeneimer, said: 'My guess is there's a lot of scepticism on whether (Mr Gerstner) can do the job.' RJR Nabisco declined to comment on reports of Mr Gerstner's impending departure yesterday. IBM also declined to comment on reports that Mr Gerstner has had several meetings with IBM's selection committee of non-executive directors. The committee was formed in January when Mr John Akers, IBM chairman and chief executive, said he would step down as chief executive following IBM's announcement of Dollars 4.9bn losses for 1992, its second consecutive annual loss. Under US securities laws, IBM has to make an announcement as soon as it has made a final selection and reached contractual arrangements. The lack of such an announcement suggests no final decision has been made. Other potential candidates, including Mr John Sculley of Apple Computer, Mr Larry Bossidy of Allied-Signal and Mr George Fisher of Motorola, have issued statements saying they would not take the job. The selection of Mr Gerstner would suggest that IBM's board has decided the company needs stronger financial controls rather than new technology leadership, since Mr Gerstner has no experience in the computer industry. He was named as chief executive of RJR Nabisco in March 1989, shortly after the record Dollars 25bn leveraged buyout of the food and tobacco giant. Then 47, he moved to the company from American Express, which he had joined in 1978 as president of the card division, and risen to become chairman of the executive committee of the parent company in 1983, and then president in 1985. Mr Gerstner has no direct prior ties to IBM, but his brother, Mr Richard Gerstner, is a former IBM senior executive. He retired recently for health reasons.</p>

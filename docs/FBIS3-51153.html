			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The leaders of the Manuel Rodriguez Movement  (MMR) yesterday did not rule out the possibility of violent  actions of various degrees during the Eduardo Frei government,  warning that this will depend on the violence used by the system.    In its first statement on the next administration, the MMR  said that it will demand that Frei "pay the immense social debt  contracted by the government of Patricio Aylwin."    Cesar Quiroz, deputy coordinator of the MMR National Board,  who in June 1991 abandoned the armed struggle to join politics,  said that the level of violence would depend on the situation in  the country and on the people's acceptance of it.    About its links with the Autonomous Manuel Rodriguez Front  (FMR-A), which has remained underground, undertaking subversive  actions, the MMR said that it had no plans for joint actions,  though adding that it respects them in their capacity as former  companions in the armed struggle. [passage omitted]    Quiroz, who said that the current state of law is "highly  repressive," made these remarks during a press conference that  he and MMR National Board member Marco Riquelme hosted yesterday  at the MIDA [Allendist Leftist Democratic Movement] headquarters.    The members of the political group said they do not expect  any change for the future, adding that the police state would  become more intense during this period.    They also emphasized that during the "new times" Socialists  will be in charge of repression, thus alluding to the  designation of the Socialist German Correa to the Interior  Ministry.    The leaders read a statement to the press saying that the  Aylwin government did not resolve the problem of political  prisoners or of human rights. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> November 13, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS SURPRISE RAIDERS;  </P> <P> NFL: FOR THE SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK, A TEAM WITH PLAYOFF ASPIRATIONS FINDS THE  TEAM IN SAN DIEGO HARD TO CONTEND WITH.  </P> <P> Suddenly, it is a brave new world for the Chargers. Blocking punts. Running  back kickoffs for touchdowns. Overcoming penalties, injuries, fumbles,  interceptions. And, for the second consecutive week, beating a team that  figured it was headed for the playoffs.  </P> <P> Last week, it was the Eagles and crusty Coach Buddy Ryan. Sunday night, it was  the Raiders and their unctuous owner, Al Davis.  </P> <P> At home, on national television and under the pale light of a full moon, the  Chargers overcame a 12-point deficit and beat the Raiders, 14-12.  </P> <P> "This one," said Raider defensive end Howie Long, "is still kind of a shock."  </P> <P> "With all due respect," said Charger strong safety Martin Bayless. "the  Chargers were the better team."  </P> <P> Bayless had been audacious enough to predict the Chargers would win last week.  But his head coach, Dan Henning, wasn't so sure in the first half when he lost  his deep snapper with a knee injury and his place-kicker with a rib injury.  </P> <P> After the game, Henning recalled what the father of Giant Coach Bill Parcells  used to say when Henning and Parcells were young coaches together at Florida  State. "It's always darkest," the elder Parcells would say, "before it gets to  be pitch black."  </P> <P> It got even worse early in the final period. Trailing by five points, the  Chargers had driven to the Raider 11 following former Raider Sam Seale's  interception of a Jay Schroeder pass.  </P> <P> Running back Tim Spencer turned the right end, broke several tackles and  fumbled. At the one-foot line. Raider strong safety Mike Harden forced the  fumble and recovered it. But the Chargers, who lost four consecutive games  earlier this year when they could have won or tied on their last possession,  were wholly uncowed.  </P> <P> Three plays after Spencer's turnover, the Charger defense that hasn't allowed  more than 20 points in any of the past eight games stiffened again.  </P> <P> Ken Woodard, acting on a tip from Joe Madden, the special teams coach, burst  past Raider long-snapper Trey Junkin and partially blocked Jeff Gossett's punt.  </P> <P> Woodard said Madden had told him that once Junkin puts his head down to snap  the ball, he never brings it back up. Woodard said Junkin never saw him  standing over him and that he came clean on the block.  </P> <P> It gave the Chargers the ball back on the Raider 23. And the Chargers went  right back to Spencer. "I never thought of taking him out," Henning said.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jim McMahon, who finished with nine completions in 20 attempts for  88 yards, dumped a swing pass to Spencer for eight. Then Spencer tried left  tackle for four. Then he burst up the middle for six to set up second and goal  at the five.  </P> <P> When McMahon saw the Raider defense overshifted in response to the Chargers'  unbalanced line, he audibled to a play called "40-gut." Right guard David  Richards cleared the way inside for Spencer to come off his right hip. Right  tackle Brett Miller wedged Long outside so Spencer could cut inside his left  shoulder.  </P> <P> This time Spencer held onto the ball. There were eight minutes and 38 seconds  remaining. But the Chargers were also able to hold onto the lead. They are now  4-6. The Raiders, who had won four of their past five, dropped to 5-5.  </P> <P> "We'll have to look at the film and try to stop that in the future," said  Raider defensive end Scott Davis.  </P> <P> Too late.  </P> <P> "The Raiders prided themselves on a new era," Bayless said. "Today was the  Charger era."  </P> <P> It just took a while to find it.  </P> <P> Early on, the Chargers showed why their offense ranked 26th in the league after  nine weeks. On their first two plays from scrimmage, penalties set them back  four yards and two yards to their own two. Then McMahon threw three consecutive  incomplete passes.  </P> <P> The next time they got the ball, the Chargers committed two more penalties  before Hank Ilesic had to punt again.  </P> <P> Yet another penalty, delay of game, nullified a 25-yard Chris Bahr field goal.  After moving back five yards, things got worse for the Chargers. Rookie center  Courtney Hall snapped the ball over holder David Archer's head. Bahr retrieved  the ball at the 41 but got clobbered by Raider Dan Land and had to leave the  game on a golf cart with what was later described as "sprained" ribs.  </P> <P> Hall was in the game because regular snapper Chris Gannon had left earlier in  the first period with a bruised right knee. McMahon finished the first half  with five completions in 13 attempts for 27 yards. The Chargers' total offense  in the first two periods was 100 yards.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Raider kicker Jeff Jaeger converted from 23, 36, 33 and 32 yards to  give the Raiders a 12-0 lead. After his fourth three-pointer, the Chargers'  biggest crowd of the year (59,151) finally got what it had come to see.  </P> <P> Anthony Miller took Jaeger's kickoff at the eight, cut right off a Woodard  block on Zeph Lee and sprinted up the right sideline for 91 yards and a  touchdown. It was the second kickoff return for a touchdown in Miller's  two-year NFL career. And it was the first time any Charger had ever scored more  than once on a kickoff return.  </P> <P> Even though the Chargers had announced Bahr would not return, he did --  converting the extra point following Miller's score. The Chargers' backup, if  Bahr had not been able to come back, would have either been Ilesic or outside  linebacker Billy Ray Smith, whose last kick of any import was a 17-yarder in a  1985 preseason game.  </P> <P> "It's an easy job," Smith said after that kick. "Maybe I can do it when I get  older." Maybe we'll never have to know.  </P> <P> Almost lost in all the post-game analyses were the game-high 103 yards Raider  running back Bo Jackson gained on 21 rushes. Jackson's longest run was 20  yards, and he didn't score."  </P> <P> "Bo don't know the end zone," the Chargers chanted in the locker room after the  game."  </P> <P> "Our strategy was to gang tackle him and not let him get his shoulders turned  upfield," said Charger free safety Vencie Glenn.  </P> <P> Jackson, like Long, wasn't quite sure what to say. Ask to explain his feelings  after the game, Bo peeped, "I really don't know."  </P> <P> Said Long: "You say to yourself, 'We should have won.' But we don't have any  excuses."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> CHARGER NOTES: Charger running back Tim Spencer, who didn't carry the ball  until late in the third period, led all Charger running backs with 59 yards on  10 carries. Marion Butts gained 56 yards on 11 tries. . . . Raider quarterback  Jay Schroeder played the whole game and completed 12 of 25 for 173 yards. . . .  Each team had three sacks. The Chargers also had three interceptions. . . .  Best Bo Jackson banner at Sunday night's Chargers-Raiders game: "BO DON'T  SURF." Best Jim McMahon banner: "JIMBO NOSE FOOTBALL."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "A Fox Loose in the Henhouse"] </F>   [Text] Gerry Adams's visit to the United States has been a  triumph for the cause he represents. And the cause he  represents is that of the Provisional IRA. We forget that last  fact at our peril. And we have been forgetting it, in a fog of  disinformation and wishful thinking. This is how it came about  that Mr Adams got to the U.S. in a blaze of glory.    He will also get a great reception on his return to Belfast,  and the morale and recruitment of the IRA will benefit  accordingly. The lives of British soldiers serving in Northern  Ireland, and of members of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary],  and of all persons incurring the displeasure of the IRA will be  at correspondingly higher risk.    The most sinister aspect of this ill-omened event was the  nature of the statement in virtue of which Mr Adams was  officially admitted to the United States. The initial position  of the Clinton administration was that Mr Adams must explicitly  "renounce violence," or be excluded. He declined to renounce  violence. Instead, he offered the thought that he personally is  against the killing of "innocent civilians."    The acceptance of this formula, as a basis for the admission  to the U.S. of the political representative of the Provisional  IRA, is equivalent to conceding the existence of legitimate  targets for political terrorism. Under all previous U.S.  administrations, the IRA were regarded as terrorists. They are  now well on the way to achieving the status of freedom fighters.  And this is the most significant result to date of what is  still being hailed as a peace process.    It is important not to minimise the scope and scale of Mr  Adams's American success, or of its implications for Ireland and  Britain. No other living Irish leader -- not Mr Reynolds, not Mr  Spring, not even Mr Hume -- has ever made a hit like this in  America. Yet all the latter leaders have important electoral  mandates. Mr Adams is not now an elected parliamentarian. Sinn  Fein's democratic base is tiny in the island as a whole, and  virtually nonexistent in the Republic.    Yet Mr Adams became, overnight on Larry King Live, the most  visible Irishman in the U.S. He was also treated with great  respect in the upmarket media, headed by the NEW YORK TIMES,  which ran two grovelling profiles of him on Tuesday. He also  totally dominated the media coverage of the proceedings at the  upmarket Kissinger- chaired conference, participation in which  was the ostensible object of his journey.    Gerry Adams's media magic is not due mainly to his skills as  a communicator, although these are not negligible. It is mainly  due to his personal status, which is romantically ambiguous. On  the one hand, he is known to be the principal spokesman for a  terrorist organisation. On the other, he comes before the  public in the role of peacemaker. On the box, he is a  fascinating twofer: Jekyll and Hyde, making a joint appearance.  From Jekyll, you get the reassuring aura of the pacific quest:  from Hyde, the delicious frisson of a safe encounter with a  killer. It is the last that is Adams's trump card on the box.  No interviewer, no interlocutor can match that. And none did, on  this trip.    Broadcasting mandarins, defending the principle of allowing  terrorists to broadcast, used to maintain -- and probably still  do -- that exposure to broadcasting, and skilful interrogation  by dedicated broadcasters, would damage the terrorists. The  fact is that letting terrorists on to television is giving the  fox the run of the henhouse. In the presence of the Adams fox,  on Irish and American television, the dedicated broadcasters  have been no more effective than the hens.    But who gave the fox the run of the henhouse? Who got for Mr  Adams the degree of official approval without which he would  never have been admitted either to the territorial U.S. or to  its airwaves? Three governments share in the responsibility for  this: Dublin, London and Washington.    The responsibilities are unequally shared. That of Dublin is  primary and pivotal. Since the beginning of the Provisional IRA  offensive, in 1971, every Dublin government has refused to  countenance the IRA, and has thrown its weight against the  admission to the U.S. of the Sinn Fein president. The leading  "friends of Ireland" in congress went along with this and a  policy of exclusion prevailed. The British government alone  could not have held that line. The two governments together  could end it. But this time round, the Dublin government shifted  its line. Irish officials now advised senators Daniel Patrick  Moynihan and Edward Kennedy to throw their weight behind the  admission of Gerry Adams. To continue to exclude him might (in  a fashionable and toxic phrase) injure "the delicate balance of  the peace process."    The State Department and the Department of Justice  continued to oppose admission. But Moynihan and Kennedy were  too much for them. Moynihan, as well as being a greatly  respected figure in his own right, is now chairman of the Senate  finance committee. He is essential to the success of the  president's legislative programme, and also a faintly menacing  figure for the presidential future as Whitewatergate develops.  (It was Moynihan who forced the president to appoint a special  council to investigate that matter.) So Clinton gave in, and  further concessions may be expected unless counter measures are  taken.    The responsibilities of Dublin and Washington are clear.  London's responsibility is less obvious, but heavy. Mr Major's  great mistake was to yield to Albert Reynolds' entreaties to  incorporate the "self-determination" formula in the Downing  Street agreement of 15 December. No doubt Mr Major and his  advisers thought the formula became harmless when incorporated  in a context which contains "guarantees" for the Unionists.    But it isn't harmless. The guarantees are old stuff, but the  self-determination formula is altogether new. And everyone  knows it is an IRA formula, urged on Dublin through the  Hume-Adams process, then pressed on London by Dublin. What the  acceptance of those words signifies for the IRA is that the  British position in Northern Ireland is weakening, and will  weaken further, under further ingenious and ruthless  combinations of political and paramilitary pressure.    For Dublin, that acceptance meant that it can pursue a  Hume-Adams line -- which is popular, especially in Fianna Fail  -- without seriously damaging relations with London, which would  worry most people in Ireland. In making possible Mr Adams's  U.S. journey, with the serious damage that this has done to  Anglo-American relations, Mr Reynolds overlooked the damage that  was being done to Anglo-Irish relations. He should reconsider  that.    It is time to call a halt. Mr Major should now talk  seriously to Mr Reynolds. He should make clear that unless Sinn  Fein unconditionally accepts the Downing Street declaration by a  given date, and unless the IRA unconditionally ends its campaign  by the same date, both governments should agree that the  declaration ceases to be operative. In short, both governments  should stop their disastrous quest for peace through appeasement  of the IRA. There are serious security matters to be discussed  between them, once appeasement is seen to have totally failed.</p>

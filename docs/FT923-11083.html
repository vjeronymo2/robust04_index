			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Contractors drop prices up to 30% PRICES CHARGED by contrac-tors for construction work in Britain have fallen by up to 30 per cent since 1989, according to contractors, customers and building professionals surveyed by the Financial Times. The findings emphasise the depth of the recession, which contractors say is the worst for more than half a century and which has caused a large number of company failures and redundancies. Many contractors, desperate for cash from advance payments, have been taking work at zero margin or even at a loss. The worst affected part of the industry is in southern England where recession and over-building, particularly of offices in the late-1980s, has led to a big fall in new construction work, forcing prices down sharply. Mr Peter Birse, chairman of Birse Group, says: 'Anybody who claims that they are doing better than just covering overheads on contracts won in southern England is lying.' E C Harris, a firm of international cost consultants which prepared a study of construction tender prices for the Financial Times, estimates building prices in London have fallen 22 per cent since the second quarter of 1989. It warns that customers accepting loss-making tenders may have to cope with their contractor going out of business or face claims for extra payments as contractors seek to recover margins on loss-making jobs. Margins are at rock bottom in many parts of the country as contractors try to move into new areas to offset the decline in private-sector office building. The transport department estimates that national prices for road construction have fallen by about 20 per cent since 1989. Anglian Water, another large customer of the construction industry, estimates building prices have fallen 30 per cent in two years. Price falls have affected other parts of the building industry. The Royal Institute of British Architects, which last week complained about architects having to take work at a loss to keep teams together, estimates that over the past two years about a third of the country's 32,000 registered architects lost their jobs. Redland, one of the country's biggest building material producers, estimates that prices of some bricks have fallen by 40 per cent since 1989. Lower building material prices have helped to cushion some of the impact of falling contracting prices. Desperate measures, Page 6 Lex, Page 14</p>

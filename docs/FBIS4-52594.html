			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "`Sitting Duck' Becoming Troublesome for </F> Government?"]    [Text] The leaders of the Chuan coalition should have been  dancing with joy after a drug scandal blew up in the face of the  opposition faction. An immediate effect was that they have been  given a welcome respite from an opposition move to call for a  no-confidence debate over the unimpressive performance of the  administration.    As the mystery shrouding the past deeds of Chat Thai MP  Thanong Siriprichaphong is being unraveled with more  embarrassing evidence involving his alleged role in marijuana  consignments to the U.S., Thai authorities appear reluctant to  be put on the spot with the lawmaker. A nagging question from  the public is "why so?"    Thanong, proprietor of the Little Duck Group of hotel and  entertainment chains, has become an ugly duckling for Chat Thai  Party and the whole opposition block which have been dismayed by  a sudden reversal of fortune. Newly-elected Chat Thai leader  Banhan Sinlapa-acha must have been particularly upset by the  jinx which had further dimmed his chances of being in the  government by whatever means he deems possible.    The scandal has made all senior officials in law enforcement  and drug suppression look very foolish. First they said they  had not been aware of Thanong's path to his current vast  fortune. Yielding to more pressing questions, they conceded  that they had quite substantial information about the MP's  alleged role in drug trafficking.    The public is frustrated on many points after hearing hasty  explanations from Thanong as well as government authorities.  Thanong categorically denied on May 6 that he had no idea about  the assets seized by U.S. authorities, but conceded on Tuesday  that he had indeed owned the property and a limousine in  California. The exposed falsehood was sufficient to wash away  whatever innocence he had claimed.    Any prosecutor having Thanong on the defense stand and with  that kind of admission would certainly be rubbing his hands in  glee. But wait a minute. What we heard later from government  officials was perplexing. From all comments, it boiled down to  something like this: they weren't quite sure whether legal  actions could be taken against the lawmaker who is being accused  by U.S. authorities of trafficking in narcotics.    "There is not yet any evidence to implicate him," they said.  This is really funny. They made the statement even before there  was any attempt to start an investigation. The Police  Department is silent. The Interior Ministry officials are  distancing themselves from the "sitting duck'' who is now in the  line of fire of U.S. legal potshots.    The Narcotics Suppression Unit has not displayed any  enthusiasm to launch a probe, despite a forced admission that  there was substantial record of suspected illegal activities.  The Office of the Attorney General did not seem interested in  finding out whether there are grounds for legal actions.    We wonder why, because the whole mess is making a mockery of  our creaking legal machinery.    But more revealing yesterday was an explanation from  American  authorities that there had been a plan to arrest the MP if he  showed up in the United States. This should be dreadful enough  for Thanong to change his bravado that he intended to prove his  innocence in any U.S. court of law. He will be lucky enough,  from now on, to stay away from the long arm of the American law  whenever he travels outside Thailand.    There are too many fine points involved. But there are  things to be done. Thanong must discontinue his House  membership to reduce the negative image on the institution. The  government must start investigations right away on this  explosive scandal. If not, it must explain to the public why  the MP should be exempted from due process of the law to clear  his name.    If the government is unmoved, it would not be a surprise to  see Chat Thai and other opposition MPs from Chat Phathana and  Social Action parties come up soon with an audacious demand that  Prime Minister Chuan resign to show his responsibility, if  Thanong refuses to quit.    Knowing full well the extent of their political scruples, we  believe that they certainly can go that far.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Huang Zhiling: "AIDS Deserves Attention Today"] </F>   [Text] Probably nine out of every 10 Chinese could not say  precisely how the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency  syndrome, or AIDS, is spread.    In the eyes of most Chinese people, AIDS is mainly a  foreigners' disease.    But a report for the Chinese Government has warned that AIDS  could be a serious problem.    The State Council Research Office report is based on  research  by the State Council and the ministry of Public Health which  studied China's AIDS prevention and control programmes.    The world's first AIDS case was reported in the United  States  in 1981.    In the early 1990's, 400,000 patients around the world were  diagnosed with AIDS. Nearly half of them were found in the  United States.    Since the mid-1990's, however, the threat of AIDS has become  of worldwide concern and it is now spreading especially fast in  developing countries.    According to a conservative estimate by the World Health  Organization, the world will have seen 50 million people  infected by HIV by the year 2000. Most of these are expected to  be in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.    HIV is one of the viruses that causes AIDS.    China's first case of AIDS, in Beijing, was reported in June  1985. The patient was an American tourist.    Since then, 1,361 cases of HIV infection have been reported  in 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions; 1,106  cases of HIV infection were found among mainland Chinese, the  rest among foreigners and overseas Chinese.    Forty of the HIV carriers have developed AIDS, and 22 of  them  have died.    These figures were determined by a very small-scale testing  operation among nearly 3 million people.    In China, the HIV virus has been spread mainly through the  sharing of needles by intravenous drug users in Southwest  China's Yunnan Province. More than 70 percent of China's AIDS  cases reportedly come from Yunnan as a result of sharing needles.    However, in recent times, HIV infection from heterosexual  contact is increasing faster than infection from sharing needles.    In 1991, 5.6 per cent of the HIV carriers were infected  through sexual contact; in 1992, the figure was 13.8 per cent;  and in 1993, 15.7 percent.    Outside Yunnan, most patients were found to have contracted  HIV through sexual contact.    Before 1989, most HIV-carriers found in China were among  foreigners. But since then, the number of Chinese infected with  HIV has risen comparatively quickly.    The State Council report predicts that about 100,000  mainland  Chinese will be HIV-positive by the year 2000. The report  predicts about 20,000 cases will have developed into full-blown  AIDS.    The World Health Organization predicts that by the end of  this century the number of HIV infected people in China will be  no less than the average for Asian countries as a whole.    If this happens, China will have a large number of  HIV-infected people. The danger of this happening is quite  feasible, according to the State Council report.    The 1992 World Health Conference predicted by 2002, southern  Sahara in Africa would be the hardest-hit HIV-infected region in  the world, as it was at the time of the report.    But towards the end of this decade, it will be Asia, home to  50 per cent of the world's population, that will witness a sharp  rise in the spread of HIV. Each year, the number of Asians  becoming infected with HIV is expected to be greater than the  number of new infections in Africa.    A survey conducted by the Chinese Academy of Preventive  Medicine shows that nearly half of the students investigated in  eight Shenyang colleges, in Liaoning Province, did not fully  understand how HIV was spread.    Public ignorance over how HIV is spread makes large-scale  infections possible, said the State Council report.    The increase in prostitution in China is expected to make  sexual contact the most common factor in the spread of the  infection, said the State Council report.    Police authorities are also concerned over the increase in  drug use and, along with that, needle-sharing that can spread  HIV.    What is worse, say officials, is that drug users tend to be  promiscuous. Women drug users often become involved in  prostitution to finance their drug habit. This undoubtedly  accelerates the spread of HIV, said the report.    China is yet to test all of its blood donor samples for  traces of HIV.    Medical equipment, if not disinfected carefully, can be the  agent for spreading HlV. In some of China's rural hospitals,  medical equipment is not carefully disinfected, said the State  Council report.    People aged between 18 and 45 are considered to be at the  highest risk of contracting HIV. About 80 per cent of HIV-cases  in China now are people aged between 20 and 49. Because this  age group represents a normally productive part of society, the  report says, the burden on the Chinese economy could be great.    Average annual medical expenses for AIDS patients range from  3,300 to 7,400 yuan ($381 to $855), which is half the average  annual family income in China.    According to the report, some high-ranking officials show  indifference to the potentially devastating threat of AIDS in  China.    China now has only 1,000 or so HIV-infected people, they  argue. Even if this number were to increase 20-fold, it would  still represent just a tiny fraction of the nation's populace,  they say.    Many ordinary people still think AIDS is just a foreigners'  disease and, providing one doesn't become involved in  prostitution, doesn't represent a real danger. Also, some  prostitutes think they can avoid infection by avoiding foreign  clients, said the report.    Public awareness about the threat is at a low level in  China.    Each year, wide publicity is given to the AIDS issue around  December 1, which is World AIDS Day. But for the rest of the  year, the problem is often ignored.    To increase public awareness on the AIDS problem, the  Chinese  media need to provide free time and space for public education,  said the report.</p>

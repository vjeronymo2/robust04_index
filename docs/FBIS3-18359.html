			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN): German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today  welcomed the results of the Brussels talks on the accession to  the European Union of Sweden, Finland, and Austria, as well as  the progress of negotiations with Norway, calling them a "great  success for Europe." According to government spokesman Dieter  Vogel, Kohl said during a cabinet meeting in Bonn today that the  accession of these countries would go down as a major event in  European history. All parties could be "more than satisfied"  with the results of the talks.    Kohl emphasized that the German Government, which had  spearheaded the opening of the European Community towards  southern Europe, had a "decisive interest" in the Scandinavian  countries and Austria becoming members. Germany's close  cooperation with the new member states would be of great benefit  to Germany in particular, he said.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Prescott targets full employment Mr John Prescott, the most likely 'traditionalist' candidate for the Labour leadership, is preparing to put full employment at the centre of his leadership campaign. The shadow employment secretary - who refuses to say whether he will run until after Thursday's European elections - is widely expected to declare his candidacy the next day. Such a move would pit him against Mr Tony Blair, the leading Labour 'moderniser' and overwhelming favourite to succeed John Smith as leader. Other candidates may include Mrs Margaret Beckett, the party's present leader. Friends of Mr Prescott say the pugnacious MP for Hull East would use a leadership campaign to press for a much clearer definition of what the party's commitment to full employment means. They say he believes that full employment could be turned into the main issue of the campaign. Ten days ago Mr Prescott called for a return to the socialist values of the 1945 Labour government in a speech that was billed as the launch of his leadership campaign. Last week he said he thought there should be a contest, arguing that an election was 'an essential part of the democratic process'. This view is thought to be shared by Mr Blair, whose supporters see a contest - which they are convinced he would win - as an invaluable means of shoring up his authority. The Blair camp has been anxious to let it be known that unsuccessful challengers would not be punished for opposing him. They have stressed that no promises have been given to any colleagues regarding specific future shadow cabinet positions under Mr Blair. This includes Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor and close confidant of Mr Blair, who decided to stand aside from the race last week. It also emerged yesterday that Mr Blair might delay the formal announcement of his candidacy until early next week rather than on Friday, when nominations open. Such a move would avoid attention being diverted from the European election results, which could be very favourable for Labour.</p>

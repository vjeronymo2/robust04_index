			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Oftel takes bigger hand in BT pricing BT'S NEW price control regime, announced yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, involves tightening of the overall price formula and greater intervention in elements of price control. The main features are that from next year BT will be required to cut the price of a basket of its main services by 7.5 percentage points less than the rate of inflation each year. This RPI minus 7.5 formula compares with the present formula of RPI minus 6.25, which itself has been tightened from RPI minus 3 at the time of BT's privatisation in 1984 and RPI minus 4.5 in 1989. The tighter price formula, to last four years, is designed to bring BT's profitability - as measured by return on the capital employed - down to between 16.5 per cent and 18.5 per cent in 1997. Oftel has assumed that BT will be able to improve efficiency, as measured by real unit costs, by 3 per cent a year. The basket includes domestic and international call charges and line rental. Connection charges are included in the main basket for the first time. They were previously controlled separately, and increases were limited to RPI plus 2. BT will not be allowed to increase the price of any single service - apart from line rental charges - by more than the RPI. The company was previously free to increase some prices faster than inflation provided it made compensating cuts to other prices. Special discounts from BT, mainly to business customers, will not be included in the price formula. BT will be allowed to increase line rental charges by RPI plus 2, but that is much less than the company had been hoping for. It argued that, in order to cover the losses it says it makes from supplying customers with lines, it should be allowed to increase such charges by RPI plus 8. Oftel has been concerned, however, to protect residential customers, for whom rental charges form a large portion of bills. It has also ordered BT to cut connection charges to Pounds 99 from the present Pounds 152.75 - a move that will cost the company Pounds 28.5m a year. In a further move to benefit small customers, Oftel wants BT to improve its discounts for low users. The new scheme should benefit 4m to 5m people compared with the 1m in the present scheme at a cost to BT of Pounds 50m a year. Private circuits, which are used by large businesses, will remain covered by a separate price cap of RPI plus 0. BT will be required to publish separate accounts for its main businesses as a means of helping competitors get access to its network on fair terms. Oftel plans to appoint consultants to advise it on the best way of doing so, with the aim of BT publishing its first separate accounts in the 1993-94 financial year. BT will be required to modernise its network so that digital services, such as itemised billing and call barring, are available to 99 per cent of customers by July 1997. By the same date, the company must have installed 3.5m km of fibre-optic cable, compared with the present 2m km.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If assurances do not exist, as described in &sect;123.12(a),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the product has been produced under an HACCP plan and under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sanitation controls that are equivalent to those required of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> domestic processors, the agency will deny entry to the products  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as provided in proposed &sect;123.12(b) because the product will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear to be adulterated (see section 801(a) of the act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Raw Molluscan Shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA is proposing to require in part 123, subpart C that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors of raw molluscan shellfish include in their HACCP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans how they control the origin of the molluscan shellfish that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they process. Proposed &sect;123.28 requires that these controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include obtaining raw shellfish only from approved growing waters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through harvesters or processors licensed by a shellfish control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority. FDA is proposing to require that processors maintain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records to document that each lot of raw molluscan shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets these requirements. Under this proposal, these records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will constitute HACCP records subject to the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;123.8.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency is also proposing to establish a system of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tagging or other labeling that provides information about the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> origin of all shellstock and shucked molluscan shellfish received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a processor. FDA is proposing to amend &sect;1240.60 (21 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1240.60) to provide for such a tagging system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Raw molluscan shellfish are molluscan shellfish that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not been subject to a treatment sufficient to kill pathogens of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public health significance. Shellfish that have been subjected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to any form of treatment, such as steam, hot water, or dry heat,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a short period of time before shucking to facilitate removal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the meat from the shell are still considered to be raw. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Molluscan shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked pose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique public health risks. They probably cause the majority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all seafood-related illnesses in the United States (Refs. 6; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7, p. 330). The safety of raw molluscan shellfish directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflects the cleanliness of its aquatic environment. Of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> edible species of fish, molluscan shellfish are unique in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they are nonmotile, filter feeding organisms. They pump large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantities of water through their bodies during the normal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feeding process (Refs. 7, p. 331; and 90, p. c-4). The positive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between harvesting areas contaminated by sewage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pollution and shellfish-borne enteric disease has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrated many times (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91 and 92). During  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feeding, the shellfish may concentrate pathogenic microorganisms,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deadly toxins associated with naturally occurring marine plankton  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 93), or forms of agricultural and industrial pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ref. 94). Among the pathogenic microorganisms is the Norwalk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virus, probably the most common cause of seafood-borne illness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This virus commonly occurs in waters contaminated by sewage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effluent (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91, 92, and 95).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before the adoption of the current public health controls in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United States, shellfish commonly transmitted many serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communicable diseases. Consumption of raw or undercooked seafood  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from polluted waters can be a mode of transmission for typhoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fever, infectious hepatitis, and cholera (Ref. 67). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diseases are still commonly associated with raw shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption in lesser developed countries (Ref. 7, p. 73).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the incidence of these diseases in the United States has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been largely controlled under section 361 of the PHS Act (42  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S.C. 264). This statute was enacted to prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under provisions of the PHS Act, FDA is empowered to accept  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance from the States to protect public health.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, FDA participates in a Federal/State cooperative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program called NSSP.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Established in 1925, the NSSP provides water quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria for assessing the safety of shellfish growing areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These criteria are applied by the States under the authority of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own laws. The NSSP ``Manual of Operations'' provides the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis (Refs. 90 and 96) for State regulation in 23 shellfish-producing States and 6 nations. Each participating State or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nation classifies and monitors its shellfish growing waters,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls harvesting, inspects shellfish packing and shucking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities, and issues certificates to individual shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processors that meet the State or foreign government's shellfish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

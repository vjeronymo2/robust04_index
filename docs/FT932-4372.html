			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD firmed on the London bullion market as renewed buying came into the market. 'The market just seems to be probing higher, to see where the selling is going to come in,' one dealer said. Initial resistance remains around Dollars 376 a troy ounce at the moment, although the former range between Dollars 372 and Dollars 378 is still in place. New York's Comex was registering only small gains by midday despite bullish influences from currency and stock markets. But New York dealers were expecting gold to remain within its established pattern. London's robusta COFFEE attempted to break back into the middle of its recent Dollars 900 to Dollars 950 range, as New York seemed content to pull back some of Monday's losses. But the absence of fundamental news failed to provide any real momentum and gains were trimmed by the close. London COCOA showed little inclination to break out of its present lethargy. Traders were paying little heed to talks this week at the ICCO, where members must decide on whether or not to call a fifth negotiating session for a possible new international agreement. On the LME COPPER was steadier. Compiled from Reuters</p>

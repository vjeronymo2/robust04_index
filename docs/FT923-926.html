			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / BA buys 49.9% of TAT for Pounds 17.25m BRITISH Airways is acquiring a 49.9 per cent stake in the French regional airline Transport Aerien Transregional (TAT) for Pounds 17.25m with an option to buy the rest by April 1, 1997. The investment is part of BA's strategy to create a global airline by buying big stakes in other airlines. BA has already agreed to buy 44 per cent of USAir for Dollars 750m (Pounds 439m) and bought a large minority stake this year in Delta, a German regional airline which has since been renamed Deutsche BA. Other international carriers including American Airlines, United Airlines and Swissair were understood to have considered acquiring a stake in TAT. The French regional carrier is based in Tours, and operates a network of French and European destinations including a service between Paris and London's Gatwick airport. It operates 54 aircraft, carried 3m passengers last year and employs 1,540 people. BA said yesterday it intended to help TAT develop its route network and strengthen its competitive position as a regional airline in the new European single aviation market. The BA acquisition is expected to intensify competition between the regional carrier and Air France, which was forced last year by the European Commission to sell its 35 per cent stake in TAT when it took over UTA, the French long-haul carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic airline. BA said the acquisition, which includes only the airline activities of the TAT group, would be funded from its cash resources. After making a small pre-tax profit last year, BA said TAT was expected to incur losses this year as it expanded its international routes. But the UK carrier said it did not expect material dilution in earnings nor material change in the debt-to-capital ratios as a result of the investment. However, the deal, expected to be completed in January, has to be cleared by the EC competition directorate and the French regulatory authorities. Although BA's Pounds 17.25m investment was relatively small, City analysts said TAT had commitments for about 10-15 new aircrafts to be delivered between now and the end of next year which could prove more costly.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 6 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In connection with the issue of North Korea's  suspected nuclear development, some legislators affiliated with  the ruling Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] have  discussed the possibility of sending a delegation to North  Korea; but on 5 April, one ruling party after another argued  that sending such a delegation to North Korea should be handled  cautiously. Commenting on the intraparty discussion at an 5  April news conference, Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the SDPJ,  stressed: "We intend to cautiously study what our party can do  after grasping the situation a little more clearly." SDPJ Vice  Chairman Inoue recently met with a high-ranking North Korean  official in Beijing. It is said that during the meeting, Inoue  got the impression the North Korean official showed a  forward-looking attitude toward a visit by the delegation.  However, the remark made by Chairman Murayama at the news  conference indicated his cautious attitude toward sending the  delegation to North Korea. During the news conference, Chairman  Murayama also stated: "If there is a role to be played by the  SDPJ in easing tensions in Asia, the SDPJ is willing to play  that role aggressively."</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Currency risks The dollar is struggling to live up to the expectations of strength with which it started the year. Against the yen, it has slipped back to roughly the level before the Japanese government fell. Though it has risen some 12 pfennigs against the D-Mark so far this month, the gain since January is less than 5 per cent. Evidently, the market misjudged the interest rate trend. The Bundesbank has been slow to cut. Poor regional inflation figures on Friday do not enhance the prospect of significantly lower rates from this week's council meeting. Meanwhile, the US recovery has slowed, lessening the chance of higher interest rates there. One question is whether currencies will continue to be driven by interest rate differentials. Trade politics overshadow the yen. Arguably the D-Mark is now suffering, like other European currencies before it, from a perception that high interest rates are untenable in the face of deepening recession. It would not do to push this theory too far, though. Given the inflationary risk inherent in Germany's large budget deficit, the Bundesbank must be anxious about relaxation if this affects long-term bond yields. The US trade deficit hardly looks a good starting point for a robust dollar recovery. Further dollar gains would drag the D-Mark down against the yen. It already looks unnaturally cheap at Y62, which compares with Y89 as recently as last August. A spot of D-Mark resilience would not come amiss for the UK chancellor. He is committed to raising taxes in November if the recovery proves too weak to reduce the PSBR substantially. But since the underlying reason for higher taxes would be economic weakness, it would be natural to accompany fiscal tightening with monetary ease. That would be easier if he has not already been driven into a premature rate cut by exporters complaining about sterling's strength.</p>

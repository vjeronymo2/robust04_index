			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (6): Fierce battle for hearts and wallets - Ground Services THE desperation of airlines to lure back the lucrative business traveller can be reflected in one simple statistic: in the past two years, carriers worldwide have managed to lose every penny of profit made since the Second World War - an estimated total of about Pounds 7bn. It is against that background - and the knowledge that business class provides about 50 per cent of profits while taking just 20 per cent of the space - that airlines have been waging a fierce battle for the hearts and wallets of the executive traveller. That war has so far been fought largely in the air, with airlines offering roomy sleeper seats, televisions and 'haute cuisine' en route to tempt the more discerning traveller. However, the battlefield of the 1990s is almost certain to be on the ground. Increasingly carriers are focusing on the pre- and post-flight needs of the business traveller. Mr Colin Ellson, deputy editor of Executive Travel, the magazine which caters for business passengers, describes it as the 'total journey concept'. In a survey recently published by Executive Travel, airlines are judged on many factors, including how completely they have adopted the philosophy. It would appear that many carriers are going to great lengths to take the hassles out of a business journey as early as possible. This has traditionally meant limousine or helicopter transfers from home, or between airports, with airlines such as Quantas, Cathay Pacific, Virgin Atlantic and Continental all offering at least the chauffeur option. Such luxury is viable, however, for only the smaller airlines. It would be too expensive for the larger carriers which have more daily flights. The larger airlines have begun to hit back with their own weapons. British Airways, for example, is investing Pounds 30m in its Airport 95 programme, in addition to a Pounds 100m investment in brands. The concept, to build customer loyalty 'by creating a distinctive personal and enabling experience that is reliable, seamless and hassle-free', hangs on the conviction that passengers want a real change to their experiences on the ground. There are plans are to relieve clients of their baggage as early as possible  -at hotel and underground check-ins, for example - and deliver it to the business passenger's final destination. The carrier is also trialling a mobile check-in service carried out by attendants with portable computers, which is expected to reduce queues. BA has also introduced Time Saver, a self-service ticketing and check-in facility for those who want the quickest route through airport red tape. BA already has a fast-track service for executive passengers at Gatwick, which gives them priority for security, immigration and customs. The airline plans to introduce this at other airports soon. The terminals have become the most important areas of competition, with millions being spent on offering business travellers facilities they never even knew they wanted. Virgin has led the field with its Pounds 1m lounge at Heathrow, opened just two months ago. 'We decided to turn the convention on its head,' said a Virgin spokesman referring to the unusual nature of the lounge. The opulent facility at Terminal Three, for Virgin's Upper Class passengers, has seven different areas to cater for whatever mood they are in. This includes a model railway bar where the train delivers the drinks, a panelled library with 5,000 books - although users would have to be speed-readers since the books may not be taken away - and a darkened games room with the latest in computer entertainment. Other facilities include an observation deck, a sound-proofed music room and a bathroom where travellers can soak to the sound of singing whales. BA also has its own new state-of-the-art lounge facility, opened last month, at Terminal Four. The facility has been described by BA officials as more like a hotel lobby than existing airport lounges. 'People can use the lounges as an extension of their travel,' says Mr Dave Bevan, senior manager of BA's service delivery systems. 'If they arrive early at a destination, they can now go to the lounge, shower, change and then go on, fresh for their meeting.' Many other airlines, such as United and British Midland, have invested in their own lounge facilities. Yet the airlines are not the only ones which feel the pressure to fight for executive business. Aware that the carriers will be looking for more space for these customers, the airports have met the challenge with enthusiasm. At Heathrow, for example, BAA is investing Pounds 12m in adding 90,000 sq ft of private lounge space in Terminal Three for first-class and business-class customers. Airlines intending to take up the new space include American, Cathay Pacific, Korean, Malaysia, All Nippon, Air Canada, SAS, Singapore, Thai, JAL, Kuwait, Quantas, and a range of other smaller carriers. Gatwick is also investing Pounds 3m in facilities dedicated to the business traveller, to be completed this spring. It will include access to showers, laundry and breakfast. The lounge is being developed in conjunction with a Pounds 12m investment in Gatwick's North Terminal. Eventually, however, the war will have to move from behind the velvet curtains of increasingly plush lounges and out into the open. Possibilities being mooted include ground-to-air communication, or even aircraft-to-aircraft, links. Virgin is already investigating options for 'interacting' with services on the ground, or vice versa. Whatever the airlines dream up next will prove of little use, however, unless companies allow their executives that extra perk of flying business class. According to a recent Mori poll, half the executives questioned had downgraded their class of air travel and more than a third were making fewer trips. Until that changes, the whales in Virgin's lounge may find they are singing to thin audiences.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Management: Strategy comes down from the ivory tower - Christopher Lorenz assesses some unusually practical research into competitive performance For well over a decade, the term 'strategic management' has been bandied about by a growing body of consultants, academics and business people - from chief executives down to quite junior line managers. It has become part of the language of MBA courses and of programmes for more experienced executives. Yet, pressed to explain what it means, many executives offer a definition which confuses strategic management with strategic planning. The latter was the rage in the 1970s but is sneered at by most consultants and academics these days as being an ivory tower headquarters activity which was too reliant on unreliable forecasts. Given this confusion, there has long been a need for an up-to-date, accessible, and, preferably, non-American, publication which not only makes the difference clear, but also provides a plain person's guide to various other aspects of the creation and execution of business and corporate strategy. In particular need of down-to-earth examination have been various strategic buzz-phrases, ideas and techniques which have become fashionable since the 1970s - most notably the blockbuster 'competitive strategy' concepts of Michael Porter from Harvard. Business executives have also needed help with the question of how far strategy-creation should be a logical, or intuitive, process. All this, and more, is covered by The Challenge of Strategic Management, the flagship volume in Cranfield School of Management's new Management Research Series*. One of its many swipes at conventional wisdom is that 'the strategies an organisation pursues are not necessarily what is espoused by the organisation or its senior figures'. Instead, they are 'the direction an organisation is actually pursuing, perceived or otherwise'. On the confusion between strategic management and planning, the book says the latter term became associated with an activity carried out somewhat remotely from line management, and reviewed at inflexibly pre-set intervals. 'It was also associated with long-term planning, which was inclined to take a definitive view of the future, and to extrapolate trend lines'. Moreover, 'economic turbulence was insufficiently considered, and the reality - that much strategy is formulated and implemented in the act of managing the enterprise - was ignored'. Strategic management, by contrast, takes planning out of the headquarters ivory tower, and 'puts the activity back where it belongs: with the line manager'. The book is especially useful for its clear analysis of the many different and often conflicting factors which create corporate and business strategies in most organisations: not just rational planning, but all sorts of political, cultural, organisational and environmental influences, as well as the visionary power of leaders. Given that some of these influences were christened by their American progenitors with such off-putting names as 'logical incrementalism' and 'organisational ecology', the book's clarity is doubly welcome. Among other things, it emphasises that an organisation's vision - one of the most powerful aspects of strategy - can emanate not only from its individual leader (or leaders), but also from well beneath the top. According to research by Cliff Bowman which is reported in the book, many managers, and even some academics, misapply Michael Porter's work on 'generic strategies'. This argues, among other things, that businesses have to make a basic choice between competing on the basis either of lowest cost (what Porter calls 'cost leadership') or of 'differentiation' - the addition of extra features to a product or service in order to differentiate it from the competition. Bowman makes the important, though unoriginal, observation that, as Toyota and other companies have demonstrated, these two strategies are not nearly as exclusive as Porter suggests. Bowman also reports that executives confuse the Harvard professor's definition of cost leadership with the less exacting criterion of 'low cost'. Andy Bailey and Gerry Johnson, two other contributors to the book, also stress that while organisational innovation and variation (of processes, structures and systems) may come about as a rational, intentional response to the environment, they may also occur unintentionally. This may happen through any of the following circumstances: conflict over control of resources; accident; errors; tactical moves; and luck. Bowman and Johnson emphasise the importance to an organisation of being able to uncover hidden differences in the perceptions and attitudes of its executives (senior and otherwise), and of debating competitive strategy in a way that renders everyone's assumptions clear, not cloaked. The academics describe various simple but powerful mapping techniques which display such differences in a way that has operational meaning for managers, rather than merely in the sort of intangible fashion suggested by some consultants. * Edited by David Faulkner and Gerry Johnson.

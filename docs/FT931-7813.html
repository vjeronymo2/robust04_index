			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Premier recruits technocrats for economy posts MR PAOLO BARATTA, as minister in charge of privatisation, joins Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister, as the second professional banker recruited into the eight-month-old Amato government. While Mr Barucci is considered sympathetic to the Christian Democrats, Mr Baratta's sympathies have traditionally leaned towards the Socialist party. An engineer trained at Milan polytechnic, the 53-year-old Mr Baratta went on to do a masters at the London School of Economics. He became a banker in 1977, joining the public works credit institute before it was absorbed by the larger state credit group, Crediop. He became head of Crediop in 1980 and ran it until the latter was transformed into a publicly quoted company last year. He then moved to manage the prestigious bank San Paolo di Torino. He has extensive experience of the needs of both the public and private sector, and Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, originally hoped he would assume the industry portfolio with a specific brief to speed up privatisation. When Mr Giuseppe Guarino refused to leave industry, he was given a newly created portfolio to deal with privatisation. Although he will now have the full support of the prime minister and the three economics ministers, he faces a tough task outmanoeuvring Mr Guarino, who has the backing of many of the old guard in the Christian Democrat and Socialist parties. After a break of 13 years, Mr Beniamino (Nino) Andreatta has returned to Italy's budget portfolio, enhanced since last June with responsibility for the Mezzogiorno (southern Italy). This young-looking 65-year-old economics professor is one of the most outspoken and distinguished economists in Italy. Although he has stayed aloof from political in-fighting, he has become an influential figure in trying to give a new identity to the Christian Democrats under the three-month-old leadership of Mr Mino Martinazzoli. Born in Trento in northern Italy, he first studied law at Padua, before going to Cambridge to concentrate on economics. An avowed Keynesian, he held the economics chair at Bologna University. He became a senator in 1976. Under the government of Mr Francesco Cossiga in 1979, Mr Andreatta first took on the budget portfolio then the Treasury. Since 1983 he was first a Christian Democrat MP, then a senator until he lost his seat in last year's elections. With a reputation as someone who does not suffer fools gladly, he once denounced Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, as a national socialist bent on nationalisation.</p>

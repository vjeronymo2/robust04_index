			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina by Rey </F> Rodriguez and Roberto Cabada at the Foreign Ministry in Havana  on 4 April -- recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] On this Sunday dedicated to Cuban youth,  we could not fail to meet with a man who for many years was the  leader of the Cuban youth and is today at the helm of the  Foreign Ministry. Mr. Minister, how do you reconcile your youth  with your ministry post?    [Robaina] First of all, I would like to say that a person  with certain responsibilities right now cannot be missing this  Sunday; what is important to me is the young people on whom Cuba  relies. I believe that today, and every Sunday, the young people  are present through their effort, work, and participation. I  believe that to reconcile this is not so hard, for several  reasons.    First, I am not as young as many think. Second, I believe  that Cuba's foreign policy is made by the people; in this, that  youth have a real and specific participation. On the other hand,  I do not think my youth is at the helm of the Ministry. The  Ministry and Cuba's foreign policy are made up of an  accumulation of youth who lead and conduct our foreign policies.  Therefore, I do not think my mission is the hardest.    [Rodriguez] You have just returned from a tour of eight  Asian  nations. What is your opinion of the trip?    [Robaina] I believe it was highly positive, particularly  since it was a remarkably open forum to tell the truth about our  project and to explain to the world that Cuba is not only  seeking the solutions it needs but has many highly positive and  successful things to offer, things needed by many worldwide,  particularly in that region. I believe that it is important for  us to thoroughly study that region which has so many economic  accomplishments in order to find out how many can be adapted to  our character, our ways, and the pressures we are subject to and  under which we are building our project.    [Cabada] You will be departing to Latin America shortly. I  would like to confirm the countries you will be visiting and  what your expectations are.    [Robaina] This is simply a follow-up to the effort being  made  in South America; this is one aspect of that effort. This trip  is in response to invitations from countries such as Argentina,  Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Paraguay. We seek the same thing  that Cuba has sought throughout the years with its foreign  policy: a forum to explain what we are doing, with all our  virtues and defects, and also a forum from which to learn.    When we speak of this, Latin America has a special place. I  believe that doing this as the Latin American summit nears gives  us an opportunity to turn that forum into what the Latin  American peoples hope it will become.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Magdeburg (DDP/ADN) -- The Republicans' list of  candidates for election to the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt  has now been accepted for the 26 June elections. This follows  the Saxony-Anhalt Electoral Committee today revizing its  decision adopted last Wednesday [1 June], by one vote.  Following detailed discussion, four of the seven members of the  committee voted to recognize the list. Only the Christian  Democratic Union stuck to its decision not to admit the  Republicans. The Social Democratic Party and the Party of  Democratic Socialists abstained and Alliance-90/Greens changed  their decision. [passage omitted]</p>

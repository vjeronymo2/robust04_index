			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / De Klerk plays down role of talks PRESIDENT F W de Klerk yesterday said the Inkatha Freedom party and other important players in South Africa's transition to democracy could approve a new constitution without returning to the multi-party negotiations, Reuter reports from Pretoria. 'My point of view is that all major role players must support the final result and the new constitution,' Mr de Klerk said. Asked if the process could be concluded without Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha returning to the talks it walked out of last month, Mr de Klerk said: 'One of the options could be that agreement could be negotiated in a process which is not necessarily concentrated around specifically one table.' Inkatha quit the talks on July 2, when the date of April 27 next year was set for the country's first all-race election. Chief Buthelezi said this was premature and criticised how decisions were taken at the talks. He has refused to send his delegation back to the negotiations but Inkatha has continued to hold bilateral meetings with the government and African National Congress. 'The election date can be reached, the formalities are not important,' Mr de Klerk said. 'In the final analysis a new constitution must have the support of all role players. We will be looking at all available options to ensure all agreements have the support of all major parties.'</p>

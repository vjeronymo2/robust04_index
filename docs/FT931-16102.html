			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Optimism over German move THE FRENCH franc apprec-iated above the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark yesterday after the Bundesbank announced a cut in its main money market dealing rates, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank did not lower any of its officially posted rates yesterday. But a 15 basis-point cut in the rate at which it offers fixed rate repurchase agreements, to 8.60 per cent, was hailed by some dealers as an extremely significant move. Some argued that it may have ensured that the franc avoids devaluation and that the European exchange rate mechanism will remain intact this year. 'This marks the passing of the peak of the pressures in the ERM,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, a currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. 'It is the first clear sign that, when pushed to the limit, the Bundesbank will act to support the French franc.' Other market participants were not as enthusiastic. A leading fund manager in London who had taken a particularly bearish view about the French franc's prospects, said he now felt 'a little more comfortable' about holding the currency. But he added: 'If there is no more easing in the repo rate within two weeks, the pressure on the system will return. Today's move has kept the pressure off for a week or two but no more.' The spontaneous reaction of currency dealers to the move was clearly positive. The franc rallied above the level of FFr3.40 to the D-Mark for the first time since Christmas, finishing at FFr3.3980. However, the prospects of the Irish punt avoiding a devaluation appeared to dealers to be even slimmer, in spite of the determination of Dublin's political leaders to hold the currency. At the end of ERM trading, the central bank raised overnight rates from 50 per cent to 100 per cent as the currency traded for the second day running below its ERM floor against the Belgian franc. How likely is the Bundesbank to ease policy again by the beginning of March? Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets believes the Bundesbank will await the outcome of talks on the German budget and the wage round talks over the next fortnight. She believes that, if the budget deal is resolved, an official rate cut could come at either of the council meetings being held on February 4 and 18. The strong dollar may bring residual pressure on the Bundesbank not to ease because of fears of imported inflation. Some dealers were at a loss to explain why the dollar did not break above DM1.6395 on a day that the Bundesbank eased and the weekly US jobless figure showed a drop to 291,000 in the week to December 26 from a total of 331,000 the week before. Rumours that the Bundesbank has been selling dollars in recent days because of inflationary concern could not be substantiated.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses find late support from bonds Encouraged by lower US retail sales and CPI data for May, European bond markets recovered from early lows yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Equities followed suit, but dealers were inclined to question the intraday rally, and strategists to remember the inflation arguments following this week's West German wholesale price data, up 0.5 per cent over April and far ahead of market expectations. FRANKFURT went to extremes in the pre-bourse, when the Ibis-indicated Dax index hit a low of 2,048.74, and after hours when it recovered to 2,088.44, 4.02 higher than on Monday evening. There were sizeable recoveries in the post-bourse, with Volkswagen at DM453.70, up DM15.70 from the day's low, and Thyssen, at DM280, up DM15. But Mr Detlev Klug, head of sales at B Metzler in Frankfurt, said the market was walking on thin ice. Arbitrageurs, he said, had been talking for a couple of days about taking the market down to 2,050; after they achieved that aim, the September bund future recovered from 91.54 to 92.30, and short covering took over in equities. On the day, volume recovered from DM5.8bn to DM9.7bn, but the daily figure covers the 24 hours until the official Frankfurt close at 13.30 local time. In that period, the Dax dropped 31.08 to 2,074.70. PARIS ended firmer, although the CAC-40 index drifted down to yet another low of 1,956 before US data prompted a return to strength. The index closed up 14.33 at 1,991.99. Turnover was nearly FFr4bn. There was activity in L'Oreal, the cosmetics group, following the announcement after hours on Monday that it was to purchase four of its distribution companies controlled by Nestle and Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of L'Oreal's founder, for FFr8.8bn. Analysts commented that the deal was likely to have a positive effect on earnings, and strengthen the group's presence in world markets. The shares rose FFr51 to FFr1,145, still 17.5 per cent down from the year's high recorded at the end of January. Pechiney, the aluminium producer, slipped FFr9 to FFr152.20 after forecasting that 1994 would be a difficult trading year, with improvement likely in 1995. AMSTERDAM found support after the US data, the AEX index, ending 0.30 down at 401.63 after a session low of 398.23. KPN remained very active on the second day of trading, encountering profit-taking after Monday's extremely busy performance. The stock lost 20 cents to Fl 50, but off the day's low of Fl 49.90, in volume of some 8m shares. KLM, up 80 cents at Fl 51.60, said that its present strategy was focused on alliances rather than a merger with another airline. MILAN lost 3.3 per cent as foreign investors raised cash ahead of the Mediobanca and Mondadori issues, although prices steadied late in the session as domestic funds returned as buyers. The Comit index registered a fall of 24.38 to 717.95, slightly below the 720 point level at which the market had been widely expected to find technical support. Mediobanca picked up L154 to L15,383 after Monday's 4 per cent slide which came as shareholders cleared the way for a rights issue to raise at least L1,500bn. Mondadori lost L860 to L18,500 ahead of news as the market closed that its issue had been priced at L15,000 a share, which was at the top end of expectations. Fiat fell L135 to L6,498 in volume of 33.5m shares amid reports of heavy selling by two Milan brokerages. ZURICH reduced some of its early losses in a technical rebound after Wall Street's firmer opening and the rally in US bonds. The SMI index finished 4.2 lower at 2,740.0. Roche certificates helped the tone, picking up from a low of SFr6,710 to finish SFr35 higher at SFr6,700 as BZ Bank launched 500,000 call warrants. Interest rate worries continued, however, to take their toll on the financial sector. CS Holding lost SFr6 to SFr575, while, among insurers, Winterthur bearers fell SFr15 to SFr720 and Zurich bearers were SFr11 lower at SFr1,369. MADRID's late upswing left the general index up 1.35 at 322.38 in turnover of Pta32.3bn. Volume was lifted by Telefonica, tipped by Prudential Securities and up Pta40 to Pta1,860 in nearly 6.4m shares. Endesa, up Pta140 at Pta6,350, also lifted the market. TEL AVIV fell 4.6 per cent after Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest commercial bank, predicted slower economic growth for the rest of the year. The Mishtanim index closed 8.63 lower at 176.88. ATHENS reversed five consecutive days of losses, rising 2.7 per cent as construction shares rebounded on expectations that the first inflows from the European Union's Delors II financial aid package would become available soon. The general index rose 21.98 to 847.35 in moderate volume of 1.2m shares as the more positive mood spilled over into other sectors. VIENNA was pulled down by weak bond and foreign equity markets, and further losses were expected ahead of Friday's option expiries. The ATX index fell 20.02 or 1.8 per cent to 1,072.78, with all 19 of its constituents falling. WARSAW tumbled another 9.4 per cent to its lowest level since last October, the Wig index falling 823.3 to 7,934.0, for a two day fall of 18.3 per cent. Dealers said that some late buying suggested that the two-day slide was losing momentum, although the worry remained that since trading remained dominated by short-term speculators, any gains might provoke a further sell-off.

Li, who is attending the ongoing session of the National  People's Congress (NPC) here as a deputy, said that a draft of  the law, which has been submitted to the NPC Law Committee for  revision, is expected to be submitted again to the NPC Standing  Committee for deliberation in April.    Li, who is also an economics professor of Beijing  University,  said that, despite repeated changes, the soon-to-be-enacted law  will always contain three principles: A tying of rights and  interests with shares, unified management of the securities  market, and opposition to such practices as illegal trading,  inside trading and procurement of shares through the abuse of  power. This, he said, is to ensure open and fair operation of  the securities market.    The Securities Law will have at least two "Chinese  characteristics," Li said, although, for the most part, it will  be compatible with internationally accepted practices.    The first characteristic will be that companies to issue  shares will be subject to approval by competent authorities as  well as to commonly-accepted practices.    The second will be a clear division between A-shares and B-  shares. "the securities authorities will formulate special  regulations on B-shares," Li Yining said.    According to Li, such stipulations are necessary because  China so far has a very small number of certified public  accountants for auditing.    Also, the inconvertibility of the Chinese yuan makes it  impossible for the two types of shares to merge, he noted.    "As China's economy grows and the Chinese currency becomes  convertible with the passage of time, a revision of the law is  possible after its enactment," he said.    The ultimate goal is to make the new law compatible with  internationally accepted practices and enable the Chinese  securities market to adapt to the global securities market," he  said.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Australia recovers at slow pace AUSTRALIA'S recovery from recession is under way, but the economy remains weak and growth over the remainder of the year is likely to be slow, government figures indicated yesterday. The quarterly national accounts showed that gross domestic product grew by 0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of March, following growth of 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, revised from 0.3 per cent. Further revisions, following the introduction of a new GDP measure, suggested that the economy stopped contracting in the three months to September, after five quarters of decline. The GDP figures follow the announcement on Monday of balance of payments data for April which showed a fall in the monthly current account deficit to ADollars 897m (Pounds 377m), seasonally adjusted, from a revised ADollars 992m in March. The deficit for the financial year at the end of June appears likely to total less than ADollars 12bn, compared to ADollars 15.7bn in 1990-91, and a record ADollars 21bn in the previous year. Economists say inflation is also likely to remain near the current level of 1.5 per cent for the rest of the calendar year. The improving economic outlook will boost the prospects of Mr Paul Keating's Labor government, which must hold a federal election by the middle of next year.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Observer: Back to the core Why has Max Chapman, Nomura's hard-hitting New York chief, cancelled his plans to come to London? Nomura's top management in Tokyo had been counting on the Chapman magic, which transformed the firm's sleepy New York operation into a significant Wall Street presence, to work similar wonders with its less-than-dazzling London outfit. The official version of events thereafter is that Chapman decided that running New York and London together would be a bit much - and might indeed jeopardise what he had achieved so far in America. Wall Street, however, believes that Chapman did not take the London job either because he asked for too much in the way of pay and perks, or because management in Tokyo suddenly got cold feet about bringing Chapman's loose and aggressive management style to London. Nomura insiders counter that a compensation package had already been agreed upon by both sides, and contend that his family's opposition to the move was a very significant factor in the volte face. Chapman must believe there is still plenty to occupy him in the Big Apple, for he has just renewed his contract. He could make a start by trying to recoup the losses sustained in the volatile markets of recent months.</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / From Russia with love: Nuclear smuggling has put the security of weapons material back in the political spotlight. FT writers assess the threat At the climax of the 1980s television thriller Edge of Darkness, a CIA agent breaks into a British nuclear fuel store and carries off a haul of plutonium in a Harrods bag. Life recently started to imitate art in a series of nuclear smuggling incidents centred on Germany. On August 10 two Spaniards and a Colombian were arrested following the seizure of a suitcase containing 300 to 350 grammes of plutonium at Munich airport on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow. It was the biggest find to date in a series of German discoveries of nuclear materials since 1990. That year, there were four finds: in 1993 there were 241. The smuggling has provoked a public political storm which is being used for electioneering purposes in Germany, has made Russia deny that there is a problem and has put nuclear security back on the agenda in the US. There have been claims and counter-claims about the importance of the finds. Some scientists in the former Soviet Union say that they are the tip of a plutonium iceberg, with impoverished Russian nuclear workers selling the raw materials for atomic weapons on an international black market. The Russian government initially claimed that the political row over the seizures was a plot by western countries to gain control of Russian nuclear stockpiles. On Wednesday, Mr Sergei Vasiliyev, spokesman for Russia's internal Counter-Intelligence Service, said: 'Not a single gram of plutonium-239 has gone missing from storage in Russia.' Official western statements have see-sawed between expressing concern at the smuggling and playing down the significance of the seizures so far. But even potential plutonium trafficking is worrying for the west. Nato foreign and defence ministers held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss the threat, following the funeral of Nato secretary-general Mr Manfred Worner. Behind the scenes, officials in most countries agree that more must be done to make Russian nuclear materials secure, before large amounts of plutonium find their way into the hands of would-be nuclear weapons states or international terrorist groups. The security of Russian nuclear stocks is questionable. The country has over 130 tonnes of military-grade plutonium which could be used to make more than 16,000 atomic bombs larger than that which destroyed Hiroshima. As a result of nuclear weapons reduction treaties, Russia is dismantling almost 10,000 nuclear warheads and returning the plutonium to store, where it is easier to steal. It also has a much larger pile of highly enriched uranium and civil reactor-grade plutonium - which are harder to detonate but are still extremely hazardous. Exactly how much civil nuclear material Russia has is unknown - even government experts probably do not have an accurate measure. The difficulty of accurate nuclear accounting is not restricted to Moscow - last year US energy secretary Mrs Hazel O'Leary revealed for the first time the amount of military plutonium the US had produced, but had to correct the figure upwards by one and a half tonnes because of a series of accounting errors. One and a half tonnes of plutonium is enough to make 190 nuclear bombs. There is little doubt that Russia has similar, and probably worse, accounting problems. That creates the loopholes which people with a motive can exploit. For example, Russian nuclear scientists, used to high status and a good standard of living in the old Soviet system, have seen their income slide. The temptation to make a fortune by smuggling plutonium is strong. Stopping this flow of plutonium is the first priority for western officials. Nuclear scientists say the three plants in Russia capable of manufacturing weapons-grade plutonium are near Chelyabinsk, south of Moscow, and the Siberian outposts of Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk, and much of the weapons material is stored there. However, it is more likely that any pilfered plutonium would have come from nuclear stockpiles or research laboratories, rather than direct from the plants themselves. The German authorities believe one stash of plutonium could have come from the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, which is primarily a research centre. Keeping track of all this material requires modern western bar coding and computerised stock systems. The Russian government has made some attempts to tighten controls, but scientists have long recognised that nuclear accounting was inadequate. In March 1992, Mr Gennadi Novikov, head of nuclear safety at the Chelyabinsk-70 plant, warned of a drastic decline in security standards: 'The technical safety of nuclear weapons has remained the same. But safety in the broader sense, taking into account the political and psychological situation, has plummeted.' Morale has slumped and supervision of materials is lax. Not only are there risks that bomb-making materials may be stolen, but weapons scientists are being encouraged to work on nuclear programmes abroad. Mr Vladimir Kruchenkov, deputy executive director of the International Science and Technology Centre in Moscow, says he has heard of approaches - not necessarily for military purposes - from China, Syria and North Korea. Efforts are being made to stem the flow of both experts and material. The US has been working with Russia to try to ensure that the stockpile of nuclear material remains in safe hands. A portion of US financial aid to the republics of the former Soviet Union is set aside to help with dismantling old nuclear weapons. The US has agreed to help construct a Russian storage facility for surplus plutonium and enriched uranium. In addition, the US Enrichment Corporation, a spin-off from the US Department of Energy, has a contract with Russia's ministry of atomic energy to take highly enriched uranium from warheads and degrade it so that it can be used for civilian purposes but not bombs. The US has also offered Russia Dollars 30m for immediate improvements in security and accounting of nuclear materials in Russia. Russia is co-operating with western governments to counter the threat of a brain-drain of Russian nuclear scientists. This March, the European Union, Japan, Russia and the US set up the International Science and Technology Centre in Moscow to redirect Russian nuclear scientists into more peaceful pursuits, such as medical research and nuclear waste management. The centre has now approved 54 projects committing Dollars 30m to sponsor 3,000 scientists over the next three years. But more needs to be done, according to western officials if the potential black market in stolen plutonium is to be prevented. They think there is still time to resolve the problem. So far, much of the smuggled material has been of limited use, such as the fragment of a nuclear reactor fuel rod seized in Munich, or the speck of plutonium found in Bremen, which probably came from a smoke detector and was of no conceivable weapons use. Nevertheless, some plutonium, deadly even in tiny quantities, is getting through. A terrorist group could cause heavy casualties with only a few grammes of the material. As well as the direct nuclear threat, the smuggling has produced political fall-out in Germany, Russia and the US. In Germany, the recent finds of weapons-grade plutonium have caused alarm and embarrassed the Russian authorities into denials of responsibility. In turn, the Russians' attempt to deny the problem has caused concern among officials in Washington and Bonn, who fear that little progress can be made while Russia is on the defensive. Much of the aggressive Russian rhetoric may be public posturing for a domestic audience. Less obviously, Russia has offered co-operation with the German authorities. President Boris Yeltsin, holidaying in southern Russia, has written to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl assuring him of assistance. Russia's foreign ministry has been at pains to reinforce that message. Such reassurance has eased fears in Washington that Russia is ignoring its nuclear responsibilities. This week's discoveries have put the security of nuclear supplies back on the political agenda; the subject will be discussed at the summit meeting between US President Bill Clinton and Mr Yeltsin next month. Until then, the US seems happy to let Germany take the lead. The German response has, understandably, been vigorous. Even before Mr Yeltsin's letter arrived, Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the chancellor's security adviser, was packing his bags for Moscow. He had evidence intended to prove that plutonium and other radioactive materials seized from smugglers and illicit dealers on German soil bore chemical fingerprints identifying their Russian origin. There has also been plenty of public comment. Regional politicians and legal officials have been airing their opinions on the dangers to the German population from the 'Russian atomic mafia'. In part such exchanges are only political posturing ahead of the German federal elections in October. The smuggling crisis gives the Social Democratic opposition a chance to air its anti-nuclear views, while Chancellor Kohl's governing Christian Democrats can prove they are tough on Russian organised crime. Several claims made by the government seem to have seriously overstated the danger of some of the material being found. Nevertheless, Germany will press for more powers for European police agency Europol at next month's informal meeting of foreign ministers. The forthright response by German politicians and the media is upsetting the Russians. 'They talk about things they don't understand, this is unpleasant and upsets the Russians,' said a German diplomat. Privately, German and US officials agree it is important to smooth ruffled Russian feathers. Russia will accept help to build further safe stores and more sophisticated inventory controls, provided the west is not seen to be forcing Russia's co-operation. Ultimately, getting additional safeguards in place will require bilateral negotiations between Washington and Moscow. Most agree that the Clinton administration has made a good, if slow start to tackling the long-term challenge of nuclear security. Even Senator Richard Lugar, a senior Republican spokesman on defence, acknowledges as much. 'I think the Clinton administration has accomplished a great deal . . . If we had not come to a point of very substantial conversation, negotiation and control, then the proliferation problem would be out of hand. As it is, it is controllable.' One question, however, remains. Can the bureaucrats in suits act fast enough to thwart the mafia with its suitcases? If not, the threat of rogue nuclear weapons appearing throughout the world will loom much larger.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 9 May, Kang Yong-hun, president of the ROK  National Red Cross, proposed resuming North-South Red Cross  talks to North Korea to exchange visiting groups of separated  families and elderly parents and resolve the overall separated  families issues.    President Kang Yong-hun asked the North Korean authorities  to  return approximately 400 persons who had been detained in North  Korea, including the crew of the Tongjin boat and those of  civilian airplanes, to their families' embraces. He proposed  this during a speech to today's meeting marking the Day of  International Red Cross.    He also said that reuniting members of separated families is  a moral issue that transcends differences in ideology and  systems and is a central point of humanitarianism. He also said  that the North and South Red Cross Societies must start  consultations on this matter as soon as possible.    President Kang Yong-hun also said that Ham Se-hwan and Kim  In-so, whom North Korea had asked the ROK to return, are not  POW's but ROK citizens. He also said that demanding their  repatriation is not in compliance with Red Cross humanitarianism.</p>

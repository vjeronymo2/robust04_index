"It is simply an erroneous analysis, it is not true," Klaus  said in the interview broadcast Monday [10 January]. He said  this view is being voiced not only in the Czech Republic but  often also in other post-communist countries which are slightly  envious of the results the Czech Republic has achieved. No  dramatic change as regards unemployment and bankrupts would take  place, Klaus said, adding that this would be a continual  process. "We are naturally expecting a certain increase in  unemployment but it will be tenths of a percent, but not ten  percent -- the difference between unemployment in the Czech  Republic and, for example, in Poland," Klaus said.    He expressed satisfaction that U.S. President Bill Clinton  would visit Central Europe and especially Prague. "This is an  important symbol," Klaus said.</p>

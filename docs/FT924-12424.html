			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost controls help McKechnie gain 21% TIGHT COST controls helped McKechnie, the restructured international plastic and metal components group, increase pre-tax profits by 21 per cent to Pounds 24.1m in the year to the end of July. The West Midlands-based group, which in the previous year sold its European metals businesses for Pounds 54m, said the result had been achieved in spite of the recession continuing to affect most of its markets - and deepening in some areas. Mr Vanni Treves, chairman, said: 'There is as yet little sign of recovery in our major markets and we do not anticipate one before our next financial year at the earliest.' Turnover fell by 5 per cent to Pounds 286m, although sales by continuing businesses were constant. Profit before interest rose 3 per cent to Pounds 24.5m, but the underlying improvement from operating sources was a gain of 11 per cent, reflecting increased margins and non-operating gains made in the prior year. In spite of higher capital expenditure of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 14.3m), the group said strong cashflow had eliminated gearing. Interest payable fell from Pounds 3.75m to Pounds 415,000. Sales of plastics increased slightly to Pounds 142.5m, in spite of a 12 per cent drop in turnover from the vehicle components' division. However, restructuring and technology costs reduced pre-interest profits from Pounds 10.3m to Pounds 8.5m. Although sales in consumer products were down 7 per cent to Pounds 48.7m, profit before interest was up 8 per cent, from Pounds 5m to Pounds 5.4m. Specialist products saw turnover fall as a result of prior year disposals, but improved pre-interest profit by 26 per cent, from Pounds 8.4m to Pounds 10.6m. There was a substantial profit recovery by the Pacific metals companies as a result of cost reductions and better margins, rather than higher volumes, and this improvement was expected to continue. Earnings per share rose to 20.7p (17p). An unchanged final dividend of 9.75p maintains the total at 14.75p. COMMENT Having focused on plastics, McKechnie has done well to squeeze costs and improve margins in adverse trading conditions. The group wants to make acquisitions in continental Europe and North America, but has been deterred by the prices asked. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m next year put the shares, up 6p to 326p, on a multiple of 14.5. They seem fairly priced given the immediate outlook, but investors looking for a longer-term recovery play might be attracted by the clean balance sheet and deftness the management has demonstrated in following its stated strategy.</p>

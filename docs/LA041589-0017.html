			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GARLAND FINISHES WHAT HE STARTS TO WIN  </P> <P> Brandon Garland's was thinking about compromise, his shoulder was still stiff  and he had butterflies in his stomach. All were the result of not pitching  enough this season.  </P> <P> Garland, who went the distance for host Clairemont Friday in a 5-4 City Western  League victory over University City (4-11, 2-3), hasn't been the starting  pitcher since the first game of the season. A shoulder injury had kept him in  left field, clearly his second-favorite position.  </P> <P> Garland (1-1) got the call from his coach, Dave Buttles, because of his strong  relief appearance Wednesday against Kearny, when he struck out the only two  batters he faced to pick up a save.  </P> <P> Garland, a senior right-hander, decided he would just throw fastballs in the  first inning Friday to test his shoulder. Turned out to be decent strategy; he  allowed nine hits to earn the victory.  </P> <P> Staying with the basics in the first inning helped.  </P> <P> "I said, 'Well, Brandon, one inning is not much to sacrifice for seven,' "  Garland said. "They didn't hit one ball solid on me."  </P> <P> Of course, Clairemont wasn't exactly a terror at the plate either. The  Chieftains (8-8, 4-2) had four hits, including a first-inning, first-pitch home  run by Antoine Henry and a timely sixth-inning double by Jesus Jauregui.  </P> <P> Clairemont trailed, 4-1, going in to the bottom of the sixth. Two University  City errors gave Jauregui the opportunity to win it. He fouled off three  curveballs before driving a fastball to left, scoring the tying and winning  runs.  </P> <P> A half-inning later, Garland finished the job.  </P> <P> "He was throwing the ball a lot harder," Buttles said, "but I think he tried to  come back a little too soon."  </P> <P> Garland, seeking a college scholarship to play baseball next year, is learning  new pitches, including a forkball. He has the tools, Buttles said. He just  needs to set his mind to the game a bit more.  </P> <P> "The biggest thing with Brandon is between the ears," Buttles said. "He's the  kind of guy you have to pump up all the time. He has got a lot of potential.  But he just has got to work harder. In his mind he's working hard. But in my  mind it's not hard enough."

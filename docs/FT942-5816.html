			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sweden tries to halt Norway's oil drilling Sweden yesterday called on Norway not to proceed with plans to drill oil exploration wells in the Norwegian sector of the Skagerrak, saying the project could damage its fisheries and tourism industries and threaten its rugged west coast. The plan to allow four exploration wells in the Skagerrak is part of a wider project to increase offshore exploration acreage by 16 per cent in a bid to offset a steep decline in crude oil production expected after 1996 by Norway. The proposals are due to be voted on by the Norwegian Storting by June 15. But opposition is also mounting within the parliament to allowing any drilling in the Skagerrak, about 50km off the southern Norwegian coast. Environmentalists and fishermen have rallied support for their objections, despite the government's intention to restrict drilling to one well at a time and to bar drilling during the summer prawn harvest. Opposition has been voiced from within the ranks of the minority ruling Labour party as well as by the chief opposition parties and the state pollution control authority.</p>

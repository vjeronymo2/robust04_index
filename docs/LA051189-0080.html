			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SEC ALTERS RULES ON ARBITRATION SYSTEM;  </P> <P> CHANGES INTENDED TO ENSURE FAIRNESS IN SETTLING INVESTOR DISPUTES  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday approved rule changes  designed to make the securities industry's arbitration system more fair to  disgruntled customers.  </P> <P> By a 5-0 vote, the commission authorized a series of changes, spurred by  complaints from unhappy investors who discovered after the October, 1987, stock  crash that they had signed away their right to sue their brokers.  </P> <P> Many firms, in the fine print in paper work required to open an account,  require customers to agree in advance to settle any disputes through  industry-administered arbitration proceedings, rather than through the courts.  </P> <P> The SEC, under the new rule effective in 120 days, will require firms to  highlight and fully explain arbitration clauses so investors know what they're  signing.  </P> <P> Arbitration, because it is cheaper and faster than suing in court, is a good  deal for many investors, particularly those with small claims. But there is  only a limited right of appeal and some investors may be better off in court.  </P> <P> The commission decided against an outright ban of the clauses. Some members  were reluctant to dictate the terms of contracts entered into by private  parties.  </P> <P> Also, brokerage firm executives had argued that banning the clauses could  destroy the arbitration system and push more cases onto the nation's already  crowded court dockets.  </P> <P> In explaining the commission's decision not to ban the clauses, SEC Chairman  David S. Ruder said enough firms offer cash accounts without arbitration  clauses that investors still have access to the market even if they want to  keep their right to go to court. However, he warned that the SEC will be  checking to see if more firms start using arbitration clauses.  </P> <P> The rules governing arbitration have become increasingly critical after a  Supreme Court decision in 1987 that upheld the validity of arbitration clauses.  Also, the number of arbitration cases has mushroomed from 830 in 1980 to 6,101  last year.  </P> <P> The SEC, in adopting the changes, acted on proposals from the New York Stock  Exchange, the American Stock Exchange and the National Assn. of Securities  Dealers.  </P> <P> "I think they will make the arbitration process better . . . and clear up some  of the perception problems that have nagged the system," said commission member  Charles Cox.  </P> <P> Another important change requires the exchanges to keep track of the amounts of  arbitration awards, the amounts originally sought, the issues in dispute and  the brokers and firms involved.  </P> <P> "We now for the first time really will be in a position to effectively monitor  the arbitration process," Commissioner Mary Schapiro said.  </P> <P> Other changes are aimed at ensuring that the "public" members of arbitration  panels do not have ties to the securities industry, that arbitrators disclose  any ties that may affect their decisions and that arbitrators get more power to  compel brokers and plaintiffs to turn over relevant documents in a timely  manner.  </P></p>

Samraong District, which is the seat of Oddar Meanchey  Province, was attacked and destroyed by the people on the night  of 24 January.    Samraong District, which is the seat of Oddar Meanchey  Province, which is the hotbed of corruption of the Vietnamese  communist puppet ringleaders and Nhoek Bunchhai's group, was  attacked and destroyed by 2,000 people. Samraong, the  provincial seat of Oddar Meanchey, which is the frontline  command post of the Vietnamese communist puppet army and field  headquarters of Ke Kumyan, Pol Saroeun, Prum Samen, Long  Sopheap, Eng Sopheap, Nhoek Bunchhai and a number of other  generals with second-hand stars on their shoulders, was attacked  and smashed by 2,000 people in and around Samraong on the night  of 24 January. As a result of this people's attack, General  Long Sopheap, commander of the 4th Military Region in Siem Reap;  Gen. Prum Samen, representative of Vietnamese communist puppets'  General Staff; Gen. Nhoek Bunchhai, who got his stars as a favor  from the Americans; Eng Sopheap, Army commander and governor of  Oddar Meanchey Province; and all other Vietnamese communist  puppet ringleaders fled in disarray. Many were wounded.    This is a punishment that the general public meted out to  the  evil puppet ringleaders serving the Vietnamese communists and  the alliance. This is a great event, clearly proving that the  people will not allow the evil Vietnamese communist puppet  ringleaders to continue serving the Vietnamese communists in  waging war to kill our nation and people.</p>

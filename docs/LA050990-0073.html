			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> CHATSWORTH OPENS WITH EASY WIN  </P> <P> The Chatsworth High boys' volleyball team is ranked No. 1 in the City Section  after winning the West Valley League title this season. And it took only 55  minutes Tuesday to show Gardena why the Chancellors have earned the honor.  </P> <P> Behind the strong hitting of senior outside hitter Ryan Labovitch and junior  middle blocker Gene Urcan, Chatsworth overpowered Gardena, 15-5, 15-9, 15-1, in  the first round of the 4-A Division playoffs at Chatsworth.  </P> <P> "They have some great players," Gardena Coach Marshall Jones said. "They really  impressed me with the most polished offense I've seen from a high school team  this season."  </P> <P> Chatsworth (13-1), the defending 4-A champion, played a near-perfect passing  game and served almost flawlessly, misfiring once.  </P> <P> Gardena had problems early with missed kill attempts and inconsistent passing.  </P> <P> "In the first game we were really nervous, a little jitterish," Jones said.  "But in the middle of the second game we realized that if we pulled our passing  together, we could play with them."  </P> <P> In the second game, the Chancellors faltered slightly after taking a 9-0 lead.  Inconsistent setting forced six sideouts.  </P> <P> Gardena (7-8), seeded 16th, scored eight consecutive points to cut the deficit  to 9-8 with help from John Won (three kills in the game) and Scott Ikegami  (nine assists).  </P> <P> "I think our enthusiasm dropped a little in that game," Labovitch said. "We  played down to their level and we can't do that."  </P> <P> But the Chancellors took a 5-1 lead in the third game before scoring 10  unanswered points.  </P> <P> From the begining, the Mohicans had problems hitting over Chatsworth blockers.  On average, Urcan (seven kills, eight blocks) and Craig Hewitt held a 5  1/2-inch height advantage and had 10 more blocks than their Gardena  counterparts (14-4).  </P> <P> Hewitt finished the match with six blocks and five kills. Junior setter Dan  Choi had 13 assists, Labovitch had nine kills and Scott Yager had nine assists.  </P> <P> "I wasn't surprised by the outcome of the game," Chatsworth Coach Steve West  said. "We went in ready to play hard. I expect to win (the City Section title)  again. NAOMI TWARD  </P></p>

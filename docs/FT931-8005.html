			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Dumping study set to provoke row: Report commissioned by Hills likely to embarrass Clinton administration A WIDE-RANGING study of the possible cost to the US economy of anti-dumping actions, commissioned as one of the final acts of Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, appears set to provoke a storm of controversy among protected US industries, and embarrassment for the new Clinton administration. The demand for the study was described by one senior US trade official as 'potentially nuclear' in its implications, pitching powerful domestic industries such as cars, steel and textiles against US exporters and consumers, all of whom have to pay higher prices because of such duties. It could embarrass President Bill Clinton, who has come under strong pressure from domestic industry lobbies to use dumping laws fully to protect US companies against 'unfair competition'. Mrs Hills told the International Trade Commission, the administration's main trade protection body, that she had called for the study because of the 'considerable public debate' stirred recently over the economic effects of anti-dumping duties and linked import restraints. Studies by the World Bank, and in the US by the Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution, have concluded that anti-dumping actions - duties and fines against alleged sales of products at below-cost prices  - represent a creeping protectionism which is raising costs and hurting US competitiveness rather than helping the US economy. Adding to possible controversy between advocates and opponents of dumping actions, the letter was sent just five days before Mrs Hills stepped down from office a month ago, and was not received by Mr Don Newquist, chairman of the ITC, until January 25 - five days after she was succeeded by Mr Mickey Kantor, Mr Clinton's appointee. To avoid being countermanded by Mr Kantor, ITC commissioners have asked him to confirm that he is willing to endorse Mrs Hills' instructions. He is expected to do so, but will be under pressure to ensure the study also takes note of domestic industries' arguments on the supposed advantages of dumping laws. Users of products subject to dumping duties often complain they result in higher costs, making it harder to remain internationally competitive. Controversy has been heightened in recent months following the US imposition of dumping duties on steel exporters from 19 countries, and threats to impose them on motor vehicle imports. Mrs Hills called for a study of 'the net economic welfare of the US' arising from dumping and countervailing duty actions. She required an examination of effects on: Industries which have petitioned for protection; The income and employment of US workers; US consumers - from shoppers to companies that use affected products as inputs to other production; US parts and components producers. The study must be completed by January 1995, and is among the most ambitious ever demanded of the ITC. Its studies are normally highly specific. For example, one recent study examined imports of durum wheat, while a current study is looking at mackerel imports. Trade experts in Washington were uncertain last week about Mrs Hills' exact motives for leaving the Clinton administration such an explosive study. Some argued it might be in deference to those ITC commissioners who have become concerned that anti-dumping laws are being used increasingly as a weapon of first resort by recession-pressed US industry. Trade lawyers were uncertain last week whether the study would escape subversion by the many powerful lobby groups in Washington.</p>

The negotiations will mostly concern  exporting plants for producing general-purpose plastic resins as  well as ethylene, which is the basic material for making resins  with. The negotiations are discussing plants for producing  about 1 million tons converted into ethylene.    A joint government-industry feasibility study mission will  present a specific concept to the Chinese Government on 7 March.  The MITI plans to back up the export of the petrochemical plants  by making available credits from the Japan Export and Import  Bank and by providing technological assistance through official  development assistance (ODA) programs. The ministry wants to  make this project a new theme in Japan's assistance to China,  while hoping that this will help the Japanese petrochemical  industry facilitate its lagging rationalization programs and  reorganize itself.    There have been instances of U.S. steel manufacturers  exporting their steel production plants to China, but these  deals have been made at the private-sector level, and this will  be the first such example of government-to-government industrial  cooperation. Many Asian nations are now hurrying to expand  their steel and chemical industries, and it is likely that this  will be a model case for production bases being moved out of  Japan.    The MITI sent a joint government-industry mission to China  on  3 March. The industry is represented by seven major chemical  companies including Showa Denko, Mitsui Petrochemical  Industries, and the Sumitomo Chemical Company, plus several  major trading companies. The mission will present on 7 March  Japan's concept to officials of such Chinese Government offices  concerned as the State Planning Commission and the China  National Petrochemical Corporation.    In China, in step with its growing economy, the demand for  petrochemical products such as plastics and packing materials is  growing fast, but China's annual domestic ethylene production  capacity is now only 2.27 million tons. While annual imports of  petrochemical products run to 1.7 million tons converted into  ethylene, the shortages of facilities are only worsening.    On the other hand, Japan, which has an annual ethylene  production capacity of 7 million tons, has the problem of excess  supply. As a result of decreased demand from the auto industry  and the home electric-appliance industry caused by the economic  recession, the total domestic demand has fallen to about 5  million tons, thus creating an excess capacity of nearly 2  million tons. As such, the MITI has come to believe that the  excess capacity should be reduced by exporting some facilities  to China.    According to the concept of the MITI, plants for producing a  total of 1 million tons -- translated into that amount of  ethylene -- will eventually be exported to China. Specifically,  plants owned by some Japanese chemical companies will be  dismantled and then will be exported -- for reassembly in China  -- at low prices as part of economic cooperation programs.  Low-interest loans from the Japan Export and Import Bank will  be made available as funds for purchasing the plants. The  plants transferred will receive the benefit of technological  cooperation under ODA programs, and technicians will be sent to  China to train Chinese technicians in plant operations and  maintenance.    The mission will also propose to make the business of  producing ethylene using the transferred plants a joint venture  project between Japan and China. The idea is to turn the  business into a government-industry joint project by using funds  from the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund as well as  investment by private Japanese companies. The ministry wants to  export several sets of plants -- most of them for producing  ethylene.    The MITI has already sounded out Japan's major manufacturers  on this concept, and the manufacturers are taking the position  of accepting it. The export deal is expected to be finalized  within this year. The plants under consideration for export are  those at the Chiba industrial complex, where Mitsui  Petrochemical Industries, the Maruzen Petrochemical Company, and  the Sumitomo Chemical Company have their production operations;  in the Mizushima industrial complex (in Kurashiki city), which  is operated by the Asahi Chemical Industry Company and  Mitsubishi Petrochemicals; and in the Kawazaki industrial  complex operated by the Tonen Chemical Company and the Japan  Petrochemical Company.</p>

			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S MUSIC MASTER  </P> <P> Jerome Kern may have been carried away by an excess of enthusiasm when he paid  his now-familiar tribute to Irving Berlin -- he "has no place in American  music; he is American music" -- but the overstatement from one professional to  another could at least be plausibly defended. For in the history of American  popular music no composer ever succeeded so often, so accurately, so memorably  in catching the moods of successive eras and expressing in such apt words and  music what people felt and thought and wanted to say and hear. Berlin was a  craftsman of prodigious talent and staggering output. His colleague Sammy Cahn  once suggested that a songwriter could feel gratified if, after 50 years of  work, he had produced a half-dozen immediately identifiable tunes. Berlin, he  said, had written 60. The word "standard," referring to songs that remain  favorites generation after generation, might well have been coined just to  describe Berlin's works.  </P> <P> Artists are rewarded for the pleasures they provide. They are cherished when  what they have created endures and continues to delight. The comedian George  Carlin once satirically described the ephemeral and forgettable nature of most  contemporary pop music -- "Yesterday at the top of the charts, today a golden  oldie!" Many of Berlin's 1,500 published songs were inevitably of transitory  interest, but among them is a catalogue of classics whose astonishing freshness  and appeal assures that they will never be thought of as relics of an earlier  age. These are songs -- "Always," "Blue Skies," "Easter Parade," "White  Christmas," "Let's Face the Music and Dance," among scores of others -- that  are likely to be performed for as long as American music lasts.  </P> <P> Berlin led a remarkably creative life, and lived an almost classic American  success story. An immigrant whose family fled the pogroms of czarist Russia,  with virtually no formal schooling and utterly without musical training, he won  fame and riches simply through the overwhelming assertion of his prolific  talent. Irving Berlin died the other day at the age of 101. For the better part  of his life he was a musical legend. The legacy of that life provides a lasting  gift to his country.  </P></p>

			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: UK MPs praise business world's 'golden triangle' BRITISH businesses are ignoring great opportunities in the 'golden triangle' of Hong Kong, Taiwan and south China, according to a British MPs' report. Taiwan offered even more opportunities for foreign contractors than Hong Kong's second airport project which had aroused considerable interest among UK contractors. Taiwan's six-year plan to improve its infrastructure was worth 25 times as much as the airport project, the report said. The report is by the UK parliamentary select committee on trade and industry, chaired by Mr Kenneth Warren, former MP for Hastings and Rye. Mr Warren described the region as the 'largest building site in the world'. The report is optimistic about the future of Hong Kong after it reverts to Chinese control in 1997. Britain tended to see 1997 as the end of an era, whereas other Europeans saw it as the start of an era in which Hong Kong would be the best place in China to do business, said Lord Young, chairman of Cable &amp; Wireless and subsidiary Hong Kong Telecom, who gave evidence. The Hong Kong authority responsible for building and operating the colony's new airport has been given provisional authority to borrow HKDollars 23.3bn (Pounds 1.67bn) to help finance the construction of the airport, though it will take months before it is ready to approach the world's capital markets, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. The authority said it would be seeking the longest-term financing that was available from the market.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: CAUGHT IN COMMON DENOMINATOR  </P> <P> Innocents turned loose in Continental restaurants have been known to blithely  order steak tartare and then, when served, to exclaim to the waiter "But I  didn't order it raw!"  </P> <P> There's a Japanese eatery named Katsu in Old California Restaurant Row, the  sizable restaurant village in San Marcos, that evidently takes a wary view of  plying its customers with too much raw fish. The separate sushi menu blares the  fact that 70% of the sushi is garnished with cooked items and makes the  practice seem both a virtue and an accommodation of timid tastes.  </P> <P> Most Californians are sufficiently versed in the ways of Japanese cuisine to  know that sushi does not, in any case, specifically denote raw fish; these  little bundles of sweetened rice can be garnished with any sort of tidbit,  including, but not limited to, raw or cooked seafood.  </P> <P> Katsu's "you can play it safe" approach takes the challenge out of ordering  sushi, although the list is amazingly comprehensive and runs from all the  usuals to things like tuna and octopus marinated in chili sauce; a Philadelphia  sushi of lox and cream cheese; a tempura roll that combines a variety of  seafoods with omelet and avocado, and a seaweed cone rolled around a filling of  halibut, smelt roe, asparagus and white sauce. All cooked varieties can be  rolled inside a fried crepe for an additional 50 cents.  </P> <P> But, although the selection is grand, the preparation is heavy-handed; the  sushi bar seems more interested in impressing diners with size than delicacy.  Simple tuna rolls were too large to be eaten at a single bite, and sushi filled  with salted cucumber had been so loosely packed that it fell apart on the  plate.  </P> <P> The dinner menu runs to less length but is no less aggressive in its efforts to  please every taste and create a sort of common denominator variant on  traditional Japanese cuisine. The entree list even includes fish blackened in  the so-called Cajun style and sauteed squid steaks in a wine-butter sauce.  </P> <P> Boat-shaped wooden platters, served for two or more and described with such  names as Love Boat and Fantasy Boat, are stuffed from prow to stern with vast  collections of such items as steak and chicken teriyaki, sashimi and tempura.  They make a good choice for the truly ravenous and seem, because of the sheer  quantity they contain, bargain priced.  </P> <P> Diners who opt to jump ship and order from the simpler side of the menu have  the option of any of 12 combination plates, all of which include either  vegetarian tempura or one that includes a few shrimp in the mix. The tempura  lacked flavor -- both the batter and the soy-based dipping sauce seemed  tasteless.  </P> <P> Indelicacy -- the opposite of what one would expect at a Japanese restaurant --  seemed the general rule for the entrees.  </P> <P> A serving of salmon teriyaki was both dry and hard. A New York sirloin teriyaki  came off better, although the kitchen would have done well to trim it of fat,  an operation most difficult to achieve at table when using chopsticks. The beef  in a serving of sukiyaki was thickly sliced, tough, dry and similarly edged in  fat. The best things about the dish were the tender, transparent noodles and  the sweet broth.  </P> <P> The restaurant takes the style of a Japanese country inn and depends for this  motif upon a heavy, beamed wooden ceiling from which hang immense paper  lanterns. Despite the cavernous qualities of the dining room, the noise level  is within the comfort range, as is the informal mood.  </P> <P> KATSU  </P> <P> San Marcos, 1020 W. San Marcos Blvd.  </P> <P> Calls: 744-7156.  </P> <P> Hours: Lunch and dinner served daily Tuesday through Sunday; closed Mondays.  </P> <P> Cost: Dinner for two, including a glass of wine each, tax and tip, $20 to $45.  Credit cards accepted.  </P></p>

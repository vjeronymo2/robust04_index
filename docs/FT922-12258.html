			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (14): Payphones for all sorts IT'S SECOND time lucky for GPT Payphone Systems. Last year, it won the Queen's Award for Technology, and this year the company - 60 per cent owned by GEC and 40 per cent by Siemens of Germany - received the award for its exports. More than 70 per cent of the payphones produced at its factory in Chorley, Lancashire, are destined for overseas markets. These phones are sold to more than 50 countries, including Kuwait, China, the US and Australia. In addition to the payphones - all sorts of coin, smart and credit card phones - the company supplies the payphone cards. Use of these has rocketed - GPT's output is nearing the 100m mark. The company's cashless calling system, which won the award last year, allows telephone calls from payphones without using coins. Standard credit and banker's cards may be used and the billing is charged to the user's credit card, banker's card or telephone account.</p>

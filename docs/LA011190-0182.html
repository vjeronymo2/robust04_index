			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> $25-MILLION WEST L.A. FIRE CALLED ARSON  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Fire Department said Wednesday that arson was the cause of a  fire that spread from a condominium construction site to an exclusive  neighborhood in West Los Angeles on Dec. 23, causing at least $25 million in  damage and forcing 150 people from their homes.  </P> <P> "We've eliminated all possible reasons for an accidental cause of the fire,"  Battalion Chief Lon Purcell said of the fire at the Devonhill Condominiums,  which began at about 3:30 a.m. Purcell said he could not discuss the evidence  found at the site of the fire at the intersection of Devon Avenue and Wilshire  Boulevard.  </P> <P> But a source familiar with the investigation, who asked not to be identified,  said investigators smelled gasoline at the site of the blaze in the partially  completed condominium project. The source also said witness statements after  the fire were consistent with a fire fed by a large quantity of fuel spread  over the ground.  </P> <P> Some witnesses said they heard an explosion, while others reported a loud  "whoosh." When they looked outside, they said, the flames already were reaching  the top of the four-story structure, which is consistent with a fire that was  intentionally set, the source said.  </P> <P> Whipped by Santa Ana winds, the fire hopscotched along Wilshire Boulevard and  into nearby neighborhoods, damaging 15 buildings. Although the initial  assessment of the damage was placed at $25 million, Fire Department officials  said the figure could go as high as $40 million.  </P> <P> Purcell said the department has identified no suspects and the source said the  department does not even have strong suspicions.  </P> <P> There was a security guard on duty the night of the fire, but he said he saw  nothing and passed a lie detector test, the source said. The source said,  however, there was "significant opposition" to the building in the surrounding  area, although he did not say what that opposition was based upon.  </P> <P> Also, the source said, "there had been a lot of labor problems" at the job  site. Some workers had been laid off recently, according to the source. That  contrasted with the public statements of construction officials at the site,  who said they knew of no labor trouble.  </P> <P> The source said the Fire Department learned that the fire was suspicious early  in the investigation, but delayed announcing the cause. Fire officials were  cautious because of criticism the department received for its handling of two  other high-profile fires, the source added.  </P> <P> In both fires -- a $22-million blaze at the Los Angeles Public Library and one  that destroyed the historic Pan Pacific Auditorium -- suspects were arrested  and then released for insufficient evidence.  </P> <P> The department felt unfairly treated in those incidents, claiming that in the  case of the Pan Pacific fire it had been pressured by the mayor's office to  announce the confession of a man whose attorney later said would "confess to  killing President Roosevelt if you asked him."  </P></p>

The  prime minister's discussions centered around the construction of  the (Lawari Tob) tunnel, to link Pakistan with Central Asia  through Tajikistan; the establishment of rail and road links  between Pakistan and Central Asia, to enhance global trade;  setting up an industrial estate in Pakistan; and financing  private thermal power units in Pakistan.    The Swedish prime minister, who met with Ms. Benazir Bhutto  in Davos yesterday, discussed the expansion of bilateral  cooperation. He expressed interest in possible investment in the  (Lawari Tob) tunnel project, because this could greatly expand  global trade with the regions of the former Soviet Union. Ms.  Benazir Bhutto invited Swedish investors to invest in power  plants in Pakistan.    Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, during his meeting  with the prime minister, emphasized his country's strong  interest in investing in rail and road projects between Pakistan  with Central Asia. Ms. Benazir Bhutto offered to let Singapore  establish an industrial estate in Pakistan to help its  industrial growth. Both leaders agreed to identify an effective  means for transferring technology from Singapore to Pakistan.</p>

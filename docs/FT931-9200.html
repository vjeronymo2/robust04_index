			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Brazauskas named new president of Lithuania: Pledges of less painful market reform vindicated MR Algirdas Brazauskas, Lithuania's popular former communist leader, was yesterday declared the winner of the presidential election. He was elected with a 60 per cent majority, vindicating his conciliatory style and promises of less painful market reform. Mr Brazauskas' victory sealed a comeback which began when his renamed Democratic Labour Party trounced Prof Vytautas Landsbergis, the republic's confrontational independence leader, in parliamentary elections in November of last year. Mr Stasys Lozoraitis, the ambassador to the US backed by Mr Landsbergis' demoralised Sajudis movement, received 39 per cent of the vote. As the Baltic republic's first directly elected president, Mr Brazauskas, 62, will be able to appoint the prime minister and dissolve parliament. Respected for splitting the Lithuanian communist party from Moscow three years ago in one of the republic's first steps towards independence, Mr Brazauskas now faces the challenge of delivering his pre-election promises. These include improved relations with Russia to obtain cheaper energy supplies, restoring trading links with its former Soviet neighbours, and boosting industrial production, which fell 55 per cent in the past two years. Yesterday he said he would remove 'as soon as possible all the obstacles' to foreign investment, and vowed to speed up privatisation. This was despite effectively calling a halt to the privatisation programme of his radical predecessors. He has claimed that his experience in government can help redress mistakes made by his predecessors. He says, for example, that breakneck attempts last year to distribute collective agricultural land to pre-communist owners and new independent farmers will spell catastrophe unless the government is able to restore 'order' to the sector to enable spring sowing to match last year's levels. However, he will have little room for manoeuvre on his promises to lessen the economic pain of price liberalisation and social spending cuts if he also carries out his promise to introduce a fully fledged Lithuanian currency and maintain financial policies agreed with the International Monetary Fund. Although the Lithuanian parliament has just required state-owned enterprises to sell 25 per cent of their export earnings to the state, the republic remains strapped for foreign exchange and foreign investment. Mr Landsbergis did not stand in the presidential elections, but Mr Brazauskas' victory owes much to popular discontent with Mr Landsbergis. 'These radical nationalist movements make mistakes, lose their authority and then turn round and blame communists,' Mr Brazauskas said at the weekend. He said yesterday, however, that there was no question of returning to communism, explaining that party membership had simply been a way of getting ahead in the old system.</p>

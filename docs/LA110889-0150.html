BRIEFING;  </P> <P> PEPSICO MAY BUY PERRIER UNIT  </P> <P> Pepsico, eager to boost sales in France to catch up with dominant rival  Coca-Cola Co., will consider buying Perrier's soft drinks subsidiary if the  price comes down, a senior Pepsi official said today.  </P> <P> Perrier, the French mineral water group, said Tuesday that it was selling its  soft drinks unit, which makes the popular Pschitt sodas, for between $272  million and $400 million.  </P> <P> "The acquisition of Perrier's soft drinks unit is one among a list of options  for our activities in France," said Stuart Haugen, Pepsi's general manager for  France and Belgium. "Other acquisitions, joint ventures and investment to boost  our own Pepsi brands are also a possibility," he added.  </P> <P> Industry analysts said another possible buyer for the Perrier unit is Britain's  Cadbury-Schweppes.  </P> <P> Perrier put its soft drinks unit up for sale one day after Pepsi said it would  end its franchise relationship with Perrier at the end of next year, citing  poor sales.  </P></p>

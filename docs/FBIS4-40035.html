			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Valeriy Konovalov: "Draft Plan for New </F> Collectivization Appears in State Duma"]    [Text] The Russian State Duma Agrarian Affairs Committee  has prepared a new version of the Russian Federation draft law  "On Agricultural Cooperatives" which, if adopted, could nullify  the entire agrarian reform.    The preparation of the law on agricultural cooperatives has  been like a detective story developing over many months. The  draft of the document was elaborated by a group of well-known  economists and lawyers, writers of many works on theory and  legal questions of cooperatives and the world cooperative  movement. It was relevant a year ago. If the law had appeared  then, it would have been possible to obviate many problems and  difficulties in the formation of the new body of peasant  entrepreneurs, legalize cooperation among farmers, and ease the  countryside's financial problems. But the draft law met with  serious resistance on the part of defenders of the kolkhoz  sustem, since the foundations of this system were being finally  undermined. We have talked on more than one occasion about the  travails of this document, which made a laborious passage  through various bodies and then went no one knows where.    Finally, all the hurdles were apparently overcome. The draft  obtained the approval not only of leading experts, including  foreign ones, but also of the Agriculture Ministry Council on  Agrarian Policy and the government and was recommended for  consideration in the State Duma.    Then came a further surprise. Yet another draft appeared,  one submitted by the State Duma Agrarian Committee. Unlike its  predecessor, this version will apparently not be impeded on the  path to approval. Our information is that it is to be examined  by the lower chamber in the very near future.    But the document is very surprising. Much of it is a rehash  of the first version -- in the wording and some theoretical  postulates. But these are interspersed with elements that not  only contradict the rehashed articles, but nullify them.    The first article of the draft, for example, says that  agricultural cooperatives in Russia only existed as such before  collectivization, yet the fourth article places kolkhoz and  cooperative on a par with one another. Moreover, it proposes  that the kolkhoz be legalized in its most classic, Soviet form:  "The owner's rights to shares of land and property pass to the  kolkhoz (cooperative) as a corporate body that manages them in  accordance with statutes which are formalized by an act of state  after its registration."    This means that peasants will effectively have their shares  of land and property taken away from them and so-called  kolkhoz-cooperative ownership (joint property belonging to no  one) will live again. It also marks the revival of the  long-forgotten Partnerships for Joint Working of the Land and  the fabrication of "cooperative farms," a concept unknown to  world theory and practice. This law, if adopted, will provide  the defenders of the kolkhoz system with a powerful legal weapon  for new collectivization, for halting the reforms, and for  strangling private farming.    This is not the first attempted legislative assault on the  reform of the countryside. Only recently a draft law was  proposed on collective agricultural enterprises. It did not get  through. Now we have a new assault, perhaps the most serious.</p>

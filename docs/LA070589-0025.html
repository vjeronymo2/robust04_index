			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COURT ON CAPITAL PUNISHMENT  </P> <P> "The Ultimate Outrage" is not the Supreme Court's decision to uphold executions  of teen-age killers. The ultimate outrage is that these murderers have deprived  their victims of their ultimate right: life.  </P> <P> A friend of mine was raped, her throat slit ear to ear, her face slashed, and  her skull crushed. Her attacker was a 16-year-old would-be murderer. He left  her for dead after ransacking her home for valuables, stole her car and was  picked up by the police for auto theft. A neighbor found my friend, or she  would have died.  </P> <P> My friend does not have access to his medical records to ascertain if he is  HIV-positive (he is an IV drug-user) because it would be "an invasion of his  privacy."  </P> <P> COLLEEN M. McHALE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

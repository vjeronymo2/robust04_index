			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Rabin coalition scandal threat A CORRUPTION scandal in the Israeli cabinet threatens the country's fragile coalition government and could harm the ability of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to negotiate peace with Palestinians and the country's Arab neighbours. Yesterday Rabbi Aryeh Deri, the interior minister and head of the Shas party, a coalition partner, said he would resign after the attorney general said the minister would be charged with aggravated fraud, accepting bribes, violating the public trust and fraudulently registering corporate documents. 'I'll resign from the cabinet but I have yet to decide when,' Mr Deri said. Some officials from Shas - a centre right ultra-religious party with six Knesset members - said yesterday they would quit the coalition. This would leave Mr Rabin with a bare one-vote majority in the 120-strong parliament. 'Shas should absolutely quit the coalition,' Mr Aryeh Gamliel, a Shas member of parliament, said yesterday. 'This is a base libel.' Mr Deri has been facing the fraud allegations for three years after investigators charged that millions of dollars were illegally transfered from his ministry to Shas organisations and synagogues through local councils which were pressed by Mr Deri and his aides to collaborate. Some of the money is claimed to have ended up in private hands. Mr Deri was widely viewed as a force for moderation on the Israeli centre-right, keeping his party in the year-old Labour-led coalition against increasing pressure from right-wing political groups and settlers to quit the government. The right-wing Likud party yesterday said that without Shas, Mr Rabin's 44-strong Labour party would be forced to depend on left-wing and Arab support to stay in power, reducing his legitimacy to sign a peace deal. Mr Moshe Katzav, the head of the Likud parliamentary group, said in an interview: 'Mr Rabin no longer has a mandate to continue his peace policy. The right thing to do now is to call early elections and give the Israeli people the right to decide.' Labour party officials conceded that the indictment against Mr Deri had damaged the coalition but said they believed Shas would remain in the coalition. 'We have already said that we cannot take the big decisions about peace if Shas leaves the coalition,' said Mr Eli Dayan, leader of the Labour parliamentary group.</p>

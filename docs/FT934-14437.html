			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lonrho Mr Dieter Bock should have known that it would be hard to persuade Lonrho's board to accept non-executive directors. Not only has Mr Tiny Rowland long viewed non-executives with disdain: existing directors have little interest in accepting new members with the power to establish remuneration and audit committees. Mr Bock occupies the moral high ground in terms of corporate governance, but his success in persuading Mr Rowland to dispose of The Observer does not mean he is firmly in charge. Mr Rowland has a proven ability to muster the support of small shareholders and, having spent Pounds 130m on his 19 per cent stake, Mr Bock cannot afford to walk away. Unless he succeeds in appointing non-executive directors, though, Lonrho's share price may fall back sharply.</p>

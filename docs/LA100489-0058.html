			<p><P> October 4, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 11,000 EAST GERMANS AWAIT LATE TRAINS;  </P> <P> ANOTHER NIGHT IN MUDDY PRAGUE  </P> <P> About 11,000 East Germans, in hurried flight from their homeland, were set  Tuesday night to board trains for a new life in West Germany. But the special  trains, to come from East Germany, did not arrive in Prague, and the crowds  faced another night in the streets and encamped in the muddy backyard of the  West German Embassy here.  </P> <P> Early in the evening, embassy officials announced to an exultant crowd the news  that another deal had been struck between Bonn and East Berlin, similar to the  arrangement that allowed about 6,000 refugees to leave here last Saturday  night, and that the first trains would be pulling out about 8 p.m.  </P> <P> But the confusion that has prevailed here for the last week continued, as  neither the embassy nor railway police could offer an explanation for the  trains' failure to appear.  </P> <P> In the meantime, the narrow streets approaching the West German Embassy were  jammed with mostly young East Germans, including an estimated 1,500 small  children, trying to stay warm and catch a few minutes of sleep on the cold  cobblestones.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sanitation Problems  </P> <P> Movement on the street was virtually impossible. In the past 24 hours, at least  6,000 new arrivals have gathered outside the embassy -- which was closed on  demand of Red Cross officials worried over growing problems of sanitation.  </P> <P> The tent city that has been erected on the embassy's large garden grounds was  occupied by at least 4,500 people, and, the diplomats said, it became  impossible to squeeze in more newcomers.  </P> <P> Inside the embassy, a huge baroque palace, makeshift bunk beds were full of  sleeping children, the hallways crowded with refugees sleeping with their heads  on their knees and refuse and duffle bags scattered in ornate drawing rooms. At  the windows, people peered out at the crowds below, waiting for the word to  leave.  </P> <P> Embassy officials said they assumed that the trains' delay was due to  "technical reasons" but hinted at the possibility that the East German  government -- in what it obviously hopes will be the last time it will face  this problem -- was simply taking its time with the trains and pointedly not  worrying over the discomfort of its defecting citizens.  </P> <P> There was also speculation that the delay might have been suggested by the  Czechoslovak government, in the hope that it would give time for any East  German in the country to get to the embassy and catch the last train out.  </P> <P> East Germany on Tuesday began requiring special permission for its citizens to  travel to Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> "I am very happy I got out in time, just in time," said Angela Jungebauer, 31,  a high school teacher. "I am so happy I cannot describe it. My husband is  working in West Berlin, and I have been trying to get out in the normal way for  two years. I just had no patience any more."  </P> <P> "We are just fed up," said another young man, cradling his sleeping 3-year-old  daughter in his arms. "You know it is not easy to leave the country where you  were born, your town, your family. But there is no future there, no chance for  my children."  </P> <P> Many of the refugees, while not involved in politics or opposition movements,  cited East Germany's hard-line attitude toward political reform -- now moving  forward rapidly in Poland and Hungary -- as a primary reason for leaving. Most  of them, they said, had apartments, cars and jobs. But, as a hospital  technician from Leipzig said: "We have no freedom. We are frozen, our  politicians are frozen."  </P> <P> It is uncertain whether the dramatic exodus, begun Sept. 11 when the first of  about 25,000 East Germans took advantage of Hungary's decision to lift its  border barriers with Austria, will bring an end to East Germany's socialist ice  age. But the events are a clear embarrassment to the regime of 77-year-old  Erich Honecker, who will preside this weekend over celebrations marking the  40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has been scolded by Honecker for his  reformist inclinations, will attend the celebrations and is expected to discuss  the refugee issue with the leadership. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze was a key participant in negotiations with the East and West  Germans last week.  </P> <P> The Czechoslovak government, an equally hard-line regime, has been sympathetic  to the plight of the East German government, and has reacted with evident  confusion over the refugees.  </P> <P> After the first exodus on Saturday, police were sent to ring the West German  Embassy to prevent more East Germans from entering the compound. By turns, they  held back the crowd and then relented to let small groups enter, sometimes  backing off when faced by the ambassador, Hermann Huber, or members of his  staff.  </P> <P> But within hours of the departure of the first group, 200 more East Germans  managed to elude the Czechoslovak police and scale the wrought-iron fence of  the embassy's garden. As more continued to arrive, the Czechoslovak police by  turns allowed some to enter and attempted to arrest others. By Monday night,  there were between 3,000 and 4,000 inside the embassy grounds, and Tuesday  morning, with the crowd outside steadily swelling, the police simply pulled  back.  </P> <P> Among the crowd, the mood was weary but civilized. Volunteers passed though the  throng handing out apples and hot tea. Some Czechoslovaks, fascinated by the  spectacle, came out to watch. Some brought candy for the children, and a few  offered rooms in nearby apartments to parents with small children.  </P> <P> Most of the emigrants, however, stayed stoically in place Tuesday night. The  crowd parted once to let an ambulance pass -- it had come to pick up a woman in  the early stages of childbirth. The youngest child in the throng was said to be  15 days old.  </P> <P> One young mother, rocking a pram back and forth, said her baby was 5 weeks old.  The mother, smiling still at the news that buses would soon take them to the  train station, said everything was fine. Her baby was sleeping and wrapped in  warm blankets. "She's got the most comfortable bed here," she said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOK AT THE RECORD, NOT THE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Lately, it seems to be the practice for candidates who are running for office  to introduce bills and make statements that make them appear to be  environmentally inclined and look good to the casual reader. The latest is Sen.  Pete Wilson's wilderness and river protection bill.  </P> <P> Wilson has no interest in protecting the environment, as his voting record  clearly shows. The bill that he is introducing carefully leaves the Sespe open  to damming and includes less than half of the valuable wilderness area  available for protection in Ventura County.  </P> <P> Voters are going to have to be more careful than ever before in deciding which  candidates to support and not be taken in by statements that are not supported  by the record.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA LEAKE  </P> <P> Camarillo  </P> <P>  Leake is vice president of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County.  </P></p>

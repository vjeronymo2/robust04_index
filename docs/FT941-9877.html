			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Vote for EU grows among Norwegians The Norwegian government's hopes of turning around the deep public hostility to joining the European Union will be boosted today by an opinion poll showing a sharp increase in support for membership. However, in Helsinki, Mr Esko Aho, the prime minister, warned yesterday that Finland's application to join the EU would fall unless its demands for special treatment of Nordic agriculture were met. Finland, Norway and fellow-applicants Sweden and Austria are engaged in accession negotiations with the EU due to be completed by next month. A poll published today in Aftenposten, Norway's leading daily newspaper, showed opposition to EU membership slipping below 50 per cent for the first time in months, to 48 per cent. Meanwhile, support has shot up since a similar poll last month from 32 per cent to 37 per cent - well above last October's low point of 24 per cent. In a further encouragement for the Labour government, which has promised a referendum to decide the issue, the poll showed that support for membership in Norway would outstrip opposition if Sweden and Finland voted to join. In such circumstances the poll showed 41 per cent in favour against 39 per cent, with the rest undecided. Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, foreign minister, said this week it was an 'unbearable thought' for Norwegians that its border with Sweden might 'become our border with Europe'. But Mr Aho said the EU must change its refusal to grant special status to Nordic agriculture quickly if the negotiations were to succeed. 'The EU must understand these Nordic conditions of ours. A solution must emerge only on this basis,' he said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time when public interest is centered on North  Korea's food shortages and the number of North Korean escapees  is increasing, the Association Studying the North Korean  Agriculture held a seminar marking its founding on 7 May and  analyzed the current North Korean farming situation. This is the  summary from the report made by Chungang University Professor  Kim Song-hun at the seminar. (Editor's Note)    North Korea has statistics on its food situation to report  to  the outside world and the true statistics are kept under strict  control. According to statistics compiled by the National  Unification Board in August 1993, with the help of relevant  agencies, North Korea's gross grain output was 4.81 million  tonnes in 1990; 4.43 million tonnes in 1991; 4.27 million tonnes  in 1992; and 3.88 million tonnes in 1993. This shows that its  output is on a downward trend. However, it is estimated that  North Koreans need to consume between 5.5 and 6.5 million tonnes  of food.    With the increase of the number of people fleeing the  country, North Korea could no longer put aside the food shortage  problem. Furthermore, out of the necessity to stabilize its  political system after Kim Chong-il inherits power, North Korea  has begun to purchase food from abroad half-openly. What should  be noted is that North Korea purchased 0.15 million tonnes of  wheat from the United States in 1991 and during 1992-1993 it  directly purchased 0.25 million tonnes of grain worth $0.2  billion from the United States.    North Korea's food situation is getting worse due to its  natural, physical, and technological restrictions. The range  and variety of mechanization are not wide, and chemical  fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, and herbicides are in short  supply. Even the land reclamation program vigorously pushed  ahead from the late seventies to the early eighties is inactive  these days.    North Korea shows no sign of promoting its collective  management system and the chuche-oriented farming in the near  future. What is more, agricultural productivity is expected to  drop much more. On the contrary, the rate of urbanization  rapidly soared in recent days and 60 percent of its total  population lives in urban areas. Due to this, the demand for  agricultural products has increased.    Inefficiency in the agricultural sector has had far-reaching  effects on other sectors, bringing about enormous restrictions  to the smooth development of the overall economy. However,  North Korea's standard of agricultural science and technology;  improvement of plant breeding; farming techniques; and  cultivation methods are considerably high. The problem is that  it needs a mechanism that can link all these factors and needs  to introduce market economy principles.    The foundation for the unification of the North and South  cannot be solidified if North Korea does not overcome the  backwardness of its grain production. Since the degree of South  Korea's crops self- sufficiency only accounts for 30 percent and  agriculture is the weakest sector in the South Korean economy,  the two Koreas cannot but supplement their weakness in the  agricultural sector through the exchange of and cooperation in  agricultural techniques and capital.</p>

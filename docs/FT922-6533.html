			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Not a level playing field: The Premier League's potential impact on UK football When Blackburn Rovers play Leicester City at Wembley on Monday, there will be rather more at stake than winning the second division play-offs for a place in the new Premier League. The most glittering prize will be the Pounds 1.5m cash that a typical Premier League club can expect in the first season of a Pounds 304m five-year television deal with British Sky Broadcasting and the BBC. The figure contrasts with the Pounds 68,000 each second division club received this season from ITV. The most enthusiastic advocates of the BSkyB deal are chairmen of the less glamorous Premier League clubs. At Wimbledon, which set records for the lowest gates in the former first division, its chairman Sam Hammam says: 'It's the difference between life and death.' The club has lost nearly Pounds 1.8m in the past year, a gap bridged as usual by selling star players. He speaks with glee of an equally important gap being closed between big and small clubs in the Premier League. Wimbledon, with an average gate of less than 7,000 collects only Pounds 700,000 a year through the turnstiles. Last year Manchester United, with an average attendance of 43,000, derived more than Pounds 9m from this source. For Wimbledon, the most crucial gain is the tele-gate. The armchair fan will at last share the burden of financing football, first through satellite subscription and in later seasons through the proposed pay-per-view system. Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur - and of Amstrad, which distributes satellite dishes - conjures up a vision of 1m dish owners paying Pounds 2 per game to deliver Pounds 120m a season, split between BSkyB and the league. His scenario assumes that 15 per cent of 7m dish owners would participate. At present, little more than 2m dishes are installed. Unless more than seven people cluster around a set, the audience is bound to be much smaller than the 7m-9m who regularly watched ITV's The Match on a Sunday. And some commentators have said the restriction would be bad for the game. Those complaining about the narrow access to live football can expect robust replies from most Premier League clubs. Ron Noades, chairman of Crystal Palace, with which Wimbledon shares a stadium, says: 'The government is asking us to rebuild grounds. The supporters are refusing to pay for it. Why should we provide soccer free for millions of screen spectators who are making no contribution to meeting the Taylor Report?' It is estimated that meeting the report's requirement for all-seater stadiums - a response to the Hillsborough tragedy - will cost the 22 Premier League clubs Pounds 163m. Only a quarter of this is expected to come from the government. Many clubs are not in good shape to meet this commitment. According to Simon Pitt, joint managing director of a new sports consultancy called Centre Forward, 'English Football's total indebtedness is probably as much as Pounds 150m.' Against this background it might seem odd that six clubs - Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Leeds and Aston Villa - voted against the BSkyB deal. They are the strongest financially and their games have dominated the coverage by ITV. Indeed David Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal, is seen as something of an ITV champion. The argument put forward by the big clubs for preferring ITV was that although BSkyB was offering about Pounds 10m a year more than ITV, this was for 60 games compared with 30. (This season 21 matches were shown.) There is concern not only about saturating the audience, but also about the innovation of live games on a Monday night, regarded as being less popular with fans than a weekend fixture. However, even for a club that did well out of the ITV deal, the new arrangement represents a big increase in income. Manchester United received about Pounds 700,000 from ITV this season. Under the new deal, which includes prize money related to league position, United would have earned the best part of Pounds 2m. Beyond this week's auction of TV and advertising rights, there remain nagging doubts about the destination of all this money. If the Premier League ultimately becomes smaller and more oriented towards European competition, English clubs would be drawn even further into the scramble for the best players, which boils down to wages and transfer fees. These already seem high. Established Premier League players earn up to Pounds 3,000 a week. John Barnes, the Liverpool forward reputed to be on Pounds 500,000 a year, is just one England international being lured abroad. As for transfers, the record Pounds 2.9m paid by Liverpool for Dean Saunders pales beside the Pounds 8m that recently took Jean-Pierre Papin from Marseille to AC Milan. While the gap has narrowed between big and small in the Premier League, a gulf is opening up between the league and the other three divisions. Luton Town, relegated after numerous escapes, was persuaded at the last minute to attend Monday's meeting of Premier League chairmen, to ensure that the little clubs had the two-thirds majority they needed in the vote for BSkyB. Along with West Ham and Notts County, Luton will receive Pounds 750,000 compensation for missing out on the serious money. The talks now going on between the Football League and potential broadcasters of games from the new Divisions I to III are unlikely to yield anything like that farewell payment from the big league.</p>

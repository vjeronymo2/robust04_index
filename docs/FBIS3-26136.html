Prices of grain, edible oil, and such major foodstuffs  as meat and vegetable have already declined from the upward  trend. Prices of household electric appliances and other  manufactured goods for daily use have been basically stabilized.  Supply of goods on markets before Spring Festival have been  ample, and both purchases and sales have been brisk.    In November and December 1993, large-scale price hikes  emerged on the province's markets, drawing the concern of the  provincial and local governments. Since then, various  localities have given full play to the role of the price  regulation fund to help lower commodity prices. Dandong and 12  other cities have allocated 17.27 million yuan to subsidize  price differences. Shenyang city that has not yet set up the  price regulation fund has also released 6 million yuan from the  city revenues to subsidize price differences. Many cities have  also adopted such administrative measures as restricting prices  and reducing the rate of profits to ensure the stability of  commodity prices on markets.    To this report, this station has added a commentary  entitled:  "Decontrol Does Not Mean Washing One's Hands." In the preceding  period, prices of some major daily necessities in the province  hiked to some extent. In addition to such objective reasons as  the commencement of new tax system in the near future, the price  hikes emerged first in southern China, and weather changes,  people's vague understanding of the price reform was the  essential reason for this situation. Some people maintained:  Price reform means decontrolling prices; and decontrolling  prices means having enterprises and managers decide prices  freely and having markets themselves decide prices without any  degree of state interference. The managers with such an  understanding frequently raised prices accordingly whenever  there was a sign of price hikes. Some others drove up prices in  defiance of laws and discipline and spoke plausibly: When you  increase wages, I increase prices; and when you collect tax, I  shift it to price hikes. This is called "when the river rises  the boat goes up." If we act like that, a considerably great  portion of the material benefits brought by China's economic  reform to the people will go to the pockets of such persons, and  it is difficult for us to achieve success in price reform. In  fact, decontrolling prices does not mean that the government  should no longer manage prices; and making markets themselves  decide prices does not mean no longer requiring state  interference. Keeping the general level of prices stable and  preventing galloping inflation is a goal pursued by almost all  countries in the world, as well as an important means of our  country to carry out macroeconomic control and ensure social  stability. How to successfully stabilize prices and make prices  flexible, but not chaotic, is a new task facing all levels of  governments at present. Were not the price hikes at the  preceding period rapidly checked and turned down through the  positive and effective interferences of governments at all  levels? This shows that the government's interference on prices  is necessary. This also proves that the government is able to  use legal, economic, and administrative means to manage prices  well in the course of carrying out price reform and to make  price reform satisfy all fields.</p>

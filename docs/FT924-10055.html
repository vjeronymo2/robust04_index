			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Islam surge in Istanbul THE Moslem fundamentalist Welfare party captured 28 per cent of the vote in Istanbul, Turkey's largest city, in municipal elections on Sunday, according to official returns announced yesterday, AP reports from Ankara. The party, which calls for the establishment of an Islamic state in secular Turkey, apparently capitalised on discontent among the city's poor. The election was limited to new city council districts, involving about 800,000 of the city's 4.2m eligible voters, and 200,000 voters in other provinces. The Welfare party's vote in Istanbul was up from 20 per cent a year ago.</p>

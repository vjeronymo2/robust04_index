			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Defense Minister Vice Admiral Radames Munoz Leon  has asked Head of State Ramon J. Velasquez to irrevocably accept  his retirement from the national Armed Forces. Along with  members of the military High Command, Munoz placed his post at  the president's disposal. The defense minister adopted this  stand because President-elect Rafael Caldera decided to  reorganize the military High Command.    Meanwhile, President Ramon J. Velasquez said that the work  done by these soldiers over the past months was decisive in  preserving democracy. He added that President Caldera is fully  empowered to make the changes he deems necessary.    [Begin Velasquez recording] I wish to say that the military  High Command and the defense minister have been key  collaborators in the process that led to the 5 December  elections. For seven months, months which were filled with  difficulties, the presence of the military High Command meant  support and strong stability for the government I headed.  Holding elections in December was also the High Command's main  goal.    I hold you in high esteem for the work you did, the way you  have maintained discipline within the military institution, and  your high sense of patriotism which guides each one of you as  members of a key team within the national Armed Forces.

The  decision was prompted by the fact that Sanchez de Lozada could  not attend the meeting, because he is scheduled to meet in La  Paz with U.S. Vice President Al Gore on that day.    The three presidents had been scheduled to meet on 20 March  to discuss the Pilcomayo River issue. Yet the above problem has  forced a postponement of the "minisummit" to a later date.    During Sanchez de Lozada's recent visit to Asuncion,  Bolivian  Foreign Minister Antonio Aranibar Quiroga noted that the Formosa  presidential summit might be postponed. It was confirmed  yesterday at Lopez Palace that the meeting has in fact been  postponed.</p>

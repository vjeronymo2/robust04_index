			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Scottish health tables published Official statistics which for the first time show variations in death rates between National Health Service hospitals were published in Scotland yesterday, Alan Pike writes. The report containing the figures was accompanied by a strong warning from Lord Fraser, Scottish health minister, that it was not a league table of good or bad hospitals. He added: 'Still less is it about death league tables for Scottish hospitals. This report provides no direct comparisons between hospitals and health boards either in relation to the quality of care or the effectiveness of service.' Industrial areas of Scotland have one of the world's worst records for deaths from conditions such as heart disease and cancer. Many researchers are likely to see the figures as confirmation of the social and economic factors behind this poor health record, rather than a test of the performance of individual hospitals. The report does, however, show a range of differences between hospitals. Nearly 30 per cent of heart attack patients, for example, died within 30 days of being admitted to Fife Healthcare Trust compared with fewer than 16 per cent at Edinburgh Western General hospital. The Scottish average was 21 per cent.</p>

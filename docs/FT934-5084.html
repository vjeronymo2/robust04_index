			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: More funds for school inspections and opt-outs - Education Mr John Patten, the education secretary, emerged as a significant victor in the public expenditure round, with an increase in the budget for the education department and the Office for Standards in Education (Ofsted) of 6.8 per cent. Total spending will be Pounds 10.487bn, an increase of Pounds 670m on 1993-94. But most funds will be funnelled into Ofsted, which was set up last year and has an ambitious plan to inspect all schools at least once every four years, and into grant-maintained schools which opt out of local authority control. Ofsted's spending on inspections will more than double in real terms over the next three years. Central government spending on opted-out schools will increase from Pounds 157m in the current financial year to Pounds 595m in 1996-97, to fund a hoped-for increase in the number of schools opting out. Both figures angered teachers' unions, three of which are planning to boycott next year's national curriculum tests. In further education, Mr Patten is using funding as a weapon to help employers in their dispute with the main lecturers' union. Several colleges are affected by industrial action over the introduction of new contracts which will halve annual holiday allowances. Mr Patten said he would hold back Pounds 50m in grants from the further education funding council until 'there has been satisfactory progress within colleges towards more flexible contracts'. The government will continue to provide funding aimed at increasing student numbers by 25 per cent by 1995-96, but said it would require 'efficiency savings'.</p>

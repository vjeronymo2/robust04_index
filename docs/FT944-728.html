			<p>941224 FT  24 DEC 94 / Joggers ignite dissent in Bahrain The violent clashes between demonstrators and police, which have erupted in Bahrain this month are a timely reminder of how brittle relations can be between Gulf governments and important segments of their own people. Bahrain is the third member of the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council  - which also links Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE - to have been forced to acknowledge public dissent on a small but significant scale in the past six months. Between May and August, several hundred people were arrested in Oman for sedition, and many more than the 110 officially acknowledged by the Saudi authorities were arrested in September at Buraidah, centre of the kingdom's conservative heartland. The Bahrain clashes started a month ago as a local village incident. On November 25, participants in a road marathon, including female foreigners, were stoned by villagers at Jidhafs, a poor and mainly Shia area a few miles west of Manama, the capital. According to diplomats among the runners, one participant was severely hurt. Joggers, particularly scantily clad ones, have long been the object of ridicule and resentment among the poorer and more conservative segments of countries in the Arabian peninsula. The police, still advised by a former British police officer who won his spurs in the Kenya campaign against the Mau Mau, then arrested several villagers. When a local Shia cleric, recently returned from theological studies at Qom in Iran, denounced the arrests, he in turn was detained. The government sought to play down the trouble, but rumours and stories of police brutality grew. As tension rose, the demonstrators added to their list of complaints. Further attempts to crush the popular action led to more violence and at least two people, including a policeman, were killed. The demonstrations continued this week and now include demands for a return of Bahrain's parliament, dissolved in 1975. The violence appears not to have affected most of the estimated 547,000 population, of which a third is foreign. But the continuation of the month-long disturbances this week was especially embarrassing as Bahrain played host to the annual summit of the GCC. While oil prices were high and economic development kept entire populations busy making money, public disenchantment was rare, even among the poorest members of national communities. Now that governments are finding it harder to lubricate their economies with liberal cash hand-outs and across-the- board subsidies, dissatisfaction among poorer people is becoming more widespread and closer to the surface. Traditional rulers find public exposure of their governmental deficiencies hard to accept, especially as the demonstrations in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have highlighted the fault lines running through all GCC countries. These are superficially economic: flat oil revenues; persistent and rising budget deficits; unemployment (particularly among graduates of home-grown universities supposed to reflect gloriously on the 'wisdom and far-sightedness' of their respective rulers); cuts in state hand-outs (including subsidies on water, electricity, health and transport which governments can no longer afford). Most of all, however, the fault lines reflect GCC governments' failure to explain to their own people how material circumstances have changed.</p>

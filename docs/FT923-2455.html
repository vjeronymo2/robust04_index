			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Community Hospitals shows 16% increase COMMUNITY Hospitals Group, which runs private hospitals and nursing homes, increased pre-tax profit by 16 per cent to Pounds 6.75m in the 12 months to the end of June. The rise, from Pounds 5.81m, came on turnover up 20 per cent to Pounds 42.1m (Pounds 35.1m). The pre-tax figure compares with the Pounds 7m given by the company in March as its 'best view' of the full-year outcome. Although the tax rate was lower, growth in earnings was limited to less than 3 per cent, from 15.6p to 16p per share, by extra shares in issue after last year's Pounds 10.4m rights issue. Sir Peter Thompson, chairman, said the company had had about nine rights issues since 1981. Now it had reached a stage where organic growth could be financed in-house. This might mean gearing rising to between 50 and 60 per cent as capital spending continued. It was Pounds 21m last year and would be nearly Pounds 20m this year. In June, net debt stood at Pounds 22m, gearing of 33 per cent, compared with Pounds 4m and 7 per cent at the end of the pre-vious year. Mr David Croker, finance director, said Pounds 1.6m (Pounds 1.1m) of interest had been capitalised. The hospital division, which has 10 units and 480 beds, increased operating profit by 14 per cent to Pounds 5.6m on turnover up 17 per cent to Pounds 36.1m. While the recession had reduced income from self-pay patients, the insured market continued to grow and changes in the National Health Service had created contracting opportunities. Continuing care improved profit by 56 per cent to Pounds 1.25m on Pounds 6m turnover. Mr Alan Dexter, chief executive, said the market was being driven by the increasing number of elderly people, particularly those over 85, where one in five suffered from dementia. In addition to the group's eight nursing homes, clusters of sheltered flats and cottages were being developed alongside its main sites. Services could also being delivered to people in the community. A proposed final dividend of 4.1p lifts the total from 6p to 6.5p. COMMENT No sooner did Community Hospitals bite the bullet by deciding to fund future growth with debt in preference to paper than interest rates shot up. One analyst hastily downgraded a 1992-93 forecast from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 7.2m pre-tax 'as a gesture' towards what higher financing costs might mean to a group whose debt was Pounds 22m and rising. While an ageing and increasingly infirm population will undeniably fuel the health market, the impact of NHS reforms and the Care in the Community legislation due next spring is less easy to predict. Trust hospitals, for instance, will increase competition. The Pounds 7.2m forecast gives a prospective p/e of less than 12 on yesterday's close of 191p. This is a comparatively low rating for a company in an expanding market and the stock is worth holding. However, earnings growth has been muffled first by extra equity and now by finance costs and rising tax.</p>

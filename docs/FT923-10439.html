			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Eventing, killer heat and rock-hard ground test British grit - Keith Wheatley describes the complex equations that determine physical survival and success in Olympic equestrianism FEW sports demand the individual bravery and team discipline of three-day event riding. Over a cross-country course that can kill horses and riders, a competitor must weigh the needs of his horse, his own life and limbs - and the points on the team board. Britain's Richard Walker was shaken when he came off the cross-country course at El Montanya yesterday. His horse Jacanda had refused and thrown him head first over the 5ft 13th fence. 'I changed his stride to find the right spot and when I pressed the accelerator the revs weren't there,' said Walker, 41. 'I'm very frustrated. Jacanda didn't make a mistake. The problem was between the hat and the saddle.' The pressure on Walker had been enormous. Britain had entered the second phase of the three-day event in first place after a totally unexpected success in the dressage section. Walker's role as lead of the four British riders was to ride a conservative clear round, building a platform for team-mates to take a few chances, cut times and increase the team's lead. Mary Thomson, this year's Badminton winner and the team's rookie, had expected to be given this sometimes frustrating spot. 'You tend to forfeit any chance of the individual gold medal if you ride first, since you must just stay out of trouble and go for a clear round, not really watching the clock,' she said. She was among the first to console the unhappy Walker as he unsaddled among the olive trees that shade the assembly area. Given the topography, it is scarcely surprising that the course has far more rise and fall than is usual at international events. 'The climbs are quite severe and at the top the horse doesn't expect to have to put maximum efffort into a jump,' said Walker. Although he fell at the 16th, it was at Hell Hole, the tiered 13th, a terrace culminating in a water splash, that Walker's problems began. Jacanda stumbled into the pond and Walker fell sideways from the saddle, balanced for a second between disaster and recovery. Although experts rate the fences tough, it is the combination of factors that made El Montanya a Waterloo for eventers. The ground was rock-hard, while heat and humidity made it impossible to push horses to the limit. As Walker said: 'I have to look to the future with this horse as well as try to win at the Olympics.' The course vet fought to save the Russian horse Dakoz after it collapsed with heat exhaustion. After Walker's mishap, the British team met for an urgent re-think of strategy. It was decided that Dixon and Thompson, riding third and fourth respectively, would take the 'chicken routes' at the more daunting fences, losing time but increasing the chances of a clear round. Britain's main rivals were not so constrained. Current world champion Blyth Tait of New Zealand scored a blistering clear round on Messiah, heading the leader board on 13 minutes 22 seconds, the day's fastest. Yet Walker's bad luck did have some bonuses for his team. The 16th fence made them wary. Most opted for the long route after Walker, although few had before. Sweden's Erik Duvander was thrown heavily at the same spot and thereafter most competitors treated it with care. It was at the same spot, rounding the pond, that Karen Dixon suffered her bad luck. As Get Smart leaned into the turn the much-loved horse threw a hind shoe. Nevertheless, Dixon was able to complete a clear round that even with time penalties kept her in the top six. Final British rider Ian Stark on Murphy Himself rode the same disciplined pattern, in the baking heat of afternoon. Overall, it was a superb effort that left Britain in second place on 248 points, eight behind NZ with Australia third (273). Mary Thomson's first-rate ride put her in third place individually, with today's show-jumping still to come.</p>

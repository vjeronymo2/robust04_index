			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JACK TAYLOR MEMORIAL ALL-STAR GAME;  </P> <P> COACHES WILL HAVE PLENTY OF TALENT TONIGHT  </P> <P> Frank Chambliss coached Torrey Pines High School's baseball team to the 2-A  championship in the Lions Tournament this season. But his team also finished  last in the eight-team Palomar League.  </P> <P> At 7 tonight at San Diego State, Chambliss will be loaded with talent. He and  assistant Jerry Schneipp of Helix will call the shots for the 3-A team when it  plays the 2-A in the Jack Taylor Memorial All-Star Game. The game is sponsored  by the San Diego County Baseball Coaches Association, which selected the  players and the coaches.  </P> <P> With all the talented seniors on the field, Chambliss could have a tough time  making decisions. When he makes a pitching change, should he bring in Orange  Glen left-hander Scott Coleman, who set a section record with 16 consecutive  no-hit innings earlier this season, or Mt. Carmel left-hander Doug Hill, who  compiled a two-year record of 18-2?  </P> <P> And there's always Poway's Danny Miller, who was 12-1 with a 1.22 earned-run  average and 123 strikeouts in 92 innings.  </P> <P> Those are the kinds of decisions facing Chambliss and the coach in the other  dugout, Santana's Jim Saska, who will get advice from assistants Ron Smock of  Coronado and Ron Lopez of San Diego.  </P> <P> In addition to the high-profile stars, the game affords the public the  opportunity to see players they normally wouldn't, such as Julian's Travis  Denmark, who hit 13 home runs, drove in 42 runs and pitched his team to the 1-A  championship, and Christian's Tony Clark, who hit 11 home runs for the Harbor  League's last-place Patriots and is expected to be among the first players  taken in Monday's free agent draft. They will compete for the 2-A.  </P> <P> Rosters  </P> <P> Scheduled to play for the 3-A team are Patrick Henry's Scott Arlin, Torrey  Pines' Preston Bynes and Shaw Henderson, Point Loma's Brett Callan, Hilltop's  David Chapman, Orange Glen's Scott Coleman, Granite Hills' John Fenn, San  Dieguito's Mike Henry, Mt. Carmel's Doug Hill and Andy Panganiban, Helix's Rob  Ippolito and Eric Nicholson, Serra's Sean Kerr, Mount Miguel's Joe Mata, El  Capitan's Sid Melero and David Rios, Sweetwater's Larry Mesa, Mike Romero and  Paul Sanchez, Poway's Danny Miller, Matt Schwenke and Greg Sorrell, Mar Vista's  Vern Mullis, Monte Vista's Ernie Reyes, and Rancho Buena Vista's David Roberts.  </P> <P> Scheduled to compete for the 2-A team are Oceanside's Andy Acevedo, Escondido's  Tom Afenir, Lincoln's Donald Anderson, Christian's Tony Clark, Julian's Travis  Denmark, USDHS' Jeff Desjardins and Gary Remiker, Grossmont's Jim Early and  John Tatum, Coronado's Jason Fledderjohn, Santana's Ferdie Hollis and Lance  McClure, University City's Troy Lane, Valhalla's Scott Lapinski, Grossmont's  Greg Layson, Mission Bay's Mike Lowry, Crawford's Joe McWilliams, El Camino's  Ricky Spears, and San Diego's Josh Stepner.  </P></p>

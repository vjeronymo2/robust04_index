			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / International Company News: Westinghouse sees weak earnings Mr Michael Jordan, chairman of Westinghouse Electric, repeated warnings of weak earnings in the first quarter of this year as the troubled US conglomerate reported figures for the last quarter of 1993. He said: 'We believe the first-quarter 1994 earnings will be down substantially compared to the first quarter of 1993, primarily due to increased pension expense, reduced licensee income, and a one-time accounting change for nuclear fuel in 1993.' The latest figures were weighed down by previously announced pre-tax charges of Dollars 750m, marking an attempt by Mr Jordan, who joined the group last summer, to strengthen the group's operating position. At the operating level, Westinghouse made a loss of Dollars 328m in the final three months of the year on sales of Dollars 2.6bn, compared with a profit of Dollars 160m on sales of Dollars 2.5bn the year before. The loss per share was Dollars 1.38 (Dollars 1.11 on continuing operations). A year before, the company made a profit of 18 cents per share (a loss of Dollars 3.74 a share after taking into account Dollars 1.4bn losses on discontinued operations). The company gave no breakdown of its various operating units in the latest period, though it repeated earlier comments that both revenues and operating profits at its environmental businesses were down 'substantially' in the quarter.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The first criterion in the FY 1995 contractor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance evaluation is ``Claims Processing'', which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures contractual performance against claims processing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy and timeliness requirements. Within the Claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Processing criterion, we have identified those performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards which are mandated by either legislation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation or judicial decision. These standards include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims processing timeliness, the rate of cases reversed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an Administrative Law Judge, the timeliness of intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration cases, and the accuracy and timeliness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier reviews and hearings. Further evaluation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Claims Processing criterion may include, but is not limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to, the accuracy of bill and claims processing, the level of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronic claims payment, and the accuracy of intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconsideration cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second criterion is ``Customer Service'', which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assesses the completeness of the service provided to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers by the contractor in its administration of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare program. Mandated standards in the Customer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service criterion include the accuracy of Explanations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare Benefits, and the accuracy and timeliness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carrier replies to beneficiary telephone inquiries. In FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995, customer feedback may be used to collect comparable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data on customer satisfaction and identify areas in need of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement. Among the specific contractor services that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be included in the evaluation process under the Customer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service criterion are: beneficiary relations; provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education; appropriate telephone inquiry responses; and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tone and accuracy of all correspondence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third criterion is ``Payment Safeguards'', which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluates whether the Medicare trust fund is safeguarded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against inappropriate program expenditures. Intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and carrier performance may be evaluated in the areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical review, Medicare secondary payer, fraud and abuse,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and audit and reimbursement. Mandated performance standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Payment Safeguards criterion are the accuracy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions on skilled nursing facility (SNF) demand bills,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the timeliness of processing Tax Equity and Fiscal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Responsibility Act (TEFRA) target rate adjustments,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions, and exemptions. Further evaluation in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion may include, but is not limited to, the efficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and effective compilation and analysis of data to bring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about continuous improvement in contractor efforts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safeguard Medicare program dollars.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fourth criterion is ``Fiscal Responsibility'', which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluates the contractor's efforts to protect the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program and the public interest. Contractors must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively manage Federal funds for both payment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> benefits and cost of administration under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Proper financial and budgetary controls must be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place to ensure contractor compliance with its agreement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with HHS and HCFA. Additional functions reviewed under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion may include, but are not limited to, bottom line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit cost, compliance with the Budget and Performance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Requirements, adherence to Chief Financial Officer's Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The fifth and final criterion is ``Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities'', which measures a contractor's administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management of the Medicare program. A contractor must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiently and effectively manage its operations to assure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constant improvement in the way it does business. Proper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems security, ADP maintenance, and disaster recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plans must be in place. A contractor's evaluation under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative Activities criterion may include, but is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to, establishment, application, documentation, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness of internal controls. Internal controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include all aspects of a contractor's operation. It can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include implementation reviews of corrective action plans,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> task management plans, data and reporting requirements, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management improvement plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have also developed separate measures for evaluating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique activities of Regional Home Health Intermediaries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (RHHIs).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Survey of International Equity Offerings (2): The birds that are worth shooting - New issues in Europe European governments and companies hoping to tap the international equity market this autumn would do well to take a crash course in grouse-shooting to come to grips with the current mood among potential buyers of their shares. Whereas last year, the bullish background of falling interest rates enabled investors to make money by subscribing to issues on a fairly indiscriminate basis, the more difficult investment climate this year and the heavy supply of equity issuance which is likely to emerge in the coming months have made them far more selective. 'The shooting season has started, but this time the strategy is not to shoot into the covey of grouse but to target one particular bird,' says Mr Ludovico del Balzo, head of international equity capital markets at Lehman Brothers. His advice to issuers is to focus on tactics and strategy when it comes to preparing their offering. 'Issues need to be well-priced and well-conceived,' Mr del Balzo says. In general, bankers are confident that realistically-priced issues will meet strong demand from international investors who, they say, have returned from their summer holidays with a positive outlook on the markets. As a result, they will be looking for the right investment opportunities to help reduce the high cash portions in their portfolios which are believed to be running at close to or above their limits. Mr Jerker Johansson, head of European equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley, detects a desire among investors to increase their exposure to cyclical companies which they believe are most likely to benefit from economic recovery. 'Cyclical companies are a large component in Europe,' he says. He adds that there is also a strong interest in telecom stocks, providing the pricing is reasonable. With supply likely to outweigh demand, pricing and the company itself are set to be the key issues this autumn and early next year, not the fact that a privatisation programme is under way. Ms Lorna Harnby, a European fund manager at Fleming Investment Management, says that her strategy will be to look at each issue on its individual merits. 'Just because it's a privatisation issue is not a good enough justification for investment,' she points out. In her view, investors are suffering from 'privatisation malaise. These issues are not a one-way ticket to make money and, if says. you look at the history of continental privatisation, that view has been vindicated.' Another reason for what she describes as her 'healthy scepticism' is that the forthcoming flood of privatisation issues across Europe is not accompanied by a strong equity culture or a strong ideological reason. 'There is less incentive to make sure that the small investor does well . . . one reason is that the governments need money to fund their huge budget deficits,' she says. Evidence of a strong economic recovery in Germany has provided the government with a favourable backdrop to the latest stage of its privatisation of Lufthansa, the national airline. Although the company has seen a dramatic turnaround in its fortunes over the last two years as a result of extensive restructuring, some analysts believe that its earnings will receive a further boost from a buoyant domestic market. By not participating in Lufthansa's capital increase which is currently under way, the government will reduce its stake from 51.4 per cent to about 41 per cent by offering 3.9m shares to investors. The government also hopes to sell a further 2.1m existing shares, thereby reducing its stake further to around 36 per cent. The government has placed considerable importance on involving international investors in the Lufthansa offering so as to gain their support for the planned privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the country's telephone monopoly. The initial privatisation should raise DM10bn to DM20bn, which could not be absorbed by domestic investors alone. Bankers have criticised Lufthansa's decision to exclude US investors from its offering, since by so doing it has cut out the single most important source of equity capital in the world. However, US investors are expected to be invited to next year's sale of shares in Lufthansa and the Deutsche Telekom offering. The Deutsche Telekom share sale is unlikely to occur before 1996 but investors wanting exposure to the sector will be able to choose from a variety of issues before then. The Greek government is seeking to raise Dollars 1bn from the sale of 25 per cent of shares in OTE, the Greek telecoms monopoly. It hopes to sell 75 per cent of the shares abroad. The offer should take place before the end of the year. The Portuguese government also plans to sell off 25 per cent of the country's telecom company early next year. The transaction could run into several hundred million dollars, bankers say. This offering could well coincide with the next stage in the privatisation of Italy's telecoms holding company, Stet.</p>

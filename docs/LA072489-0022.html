			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO REACHES ACCORD ON RESTRUCTURING DEBT;  </P> <P> AGREEMENT WITH FOREIGN LENDERS TO PROVIDE NEW LOANS, WILL EASE NATION'S OVERALL  BURDEN  </P> <P> Mexico reached agreement in principle with foreign governments and banks Sunday  on a massive new debt financing package -- the first under the new Third World  debt-reduction strategy proposed last March by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas  F. Brady.  </P> <P> The landmark accord, which will provide the Mexican government with some $3  billion in new loans and debt relief over three years, will for the first time  reduce both the country's overall debt burden and the amount it must pay  foreign creditors each year. The $3-billion-plus figure will come from a  mixture of about half new loans and half debt relief.  </P> <P> The idea is to ease Mexico's debt burden enough to enable the government to  finance its planned overhaul of the economy and still allow for economic  growth. Under the previous Third World debt plan, the country's overall debt  burden steadily increased.  </P> <P> The accord was viewed as a victory for Brady and the Bush Administration, which  had hoped to portray the Mexican agreement as a "test case" of the secretary's  new debt-reduction plan. It also was expected to bolster politically the  government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, whose party has been in  increasing difficulty at home.  </P> <P> The pact was announced jointly late Sunday by Salinas and a 15-member Bank  Advisory Committee, which represents 500 U.S. and foreign commercial banks that  have been lending regularly to Mexico over the past decade.  </P> <P> Both U.S. and Mexican officials hailed the new accord as a major turning point  in the seven-year-old global debt problem and said they expect it to serve as a  precedent for applying the new Brady Plan, as the debt-reduction proposal is  known, to other large Latin American debtors. Venezuela already has begun  negotiations with commercial banks.  </P> <P> Brady said the agreement is "a major step forward in the implementation of the  strengthened (U.S.) debt strategy." He said it would provide "significant debt-  and debt-service reduction for Mexico as well as new money to support Mexico's  economic growth."  </P> <P> President Salinas announced the agreement in a nationally televised speech,  saying it evolved out of one of the most "complex and tense negotiations" in  the history of Mexico and international finance.  </P> <P> "This opens the trail that other countries with similar problems can convert  into a road," Salinas said in his 15-minute speech.  </P> <P> He warned the country, however, that "we cannot expect to see spectacular  results overnight." Mexico's resumed growth will be gradual, he said, adding  that the government will continue to support a wage and price control agreement  signed with unions and businesses valid through next march.  </P> <P> Mexicans' initial reaction to news of the agreement was glowing. "The package  is excellent," said Rogelio Ramirez de la O, an economist and private  consultant.  </P> <P> "The stock exchange over the next week is going to go through the roof," he  said. "Expectations in Mexico are going to be very positive. This will raise  the optimism of the Mexican private sector in the future of the economy."  </P> <P> He said that the Mexican government's original assertion that it needed a 50%  debt reduction was "just a negotiating position" and that this package is  "absolutely enough" to turn around Mexico's stagnant economy. He predicted  positive growth for this year of as much as 3%.  </P> <P> Luis Rubio, director of the private Banking and Finance Institute, a Mexico  City-based think tank, said, "That sounds like a superb agreement." If debt and  interest rate reductions are combined with new money, "it looks like an  enormous discount, much more than what anyone had been expecting," he said.  </P> <P> "The main thing here was that Mexican savers and investors believe that the  debt will be manageable and the country won't be in permanent recession," he  said. "This package accomplishes that."  </P> <P> Besides the actual reduction of a portion of Mexico's debt, Sunday's accord has  another new element: It assures the Mexican government a continuing flow of new  bank loans for the next four years, instead of just 12 more months. The  Mexicans had insisted on this feature as a way to ensure stability and help  stem the flight of capital.  </P> <P> The package includes these provisions:  </P> <P>  -- Commercial banks that have made loans to Mexico in the past will first have  the option of providing Mexico with new loans amounting to 25% of the total  they have outstanding. They then will seek to reduce Mexico's debt burden on  the rest by exchanging a portion of that debt for 30-year bonds whose interest  payments are guaranteed with money from U.S.-issued zero-coupon bonds or money  lent by the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Some $7 billion  already has been assembled for this purpose.  </P> <P> The effect of the securities would be to reduce the portion of Mexico's debt  that they cover by 35%. Banks that choose not to make new loans must discount a  larger portion of their existing debt. Details of how much each bank will  choose from each option still must be worked out, but U.S. officials estimated  that the provision could net Mexico some $10 billion in debt reduction over  three years.  </P> <P> Along with the other options to be given commercial banks, Mexico also would  offer to trade shares of stock in state-run corporations that it hopes to sell  to private investors. These offerings could cover up to $1 billion a year worth  of debt. Mexico now owes $107 billion to foreign creditors, some $54 billion of  which is owed to commercial banks from the United States, Europe and Japan.  </P> <P>  -- The interest rates for any new loans that the banks provide will be 6.25%,  well below the 11.3% that prevailed when the current talks began or the 9.1%  rates in force this past week. How much Mexico saves under that arrangement  will depend upon how much in new loans the commercial banks decide to make, but  ballpark estimates suggest that Mexico could save about $1.6 billion a year  from the lowered interest rates. The banks also could lower interest on  existing loans by trading them for bonds, just as they would under the  debt-reduction portion of the program.  </P> <P>  -- In addition, both Japan and Spain will provide new loans to Mexico. Japan  is expected to offer $2 billion in new lending. Spain's contribution has not  yet been decided.  </P> <P>  -- As is traditional in such negotiations, Sunday's accord was only on the  basic outlines of the agreement. Both sides said details would have to be  worked out over the next several weeks, and Mexico may not actually realize the  benefits of the new accord for two to three months.  </P> <P> In the interim, Mexico will receive some $2 billion in temporary "bridge" loans  from other industrial countries, including the United States. How much each  country will provide still has not been worked out. The bridge loans will be  repaid with money from the new loans that Mexico will receive.  </P> <P> "Finally, the system has an answer," an ecstatic senior Mexican official said  after the talks ended late Sunday. "The important thing here is that this is  not just for Mexico, but that it will provide a way to help other countries  that are suffering with this burden."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Marjorie Miller, in Mexico City, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

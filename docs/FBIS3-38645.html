Kinkel said in Bonn today that "the senseless  killing must stop." The political and military leaders of the  parties to the conflict must not be allowed to continue their  war at the expense of the people in former Yugoslavia any longer.    Kinkel had telephoned his American, British, and French  counterparts in advance. Kinkel announced that the 12 foreign  ministers of the European Union would discuss strategies and  measures for solving the conflict again on Monday [7 February].  He stressed that ways to end the war would have to be found  with the United States.</p>

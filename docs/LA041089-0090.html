			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHORTAGE OF $4,000 AT GW COLLEGE INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Golden West College officials have determined that at least $4,000 in college  funds are missing and have asked the Huntington Beach Police Department to  investigate for possible fraud.  </P> <P> John D. Renley, vice chancellor for human resources of Coast Community College  District, which governs Golden West, said Sunday that the missing funds are  from weekend swap-meet receipts at the 2-year Huntington Beach school.  </P> <P> The college, which is situated at Golden West and Edinger streets, rents  parking lot space to swap meet vendors on Saturdays and Sundays, and the  rentals bring in about $250,000 a year, Renley said. He said it may be  determined that the $4,000 shortfall is actually more as the investigation,  which is in the early stages, is completed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Met With Police  </P> <P> "I met with Huntington Beach police last Friday, and they need additional  material that I will be giving their fraud investigators on Monday," Renley  said. He added that the college district also will continue its own  investigation of the financial discrepancy at the school, which has an  enrollment of 14,000 students.  </P> <P> Renley said that Gary Sperling, an associate dean at Golden West College and  the administrator in charge of the swap-meet program and other community  service activities, was put on paid administrative leave March 17, the day  after tipsters told college officials something was amiss with swap-meet funds.  </P> <P> Sperling could not be reached for comment on Sunday. Renley stressed that  Sperling is not being accused of anything and that putting him on paid leave  was an administrative move while an investigation took place.  </P> <P> Renley said the college district's initial probe has determined "that funds are  missing, and we don't know if it's an accounting or a clerical error." The  $4,000 specifically unaccounted for are swap-meet funds for the month of  February, Renley said.  </P> <P> "Someone came to the district office (in Costa Mesa) on March 16 and talked to  one of our officials and indicated there was a discrepancy in some of the funds  from swap meets," Renley said.  </P> <P> Renley said the initial investigation centered on the months of December,  January and February. He said that the probe found an apparent excess of $2,000  from swap meets logged in December, and an apparent shortage of $2,000 from the  swap meets in January. The February receipts showed an apparent shortage of  $4,000, Renley said.  </P> <P> "The accounting system is not working," Renley said, referring to the  discrepancies found on the books for those 3 months. "We will now be looking  into the records for the past 2 years."  </P> <P> Renley said he did not know how long it will take for an investigation to be  completed. "We'd like to get this resolved pretty soon," he said.  </P> <P> Renley said information about the fund discrepancies was given to Coast  Community College District trustees at their meeting Wednesday. The trustees,  through the college district headquarters in Costa Mesa, govern Golden West and  two other community colleges.  </P></p>

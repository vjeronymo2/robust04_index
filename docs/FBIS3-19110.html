			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Munich (DPA) -- In 1994, on an annual average,  FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt (Free Democratic Party of  Germany) expects approximately 450,000 more unemployed than last  year, despite an economic growth of 1 to 1.5 percent. The  reduction of jobs in large enterprises is continuing and cannot  be balanced by new jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises,  Rexrodt said at the opening of the 46th International Trade Fair  (IHM) in Munich (until 20 March) on Saturday [12 March].    The end of the employment crisis can be expected in 1995 at  the earliest, with a presumable growth of 2 to 2.5 percent.  Rexrodt, Trade President Heribert Spaeth, and Bavarian Minister  President Edmund Stoiber (Christian Social Union) paid tribute  to the latest wage agreements and the first step toward more  flexible working hours as a step in the right direction. Labor  costs are too high, it was stated. [passage omitted]</p>

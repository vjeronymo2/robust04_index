Male and female citizens, I have the honor to address you today  while the country is about to encounter a decisive stage in its  history. The roots of the political crisis that is storming our  country go back to the last few years. The crisis grew under  the overall weakness of the state and its institutions, and it  started to grow further and expand with the passing of time  until it reached its peak in October 1988 when an explosion  occurred. This exposed other sides of the crisis in the  economic, social, and security spheres, and every opportunity  became available to internal and external destructive elements  to achieve dubious objectives based on the distortion of facts  as a means of consolidating a feeling of failure and waste among  deprived citizens.    The spread of selfishness, egocentricity, and the dominance  of narrow partisan perceptions over wider national interests  contributed to the further complication of the crisis.    After this brief review of the nature of the crisis, it may  be useful to recall its major causes:    Political causes:    1. The weakness of the political system that provided the  opportunity for parasitic [tufayli] political tendencies and  groups with vested interests to reach many positions of  responsibility in the economy, administration, and other  sensitive state bodies;    2. Blatant contradictions between the programs and ideas of  some parties, and their noncompliance with the terms of the  Constitution, which clearly define the nation's ideals and its  firmly-established values;    3. The prevalence of party over national affiliation in many  parties and their narrow understanding of pluralism and  democratic practice in their effort to attain power;    4. The wavering of public opinion and its lack of concern  due  to loss of confidence in the authorities as a result of the  contradiction between the authorities' public declarations and  actual practices, and as a result of dissatisfaction with the  programs of many parties.    Economic causes:    1. The mismanagement of the economy;    2. The disruption in the manufacturing sectors in general as  a result of the repeated restructuring that has become the main  characteristic of management for many years;    3. The destructive squandering of the country's hard  currency  reserves and other financial resources through the use of  demagogic slogans;    4. The use of short-term loans to cover the state's deficit  caused by spending and consumption, a matter that has led to an  increase in the servicing of foreign debts that were eating into  three-quarters of the country's financial resources at the end  of 1993;    5. The encouragement of the smuggling phenomenon through the  opening of borders without providing the necessary measures for  the protection of the national economy.    Social causes:    1. The rise in unemployment as a result of putting a brake  on  investment, development, and as a result of the continual  shedding of manpower in organizations;    2. The state's abandonment of its social role, particularly  in the field of housing and jobs to which attention had been  paid in the last few years;    3. Infractions by some of the institutions of the  administration in the form of widespread bureaucratic abuses:  Graft, nepotism, and breaking the law in many cases;    4. The unequal sharing of national income.    All these causes have led to the aggravation and  deterioration of the crisis and although matters have become  more complex, it is quite possible to contain them and find  suitable and gradual solutions to tackling them.    This requires, first of all, goodwill from all the sides and  the concerted efforts of all the sincere patriots and upright  citizens in all social strata, parties, societies, vocational  groupings, factories, farms, schools, and universities in order  to arrive at a political solution that responds to the  aspirations of our people and that would match the greatness of  Algeria and its historical revolution and its contemporary  values. At the same time, they should show wisdom and a spirit  of true patriotism and place the interest of the country above  all considerations and adhere to the unchanging historic and  spiritual values of the Algerian people, and discard for good  all aspects of violence in political action.    Within this framework, the National People's Army has  repeatedly given proof of its good intentions. Thus, its' full  readiness to contribute in an effective manner to the search for  a solution that might take the country out of the current  political crisis and its' withdrawal from the political scene  for the past five years are clear proof of its respect for the  people's will following the adoption of the 1989 Constitution.  The National People's Army's withdrawal from political life  does not, however, mean that it will remain with its' hands tied  when there are mistakes and serious abuses that have threatened  and are still threatening the people's fate and the future of  the nation as a whole.    I would also like to point out here that the Army's  withdrawal from the political scene means, furthermore, that the  military will not henceforth accept being an instrument of  political struggle or anyone's ambitions.    This is a principled stance by the Army; there will be no  moving away from it and nor should it be subjected to any  trickery or manipulation.    On the other hand, the agreement of the Army to the request  of the political class to be present at the National Dialogue  Commission does not in any way mean going back on this  principle, rather the opposite. The National People's Army, as  a patriotic melting pot, should always be alongside the patriots  who want to get the country out of the crisis that it has been  enduring as a result of the methods of previous management.    The matter here concerns patriotic action, which should be  an  example followed by all the political and social partners as it  would lead them to shoulder their responsibilities before  history and carry out their tasks before the nation. The  National People's Army adheres to its well-known principles that  derive from the ideals of the patriotic movement and the  declaration of the glorious November revolution, in which Islam  remains a reference point for civilized development and the  natural framework for social enlightenment as practiced by our  nation throughout the ages.    In these difficult circumstances, the Army considers  participation in overcoming the crisis as a patriotic matter  that is binding on all. Anyone who retreats, or acts according  to their own whims or personal or partisan ambitions will, in  actual fact, be expressing their own failure and not the failure  of society or of the political formations as a whole. This is  because the country is approaching the national concord  conference and also an interim period that will open up a new  era for the Algerian people through which it can regain  confidence in it's ability, and choose it's leaders and it's  political institutions quite freely and away from any pressures  or misrepresentations.    We would like to assert very strongly here that any solution  to the crisis lies in the ability of the political classes to  surmount narrow-mindlessness and partisan interests and to be up  to the real tasks.    Fortunately, our political class does include many men and  women who are very patriotic and sincere and who are determined  to face up to the challenges, surmount short-term interests and  give momentum to the real changes for which our people have been  calling.    We see this change in the form of a clean break with past  practices and the methods of management at all political,  economic, and social levels.    The break, in which we believe and for which we are calling,  should make a radical change in state institutions and functions  by creating new criteria for them.    Given the colossal nature of the crisis and its  complications, and given the radical nature of the changes that  must be brought about, the National People's Army believes that  such a break, to which our people aspire, will be achieved  through the creation of a new national political system.    This new national system will consolidate true democracy,  guarantee all individual and collective liberties, put a final  end to political, economic, cultural and ideological monopolies,  and help with the emergence of new men capable of bringing about  these changes, the reification of the nation's aspirations for  peace, fraternity, advancement, and the restoration of Algeria's  standing and its position among nations.    In order to achieve all that, the National People's Army  addresses a call to all male and female Algerians who are loyal  to their homeland, and assures them that it will do its utmost  to prepare the right circumstances to enable them to offer their  contributions in order to save the country and return it to safe  grounds.    May God help us all to succeed in doing what is good for the  country. Glory and eternal life to our honorable martyrs.  Peace and God's blessings be upon you.</p>

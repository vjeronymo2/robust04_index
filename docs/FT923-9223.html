			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rallies on government support plans INVESTORS welcomed reports of the government's economic support measures and share prices rallied, with the Nikkei average briefly breaking through 16,000, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained a net 291.05 at 15,983.64 on arbitrage- related purchases by dealers and small-lot buying by foreigners and institutional investors. It opened at the day's low of 15,718.09 and rose to 16,074.47 before profit-taking emerged in the afternoon. Volume was thin but improved from 143m shares to 180m. Traders noted increased interest from investors but said buy orders were made in small lots. Advances led declines by 512 to 409, with 154 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 13.17 to 1,213.34, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was off 0.32 at 977.67. Reports that life insurance companies were shifting cash from money markets into equities also helped sentiment. Life insurers said the government's reported plans to buy real estate held by banks as collateral for bad loans were encouraging. 'It seems that the government is finally becoming serious about supporting the economy and the stock market,' commented an official at Sumitomo Life. Traders said some foreign investors have also started to shift funds from overseas stock markets to Japan. 'US pension funds are putting long term money into the market,' said Mr Ross Purdie at SG Warburg. Bank issues rallied on the government support measures. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y50 to Y1,760 and Fuji Bank Y30 to Y1,360. Real estate companies were also higher, with Mitsui Fudosan rising Y11 to Y820. High-technology blue chips moved forward on bargain hunting, Hitachi by Y30 to Y760 and NEC by Y17 to Y782. Fujitsu, however, fell Y13 to Y575 on reports that it would incur a consolidated net loss of Y10bn for the interim term to September. Company officials acknowledged the figure but added that the group would post a profit for the full year. Fujitsu will also halt production at its semiconductor plant in San Diego. Dealers continued to liquidate holdings in speculative theme stocks. Meiji Milk Products, still the market's leading active, receded Y7 to Y797 and Mochida Pharmaceutical lost Y110 to Y2,670. Marui, the department store, firmed Y30 to Y1,030 on speculation that it would be included in the Nikkei index. Market participants expect a reshuffle of index component stocks in October. In Osaka, the OSE average recovered 39.98 to 17,573.87 in volume of 26.3m shares. Roundup THE PACIFIC Basin markets were mostly easier yesterday. SEOUL fell to its lowest close since December 1987 on rumours that Daewoo chairman Mr Kim Woo-choong is to establish a new political party to contest the presidential elections due later this year. The composite index shed 8.15 to 493.33. Daewoo Group companies declined sharply and the suspension of garment maker Hyupjin Enterprise further dampened sentiment. SINGAPORE was depressed by disappointing half-year results from Far East Levingston Shipbuilding. The Straits Times Industrial index slipped 13.72 to 1,442.03. FELS weakened 40 cents to SDollars 3.08 while Keppel, its parent group, fell 35 cents to SDollars 6.40. HONG KONG lost further ground in dull trading. The Hang Seng index dipped 18.54 to 5,841.24 in turnover of HKDollars 1.69bn. Hutchison Whampoa eased 20 cents to HKDollars 15.60 on rumours that it will announce a rights issue today when it reports interim results. TAIWAN rose on news of a fall in inflation in July. The weighted index advanced 46.73, or 1.1 per cent, to 4,134.91 in turnover of TDollars 20.7bn. MANILA declined after Philippine Long Distance Telephone reported lower than expected first-half earnings. The composite index lost 6.13 to 1,485.85 in combined turnover of 264m pesos. PLDT fell 20 pesos to 1,060 pesos. NEW ZEALAND was driven lower by falls in some leading stocks. The NZSE-40 index ended 11.48 off at 1,549.85 after turnover of NZDollars 24m.

Retailers suffered, with Coles Myer down 28 cents at ADollars 10.92, while banks further weakened. KUALA LUMPUR's composite index eased 0.96 to 602.58. RJ Reynolds fell 20 cents to MDollars 3.32 after announcing that it was to cut the price of one of its cigarette brands. BANGKOK improved on rises in bank, construction materials and finance stocks. The SET index put on 7.03 to 761.51 in high turnover of Bt9.84bn. BOMBAY fell for the third day in a row as institutional demand could not offset continued nervous selling.

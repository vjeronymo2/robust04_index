			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, head of the </F> Israeli Arab delegation currently visiting Syria, by 'Isam Dari,  in Damascus on 9 March]    [Text] [Dari] We asked delegation head 'Abd-al-Wahhab  Darawshah for his impressions of his visit to Syria and the  meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and members of the  delegation. He said:    [Begin recording] [Darawshah] We met with the president to  perform a pan-Arab, social, and humanitarian duty, to offer  condolences on the death of his son Basil, may God have mercy  upon his soul. That is the primary objective of our visit. The  president received us very warmly, as a great father of all the  sons of the Arab nation. He welcomed us, and gave us a detailed  briefing on Syria's position. I can say the president is a  vital scholar for our Arab masses everywhere. He explained that  Syria's strategic position is a peaceful position. Syria wants  to achieve a just and comprehensive peace based on international  legitimacy. He pointed to the UN resolutions, particularly  Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. He said Syria wants to achieve  the peace of the brave, the peace that guarantees the end of  Israeli occupation of all Arab territories, not just the Syrian  Golan. He said he wants the implementation of the land for  peace principle, Israel's withdrawal in return for peace. He  said Syria has a lofty stand, a militant stand, a stand of pride  and dignity. He said Syria's position is based on free Syrian  Arab will, and that Syria will not submit to pressure from  outside to adopt any particular position. He said: We adopt our  stands based on our strategic vision, and on our belief in the  Arab cause and Arab rights.    [Dari] You toured Damascus and some other areas. What is  your impression of Syria and the Golan?    [Darawshah] Our meeting with President al-Asad; our meetings  with the sons of our people in Syria; our tours of the Golan,  the al-Qunaytirah Governorate, and the Damascus Governorate; our  meetings with the brother governors; and our meetings with the  masses of our people in markets and streets; as well as our  meeting with the masses of our Palestinian people in the  al-Yarmuk camp and elsewhere, have proved to us that this  country, Syria, of which we are proud, is an oasis of freedom,  dignity, and pride, and that all the requirements of honorable  life are in Syria. Basic needs are available at prices that are  cheaper than in any other state in the world. I have toured the  world. Now, I have learned that the cheapest prices are in  Syria. Commodities and goods are first class, very excellent.  They are high-standard Syrian-made commodities. This conflicts  with the propaganda campaign launched against Syria in the past,  on the pretext that it is a police state, a state that  suppresses freedoms, a state where Jews are persecuted, and a  state that suffers a shortage of the basic needs. We have found  that everything is abundant, that freedom is available, and that  loftiness and dignity characterize every action by Syria, led by  President Hafiz al-Asad, may God preserve him.    [Dari] Mr. 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah, you have come from the  occupied Arab territories. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre, the situation became very tense. Can you tell us your  impression of the massacre and the Israeli army's actions  against Palestinian Arab citizens, not only in Hebron, but also  in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip?    [Darawshah] We have continuous contact with the sons of our  Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. We are very  close to them, to their feelings, and their stands. We support  their cause and their persistent struggle to achieve freedom and  independence and to kick out the occupation. We bless the  valiant intifadah of the sons of our Palestinian people to get  rid of this occupation. Based on this, every time anything  takes place, we call upon each other and rise up to defend the  sons of our people. Following the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre,  the heinous massacre perpetrated by settlers protected by the  Israeli army, we visited Hebron, offered condolences to the  martyrs' families, visited the wounded in hospitals, and met  with the masses of our people in the city of Hebron and its  governorate. We denounced this massacre. We call on the  Israeli Government to deter the settlers, to disarm them, and to  deport them from Hebron, from Qiryat Arba', the accursed  settlement, and from all settlements established in the occupied  Arab territories. We call for international protection of the  Palestinian people, because the Israeli occupation not only did  not protect the Palestinian people, but also allowed the  settlers to carry out repressive acts against the Palestinian  people. The Israeli army itself has carried out repressive and  suppressive acts against the sons of our Palestinian people.  The massacre that began at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was  continued later by the Israeli army, to the extent that the  number of martyrs and wounded was much greater than the number  of those killed at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque.    [Dari] Are you trying to say the holy Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre has confirmed the impossibility of coexistence between  settlers and Palestinian citizens?    [Darawshah] There will be no coexistence under occupation.  There will be no coexistence as long as settlements continue.  Therefore, all the settlers must be evicted and returned to  Israel. These settlements should be turned into homes for  Palestinian refugees and evacuees. Let them return and take  these settlements as their houses. This is how we can achieve  peace. This also applies to the occupied Syrian Golan.  Settlers there must be evicted, the Golan must be returned in  full, and these settlements should be turned into houses for  Syrian evacuees who return to the Syrian Golan.    [Dari] Thank you.

Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, EC research commissioner, yesterday fleshed out plans to provide venture capital for smaller businesses as part of the EC's fourth framework programme for research and development. The Commission would like approval for an increase in total research funding from Ecu2.4bn to Ecu4.2bn in 1997, concentrated on certain key technologies. Mr Pandolfi said funding for 1993-97 should also include Ecu100m of funds to underpin low-interest loans from financial institutions.</p>

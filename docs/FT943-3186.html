			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Prison policy unchanged Sir, I am responding to points made by Mrs Paddy Seligman in her letter published in several newspapers and referred to in your report 'Howard accused on jail rule change' (September 13). Neither the home secretary nor the prison service has sanctioned any relaxation of security for IRA prisoners or provision of any special privileges. When the special unit which held the IRA prisoners at Whitemoor was first opened, in July 1992, it was not general practice to conduct rub-down searches of visitors to prisoners in all such units. Following a review of policies, instructions were issued by prison service headquarters in May of last year which required full rub-down searches for all visitors in all special secure units. That policy has applied at Whitemoor since the reopening of the special secure unit in June 1993. It will be a matter for the inquiry which is now under way to confirm that this policy was being fully implemented. The prison service policy is that no special privileges are given to IRA prisoners that are in any way different from other prisoners of the same security category. Maintenance of security is the top priority for the prison service. Our policy is to ensure adequate staff are available to maintain security. There have been no reductions in the number of security staff at Whitemoor, which is fully staffed. Derek Lewis, director-general, HM Prison Service, Cleland House, Page Street, London SW1P 4LN</p>

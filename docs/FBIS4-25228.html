			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 (AFP)--Chinese President Jiang  Zemin assured an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)  delegation here Tuesday that China would take a "positive role"  in dealing with the North Korea nuclear crisis. Jiang told the  head of the multinational delegation, Philippine parliamentary  speaker Jose de Venecia, that the time had come for intensified  creative and patient diplomacy to avoid further deterioration of  the situation and to ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.  China will play "a positive role, not a negative role" in  dealing with the crisis, a Philippine embassy press release  quoted Jiang as saying.    His remarks came as the United Nations started informally  debating possible sanctions against North Korea which, amid  suspicions that it is developing a nuclear bomb, has refused to  allow international inspectors examine crucial parts of its  nuclear facitilies. China, one of the five permanent members of  the UN Security Council, has so far rejected the idea of  sanctions against Pyongyang which it says would only increase  tensions on the Korean peninsula.    Jiang's comments were made in response to a proposal by de  Valencia for active mediation in the nuclear crisis by China and  ASEAN.    Meanwhile, Jiang also attempted to allay regional concerns  over China's growing military might. China "will not be a  threat to its neighbours," Jiang told de Valencia, adding that  the 20-percent hike China's national defence budget this year to  52.04 billion yuan (six billion dollars) was the result of  inflationary adjustments.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Top annuity rates ANNUITY rates rose slightly last month. According to the Annuity Bureau (11-12 Hanover Square, London, W1R 9BD, tel: 071-495 1495), which produces the table, Generali has raised its rates by 1 per cent and Royal Life by 2 per cent in the past week. This follows an increase in long gilt yields. Life expectancy is the other determinant of annuity rates, and a few companies will 'underwrite' an annuity if medical evidence shows that your life expectancy is reduced. According to Billy Burrows, of Annuity Direct, two companies, Sun Life and Providence Capitol, lead the market, while Prudential and Norwich Union will underwrite an annuity on request. This is done by adding notionally to the number of years - usually up to a maximum of 10 - you have lived already and giving an annuity on this basis.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              ANNUITY RATES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Level annuity with 100% spouse's annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 55/Female 50          Annuity    Male 60/Female 55         Annuity Royal Life           pounds8723.13    Royal Life          pounds9020.07 Prudential           pounds8691.12    Prudential          pounds8967.84 Scottish Widows      pounds8651.40    Scottish Widows     pounds8856.84  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Level annuity with 50% spouse's annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 55/Female 50          Annuity    Male 60/Female 55         Annuity Prudential           pounds9290.28    Royal Life          pounds9805.58 Royal Life           pounds9271.87    Prudential          pounds9782.40 Equitable Life       pounds9197.04    Equitable Life      pounds9765.96  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating by 3% per annum, 100% spouse's annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 55/Female 50          Annuity    Male 60/Female 55         Annuity Prudential           pounds6323.76    Royal Life          pounds6724.77 Royal Life           pounds6315.34    Prudential          pounds6678.00 Equitable Life       pounds6084.00    RNPF Nurses         pounds6518.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annuity escalating by 3% per annum, 50% spouse's annuity  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Male 55/Female 50          Annuity    Male 60/Female 55         Annuity Prudential           pounds6946.20    Royal Life          pounds7559.30 Royal Life           pounds6939.03    Prudential          pounds7493.76 Equitable Life       pounds6819.00    RNPF Nurses         pounds7485.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All annuities are compulsory purchase.

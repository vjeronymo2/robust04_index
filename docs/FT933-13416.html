			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / German potash mine wins reprieve THE Treuhand, the agency charged with restructuring and privatising eastern German industry, has reversed its decision to close a loss-making potash mine, in a move to ensure its radical plan to merge western and eastern Germany's potash sector is implemented. The decision to give a reprieve to 700 jobs at the Bischofferoder mine in the state of Thuringia follows a two-week hunger strike by 47 employees. Five hunger strikers have been admitted to hospital. The Treuhand and the state government propose that the mine should stay open temporarily to save jobs until 1995. The Treuhand originally envisaged closing Bischofferoder as part of a package to merge Kali + Salz, a BASF subsidiary, with Mitteldeutschen Kali, the east German producer. With the merger, the Treuhand aimed to save the remaining five eastern German mines, and reduce capacity in an industry plagued by overcapacity. Last year, 35m tonnes were produced worldwide but less than 25m tonnes sold. Before 1989, eastern Germany's potash mines were producing more than 3m tonnes a year with a workforce of 33,000, compared to western Germany's annual production of 2.4m with 11,000 employees. As part of its merger plan, the Treuhand has already made two unprecedented moves. Firstly, it proposed that the western Germany potash sector should share the burden in reducing the workforce. The number of jobs at Kali + Salz will be reduced by 1,744 to 4,488, and at Mitteldeutschen Kali by 1,884 to 3,012. Secondly, the Treuhand has taken a 49 per cent stake, worth DM1bn, in the merger, with an option to sell its share after five years. Mr Helmut Ballon, the Treuhand's director of mining and non-metallic minerals, has said: 'We had to think of reducing capacity. We decided on a radical approach which would not only save jobs, but perhaps give a new lease of life to Germany's potash industry.' The DM1bn will be earmarked for restructuring Mitteldeutschen Kali and covering losses. The merger followed 48 unsuccessful attempts to seek foreign partners for the east German industry. It will need European Community approval because it will create a virtual monopoly in Germany's potash sector. A Treuhand official yesterday expected the Commission would rule in favour of the merger, since total German capacity would be reduced to an annual 3.1m tonnes. A decision is expected next month.</p>

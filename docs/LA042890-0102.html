			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLLYWOOD PARK;  </P> <P> KENNY BLACK IS HAPPY TO BE BACK  </P> <P> Even though sixth place was the best Kenny Black could manage with his three  mounts, it was a gratifying return for the jockey Friday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> "In the post parade for the first race, people were yelling things like, 'Go  get 'em, Kenny' and 'Glad to have you back,' " he said. "It was nice. I even  got a small standing ovation."  </P> <P> Corey Black's older brother, 26, hadn't ridden locally since 1984, except for  two mounts in 1986. A regular in the top 10, he tested positive for cocaine in  the summer of '84 and developed a drug problem.  </P> <P> That winter, he was suspended by the stewards and has been something of a  vagabond since. Over the years, he has ridden at such outposts as St. George  and Beaver, Utah; Globe, Ariz., and Farmington, N.M.  </P> <P> Married and the father of two, Black says he is a changed man and hopes to  become a Southland fixture again. Always in a battle with weight, he rode at  119 Friday.  </P> <P> After riding at the New Mexico State Fair in Albuquerque last fall, Black  served as his brother's agent briefly, then started exercising horses in hopes  of making a comeback.  </P> <P> He had a hearing before an officer of the California Horse Racing Board last  month, then was granted his jockey's license earlier this week.  </P> <P> "I've matured tons," he said after completing his first day back.  </P> <P> He finished ninth with 40-1 shot Notice Me Baby in the first race, 12th and  last with 109-1 outsider Current Climate in the second and sixth on 25-1 shot  Showerstime, who had the lead until tiring in the final eighth of a mile.  </P> <P> "I'm not making excuses or anything, but I was 18, driving a Porsche, making  $300,000-$400,000 a year and living in a half-million-dollar house," Black  said.  </P> <P> "It was life in the fast lane and 90% of the people in the fast lane back then  did drugs. It was the 'in' thing. I wasn't uncommon. I was going to do what I  wanted to do.  </P> <P> "I'm a complete family man now and I like it. When I married Kelly (two years  ago) and had two kids, I realized how much I was missing. Kelly turned my life  around.  </P> <P> "When I was Corey's agent, it really wasn't me. I really got the itch again. I  want to give my family the things they deserve."  </P> <P> Black, who has hired Vince DeGregory as his agent, is named on three more  horses today -- Rosie's Lord Tudor, Gorbot and Gum Swapper -- and has two calls  Sunday.  </P> <P> A head better than Bruho in the El Rincon Handicap in his second start of the  year, Steinlen will spot six rivals nine to 16 pounds in the $110,000 Shoemaker  Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> Formerly named the Premiere, the Shoemaker will be run at a mile on the turf,  the same course where Steinlen had three seconds and a victory in four starts  last year. After being beaten a nose by Mister Wonderful in the American  Handicap last July 4, the Habitat horse rattled off five consecutive victories  en route to his Eclipse Award as the nation's top turf performer.  </P> <P> Jose Santos, who has ridden the 7-year-old in his last six races, will be  aboard Sunday as Steinlen carries 126 pounds, one more than in the El Rincon.  </P> <P> The horse he may have to fear most is Super May, who has blossomed in recent  months for Richard Mandella.  </P> <P> A 4-year-old son of Super Concorde, Super May has won four consecutive races,  most recently a three-quarter length decision over Royal Reach in the Santa  Gertrudes April 7. Royal Reach returned to capture the San Jacinto, the  closing-day feature at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Robbie Davis will again ride Super May, who had a nightmarish trip in his only  other try on the Hollywood Park grass as a 2-year-old.  </P> <P> Neil Drysdale will be represented by Nediym, who has been rested since a  disappointing try in Bill Shoemaker's final race Feb. 4, and Saudi Desert, who  was beaten at 4-5 in a Santa Anita allowance race.  </P> <P> Owned by Bruce McNall and Wayne Gretzky, Shining Steel was well beaten in the  El Rincon when he took off early. He's much more effective coming from behind,  as shown in his four-length victory March 17.  </P> <P> Preston and Brave Capade, who are also entered in the seventh race today, are  the other scheduled Shoemaker contestants.  </P> <P> Three days into the meeting, Kent Desormeaux tops the jockey standings after  three winners Friday.  </P> <P> Ninth at Santa Anita, even though he didn't compete in California until  mid-February, Desormeaux won the second race with favored Gibson's Choice, the  fifth on 9-1 longshot Cookie Bear and the seventh with Final Frontier. He has  five wins and four seconds in 18 mounts in Inglewood.  </P> <P> Eddie Delahoussaye and Pat Valenzuela each won twice Friday. Delahoussaye took  the feature on Dachi's Folly, who rallied from far behind, and the ninth with  7-1 outsider Chief's Image. Valenzuela scored aboard Pocketful of Class in the  fourth and Provident Ruler, a 12-1 longshot, in the sixth.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Stormy But Valid, who is tough on any surface, returns to the dirt today in the  $107,300 A Gleam Handicap at seven furlongs. Trained by Brian Mayberry, the  4-year-old Valid Appeal filly has won seven of 17 while earning $324,600. She  will be ridden by Gary Stevens and has five opponents -- Hot Novel, Sugarplum  Gal, Inverness Lady, What Has Been and Tis Juliet. . . . John Sadler is the  early leader in the trainers' race with three victories. He had two Friday --  Gibson's Choice and Pocketful of Class.  </P></p>

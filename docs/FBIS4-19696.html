			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has stated that the  coming days will be a turning point in the fight against  terrorism, and she called on the terrorists to surrender before  the arrival of summer. Ciller also condemned the Serbian  massacre of defenseless Bosnians, calling it the most  disgraceful event in the history of humanity. The prime minister  called on all concerned nations and international organizations  to fulfill their responsibilities urgently and with  determination to stop this human tragedy.    In a speech she delivered at the True Path Party's assembly  meeting, Ciller discussed the fight against terrorism, the new  radio and television law, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and her recent visit to the United States.    Ciller stressed that the fight against terrorism is  continuing as planned and in determination. The prime minister  noted that great success was achieved during the intense  operations concentrated around Agri and Tendurek Mountains  during the last week.    [Begin Ciller recording] We had previously announced that a  turning point regarding this issue would be reached during the  summer months and this plan is continuing successfully -- with  determination -- and it will be written in history as the  victory of the 50th government, with the True Path Party as its  major partner. [applause]    Dear friends, nowadays, dissolution and disintegration has  started amid the terrorists. We know that, within this  framework, the terrorists are conducting propaganda directed at  the young people and I would like to convey once more how wrong  this is. The propaganda advises not to surrender to the  security forces because they will be maltreated. This is  definitely wrong. I am once more calling on these young people:  The end of this road is distress. We are determined to  eradicate terrorism. Let the lives of these young people be  spared within this determination to eliminate terrorism. Let  them come and surrender themselves to the state. The state will  show affection to them. The state will embrace them and be just  toward them. [end recording]    Expressing her views on the law regulating radio and  television broadcasts, Ciller said that the aim of the law is  not to restrict broadcasts but rather to prevent broadcasts  which may harm public order and the country's peace and  security. Ciller explained that legal procedures similar to  the one adopted in Turkey exist in all Western countries.  Ciller said: Nowhere does the freedom of press and speech  imply encouraging acts of incitement, which disturb the  indivisible integrity and independence of the state as well as  the tranquillity and security of the people.    Ciller called the Serbian massacre of defenseless Bosnians  the most disgraceful incident in the history of mankind. Ciller  said these developments, which are exhausting the world's  patience, are also harming the confidence in the United Nations  and NATO, adding that Turkey is taking all necessary initiatives  on the issue.    [Begin Ciller recording] I am calling on all the world as I  have done from Tuzla: I am calling on all concerned nations and  international organizations to fulfill their duties urgently and  with determination to end the human tragedy in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and to save the crushed human pride. These  people have a right to self defense. The least that can be  done, if NATO and the United Nations are incapable of fulfilling  their duties, is the lifting of the embargo, and I am urging  once again that this step, at least, will be implemented  urgently. [end recording]    At the conclusion of her speech, Ciller briefed the party  members on her recent visit to the United States. Ciller said  that the real aim of her visit was to participate in the meeting  held by the Elie Wiesel Foundation. Stating that lately there  have been unjust allegations as to Turkey violating human rights  spreading in Europe and the United States, Ciller said that all  efforts in all forums will be exerted to prevent these rumors,  which have intensified especially after the immunities of  certain deputies were lifted.    [Begin Ciller recording] How do other countries react when  somebody arrives with another flag at the assembly; when there  is an attempt to take an oath in another language, outside the  official language; and when the contents of the oath are being  changed? What actions were taken in Belgium? In France? How  does the United States react to such a situation? I was happy  to see that when asked these questions, the answers were: We  would have done the same thing. However, we did not do the same  thing. We really did not do anything when these incidents were  taking place. Our determination regarding this issue and the  step we took in the assembly were undertaken in an environment  open to offensive proclamations by authorized persons and  institutions. The steps we took came after these persons, who  are accused of meeting with terrorists in the houses allocated  to the deputies, were charged with cooperating with murderers  and criminals. For that reason, our cause is just and we will  continue to explain our side. I am glad to see that the more we  explain the situation the more the realities are crystallizing.  [end recording]    Ciller said that during her visit to the United States she  had an opportunity to meet with the U.S. President Clinton and  discuss with him important foreign developments -- primarily  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Explaining that within this framework, she  also had an opportunity to explain to Clinton the economic  stability program, Ciller said that the U.S. Administration  expressed its open political support for the economic package.  However, Ciller continued, the IMF and the World Bank did not  influence the 5 April decisions.    [Begin Ciller recording] We made these decisions not to gain  the support of the IMF or the World Bank. We made these  decisions to be independent from them, because we believe they  are needed for the Turkish people's prosperity, before  unemployment spreads all over the country and people are laid  off en masse, before inflation reaches 4,000 or 5,000 percent,  and before the vicious circle in the economy becomes irrevocable.    I would like to say openly and with utmost sincerity that  these decisions would have been taken regardless of the IMF and  regardless of the World Bank support. These decisions were  reached not because the IMF or the World Bank wanted but because  they were needed for the prosperity of the Turkish people and  were taken independent of them. However, I was glad to see that  these organizations are supporting these economic measures.  This is very gratifying for us, because in this way we will be  able to reintegrate with the world money markets as well as  revive the credit mechanism which was getting disconnected.  [end recording]    Ciller added that they will solve the issues left to the  50th  government, and which are the result of years of errors,  undaunted and with determination.</p>

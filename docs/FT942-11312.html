			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: Rotherham runs true to form Labour last night held Rotherham with a reduced but rock-solid majority in a by-election result that augured badly for the Conservatives. The Tory candidate, Mr Nick Gibb, polled only 2,649 votes and was pushed firmly into third place by the Liberal Democrat candidate. The Tory share of the vote plummeted to 9.9 per cent from 23.7 per cent at the general election in April 1992. In previous elections, the Conservative vote in this recession-hit South Yorkshire coal and steel town had never fallen below 8,500. The turnout was low, however, at only 44 per cent, compared with nearly 72 per cent two years ago. In last night's poll, caused by the death of Mr Jimmy Boyce, Mr Denis MacShane, a former journalist, easily held the seat for Labour with a majority of 6,954 - down from 17,561 at the general election. Labour's share of the vote fell by more than 8 percentage points from 63.9 per cent to 55.6. A feature of the poll was the stronger-than-expected performance of Screaming Lord Sutch and the Monster Raving Loony party, which won 1,114 votes - its highest tally ever and only 1,500 votes fewer than the Conservative candidate. For the Liberal Democrats, Mr David Wildgoose made significant headway, lifting the party from third to a distant second with 7,958 votes. This represented 29.7 per cent of the vote, against 12.3 per cent two years ago.</p>

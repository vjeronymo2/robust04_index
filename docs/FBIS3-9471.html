			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Helsinki, March 24 (AFP) -- Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic expressed hope Thursday that negotiations  with separatist Serbs in the disputed Krajina region in southern  Croatia would lead to an overall ceasefire.    "I'm hopeful," Granic said at a brief press conference after  talks with Finnish leaders. Granic also said Zagreb was ready to  grant limited autonomy to Krajina Serbs but ruled out full  "independence" as demanded by local Serbs.    The first round of negotiations between Croatian officials  and Croatian Serb leaders in Zagreb were adjourned early  Wednesday but the two sides agreed to meet again next week. The  negotiations at the Russian Embassy were the first of its kind  to be held in Zagreb under the auspices of the United Nations  Protection Force (UNPROFOR). Granic, who arrived here Wednesday  evening on a 24-hour visit, had talks Thursday with Finnish  President Martti Ahtisaari, Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto,  parliamentary speaker Riitta Uosukainen and the chairman of the  parliamentary foreign affairs committee Pertti Paasio.    Granic said he had briefed Finnish leaders on the situation  in his country and Croatian policy on the former Yugoslavia.  Ahtisaari, who earlier this year was elected Finland's head of  state, was himself involved last year in Yugoslavia peace talks  in Geneva as a special representative of UN Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Helsinki was the last leg of Granic's  Nordic tour that also included stops in Oslo, Stockholm and  Copenhagen.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] AL-'ARABI has learned that the Israelis have  initiated contacts with oil companies operating in Egypt that  have discovered huge gas reserves. The Israeli ambassador in  Cairo, accompanied by a small delegation, visited Shell-Egypt  with the objective of starting practical steps in an Israeli  project to export Egyptian gas through a pipeline to Israel.    Shell announced that it had discovered the largest gas  reserves in the western desert, in the region of al-Abyad. The  reserves are estimated at 14 billion cubic feet. Despite the  fact that Oil Minister Hamdi al-Banbi announced that Egypt's  position on exporting gas is still under consideration, public  oil companies in Egypt do not generally adhere to the official  position and own shares in gas companies, in accordance with the  oil agreements, in exchange for investments in prospecting and  digging. It is likely that practical steps will be agreed upon  between Shell-Egypt and Israel, particularly because Shell is  decreasing its prospecting activities to save funds for the  investments that will be required to develop gas discoveries.    On the other hand, practical steps have already been taken  to  set up a refinery with the Israeli company Paz Adil, which is a  subsidiary of the Merhav investment group. This is being done  using two Egyptian businessmen as a cover. One of these men is  a prominent member of the National Democratic Party in  Alexandria. The other is reported to be an arms dealer.    An Israeli technical delegation will be arriving in Cairo  tomorrow to meet with a number of officials from Egyptian  companies after 1 January 1994. It is worth noting that the  head of the investment authority earlier denied that Israelis  were participating in a refinery and that the responsible  company is registered abroad to dodge the Arab boycott  officially enforced against Israel.</p>

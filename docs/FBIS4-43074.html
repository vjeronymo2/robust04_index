			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report]  <H5>  `Close as Possible' to Power Centers </H5>   As the opponents of Norwegian European Union [EU] membership  repeat their warnings about lost sovereignty and national  identity, those in favor of the EU have started stressing the  security/defense issues.    The daily AFTENPOSTEN on 3 May carried a guest commentary by  Iver Neumann, head of the foreign affairs/security studies  department at the Norwegian Institute for Foreign Affairs  Studies (NUPI), in which he contended that neither EU membership  nor NATO "can in and of itself determine the country's foreign  policy course." The issue is how Norway "best can balance" its  relationships with the three major political centers of power:  Norway must "work hard to be as close to the EU, the United  States, and Russia as it possibly can without alienating any of  the parties."    The geopolitical picture is not the whole picture, however,  because there are "fundamental" changes "in the distribution of  power in the international system and in the development of new  technology." The latter challenges are as significant as the  geopolitical ones for Norway's choice of foreign policy. The  international system is no longer founded on a balance of terror  between the superpowers: The new system has a nucleus  consisting of the "economic centers" of NAFTA, the EU, and  Japan, with a "periphery of regional challengers such as China,  Russia, and Iraq."    According to Neumann, there are three immediate  consequences.  First, the significance of the economic order for security  policy. At present the EU is the nucleus of economic Europe,  hence also of political Europe. This means that it is "a  security imperative for all European leaders to shepherd their  regions, nations, and states as close as possible to the center  of Europe, i.e., Brussels." Neumann compared the European  situation to a series of orbits: the EU superpowers as the inner  orbit, surrounded by the other EU members in a second orbit,  then the EEA [European Economic Area] members in a third orbit,  and finally the Central European countries (by virtue of their  agreements with the EU) in a fourth orbit. He pointed out that  Norway had some special leverage in this constellation: its  energy reserves, which, "from a Brussels perspective are all the  more interesting since alternative sources are primarily in a  less stable periphery -- Russia and the Middle East."    The second consequence of the new economic order is that  Europe's relationship to "its challengers in the periphery" has  become "regional." For example, Moscow's attempts at asserting  influence in Central Europe will "clash with those of Brussels."    The third consequence, according to Neumann, is that  cooperation within the Nordic region is no alternative to a  Brussels affiliation, because such cooperation would "not  necessarily bring the Nordic countries any closer to Brussels."  Norway's involvement in Baltic and Barents Sea regional  cooperation, on the other hand, has viability because the  cooperation "begins in the contested areas, and ties are made to  both of the rival power centers, Brussels and Moscow." (Both in  the Arctic Barents region and in the Baltic area, the Nordic  governments, together with the EU, WHO, and other countries and  international bodies are working with Russia and the former  Soviet republics in such fields as nuclear safety, pollution,  health, and commerce.) According to Neumann, this leads to  "confidence-building, concrete work at the local level, closer  ties with Brussels, a dialogue with Moscow, and a better  domestic understanding of the fact that transnational and  supranational political mechanisms have been added to the  international ones." Neumann called this "significant, in view  of Norway's historical trend of isolationism and noncommitting,  abstract internationalism."    Neumann pointed out that rapid advances in technology can  have a limiting effect on a small country's defense policy.  Regardless of what resources Norway devotes to defense, it will  not be able to carry a full assortment of weapons: "There is no  point in our trying to arm ourselves away from an unstable  neighbor like Russia; we will have to find other mechanisms to  tackle that challenge."    In the past, through its NATO membership, Norway has  "probably got as close to the United States as it could possibly  get." But the U.S.-European relationship will "weaken in the  future because the United States no longer is as interested in  Europe and the northern regions as it was during the Cold War."  Militarily, the shift is "out of NATO and over to the WEU."    Norway's "current focusing on the EU is a consequence of the  end of the Cold War. Its only competitor is a nascent  isolationism." A no to the EU will still mean having to get "as  close to Brussels as possible in as many areas as possible," nor  are there any alternatives to Norway's present course in its  policy toward an "increasingly regionally assertive Russia."  <H5>  NATO Shifting to WEU </H5>   An AFTENPOSTEN editorial on 3 May pointed out that making a  choice on membership in the EU is making a choice on "how we  choose to protect our national interests, not the least of which  are our security interests." The daily pointed out that although  there may be no "immediate, acute risk, it would be foolhardy to  preclude that we could find ourselves in a position of extreme  danger in the coming years." The editorial recalled the short  span, 10 years, from the "unbridled peace optimism" of Europe in  the late l920's to a new world war. The editorial noted the  need to have a perspective "beyond the next two weeks," given  the "changes now under way" in the security policy pattern in  Europe and in Europe's relationship to the United States.    Because the United States "defines the EU and WEU as the  European tools" in building a European pillar in NATO, Norway  "does not have the choice between a North Atlantic or a European  anchorage."    Norway could, from an economic point of view, manage with  the  EEA agreement, the paper contended, "providing we always and  without objection adjust" to the EU's decisions.    In view of the "emerging pan-European security perspectives"  Norway and the three other EU applicant countries, Finland,  Austria, and Sweden, "need to find their place within the EU,"  the paper stated flatly. Not only is Norway "interested" in a  common European approach to security challenges, it is "truly  dependent" on it. As an example of the new regional approach to  meeting challenges, AFTENPOSTEN pointed to the Barents  Euro/Arctic project, initiated by former Foreign Minister  Thorvald Stoltenberg and designed to "help bring much-needed  stabilization to Russia." Such projects, the editorial  concluded, "may become illuminating chapters in the area of  peacekeeping, which in its time was the reason for establishing  a European community."  <H5>  Helping Those Who Help Themselves </H5>   In a guest commentary in AFTENPOSTEN on 15 May, entitled "As  If Norway's Future Knew No Danger," Army Colonel Arvid Geirulv,  chief of the Defense Geographic-Military Service, detailed the  debilitating effects of the military reductions in the post-Cold  War era, decrying the political leadership's stance that it  "could not afford more defense." The minimum military force  determined in the last Defense Commission Paper is not being  maintained. According to Geirulv, it is "incomprehensible" that  "responsible authorities dare risk having to send a few,  undertrained conscripts" into battle against an "obviously  overpowering enemy."    With the U.S. reduction in forces in Europe and Norway's  other NATO allies also cutting back, Norway "should not be  overly optimistic" about the allies' willingness to come to its  rescue, "especially if we have turned our back on that very  Europe" by remaining outside the EU. Norway cannot expect  others to rush "to help us any more than we are willing to help  others, and, in particular, no more than we are willing to help  ourselves." Geirulv warned that Norway must not repeat the  pre-1940 mistake of believing that "it cannot happen here."</p>

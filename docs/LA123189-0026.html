			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOP 10 STORIES OF 1989;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT IS YEAR'S HOTTEST ISSUE  </P> <P> The year's biggest news stories in the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> 1. Slow-growth movement.  </P> <P> 2. Violent crime.  </P> <P> 3. Irwindale and the Raiders.  </P> <P> 4. Pomona political tumult.  </P> <P> 5. Montoya indictment, trial.  </P> <P> 6. Diamond Bar incorporation.  </P> <P> 7. Sign ordinance controversies.  </P> <P> 8. Azusa dump expansion.  </P> <P> 9. Hacienda La Puente, Sierra Madre school battles.  </P> <P> 10. Three major fires.  </P> <P> In the past year, the San Gabriel Valley and its residents gained a new city,  endured a wave of drive-by shootings, saw hopes of landing a professional  football team fade and engaged in controversies on issues ranging from foreign  language signs on stores to morbidness in school textbooks.  </P> <P> In addition, one of the area's most prominent politicians went on trial on  corruption charges, city government in Pomona was thrown into turmoil and a  major environmental battle was fought over the expansion of an Azusa dump.  </P> <P> But the theme that dominated many San Gabriel Valley news stories in 1989 was  the issue of development versus preservation. That continuing source of  controversy, often pitting developers against homeowners, was the top news  story of 1989, in the opinion of editors and reporters in The Times' San  Gabriel Valley edition.  </P> <P> Preservationists won a major victory in Pasadena in March when voters approved  an initiative limiting growth. Pasadena Residents in Defense of our Environment  sponsored the initiative, claiming it was needed to ease traffic congestion,  curb high-rise construction and stop the bulldozing of single-family homes.  </P> <P> The Chamber of Commerce, Urban League, developers and business interests fought  it, claiming it would cost the city business and jobs and would reduce the  availability of low- and moderate-priced housing. Voters approved the  initiative by a decisive margin.  </P> <P> The measure restricts construction of housing to 250 units a year, not counting  housing that is deemed affordable. The measure also bans mini-malls and sets a  yearly limit on construction of major office buildings and other commercial  projects.  </P> <P> Preservationists also made progress in persuading cities along the foothills to  tighten restrictions on hillside construction. In Glendora, a private land  conservancy was established, and the city is planning to ask voters in April  whether they are willing to be taxed to fund hillside purchases. Other  proposals would put 1,600 acres in Sierra Madre and 1,200 acres in Claremont  under public ownership.  </P> <P> Although slow-growth forces made gains last year, they also suffered some  losses. The Pasadena Board of Directors overrode objections from Pasadena  Heritage and approved the One Colorado project, a $75-million development at  the site of a group of historic buildings on Colorado Boulevard.  </P> <P> The Monterey Park City Council approved plans for a $27-million to $30-million  renovation of the Atlantic Square Shopping Center, despite complaints about  traffic congestion.  </P> <P> The County Board of Supervisors overrode neighborhood opposition to approve the  La Vina project, a plan to build 272 homes on 220 acres in Altadena.  </P> <P> In West Covina, the City Council approved a $112-million expansion of the  Fashion Plaza shopping center, a decision that was controversial because of the  terms of the agreement between the developer and the city redevelopment agency  and concern about the impact of moving the May Co. from the Eastland Shopping  Center to Fashion Plaza.  </P> <P> 2. Violent crime  </P> <P> Violent crime, including a record number of homicides in Pomona, was the No. 2.  story in the San Gabriel Valley. Pomona had 36 killings in the first nine  months of 1989, more than any San Gabriel Valley city had ever recorded in a  full year. The victims ranged from teen-agers shot on the street to an elderly  brother and sister beaten in their home.  </P> <P> Police from Pomona to Pasadena reported numerous drive-by shootings, as gangs  battled each other over the drug trade and tried to avenge previous assaults.  </P> <P> In the Pasadena-Altadena area, one death of a gang member in 1988, police said,  led to a series of retaliatory gang attacks between the Bloods and the Crips  that continued into 1989 and took 10 lives.  </P> <P> 3. Irwindale, Others Court the Raiders  </P> <P> Irwindale has been unable to complete the $115-million deal made with the  Raiders two years ago. By the end of the year, the football team seems more  likely to move to Sacramento, return to Oakland or even stay in Los Angeles in  a rebuilt Coliseum than move to Irwindale, but city officials have not given up  hope that the Raiders will someday play their games in a stadium built in a  gravel pit.  </P> <P> The negotiations have been hampered by a series of changes in the city's  bargaining team. One of the key negotiators, Fred Lyte, was fired as city  redevelopment consultant and is suing the city. Another negotiator, public  relations consultant Xavier Hermosillo, was fired, rehired and fired again.  </P> <P> 4. Political Tumult Shakes Up Pomona  </P> <P> No city generated more controversy than Pomona, where the election of Tomas  Ursua to the council in March created a new alignment that put harsh critics of  city management in the council majority. The council fired A. J. Wilson as city  administrator and dismissed Richard Tefank as police chief. Other department  heads and key officials, including the city attorney and head of the  redevelopment agency, retired or quit.  </P> <P> A movement to recall Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was begun after the council  fired Wilson in May. The effort picked up backing from city employee groups  after the council fired the police chief in October and Bryant was sued by two  police officers. They sued after he said at a council meeting that one of them  was under psychiatric care and both were being investigated for sexual  harassment.  </P> <P> The officers accused Bryant of disclosing confidential information, but Bryant  claimed he had said nothing that was not a matter of record. Recall petitions  are being circulated and will be submitted to the city clerk in January.  </P> <P> The effort to oust Bryant was the second major recall campaign in the San  Gabriel Valley in 1989. In May, San Gabriel Councilman Frank Blaszcak was  recalled after allegations that included misusing city funds by buying a $2,100  portable phone and harassing city employees. Blaszcak lost the recall election  by nine votes.  </P> <P> 5. Indictment and Trial of State Sen. Montoya  </P> <P> State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who has represented portions of the  San Gabriel Valley in Sacramento for 17 years, was indicted on corruption  charges. His trial, which has recessed until Tuesday, has included testimony  that Montoya solicited payments for his support of legislation. He is accused  of extortion, bribery, racketeering and money laundering.  </P> <P> Montoya won election to the La Puente City Council 21 years ago, then advanced  to the Assembly in 1972 and to the Senate in 1978. Montoya has said he will  seek reelection next year. Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and  Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) have talked about running for his  seat.  </P> <P> The year ended with a rush of political activity and speculation, prompted not  only by Montoya's difficulties, but also by the retirement of another veteran  San Gabriel Valley politician, Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights).  Campbell resigned Dec. 15 to become president of the California Manufacturers  Assn., a business lobby.  </P> <P> 6. The Incorporation of Diamond Bar  </P> <P> The number of cities in the San Gabriel Valley grew to 29 with the  incorporation of Diamond Bar in March. Voters in the community of 65,000  favored cityhood by 3 to 1 and elected five City Council members.  </P> <P> As soon as the city was formed, the Diamond Bar council found itself in a suit  with San Bernardino County over a chain-link fence and wooden barricades that  were installed across Grand Avenue to keep Chino Hills traffic out of Diamond  Bar.  </P> <P> After five months of negotiation, Diamond Bar agreed to remove the barrier and  San Bernardino County agreed to pay $1.2 million for traffic signals and road  improvements to ease traffic congestion in Diamond Bar.  </P> <P> 7. Sign Ordinances Spark Controversies  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi ruled in July that a Pomona ordinance  requiring the use of English characters on business signs was unconstitutional.  The city had required businesses that use foreign characters in their signs to  devote half their space to English characters. The judge said the ordinance  "was clearly an attack by the city of Pomona on its growing Asian community."  </P> <P> The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California and the American  Civil Liberties Union used the Pomona ruling to challenge similar ordinances in  San Gabriel, Arcadia, Rosemead and Temple City.  </P> <P> 8. Bid to Increase Azusa Landfill's Size  </P> <P> Browning-Ferris Industries' proposal to quadruple the daily dumping capacity of  1,500 tons at its Azusa landfill was opposed by local water officials, the  Metropolitan Water District and groups such as the March of Dimes and the  Environmental Defense Fund.  </P> <P> Opponents contended that the trash could seep through the bottom of the  landfill into ground water. Browning-Ferris insisted it could install a system  to protect ground water and also promised to put up $20 million to clean up the  area's existing water pollution.  </P> <P> The State Water Resources Control Board approved the expansion in October, but  opponents have sued to overturn that decision.  </P> <P> 9. Hacienda La Puente, Sierra Madre Schools  </P> <P> Parents in the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District battled school  officials over textbooks the parents said were morbid, macabre and harmful to  children. The controversy centered on an elementary school reading series,  titled "Impressions," which is used by hundreds of school districts across the  country.  </P> <P> The series incorporates literature drawn from folklore, mythology and fairy  tales, and its backers say it stimulates children's imaginations and love for  reading. The school board voted to withdraw the series and sue the publisher.  </P> <P> In Sierra Madre, some parents led an effort to secede from the Pasadena Unified  School District, citing gangs, violence and low test scores in the Pasadena  district. Pasadena school officials opposed the move, arguing that the loss of  students from mostly white Sierra Madre would complicate efforts to comply with  federally mandated racial integration.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Committee on School District Reorganization has  recommended against the secession, but the state Board of Education will make  the final decision.  </P> <P> 10. Three Major Fires  </P> <P> A July brush fire destroyed 13 houses and damaged eight others in Hacienda  Heights. In one December week, half a block of stores burned in downtown Sierra  Madre and in Pasadena, and an Orange Grove Avenue condominium burned.  </P> <P> Other major stories:  </P> <P> * Continuing battle over the expansion of the Long Beach (710) Freeway through  South Pasadena.  </P> <P> * Controversy over aerial spraying of malathion to attack the Medfly.  </P> <P> * New efforts by cities to encourage recycling.  </P></p>

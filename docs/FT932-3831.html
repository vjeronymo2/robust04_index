			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Survey of South Africa (13): Unbundling is dawn of a new era  -Corporate restructuring is a hot topic in Johannesburg THE announcement last month by Gencor, South Africa's second largest mining house, that it plans to unbundle itself by distributing all its non-mining assets to shareholders - effectively halving its size - has made corporate restructuring the hot topic in Johannesburg. There has been a giddy sense of the winds of change sweeping through corporate South Africa, uprooting long-established structures and signalling some sort of New Jerusalem on the Highveld. Gencor's announcement has fundamentally shifted the terms of the debate. Now one of the capitalists has broken ranks, it is no longer possible to dismiss unbundling as an airy Marxist fancy. Indeed, it is likely that South Africa has only witnessed the dawn of an era of significant corporate restructuring. That said, with the initial euphoria having receded, a more sober sense of what unbundling might mean for the business community is emerging. Some of the more dewy-eyed assessments that it represents a magical balm for a wide range of political and economic ailments are quietly being discarded. Indeed, useful debate - unbundling has been on the agenda for the past three years - has been impeded by the shotgun usage of the term to embrace everything from opposition to size, concern about efficiency, worries about monopolies, desire to curb the dominant role of whites in business and the related aim of empowering blacks economically. Opponents of unbundling have too easily been able to avoid the real issues by citing the confusion of some of unbundling's proponents as reason to dismiss the concept in its entirety. An interesting feature of the unbundling debate is that while its basic purchase derives from the political support of the quasi-socialist ANC - motivated by its dislike of a small white clique dominating the economy - the intellectual legwork, in terms of why the concept deserves support, has emerged from the investment community where it is believed unbundling will stimulate efficiency. Lined up against unbundling, unsurprisingly, are the leaders of South Africa's large conglomerates - such as Anglo American, Rembrandt, Anglovaal, Barlow Rand - who remain sceptical of the economic merits of unbundling. They tend to argue that the issue turns on what is good for the shareholder  -the same criterion, incidentally, Gencor used to justify its decision. Their scepticism about unbundling is not difficult to understand. Mr Peter Cronshaw, of Genbel, Gencor's investment arm, distinguishes 'dynastic' conglomerates, that have been developed by families, and 'republican' conglomerates, such as Gencor, where there is no definite line of succession. He points out that because the former have developed from the efforts of entrepreneurs, with these individuals/families likely still to have a stake in the business, different dynamics are at play compared to Gencor where no such considerations were at stake. Ironically, since Gencor's announcement, the rise in the gold price has again provided a reminder of the benefits of diversity. Notwithstanding deep economic recession both in South Africa and internationally, a company such as Anglo will benefit considerably from its large gold holdings. Thus, while Gencor has bathed in commentators' plaudits for its bold decision, it has been the Anglo share price which has approached record highs. In fact, the underperformance of Gencor's share price against the All Share index since the announcement is a reminder that the market has yet to show significant enthusiasm for unbundling. While the view of the market doubtless confers a nice warm feeling down at 44 Main Street, the headquarters of Anglo, there is enough strategic savvy in Anglo to know that this is by no means the end of the argument. It is an overwhelming probability that the next government, at the instigation of the ANC, will take a tougher line than is at present the case on the related issues of anti-trust policy and the structures of corporate control. Given this, a measure of pre-emptive action - some gesture which unequivocally carries the message 'We are on the side of change' - clearly has advantages. As one analyst noted: 'If you're a Boer army and you see the redcoats coming over the hill, you don't just stand there. You melt into the hillside.' Also, there are examples in most of South Africa's large groups of subsidiaries which appear to have withered in the shade of the parent company. In such cases unbundling would appear to have a positive role to play. Although a measure of pre-emptive restructuring should not be ruled out, politicians would have to be very naive to believe corporate South Africa will undertake voluntary unbundling on any significant scale. More likely is that the process will have to be encouraged by a new government. If the process is not to degenerate into a fiasco of heavy-handed intervention, then at least two steps will be necessary. First, a clear delineation of priorities - for example, whether corporate restructuring is primarily about economic justice or economic efficiency, given that the two will probably clash in practice. Also, a distinction between the separate, if related, issues of black empowerment, competition policy and corporate restructuring. Second, careful empirical study, on an industry by industry basis, of why certain structures have evolved - for example, a state sanctioned cartel between three cement producers - and what utility they still have. There is little doubt that South Africa stands to benefit from a freeing of existing control structures. Equally, there is considerable potential for harm if the corporate sector is to be bludgeoned with an ideologically motivated restructuring policy. So far the debate has been characterised by much rhetoric and little research. This balance needs to be reversed if South Africa is to get the useful sort of restructuring.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Profitable Regent buys housebuilder Regent Corporation, formerly Nouvelle Group, yesterday reported profits of Pounds 32,000 pre-tax for the six months to September 30 against losses of Pounds 110,000 last time. The company also announced the purchase of all the issued share capital of Renaissance Properties, a newly formed Sussex-based housebuilder, which, like Regent, specialises in lower cost housing on small developments. Its sole asset is housing in the course of construction. The Pounds 150,000 consideration will be satisfied by the issue of 1.5m new ordinary 1p shares in Regent, valued at 10p each. Regent reported turnover of Pounds 142,000 (nil) for the period. Earnings per share were 0.6p (0.41p losses) and the directors intend to resume dividend payments 'as soon as is reasonably possible.' They also intend to broaden the base of the company, as appropriate, into other specialised property or property-related activities.</p>

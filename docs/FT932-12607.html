			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Bosnia Conflict: Yeltsin condemns Serb defiance of peace process RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin warned Bosnian Serbs yesterday they could expect no protection from Russia if they continued to defy an international peace plan for the fragmented former Yugoslav republic, Reuter reports from Moscow. But a Russian foreign ministry spokesman said the use of force by an international military contingent could deepen the conflict and spread it beyond former Yugoslavia's boundaries. Mr Yeltsin described a plan drafted by mediators Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance and rejected on Monday by the Bosnian Serbs as the only prospect for peace in the region. 'The time has come for decisive measures to quell the conflict,' he said. Mr Yeltsin's statement suggested a more confident Kremlin approach to the former Yugoslavia following the president's victory over hardliners in Sunday's Russian referendum. He won 58 per cent support in the plebiscite, which the president hopes will allow him to break the power of a parliament heavily coloured by nationalist thinking. Nationalist opponents of the president regard his support of international sanctions against Serbia, including the despatch of troops under the United Nations flag, as a betrayal of cultural and ethnic links with Slav Serbs. Mr Yeltsin dispelled any possibility of Moscow breaking ranks with the west on former Yugoslavia as long as he was president. The west had long feared the Kremlin could back down on a joint front that had been a litmus test of the post-cold war order. 'The Russian Federation will not protect those who resist the will of the world community,' Mr Yeltsin said, dashing any remaining Serb hopes of help from Moscow. The Russian president, despite his reference to 'decisive measures', did not make it clear whether Russia would back the use of force against the Bosnian Serbs if economic sanctions failed to make them pull back.</p>

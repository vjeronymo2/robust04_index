			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHARGERS THINK THEY HAVE SOMEONE SPECIAL IN PASQUALE  </P> <P> Grabbing the catsup bottle with one hand and the pepper shaker with the other,  Larry Pasquale begins to describe the punt return. Pepper is the short man,  catsup the deep man.  </P> <P> His eyes light up like those of someone about to slap down a royal flush. He  gets a charge out of this stuff.  </P> <P> Pasquale is the Chargers' new special teams coach. He came west this year,  after 10 seasons with the New York Jets, to fix what was nothing short of an  abomination last season. He knows how a special teams unit can win a football  game. Or lose one.  </P> <P> This is one of his favorite examples:  </P> <P> It was a Monday night game between the Jets and New Orleans back in the early  1980s. There were less than two minutes to play, and the Saints were ahead.  </P> <P> "Howard Cosell basically had shut off his mind," Pasquale recalls. "He had  assumed the Saints were going to win. They were talking about nothing at the  end of the game. They were basically just rambling."  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Jets returned a punt 76 yards for a touchdown, and Howard tuned  back in and said in his unmistakeable voice: "What a football game this turned  out to be."  </P> <P> You can hear it, can't you?  </P> <P> "They might have been packing up or something, saying 'What time is that  plane?' " Pasquale says, demonstrating how the camera had focused on the pepper  shaker when it should have been following the catsup bottle. "I thought it was  really hysterical."  </P> <P> Hysterical. What a perfect word to describe the Chargers' special teams last  season, unless, of course, you are one of the coaches. It was better than  vaudeville.  </P> <P> Let's see, we saw Hank Ilesic shank two punts that went less than 10 yards  each. There was the 17-16 loss to Seattle in Week 6 when the potential tying  extra point and a subsequent field-goal attempt were both blocked. There were  the times the football bounced off players' helmets and through their fingers.  </P> <P> It was all great stuff for the blooper file. But it naturally didn't sit well  with Charger Coach Dan Henning, who fired Joe Madden as special teams coach at  the end of the season. Madden was the defensive coordinator on the Pittsburgh  Steelers' 1976 Super Bowl team, but Charger players lost confidence in him.  </P> <P> "People just didn't feel like it was important," says inside linebacker Gary  Plummer. "Most of the guys that are in the NFL have been stars all their lives.  When all of a sudden they're relegated to special teams, they feel like  second-class citizens. And that's the way the guys played last year.  </P> <P> "When you have a motivating guy like Pasquale, you feel important."  </P> <P> That's where Madden fell short. Players didn't take him seriously.  </P> <P> "I felt the change was necessary because some people in our organization  (thought) we needed a change, and that carried over to the players," Henning  said. "And I thought Joe was a little undermined. He was fighting an uphill  battle. We needed a fresh approach and a fresh start."  </P> <P> In defense of Madden, Henning says the personnel wasn't conducive to a polished  product. The Chargers filled in a lot of gaps with backup players who had  little or no experience in that area.  </P> <P> When the special teams look like a circus act, the coach gets blamed.  </P> <P> "And that's not the way you should completely evaluate the coach's ability,"  Henning says. "That would mean that Chuck Noll wasn't a very good coach for  three or four years, but he was a great coach in the '70s. He's an outstanding  coach, and when he had outstanding players, they were outstandingly productive.  When he didn't have outstanding players, he wasn't as good a coach. So that's a  crock."  </P> <P> Either way, Henning knew whom he wanted as Madden's replacement. Back in high  school in New York, Henning and Pasquale used to play football at rival schools  in Brooklyn. Henning was the quarterback for St. Francis High, a Catholic  powerhouse, and Pasquale was the quarterback at Lafayette, a public school with  an equally successful program.  </P> <P> Henning tried to get Pasquale to coach his special teams in Atlanta in 1983  when he was coach of the Falcons. Pasquale declined, deciding he didn't want to  desert Jet Coach Joe Walton.  </P> <P> Henning called again after last season, and he and Pasquale met in New York.  Three or four hours of discussion were enough to determine that they were on  the same wavelength. Henning wanted to have every coach and every player on the  team involved in special teams. Pasquale decided it was worth leaving New York  for a new challenge.  </P> <P> "It was an opportunity to maximize our coaches' contributions and players'  contributions," Pasquale says. "I really wanted to be a part of that."  </P> <P> This year, everybody participates in special teams drills. Pasquale spends  hours with his assistant, LeCharls McDaniel, evaluating personnel and figuring  ways to make sure players are in sync.  </P> <P> Playing special teams is kind of a strange deal. It's all about throwing  linebackers, receivers, running backs and whoever else together on one unit and  expecting them to click.  </P> <P> "It's very tricky," Pasquale says. "You have to develop a bond. They have to  have a trust in one another and a feeling for one another. It takes a great  deal of understanding of the personalities of the people."  </P> <P> So far so good. Wide receiver Nate Lewis went 87 yards on a kickoff return last  Saturday to help the Chargers to a 30-27 victory over the Rams. Exhibition or  not, that buoyed Pasquale.  </P> <P> And the players are taking pride in playing on special teams. Guys such as  Donald Frank, a rookie cornerback from Winston Salem State, and Lewis, a rookie  from Oregon Tech. Both are Pasquale's type: speedy and powerful.  </P> <P> In past seasons, the special teams players would stay late after practice while  the others headed for dinner. That didn't sit too well.  </P> <P> "You felt like it was a punishment," Plummer said. "With Larry, everyone's out  there. Everyone's involved."  </P> <P> Which doesn't mean that everything is perfect. Against the Rams, the Chargers  missed a 27-yard field goal and a PAT. And they narrowly escaped a blocked  punt.  </P> <P> If there is still room for improvement, there is one thing that is certain.  There is enthusiasm. Special teams aren't a chore.  </P> <P> "I just felt that (last year) they didn't really believe they could make a  difference," Pasquale says. "It didn't seem like they were really into it, like  they felt they could defeat their opponents on a regular basis. Our biggest job  was really to regain their confidence in special teams."  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning said defensive tackle Les Miller, who strained his  elbow in the Rams' game, will miss Saturday's game against the 49ers. Also out  is tight end Arthur Cox, who has missed 15 days with a back strain.  </P></p>

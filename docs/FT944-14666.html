			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Global growth lifts drugs groups  -Consumer products sales help Warner-Lambert, AHP to higher earnings Strong sales of consumer healthcare products supported third-quarter earnings at both Warner-Lambert and American Home Products, the US pharmaceuticals and healthcare companies. Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman and chief executive of Warner-Lambert, which derives two-thirds of its sales from consumer products, said worldwide growth accounted for a 20 per cent increase in sales from a year before, to Dollars 1.13bn. This was partly due to a joint venture with Wellcome, under which Warner-Lambert markets some of the UK company's products in the US. AHP, which is in the process of completing its acquisition of American Cyanamid, reported a 14 per cent increase (13 per cent without exchange adjustments) in non-US consumer product sales. Overall, such products, which account for just over a quarter of the group's total healthcare sales, recorded 6 per cent growth. AHP's bigger pharmaceuticals business also reported a 6 per cent advance in sales, to Dollars 1.3bn, driven by a 14 per cent jump in revenues outside the US. Demand for infant nutritional products and the company's contraceptives accounted for the growth. This was balanced by growth of only 2 per cent in US drugs sales (4 per cent excluding the Agri-Bio business, which was sold earlier this year). Warner-Lambert's drug sales, meanwhile, rose just Dollars 2m from a year before, to Dollars 534m. Sales in the US of Lopid, the company's lipid regulator, slipped on competition from generic drug makers, resulting in a 1 per cent overall fall in US sales, to Dollars 274m. Warner-Lambert's net income for the period rose 8.5 per cent to Dollars 169.2m, or Dollars 1.26 a share, on overall sales up 13 per cent at Dollars 1.67bn. AHP's after-tax profits were 4 per cent higher, at Dollars 413m, or Dollars 1.35 a share, on sales of Dollars 2.26bn, also 4 per cent higher than the 1993 quarter.</p>

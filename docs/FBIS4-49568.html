			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 6 (XINHUA) -- Making good use of the  international equity market is China's long-term strategy and  more Chinese firms can expect to go public on overseas stock  markets in the future.    "Overseas listing will become one of the main vehicles for  China to attract foreign capital in the years to come," said Nie  Weiping, deputy director of the Overseas Department under the  China Securities Regulatory Committee, the country's top  securities administrative body, at a symposium on public  relations for China's overseas listings.    He said that investors from the developed countries have  begun to actively participate in trading Chinese or  China-related equities after years of watching and pondering.    "Their enthusiasm is a great help to us in entering the  international capital market," said Nie, adding that the  securities authorities are seriously considering expanding  Chinese firms' presence on the world financial market to seek  more foreign investment via such means as launching China funds  as well as issuing convertible bonds.    The significance of overseas listing, however, lies in  accelerating the process of enterprise reform which aims to  enhance productivity and make these firms consistently  profitable.    According to Nie, the seven Chinese firms already listed on  the Hong Kong market have all reported remarkable improvements  in management and economic efficiency.    They have expanded production as they used the funds raised  through stock issues to purchase advanced technology and  equipment.    The fund raised by the seven firms totals an estimated 10.5  billion H.K. [Hong Kong] dollars.    And the yearly profits of these firms have all exceeded the  projected figures in their statements for public stock offering,  said Nie.    The symposium, co-sponsored by the China Securities  Regulatory Commission and Edelman Public Relations Worldwide,  features presentations on listing mechanisms and public  relations support for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the New York  Stock Exchange, and European investor roadshows and discussions  on ADRS [expansion unknown].    Experts from major world banks, investment corporations,  auditing firms and public relations companies will have detailed  exchanges with the 40-odd Chinese firms seeking overseas  listings.</p>

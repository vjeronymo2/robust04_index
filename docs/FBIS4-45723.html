			<p>CSO     [Text] Airborne pollution from pig farms and other  intensive agriculture sites is damaging British forests.    Scientists have linked ammonia emissions from livestock with  acidification of forest soils, which causes parts of trees to  wither and die.    The research, carried out by the Institute of Terrestrial  Ecology's Merlewood Research Station at Grange-over-Sands,  Cumbria, has drawn attention to a source of pollution that up to  now has been all but ignored in Britain.    Since 1950 there has been a 50 per cent growth in emissions  of ammonia over Europe and in some countries it may have doubled.    Agriculture is believed to account for 95 per cent of these  emissions and the new research indicates that large tracts of  British woodland may be suffering as a result.    The study, carried out by Dr Phil Ineson with funding from  the Department of the Environment, concentrated on Scots pine  and Norway spruce woods near a pig farm at Wensleydale in the  Yorkshire Dales.    Dr Ineson, writing in the Natural Environment Research  Council's Nerc News, said measurements showed high  levels of ammonia-linked pollution downwind of the farm and less  upwind. Concentrations were highest during muck spreading and  when pigs were moved on to the farm in the winter and spring.    TIMES NEWSPAPERS LIMITED, 1994</p>

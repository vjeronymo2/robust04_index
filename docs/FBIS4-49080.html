			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Newsletter" by XINHUA reporters Yang Jisheng (2799 4949 </F> 4939) and Zhang Jimin (1728 4949 3046): "Secret Green Light Sent  to the Universe]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted]    Out of curiosity, we reporters visited the place at night  recently and took the liberty to knock on the door. After  making clear what we had come for, Chen Xianjun, deputy head of  the satellite observation station, received us warmly. This  engineer said only those who visit at night will be impressed by  the observation station. Due to technical reasons, the station  only conducts observations at night and does not turn on the  instrument in the day time.    Deputy head Chen led us to the monitoring room, which is  equipped with all kinds of electronic instruments. The red  signal light kept twinkling and the telecommunications sign  sounded clearly and melodiously. Signs and figures moved up and  down on the computer screens.    Deputy head Chen told us the so-called satellite tracking is  to measure the distance between the satellite and Earth at all  times. To be more specific, it is to measure the distance  between the satellite and the observation spot at all times.    We asked: "How many satellites can the station track?"    He hit several keys on the computer keyboard and the screen  showed the directory of observed satellites and times they were  close to the sky over the observation station. There are nine  satellites: the U.S. Geodesic Satellite, the Japan Violet  Satellite, the European Remote Sensing Satellite No. 1, the  French Maritime Hydrographic Satellite, and so on.    [passage omitted]    Although the principles are very simple, it is very  difficult  in operation. The furthermost satellite is some 20,000 km from  the Earth and is rotating continuously. To ensure the error of  measurement does not exceed 4 cm, we should utilize modern  science and technology to guarantee the speed. For example, the  velocity of light is 300,000 km per second in the physics  textbooks; however, here we use an even more accurate speed:  29.9292458 km per second. As for time, one second passes in a  twinkle; however, here 10.000000000001 [as published] second,  the unit of time, can be accurately counted. Deputy head Chen  said proudly most of the instruments ranging from laser devices  to precision measuring instruments are produced in China. The  turning on of the laser device, sending and receiving the laser  beam, as well as data recording and processing are operated by  all kinds of instruments in the monitoring room. They are  operated automatically by computers by programs designed  previously. [passage omitted]    "We heard that a foreign laser weapon is used to hit  aircraft. Can a laser sent from the station penetrate the human  body?" we asked.    "It would be OK if a laser strikes any part of the human  body, except the eyes. Once the eyes are stricken, serious  burns will cause blindness. [passage omitted]    Speaking of satellite ranging, engineer Chen was extremely  excited. His words brought us to a remote space. He said:  "The precision of laser ranging is pretty high. Its error is  at the cm level. Think about this, the average value of global  sea level obtained with such precision is very precious data.  Now it is said that the global weather is getting warmer and  less snow falls than melts in the Antarctic Pole; if it causes  the raising of the sea level, a rather reliable numerical value  can be obtained at the satellite observation station. In  addition, the India massif moving northwards not only raises  Mount Qomolangma, but also moves the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau  northwards close to Tian Shan. A massif's moving rate can be  obtained through satellite ranging. [passage omitted]    Now through satellite ranging, it is known that Shanghai is  moving 2 cm toward Japan annually. Of course, satellite ranging  is not limited to this application. We cannot calculate the  satellite orbital angle or establish the zero-level global  network without it."    It is learned from the satellite observation station that,  as  far as such global data is concerned, it is not sufficient to  rely only on the station in Beijing and the other three stations  in Shanghai, Wuhan, and Changchun. Close cooperation among  relevant scientists in the international community is needed.  This is a global industry. There are some 40 satellite ranging  stations in operation in the world, sending data obtained to the  international satellite ranging data analyzing and processing  center in the United States. Data will be provided to  scientists and technicians worldwide after being processed. As  engineer Chen summarized: "Utilize satellite and laser  technology to conduct experiments on Earth on which we depend  for existence, so that we can give an early warning as soon as  we find an abnormal state unfavorable for the existence of human  beings." [passage omitted]    Do you want to find the station's location? The green light  is sent to the universe from 39 degrees 36 minutes 22.3 seconds  north latitude and 115 degrees 53 minutes 36.87 seconds east  longitude.</p>

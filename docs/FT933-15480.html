			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: BASF restructures drugs division BASF, the German chemicals group, is to cut up to 15 per cent of the workforce employed in its German pharmaceuticals divisions. Claiming that the domestic drugs companies had fallen deeply into the red in the first half, Mr Hans-Uwe Schenck, chairman of the group's Knoll division, said all cost-cutting possibilities were being examined in collaboration with workers' representatives. He calculated up to 600 of the 4,000 German workforce would have to go. Other BASF officials complained recently that government health service reforms had led to drugs turnover falling by as much as 18 per cent. Mr Ingo Paetzke, a group director, forecast a decline in domestic sales for the full year and even heavier falls in profits. The group recently announced plans to restructure its pharmaceuticals business, partly in response to rumours that it planned to dispose of it, and partly to equip the business better for international competition. Provided the board approves, all activities will be focused in a new division, BASF-Pharma, from the start of next year. The main components of the new division will be Knoll, Nordmark and Minden Pharma. BASF employs 7,800 worldwide in pharmaceuticals. More than a quarter of its DM2bn (Dollars 1.25bn) turnover last year came from the German market, with a further 30 per cent each from North America and elsewhere in Europe. A management consultants' study on which the project is based recommended that BASF reduce the number of research projects under way, and focus on the most promising products, especially those with international marketing prospects.</p>

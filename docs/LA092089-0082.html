			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A self-described free-lance hit man says in Playboy magazine that former  Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa was shot and dismembered and buried near the end  zone in Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. In an interview in the November  issue of Playboy, Donald (Tony the Greek) Frankos, who is now in the federal  government's witness protection program, claims he told the FBI in 1986 that  Hoffa was killed by alleged Irish mob boss Jimmy Coonan in a house near the  Detroit suburb of Mt. Clemens. Hoffa's body was dismembered with a chain saw  and stored in a freezer for five months before it was transported to New  Jersey, the magazine reported. FBI officials declined comment on Frankos'  account of Hoffa's disappearance July 30, 1975.  </P></p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Brussels talks to step up Yugoslav peace initiative MOVES to resolve the Yugoslav crisis will be stepped up today when the EC-sponsored conference on Yugoslavia reconvenes in Brussels, following the arrival yesterday in Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, of the commander of the UN peace-keeping troops. General Satish Nambiar, an Indian, is expected to finalise plans to deploy more than 13,000 UN peace-keeping troops in the republic of Croatia later this month. Despite the first major breach of the nine-week-old ceasefire in Osijek, eastern Croatia, in which five people were reported killed at the weekend, western diplomats yesterday said they expected the deployment to go ahead. In Brussels, the presidents of Slovenia and Croatia, and the four presidents of the rump Yugoslavia, are today due to discuss the recognition of the republics of Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia. Both republics voted for independence in recent referendums. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic may not attend the talks because of slight injuries received in a car accident, Tanjug news agency said. Greece continues to oppose the recognition of Macedonia on the grounds that Macedonia has claims on part of northern Greece, while nationalist Bosnian Serbs, who boycotted the referendum in Bosnia-Hercegovina, want to remain part of the Serb-dominated rump Yugoslav federation. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, president of Bosnia, will again ask the EC to recognise the republic's independence. But Moslem officials said at the weekend that some EC countries now suggest Bosnia should be administered on ethnic lines, with considerable autonomy granted to the Croat, Moslem and Serb communities. Croatia and Serbia also support the division of Bosnia into cantons in the belief that this would speed up the eventual disintegration of the republic and its eventual unity with both Croatia and Serbia. Western diplomats yesterday said the UN, and some other EC countries, oppose this plan. Mr Franjo Tudjman, president of Croatia, has already succeeded in having Mr Miro Lasic, a moderate Bosnian Croat who wants to preserve the territorial integrity of Bosnia, dismissed from a special tripartite committee of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. This committee is negotiating with the EC on the future status of the republic. Slovene officials want the EC conference to open up negotiations on tackling Yugoslavia's Dollars 16bn (Pounds 9bn) external debt. Mr Marko Krajnac, vice-chairman of the central bank of Slovenia, said all six republics must decide how the debt should be distributed among the republics, so as to facilitate fresh credits. Much of the federal debt is already accounted for, except for Dollars 3.5bn, which is unallocated debt. 'We have to reach a settlement on this soon. But so far, the National Bank of Yugoslavia (the central bank) has not been willing to discuss it,' Mr Krajnac said. Slovenia's share of the allocated debt of the Yugoslav federation is about Dollars 1.8bn.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Georgetown, Guyana, 15 Jan, CANA -- Guyana's  National Assembly has passed a customs amendment bill comprising  new rates of the Caribbean Community (Caricom) Common External  Tariff [CET] , being implemented by the community's 12-member  common market.    Guyana is one of three member states -- Antigua and Barbuda,  and Montserrat are the others -- yet to implement the CET after  Caricom agreement in 1992 on a lowering of the tariffs to  reflect international trends.    All three opposition parties here supported the government  as  the Customs (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 1993 came up for debate and  passage this week. Debate on the bill was previously scheuled  for December 16, but was postponed because of delays in printing  of the voluminous tariff rates.    The CET is intended to demarcate a regional market behind a  common tariff against third-country goods. It is expected to  facilitate the development of regional manufacturing and  agriculture.</p>

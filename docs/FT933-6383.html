			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Company News: MCC offshoot agrees to sale of stake in publisher MACMILLAN, a US offshoot of Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC), has agreed to sell its 50 per cent stake in the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company to McGraw-Hill, the US-based publishing group, for Dollars 337.5m. The news ended speculation that Paramount Communications or Walt Disney might bid for Macmillan's share in the company, which is a leading publisher of elementary and secondary educational materials in the US. MCC filed for protection from creditors under chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code in 1991. Macmillan has been operating while co-ordinating important decisions with UK court-appointed administrators of the Maxwell empire. The letter of intent for the latest sale was signed by Price Waterhouse, the joint administrator of MCC. In March, Price Waterhouse said it planned to put Macmillan up for sale. McGraw-Hill's share in the joint venture's second-quarter profits rose 72.4 per cent to Dollars 11.2m. According to bankruptcy court documents, Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing had 1992 net profits of Dollars 19.1m on operating revenues of Dollars 504.9m.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HEYWARD CARRYING HIS WEIGHT AS SAINTS TRIM THE BUCCANEERS;  </P> <P> NFC: MUCH-MALIGNED FORMER NO. 1 DRAFT PICK RUSHES FOR MORE THAN 100 YARDS FOR  SECOND CONSECUTIVE WEEK IN NEW ORLEANS' 35-7 VICTORY.  </P> <P> Craig Heyward is beginning to look like the kind of running back the New  Orleans Saints hoped he would be when they made him their first-round draft  pick in 1988.  </P> <P> Heyward, who has been in the doghouse for most of his three seasons with the  Saints, turned in his second consecutive 100-yard rushing game Sunday,  including a 47-yard touchdown run to lead the Saints to a 35-7 victory over the  Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  </P> <P> "He's the same guy he was 2 1/2 years ago," Saint Coach Jim Mora said. "He's  just getting more opportunities now, and he's making the most of them."  </P> <P> It was the second consecutive victory for New Orleans (4-5) and the fourth  consecutive loss for the Buccaneers (4-6).  </P> <P> Heyward, who has been as heavy as 290 pounds during his three seasons, has made  more headlines in New Orleans with his weight problems than his production. In  the first seven games of the season, Heyward carried 11 times for 35 yards.  </P> <P> But Heyward, down to 259 pounds, followed last week's 122-yard effort against  the Cincinnati Bengals with 155 yards in 20 carries against the Buccaneers.  </P> <P> "I'm in my third year, and I hadn't been very productive," said Heyward, who  rushed for 183 yards in 49 carries in 1989. "Now, it's more a matter of being  level-headed. I can't let it affect me."  </P> <P> Heyward's 47-yard touchdown run was the longest run of the season for the  Saints. Heyward tore through the grasp of Wayne Haddix at the line of  scrimmage, stiff-armed Harry Hamilton, then knocked Ricky Reynolds backward  into the end zone from the two-yard line.  </P> <P> The touchdown put New Orleans ahead to stay, 14-7. Heyward also scored on a  two-yard plunge in the third quarter to make the score 28-7.  </P> <P> The Saints also scored on a 26-yard touchdown pass play from Steve Walsh to  Brett Perriman in the second quarter, and on four- and one-yard touchdown runs  by Rueben Mayes.  </P> <P> Walsh completed seven of 13 passes for 84 yards.  </P> <P> Mayes, who rushed for 115 yards last week, finished with 56 yards in 15  carries.  </P> <P> Chris Chandler started at quarterback for the Buccaneers and led them on a  15-play, 80-yard scoring drive on the game's first possession. Chandler capped  the drive with a 12-yard touchdown run.  </P> <P> Chandler completed seven of eight passes for 44 yards before suffering a  concussion on a third-quarter sack.  </P> <P> Vinny Testaverde replaced Chandler and completed 11 of 19 passes for 110 yards.  Testaverde fumbled his first snap on a sack by Pat Swilling, setting up  Heyward's second touchdown.  </P></p>

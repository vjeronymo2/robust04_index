			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Arms dealer beats Black to buy Israeli paper from Andersen MR YAACOV Nimrodi, an Israeli arms dealer, has bought Maariv, Israel's second largest daily newspaper, from Arthur Andersen, administrator of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's assets in Israel. Mr Nimrodi fought off competition from Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian press magnate who was the other serious contender for the paper. Mr Black's Hollinger group, whose holdings include the Daily Telegraph and the Australian Fairfax newspaper chain, already owns the Jerusalem Post, Israel's English-language daily. The offer is being made through Israel Land Development, in which Mr Nimrodi holds a majority stake. It has signed an agreement to buy 87 per cent of the Maariv Modiin Publishing House for Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 8.2m). The offer is being made in tandem with Mr Shimon Cheifetz, Maariv's managing director, who already has 8 per cent of the company's shares. Aside from the newspaper, Maariv Modiin's subsidiaries include a video company, a printing house, a woman's magazine and cable television. Mr Nimrodi's son, Ofer, managing-director of Israel Land Development, said the newspaper's editorial board would continue to enjoy 'absolute independence and freedom of the press'. Maariv Modiin is understood to carry debt of about Dollars 30m and is said to require a capital injection in addition to the buying price. A survey published this week by the Israel Advertisers Association showed that Maariv's circulation had declined in 1991. Mr Maxwell was the first foreigner to buy an Israeli newspaper. His plans for Maariv to capture part of the market held by Yediot Aharonot, Israel's largest daily, were never fulfilled.</p>

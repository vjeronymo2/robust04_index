			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Danes expect strong growth Strong growth in domestic demand will cut the surplus on Denmark's current account from DKr35bn (Pounds 3.6bn) - close to 4 per cent of gross domestic product - in 1993 to around DKr12bn by 1996, according to a report by the chairmen of the economic advisory council. They predict an increase in real private consumption by 5 per cent annually this year and in each of the two following years, while GDP is expected to increase by about 3 per cent a year over the same period. The rise will cut the central government budget deficit from DKr50bn this year to about DKr22bn by 1996 as tax revenues recover, they forecast. The report calls for reductions in the country's minimum wage levels and 'entry wages' for first-time employees as the best way to bring about a lasting reduction in unemployment, currently running at 12.5 per cent. Mr Mogens Lykketoft, finance minister, was quoted yesterday as saying that he did not accept the argument. The report also attacked an ambitious government job-sharing scheme, by which wage-earners can take six months off on unemployment pay to care for children or undertake job-related education. The scheme, so far temporary, will cost the equivalent on an extra 1.5 percentage points on the 25 per cent VAT if it is made permanent, the report said.</p>

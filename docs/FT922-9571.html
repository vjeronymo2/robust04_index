			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / International Company News: Loblaw will push into US if bid for Steinberg fails IF Loblaw, Canada's biggest food distributor, fails to buy the Steinberg chain in Quebec soon, it will push further into the US, said Mr Galen Weston, chairman of Loblaw's parent company, George Weston. Loblaw is negotiating with Steinberg's owners for all or part of its Montreal operations. It is the third time Loblaw has tried to enter the Quebec grocery market over the past 20 years. It already has a large automated bakery in Montreal. Mr Weston said his group has CDollars 500m (USDollars 420m) or more available for a Canadian or US acquisition. Its north-eastern US bakery operation is succeeding after a restructuring and is expanding its long-term supply contracts. The Weston group has large cash resources but its earnings are being held down by its forest products and fisheries divisions. First-quarter earnings fell nearly 50 per cent to CDollars 6.1m on revenues of CDollars 2.5bn.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Scottish Power advances 18% - Opportunities seen for expanding non-core activities Scottish Power, the electricity company, indicated it saw significant opportunities for expanding non-core businesses, possibly through acquisition, as it launched the electricity sector's preliminary results season. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 were up 18 per cent, at the top end of expectations, to Pounds 351.1m (Pounds 297.1m) on turnover of Pounds 1.57bn (Pounds 1.5bn). It announced an 11 per cent rise in dividend to 12.4p (11.15p) with a proposed final of 8.27p. Earnings per share rose 17.5 per cent to 31.6p (26.9p). Market speculation on acquisitions was fuelled after the company said it would not be following the lead of other electricity companies which are seeking to buy back their shares. Gearing fell over the year from 12.2 per cent to 0.4 per cent. Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said the company began with gearing of 50 per cent at privatisation and would not feel uncomfortable with that in the future. He said the company would invest to widen its business horizons in the next few years. Analysts yesterday speculated that Scottish Power may seek to increase its interests in the gas and telecommunications businesses. Another possibility was a bid for a regional electricity company in England and Wales after the government's golden share in those companies expired next April. The company is not, however, looking to expand outside the UK. The company is already increasing sales of electricity in England and Wales. Capital expenditure last year of Pounds 158.1m included Pounds 36m on the construction of a 40MW generating station in Knapton and completion of improvements in transmission links with England and Wales. Full utilisation of the 1600MW links awaits the granting of planning permission for National Grid to upgrade its England and Wales system. Scottish Power is also considering the possibilities of increasing the capacity to 2000MW. In the long term a 2000MW capacity together with a planned link with Northern Ireland could help it to increase its sales of electricity outside Scotland to 40 per cent of the total, compared with about 10 per cent last year. Mr Duncan Whyte, chief operating officer, said the company may look at installing equipment to generate power from gas at Longannet, Fife, if limits on emissions of nitrous oxide were lowered beyond a certain level. Highlights of the year included a Pounds 7m profit in retailing, against Pounds 4m the previous year and a Pounds 5m loss in 1990. Mr Whyte said he expected a profitable contribution this year from the 50 Clydesdale superstores, which had been bought from the receiver. The number of people employed in the core electricity business fell by 619 during the year to 5,740. See Lex</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1993 (16): A big pool of skills and resources - User View / National Grid Company / The trend towards distributed computing is raising new challenges for facilities management companies and their clients THE National Grid Company's Central Division was a rather unusual client for facilities management; it did not have a corporate computer. Central is the biggest of National Grid Company's three divisions, handling electricity transmission to an area running from south-west England and south Wales across the Midlands to the east coast. When the electricity industry was sold to the private sector in 1989 the new National Grid Company took the opportunity to move from ageing computer systems run on the old Central Electricity Generating Board's mainframe computers and switch to smaller, networked computers running the Unix operating system. Central Division now has Sequent S3 computers in its five geographic management units, its construction unit and its main office near Bristol. These run financial, personnel, work management, stores and purchasing systems, mainly using program packages from Oracle. There are at least 50 personal computers at each of the seven sites, linked to each other and to the Sequent machines through Novell local area networks. The offices are also linked to each other. Once this new set-up was in place, however, the division decided that it wanted to be able to concentrate on its core business. 'I wanted to avoid creating a large information technology department,' says Tony Hill, the manager responsible for computing, finance, accounting, business development and marketing. 'We would have needed a substantial mix of skills and would have been vulnerable if people left or were ill.' The fact that the division's computing was based on a network rather than on a central machine made it an unusual prospect for facilities management companies. This is reflected in the fact that two of the biggest specialists in this field dropped out of the bidding. The contract went to Data Sciences, one of the top half-dozen service suppliers. Hill says it was 'one of the very few' already handling such a network for a client and it also had centres which broadly matched the division's geographic spread. The contract has three elements. Data Sciences runs a help-desk for all seven sites from its Swindon office. Users can dial direct to the company's National Grid team there. The unit also manages all maintenance contracts. The second element is related to the staffing issue raised by Hill. Previously each of the seven sites had one computing specialist to manage the local systems, load new software, handle data back-up and deal with basic user problems. 'This was just one IT person in an office of perhaps 700 people,' Hill says. 'There was no career progression and the job did not fit comfortably into the structure of the unit. If he went sick or on holiday there was no cover and if he left, the office was vulnerable until a replacement could be found.' Hill hoped to move the systems administration jobs to Data Sciences but felt this was too big a step for people used to working in the security of a nationalised industry. So Data Sciences is taking over the job gradually, as people leave. It now supplies systems people to two sites. 'I pay for Monday-to-Friday cover, not for a particular person,' Hill says. 'This means we've got better cover than we had before.' The third part of the contract involves a bureau operation on Central Division's corporate ledger systems. This is run on two IBM RS6000 Unix computers, again using an Oracle package. And, again, Hill did not want the concerns of running a computing operation, so although the division owns the equipment it is installed at Data Sciences in Swindon and managed by the company. The contract is initially for two years at a cost of Pounds 965,000, but Hill says that 'essentially it could run for ever'. Price increases are written in but they are less than those of the retail prices index. Hill says there have 'undoubtedly' been cost savings, but he puts the benefits in other areas: 'We have access to a big pool of skills and resources. It is up to the supplier to provide them, so we get continuity without having to organise people and replace them when they leave.' Hill believes management time spent on computing has been cut to 10 per cent of one person's time. His team of three computing specialists now concentrates on future strategic issues. The management effort goes mainly on monitoring the contract. 'We meet at least monthly,' Hill says. 'This takes time: they're in business to make money; we're looking for a long-term relationship. We put a lot of work into setting performance criteria based on numbers: for example the number of calls handled by the help desk. 'We have a good contractual relationship: Success in a facilities management contract involves both parties playing their part.' SUPPLIER PROFILE Data Sciences was formed as Datasolve in 1965. It was bought by BOC in 1975 and sold to Thorn EMI in 1982. A management buy-out in 1991 led to the creation of Data Sciences as a facilities management, systems, consulting, payroll processing, disaster recovery and software products company with 1,750 staff. Offices: Data Sciences has eight computer centres across the south of England, mostly with IBM or compatible mainframes and one with ICL equipment. Half the centres also have Unix machines. Turnover and profit: 1992 turnover Pounds 119m; profit after tax Pounds 5m. Facilities management is 30 per cent of turnover. Market research says the company is the fifth-biggest facilities management supplier in the UK. Price: Average contract size Pounds 4m in 1991; Pounds 4.9m in 1992. Clients: More than 50, mostly in UK</p>

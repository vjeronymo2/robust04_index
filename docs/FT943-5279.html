			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: The Giordano dividend Mr Richard Giordano may not be popular with Sid if, as feared, he freezes or even cuts British Gas's dividend this week. But shareholders should take comfort from the fact that their new chairman is engineering a change in strategy which should, in time, more than compensate for any disappointment on dividends. The biggest change is that Mr Giordano is determined to embrace competition and make it work to Gas's advantage rather than fight it at every turn. Gas's previous tactic was to run scare stories about how millions of consumers would see their gas bills double if competition was introduced for domestic customers. That won it few friends. Mr Giordano appreciates that competition can be used to change the group's bureaucratic culture. The company has also come to the view that the real added value in its UK business is transporting gas, which will remain a monopoly, not trading it. Since its trading monopoly carries a host of social obligations, Gas believes it may be in its interest to demerge the business completely. It remains to be seen whether Gas can persuade the government to move ahead with its planned legislation. Gas's earlier scare tactics have given ministers cold feet about dismantling the monopoly. But Gas's more constructive approach is certainly in shareholders' interests. Mr Giordano is also refocusing Gas's overseas strategy. In the past, Gas spent hundreds of millions of pounds on foreign acquisitions without a clear idea of where it could add value. Again, the new strategy has yet to be fully articulated, let alone produce tangible benefits. But the shares, which have underperformed the market by 15 per cent this year, look due for a turn.</p>

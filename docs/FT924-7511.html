			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE BRITISH Airways is expected to report a 40-45 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits tomorrow, confirming its position as one of the world's most profitable airlines. However, the City expects a small decline in the company's second-quarter profits, reflecting the increasingly tough outlook in the industry. BA's first-half pre-tax profits are expected to be in a range of Pounds 250m-Pounds 260m, against Pounds 185m in the first half last time. But second quarter profits are expected to total around Pounds 160m-Pounds 170m, against Pounds 176m. British Steel, struggling in the depressed worldwide steel market and a flood of cheap metal entering the EC, particularly from Eastern Europe, is expected to report a significant pre-tax loss today. Analysts put it at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m in the half year to September (Pounds 13m). The big question is whether the steel group will maintain or cut its interim dividend, held at 3p last time. There is no financial reason to maintain the pay-out, but British Steel may want to keep its options open, and wait to play with the final dividend. The market is expecting today another solid year to September from BOC, the industrial gases and healthcare group, but the slowdown in earnings growth is likely to continue. Analysts expect pre-tax profit of Pounds 345m (Pounds 310m) and eps of about 45p (40.98p). A 22p (20.4p) dividend is forecast. Whitbread is expected to report flat first-half profits of about Pounds 142m on Wednesday. Its retail operations have continued to suffer from tough trading conditions, particularly in south-east England. First-half results of electricity companies have only limited value as they take in the spring and summer months when activity is low. However, this year's crop, which start tomorrow, are bound to attract attention because of the coal mine closures programme. National Power starts off the month-long electricity results season with analysts expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 230m, against last year's Pounds 202m. PowerGen reports on Wednesday with expectations at about Pounds 100m (Pounds 97m). Dividend rises of about 10 per cent are likely. Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, is expected to report flat pre-tax profits of around Pounds 355m (Pounds 351m) for the half year when it announces its results on Thursday. Strong UK performances from HongKong Telecom and Mercury Communications have been offset by the weak dollar. Storehouse, the retailer, is expected to report a break-even first half on Thursday. Analysts are looking forward to better second-half profits of around Pounds 30m, and will be keen to hear if Storehouse is making progress on selling Habitat's loss-making US operations.

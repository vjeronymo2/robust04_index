			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 10 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  and visiting Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori here today  pledged to further develop friendly relations of cooperation  between the two countries.    During their meeting here this afternoon, both Li and  Fujimori expressed satisfactions over the smooth development of  Sino-Peruvian relations.    Li said that yesterday Fujimori and Chinese President Jiang  Zemin had "very good talks and reached consensus on a series of  issues." He believed that Fujimori's current visit would play a  positive role in furthering Sino-Peruvian ties.    The economies of China and Peru are mutually complementary  and their products are suitable to each other, Li said,  therefore, the two countries enjoy great potential in developing  bilateral trade relations on the basis of equality and mutual  benefits.    The Chinese premier said that both China and Peru are  developing countries and they share similar views on issues of  human rights and democracy.    Li expressed thanks for Peru's support to China at world's  human rights conferences. He also expressed appreciations of  Peru's support for China's re-entry into GATT as a signatory  state and for China's application to join in the Pan-American  Development Bank.    "We are delighted to notice that the debt burden for Latin  American countries has been eased up recently and that Peru's  economy has been developing steadily," the premier said.    Li noted that exchanges between China and Latin American  countries have been increasing year by year in politics,  economy, and culture and they have the common aspiration to  develop cooperation.    While recalling his last two visits to China, Fujimori said  that his three visits to China have enhanced mutual  understanding and promoted bilateral economic and trade  relations.    Fujimori agreed to Li's view that the economies of the two  countries are complementary to each other.    The Peruvian president said that Peru and China share  similar  views on many international issues, and both oppose interference  in other nation's internal affairs by means of human rights and  democracy.    He stressed that the common positions of the two countries  on  political issues serve as the foundation for the further  development of bilateral economic and trade relations.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks, names as published] </F>   [Text] Hyderabad, May 27: Rich tributes were paid to the  first Premier Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru at a colloquium on  "Relevance of Jawaharlal Nehru's Philosophy in Contemporary  India" organised by the AP Chapter of the Jawaharlal Nehru  National Youth Centre (JNNYC), here on Friday.    The Minister for Panchayat Raj, Mr D.K. Samarasimha Reddy,  said had he (Nehru) not laid the foundation for democracy, the  country would not have seen such a development in spite of  experiencing turbulent times on many an occasion. He said Pandit  Nehru, who understood the crux of the Indian polity, thought it  fit to further cement the democratic set up. "He was  instrumental in giving a right mix of socialism and capitalism  to suit the Indian conditions," he observed.    Mr Samarasimha Reddy said the former Prime Minister time and  again used to remind the people to attain self-reliance while  maintaining cordial relationship with America and Russia. For  the over all development, Panditji had introduced the Five-Year  Plan and gave impetus to industrial and agricultural  development. "To sustain a democracy, Panditji has also framed  the three-wheel vehicle -- the Legislature, the Executive and  the Judiciary. If any one of these wheels fails, democracy is  bound to collapse," he added.    The Minister described Nehru as a true democrat, a statesman  par excellence and a visionary who had ensured the country the  present status of a developing nation. "He was also a true  secular," he pointed out. All through his life, Nehru opposed  import of technology and hence he had laid a strong foundation  for scientific and research laboratories. "None could forget  Panditji's contribution to the technological capabilities." He  said Nehru was the architect of the Non-aligned Movement and the  father of the `Panch Shell.'    The Reserve Bank of India Director, Mr Ch Hanumantha Rao,  said even Russian economists were attracted to Nehru's policies.  He said democracy was the only tool for any country's  development and cited how Communism collapsed in Russia and  elsewhere in Europe. He said the day was not far when even China  would get attracted to democracy.    Mr Mohit Sen, Chairman, United Communist Party, Dr K. Keshav  Rao, Chairman of the Rajiv Technology Mission, Ms Nannapaneni  Rajakumari, Chief Whip, and Mr P. Goverdhan Reddy, JNNYC  Chairman, also spoke.    The Congress MP (Member of Parliament), Mr T. Venkatram  Reddy, who was to participate in the seminar, could not attend.  In his speech, which was read out in absentia, Mr Reddy said:  "Even after three decades had passed since Panditji left us, his  impact on every aspect of national life continues to be felt.  Such was his contribution during the freedom struggle and as a  leader of the nascent free India that he was the unchallenged  leader and a darling of the masses."    He said though Panditji was born with a silver spoon in his  mouth, his sacrifices and self-denial were supreme. Panditji was  instrumental in India's modernisation process and introducing a  scientific temper in order to eradicate poverty and fighting  superstition, orthodoxy and such customs and practices that came  in the way of progress and development.    He said no historian dared to forget Nehru's contribution as  a world leader, as a man of the masses and as a human being  without whom India would not have been committed to the ideals  of secularism, socialism and planning.</p>

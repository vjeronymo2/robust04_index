			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Duggan's resignation marks change of direction for Cabra MR JOHN DUGGAN has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Cabra Estates, the heavily-borrowed property company which owns Stamford Bridge and Craven Cottage, homes to Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. Mr Eoin Cotter, group financial director, has been appointed group chief executive. He said Mr Duggan's resignation marked a change of direction for Cabra. 'It's now a time for belt tightening and taking a different profile,' he said. Mr Duggan had come under mounting pressure to complete agreements with the two clubs which were seen as central to Cabra's survival. But relations had become acrimonious, and Fulham and Cabra have been locked in a legal wrangle all week about a planning inquiry into Craven Cottage's re-development. Mr Duggan's departure could speed up completion of an agreement in principal for Cabra to sell Stamford Bridge to Chelsea and reduce its debts by about Pounds 13m to Pounds 40m. Cabra announced yesterday that completion with Chelsea 'is anticipated in the near future', the most positive statement on the state of negotiations for some time. An adviser close to the discussions said various legal obstacles remained but the outlook was now positive. Cabra's legal argument with Fulham remains unresolved, however. Fulham yesterday won a court declaration stating it could give evidence to a planning appeal investigating Cabra's re-development of Craven Cottage. Fulham had earlier agreed with Cabra it would not jeopardise those plans. However, Cabra has pledged to appeal against the declaration and the planning appeal was yesterday adjourned until next month.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Setback for Tsongas in Maine THE CAMPAIGN for the US Democratic presidential nomination by Mr Paul Tsongas, winner of last week's New Hampshire primary, appeared last night to be in danger of losing momentum as votes were counted in a caucus in neighbouring Maine. With 80 per cent of the votes counted in the state, Mr Tsongas had seven delegates to the national convention and was edged out by Mr Jerry Brown, the former California governor, whose reward for campaigning hard on his anti-corruption crusade was eight delegates. The outcome was a surprise because Mr Tsongas had been expected to build in Maine on his success elsewhere in New England. However, he had not campaigned as intensely as Mr Brown, preferring to demonstrate strength beyond his New England base. The national front-runner among the Democrats, Mr Bill Clinton of Arkansas, had sought to shore up his support in the south and Maine yielded him only three delegates. Vice-president Dan Quayle was meanwhile defending President George Bush's record from rightwing criticism by Mr Pat Buchanan, who - although well beaten by the president in Maine - has mounted a challenge for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr Quayle on television described Mr Bush as 'a good conservative' and commended the jobs package in the budget unveiled last month as a non-political, pro-family initiative. However, he immediately went on to acknowledge that it would 'play well in middle America'. The Democratic candidates face a gruelling test over the next two weeks, with 22 states holding their primaries or caucuses, culminating in the 11-state 'Super Tuesday' ballot on March 10. Last night all five candidates were due to face each other in debate again in South Dakota, where Tuesday's primary may provide the first winnowing of the field. Senators Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and Tom Harkin of Iowa are competing fiercely there; a loss could prove fatal for one or both. Mr Tsongas has been gaining on Mr Clinton since his victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday. A New York Times/CBS poll at the weekend showed Mr Clinton leading by just five points (29 per cent to 24 per cent). Before the New Hampshire primary, one Gallup poll showed Mr Clinton with 42 per cent to just 9 per cent for Mr Tsongas. Mr Tsongas sought to consolidate his gains with an interview in which he was frank in recognising the health fears that surround his candidacy. He said he had been searching for over a year for a 'superbly qualified' candidate to run with him, in anticipation of questions about his health as an ex-cancer sufferer. With 10 days to go before its primary, Georgia is relishing its role as the first southern state to vote in the presidential nomination campaign. Georgia should be home territory for Mr Clinton, who has spent 10 years as governor of a southern state and who has close links with many of Georgia's centrist Democrats. Virtually the entire Democratic establishment - from Governor Zell Miller to Senator Sam Nunn and most of the state assembly - have endorsed his candidacy. But Mr Clinton needs a good result to show he has laid to rest the difficulties that have dogged his campaign - stories he says are about 'a woman I didn't sleep with and a draft I didn't dodge'. In the south, with its conservative family values and strong military tradition, these issues could be more damaging to Mr Clinton than they proved to be in New Hampshire. Maryland is shaping up as another vital battleground. Almost every elected official in the state below governor has endorsed Mr Clinton but Mr Tsongas has been picking up strength among more affluent voters.</p>

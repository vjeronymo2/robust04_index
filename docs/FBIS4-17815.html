			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 27 April (SNARK) -- The entrance of the UN  peacekeeping forces is the key-item in the settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. It is impossible to put an end to  the conflict without it. This declaration was made by the  personal representative of the Georgian head Sandro Kavsadze in  an exclusive interview to SNARK.    In his opinion, dislocation of peacekeeping forces all over  the territory of Abkhazia meets the interests of both  conflicting sides, for it will guarantee the coming back of  Georgian refugees, as well as protect Abkhazia from the possible  Georgian attacks.</p>

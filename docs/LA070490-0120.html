			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT TURNS KEY WITNESS IN GIRL'S DEATH  </P> <P> A man who was identified as a suspect in the slaying of 9-year-old Autumn  Wallace has contacted police and is now a witness in the murder case, sheriff's  officials announced Tuesday.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Lt. Richard J. Olson identified the man only as a 35-year-old  resident of Anaheim.  </P> <P> Autumn, a popular pupil at Dr. Jonas E. Salk Elementary School, was found face  down in a pool of blood in a bathroom of her Hedlund Drive home in an  unincorporated area between Stanton and Anaheim. Sheriff's investigators said  she had been stabbed numerous times.  </P> <P> Last week, authorities charged Maria del Rosio Alfaro, 18, of Anaheim with the  June 15 slaying. At the same time, they released a composite of a man who was  seen with a male companion in front of the Wallace house on the afternoon of  the girl's death. According to investigators, neighbors saw the man playing  with a Latino child in the Wallace front yard.  </P> <P> Olson said the man depicted in the composite drawing contacted Anaheim police  Monday night to report that he was one of the men seen at the Wallace  residence.  </P> <P> After meeting with police, the man agreed to be questioned by sheriff's  investigators who now consider him an important witness in the murder case,  Olson said.  </P> <P> "He was a suspect until such time as we found out what he was doing (in front  of the house)," Olson said. "(Now) he is strictly a witness to us."  </P> <P> He declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Olson said investigators are still looking for the second man and for a gold  1970s-model Chevrolet Monte Carlo seen parked in front of the Wallace house on  the day of the slaying.  </P> <P> Walt Zwonitzer, a private investigator with Clarke International  Investigations, said an arrest of a "primary suspect" is imminent. The Long  Beach firm has been hired by the Wallace family to investigate the crime.  </P> <P> "When everything is known, the brutality of this crime will be shocking,"  Zwonitzer said.  </P></p>

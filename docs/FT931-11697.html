			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Equities move on fiscal and currency speculation Japan was the powerhouse of an equity world dominated by currency and monetary economic speculation last week. While the US put in a modest performance and Europe was indecisive, Tokyo gained 3.6 per cent on mounting expectations of an imminent cut in the official discount rate, taking the FT-Actuaries World Index to a rise of 1.1 per cent in local currency terms. Researchers from Salomon Brothers in Tokyo say the Bank of Japan (BoJ) showed no resistance to last week's continued rally in money markets, which set the stage for a probable reduction of 75 basis points in the official discount rate, from the current 3.25 per cent to 2.50 per cent. However, says Salomon, the BoJ will not allow a bubble economy revival: 'Once the economic recovery has taken firm hold, the BoJ will waste little time in returning interest rates to normal levels.' In Europe, the big battalions cancelled each other out: the UK celebrated its base rate reduction; but disappointing company results and continued earnings downgrades depressed sentiment in France and Germany. On the periphery, Ireland moved higher on what the currency speculators were expecting, a devaluation of the punt. However, Davy Stockbrokers of Dublin, which in mid-January said this offered scope for a post-devaluation rally of 10 to 15 per cent, is not so bullish now. Things have changed in two or three weeks, says Mr Robbie Kelleher, Davy's head of research. In mid-January, notes Mr Kelleher, the punt was standing at a sterling exchange rate of Pounds 1.04 to Pounds 1.05, with the possibility of a devaluation and some upside in sterling. Since then the UK currency has been weak, weekend forecasts of further UK interest rate cuts have made things worse, and even after a 10 per cent devaluation the punt is still around Pounds 1.03. The currency theme persists on the other side of the Atlantic, where Mexico fields the biggest drop of the week with a setback of 6 per cent in local currency terms. Mr Federico Laffan of Latin American Securities says there were a number of factors here: the increased strength of the peso against the dollar, offering currency gains, seems to have prompted some profit-taking; the offer for sale of shares in Grupo Carso, the conglomerate which manages Telmex, led to fears of oversupply; and, by the latter end of the week, there were fears of delays in the approval of NAFTA, the North American free trade agreement which had been seen as a boost for the Mexican economy.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 % change   % change in               % change in local currency**     sterling**  US Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                         1993      1993        1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria      +3.70    -0.50   -18.05    -0.50    +1.55       -0.26 Belgium      +1.34    +5.27    -1.24    +5.27    +7.51       +5.58 Denmark      +1.83   +10.99   -20.83   +10.99   +14.28      +12.24 Finland      +2.91    +2.81    -2.34    +2.81    -1.17       -2.93 France       -2.27    -3.13    -4.94    -3.13    +0.08       -1.71 Germany      -0.99    +2.04    -9.46    +2.04    +4.58       +2.71 Ireland      +3.28    +4.04   -14.63    +4.04    +6.29       +4.39 Italy        +1.49   +10.75    -5.07   +10.75   +10.94       +8.97 Netherlands  +0.79    +1.89    +2.04    +1.89    +4.20       +2.34 Norway       -1.67    +1.44   -14.99    +1.44    +4.26       +2.40 Spain        -0.93    +8.21    -7.63    +8.21   +10.38       +8.40 Sweden       -2.51    -4.79    +4.77    -4.79    -6.01       -7.70 Switzerland  -0.33    +0.66   +16.22    +0.66    +1.11       -0.70 UK           +1.12    -0.63   +11.48    -0.63    -0.63       -2.40  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE       +0.11    +0.63    +2.30    +0.62    +1.76       -0.05 Australia    +0.11    -2.00    -7.99    -2.00    -1.44       -3.20 Hong Kong    -3.31    +3.40   +20.45    +3.40    +5.40       +3.52 Japan        +3.62    -0.43   -16.69    -0.43    +1.42       -0.39 Malaysia     +0.91    -0.46   +14.07    -0.46    +0.88       -0.91 New Zealand  +2.16    -2.71    -3.49    -2.71    -0.50       -2.26 Singapore    +2.58    +2.55    -2.88    +2.55    +4.31       +2.45  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada       +0.65    -1.90   -10.96    -1.90    -0.04       -1.82 USA          +0.49    +0.70    +7.17    +0.70    +2.53       +0.70 Mexico       -6.00    -4.90    +4.39    -4.90    -3.24       -4.96 South Africa +0.76    +5.30    -8.56    +5.30   +10.47       +8.50  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX  +1.08    +0.35    -1.76    +0.35    +2.02       +0.20  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on January 29th 1993.

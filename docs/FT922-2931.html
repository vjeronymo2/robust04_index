			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / International Company News: Stora blames price cuts for sharp fall in profits STORA, Europe's largest paper and pulp group, yesterday announced a steep fall in profits for the first four months of 1992 following a drop in sales from SKr18.3bn (Dollars 3.18bn) to SKr16.2bn. Profits after net financial items were SKr3m against SKr901m for the same period of 1991. The company warned it would suffer a loss in the second four-month period but added that its programme to cut costs combined with an improved market should enable profits to improve in the final four months of 1992. The company blamed sharp price cuts for the sharp profits fall. These applied to most forestry industry related products, the result of severe competition in a depressed market which produced a loss of SKr1.2bn. Also, construction-related revenues fell SKr300m, while there was a fall in net financial items because of lower interest differentials caused by linking the Swedish kroner to the European currency unit in May 1991. The company made actual operating losses in the first four months of SKr149m in pulp and SKr119m in printing papers, compared with profits of SKr56m and SKr226m respectively. Stora's operating profit for packaging board and paper was SKr465m, against SKr470m. Esselte, the office equipment group, has reported a steep increase in profits for the first four months of 1992, despite reduced turnover. After net financial items, profits jumped to SKr140m from SKr63m a year ago. Sales were SKr4.49bn, against SKr5.31bn. Esselte forecasts full-year profits after net financial items of SKr350m. Hit by restructuring costs the group made a loss of SKr416m last time.</p>

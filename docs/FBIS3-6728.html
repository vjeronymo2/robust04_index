His government decided to join SITTDEC a few months ago  after  following SITTDEC's development since its inception about two  years ago.    We were briefed about SITTDEC and its development today and  I  think that Cuba will benefit if it joins, he told reporters  through an interpreter after visiting the SITTDEC office at the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry here.    SITTDEC, an agency of the group of 15 developing countries  (G-15), set up through Malaysia's initiative, was adopted at the  grouping's second summit in Caracas, Venezuela, in November 1991.    SITTDEC would help relay business information to member  countries to reduce economic dependence on the developed  countries.    Gonzales, who is leading a seven-member delegation, was  earlier briefed by SITTDEC executive director Mohamed Salleh  Masduki.    Cuba would be the 15th country to join SITTDEC.    Gonzales and his delegation arrived Saturday for a three-day  official visit.    Meanwhile, Mohamed Salleh said Indonesia, India, Argentina,  Chile, Jamaica, Senegal, Zimbabwe and Algeria were among  countries that had joined SITTDEC.</p>

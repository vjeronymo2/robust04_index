			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television Viewpoint 93: Saddam's Killing Fields (ITV, 11.20) is a sickening account of the sufferings of the marsh dwellers of Iraq. No one who has read Wilfred Thesiger can forget his evocation of the riverine culture of the marsh Arabs. Now these inhabitants of the original Garden of Eden inhabit a Gehenna of poisoned water, rocket attacks, and land fast being turned into an arid waste by Saddam's drainage project. Documentary-maker Michael Woods excoriates the US for abetting suppression of the revolt of the southern Shia in 1991. The ghastly reprisals are described with the help of smuggled video film and interviews with refugees in Kurdistan. There is harrowing footage of the last minutes of Kerbala. Given how little information is leaked out of southern Iraq, it is unfortunate that this important film is screened so late. Omnibus: Houdini (BBC1, 10.20) is a life of the legendary escapologist, presented with charm and wit. Some delightful characters are interviewed on family memories of Houdini, born Eric Weiss of Milwaukee, son of a hopeless Hungarian rabbi.</p>

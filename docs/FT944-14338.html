			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Whatever happened to the monetarists?: Why the Treasury and Bank no longer take much notice of M4 The time was when the publication of figures for broad money supply growth would be one of the economic highlights of the month. Not any more. The first Conservative administration of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, now Baroness Thatcher, believed devotedly in a link between money supply and inflation, as did many distinguished City economists of the day. Even now figures for German money supply growth can have a big impact on the financial markets. However, Thursday's publication of the measure of broad money supply - M4 - had little effect on traders. And although the government has a monitoring range for annual M4 growth - of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent - it seems to play a very minor role in determining economic policy. Growth in M4 in the year to September was just 4.8 per cent, well towards the bottom of the monitoring range. Furthermore, analysing the components of M4 shows that credit growth in the economy is even weaker than the headline suggests. What the Bank of England calls 'sterling lending to the M4 private sector', defined as all UK residents other than banks, building societies and the public sector, grew just 3.7 per cent in the year to September. If the authorities really believed that broad money growth was an indicator of future inflation, there would be no need to raise interest rates. However on September 12 base rates were increased from 5.25 per cent to 5.75 per cent. In the minutes of his meeting with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on September 7 Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, said that, notwithstanding the recorded price performance and reasonably reassuring monetary indicators, the increasing evidence of capacity and price pressures in the pipeline could not be ignored. But there are still keepers of the faith who believe that broad money supply growth is significant. Prominent among them is Mr Tim Congdon of Lombard Street Research, one of the chancellor's panel of economic advisers - the so-called 'wise men'. Mr Congdon argues that it was the slow growth of broad money in late 1990 and early 1991 which has led to the lowest inflation rates since the late 1950s and 1960s. He also believes that the subdued growth rate of M4 means that inflation will stay low. There is general agreement on the reasons for the slow growth in M4. The borrowing binge of the 1980s meant that corporations entered the recession highly indebted. Many went bankrupt. Those that survived resolved not to make the same mistake again. They are either paying off their borrowings or raising finance from other sources. Meanwhile, consumers have faced many of the same problems as the corporate sector. They entered the recession with high debts. According to Mr Ian Shepherdson, UK economist at Midland Global Markets, personal-sector debt was about 120 per cent of disposable income at its peak. Debt levels remain high, at about 105 per cent of disposable income. However, there are some signs that the consumer is borrowing again. The Central Statistical Office's measures of consumer credit, which cover items such as credit cards, reached record levels in August, with net lending reaching Pounds 632m. But Mr Congdon points out that the consumer credit figures cover only a small proportion of personal-sector debt. Mortgage borrowings are about seven times the size of consumer credit, and mortgage lending remains fairly weak. According to Mr Congdon, the answer is simple: 'Housebuyers are over-extended. The ratio of mortgage debt to housing stock hovered around 20 per cent between 1960 and 1990, and is now over 30 per cent. This is only bearable because of low interest rates.' Other economists may accept some of Mr Congdon's analysis but they disagree with his conclusions. Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at Morgan Stanley, said: 'The behaviour of broad money tells you very little about the business cycle. At the moment it just tells you that companies are rearranging their balance sheets.' He believes that the recent rise in consumer credit is significant because it shows that consumers, while not yet sufficiently relaxed to borrow for mortgage purposes, have rediscovered some of their 1980s habits. Rather than M4 being a forward indicator of the economy, Mr Gardiner believes that the economy's strength will eventually lead to M4 growth. The debate may seem arcane but it is important. If believers in the significance of M4 are right, the Bank of England may seriously damage the recovery if it pushes for higher interest rates when credit growth is so weak.</p>

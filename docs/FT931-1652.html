			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy placings in shares absorbed DEEPENING uncertainty over developments in Russia left the UK stock market to busy itself with more local matters yesterday. Successful placings of shares with the big institutions, tax loss trading and hints of impending changes in life assurance profits distribution all combined to drive equity volume higher but the broad range of the market close with little change from the previous day. Equities were also overshadowed by fund managers' preoccupation with the details of the latest UK government bond auction, disclosed only towards the end of the trading session. The stock market was also restrained by continued weakness in stock index futures, which gave little lead to the underlying blue chips. Shares moved uncertainly, gaining 9 Footsie points in early trade, and then sliding to 2,851 for a mid-session loss of 12.9. Traders expressed satisfaction at seeing the FT-SE 2,850 held. Some analysts believe the market has now absorbed the implications of last week's UK Budget and will renew its advance if further evidence of economic recovery arrives. At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a fall of 2.8 at 2,861.1, having rallied somewhat half-heartedly as Wall Street came in with a loss of only 8.65 on the Dow during London hours. The tone of the day was set early with a highly successful placing of more than 42m shares in Granada, the entertainments group, in part-payment for its Pounds 360m purchase of the industrial services division of P &amp; O. This substantial placing, comprising more than 9 per cent of the enlarged equity of Granada, was heavily over-subscribed by the institutions, although it was priced at a discount of only 4 per cent to Granada's share price in the market. Dealers saw this as clear indication of the institutions' readiness to buy good quality stock at current market levels. The same point was underlined by a very successful response from fund managers to the flotation yesterday of Hambros Insurance Services. The stock market also took aboard without difficulty two rights issue, of Pounds 126m from BBA and Pounds 34.1m from Clyde Petroleum. News than another life assurer was considering ways to improve rewards to shareholders was good for investor confidence. It sharp gains in the life sector, but insurance broker issues were hit by suggestions that a leading reinsurer was about to reduce its business range. These developments, together with a burst of what appeared to be tax loss selling of shares at the close lifted Seaq volume to 701.7m shares, with non-Footsie business matching recent daily averages with a contribution of about 62 per cent. Tax-influenced activity is likely to be matched by similar trades today. On Monday, Seaq volume dipped to 529.2m shares and was worth only Pounds 1.03bn at retail level. These volume figures appear to bear out the general belief that the institutions have not been heavy sellers since the Budget, in spite of some signs of caution towards the UK chancellor's measures on dividend payments from corporate profits earned outside the UK, and also the future prospects for corporate taxation. The FT-SE Index has lost about 2 per cent since the Budget.</p>

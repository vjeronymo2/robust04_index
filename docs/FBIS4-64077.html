			<p>BFN     [Text] The president's press service today issued a  statement from Boris Yeltsin on the State Duma's decision to set  up its own radio and television service. We asked Vyacheslav  Kostikov, the president's press secretary, for the details.  Here's what he told us by telephone.    [Begin Kostikov recording] Unfortunately, the point has to  be  made that the State Duma is taking steps to set up its own radio  and television service, and, what is particularly annoying, with  a compulsory system of daily broadcasting on the state  television channels and primarily on the channels of Russia TV.  So the new legislative body is, in effect, reviving the  practice of the earlier Supreme Soviet's encroachments on the  free airwaves.    Boris Nikolayevich had a serious conversation on the subject  today. He is very concerned at these new tendencies in the work  of the Duma. He thinks that the renewal of attempts at an  information diktat may lead to a fall in the prestige of the  State Duma. This worries him because the State Duma is one of  the participants in the process of public accord, and the  discrediting of that important state body will damage the  strengthening of public accord in Russia.    Moreover, it must be borne in mind that neither the  president  nor the government nor the Federation Council has its own  broadcasting. They interact with the public on the principles,  universally adopted in world practice, of the free flow of  information. The tactic of compulsorily reserving and grabbing  its own radio and television time must be seen as an attempt by  a state body to create information privileges for itself. That  is, of course, impermissible. In the information field, all  participants in a discussion -- sometimes there are several of  them in a political struggle -- must nevertheless, in a  democratic state, have equal opportunities, and the constitution  must provide such opportunities. But that seems too little for  the State Duma -- not the whole of the State Duma, of course,  but some of it, some groups which think that they must have some  special rights to the information space.    Politically, this can only be seen as the desire of one  branch of power to violate the division of powers which has  taken shape and is enshrined in the constitution. We have  already experienced such a practice and know the ruinous  consequences. They are well known. This tactic by the Supreme  Soviet led, in part, to the October events. And it is extremely  dangerous to public calm to return once more to those plans for  forcibly foisting one's own viewpoints on to the public.    In this connection, by making his statement, the president  is  urging the deputies of the State Duma to display wisdom that is  characteristic of many groups and many deputies, and political  tact, and, above all, to take account of the lessons of very  recent history.    The statement must certainly not be seen as some kind of  confrontation. It is a calm warning from the president to  deputies, so that they should not make mistakes that will  rebound on them, above all. I think that deputies must be  concerned about their own image if they want the State Duma to  be a popular body among the people.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN CITES ETHICS AS KEY THEME IN CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Enumerating the ethical misfortunes of some of her fellow Democrats, former San  Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein chose Friday to make clean government a  central theme of her campaign to become the Democratic nominee for governor.  </P> <P> Feinstein, the only potential gubernatorial candidate who is not mow holding  office, criticized both federal and state officeholders for having created a  "cloud of suspicion" over government in their zeal to collect honorariums,  campaign contributions and free trips.  </P> <P> "Increasingly there is a public perception, a perception whether it's right or  not right, that elected officials trade their integrity for honorariums and  that some -- and I say some -- would abandon their principles for profits," she  said.  </P> <P> Quoting heavily from newspaper accounts of political misdeeds, Feinstein  unveiled her new campaign platform at a meeting of the California Society of  Newspaper Editors. The editors, who had originally planned to hear her address  during a luncheon meeting at Sacramento's Hyatt Hotel, at the last minute had  to trek across the street to a legislative hearing room because she refused to  cross a union picket line. The Hotel, Restaurant Workers Local 49, AFL-CIO, has  been picketing the downtown hotel for weeks.  </P> <P> Feinstein is the second politician this week to announce that ethical reform  would be a major campaign theme. Former Republican Rep. Daniel E. Lungren  promised Wednesday that he would actively prosecute political corruption if his  efforts to win election as attorney general are successful.  </P> <P> Feinstein vowed to push for legislation that would drastically reduce the  amount of money candidates and officeholders can collect from political action  committees and other special-interest groups.  </P> <P> But when asked if she would voluntarily agree to put some of the reforms into  effect in her own campaign, Feinstein said she would not do so unless other  candidates agreed to do likewise.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make a lot of sense for a candidate to disadvantage himself," she  said.  </P> <P> Acknowledging that similar proposals have stalled in the Legislature, Feinstein  outlined a legislative reform package that included proposals for banning  political donations from businesses, limiting political action committee  contributions to $1,000, preventing officeholders from collecting contributions  in non-election years, banning honorariums and limiting the acceptance of gifts  -- including travel -- to $100.  </P> <P> She also called for legislation that would prohibit lawmakers from voting on  any matter in which they have a direct financial interest, prevent state  administrators from lobbying their former agencies for at least one year after  they leave office and ban lobbying of governmental agencies by elected  officials.  </P> <P> The former mayor said she will try to find a lawmaker to sponsor her proposals  and if that is unsuccessful, she will work to get them adopted in an  initiative.  </P> <P> Feinstein said her travels throughout the state have shown her that recent  publicity over the resignations of House Speaker Jim Wright (D-Texas), U.S.  Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced) and the federal indictment of State Sen. Joseph  Montoya (D-Whittier) have given voters "a profound mistrust of government."  </P> <P> "As California faces a crisis of leadership, a cloud of suspicion hangs over  our government," she said. "And this cloud adds to the inability of our elected  officials to get anything accomplished."  </P></p>

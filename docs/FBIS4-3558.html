			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 21 (XINHUA) -- China's and Egypt's  presidents voiced the hope here today that their countries'  bilateral contacts and friendly relations will be further  intensified and promoted.    President Jiang Zemin and visiting Egyptian President Hosni  Mubarak expressed this hope in talks here this afternoon, which  proceeded in a "cordial and friendly" atmosphere, according to  Chinese officials.    Mubarak flew in here at noon today for a three-day state  visit as Jiang's guest.    China and Egypt, separated by mountains and rivers, maintain  close ties, Jiang said in the talks.    Calling him an old friend, Jiang expressed appreciation of  Mubarak's positive efforts in promoting the development of  Sino-Egyptian ties.    The friendship between China and Egypt, two ancient  civilizations, has a long history, he said.    Since the establishment of diplomatic ties 38 years ago,  bilateral ties have been developing steadily and exchanges and  cooperation in politics, economy, trade and other fields  proceeding smoothly.    The two sides share identical or similar views on major  international issues and have good co-ordination and cooperation  on global issues, Jiang said.    At present, both countries are faced with tasks of deepening  reforms, developing their economy and raising people's living  standards. They can learn from each other and share experience  in many respects, he noted.    The Chinese Government and people greatly cherish the  Sino-Egyptian friendship. "We feel satisfied with the  development of the bilateral relations," he told Mubarak.    Mubarak expressed his satisfaction with the deep traditional  friendship between the two countries.    Egypt attached importance to the development of friendly  ties  of cooperation with China and their cooperation in politics,  economy, science and technology has been developing in a  sustained and steady manner, Mubarak said.    He gave Jiang a brief account of the peace talks between the  Palestine Liberation Organization and Israel as well as the  Middle East peace process.    The talks have achieved a breakthrough and the two sides  have  signed an agreement on self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank town of Jericho, he said.    However, a lot of problems remain to be tackled and call for  the joint efforts of all parties concerned, Mubarak said.    China welcomes the progress of the talks, Jiang said.  History has shown that conflicts between different countries  can only be solved through peaceful negotiations.    Yet, the Middle East issue is very complicated and it is  only  too natural to encounter some difficulties and obstacles in the  process, he said.    "We hope all the parties concerned continue their flexible  and practical attitude, overcome obstacles and make strenuous  efforts to make the talks a complete success at an early date,"  Jiang said.    China will continue to do its part in pushing forward the  peace process and in the realization of a complete peace in the  region, he said.    China highly values the role Egypt plays in the Middle East,  he said, adding that it appreciates Egypt's efforts in  maintaining the interests of the Arab people and the just rights  of the Palestine people, and in propelling the peace process  forward.    On the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, Jiang said  that  China maintains that the issue be settled properly through  consultations and negotiations between the four parties  concerned.    "We don't favor imposing pressure or sanctions on the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea," he said. "We believe  that imposing pressure or sanctions can only make things more  complicated."    Egypt holds identical views on this matter, Mubarak told  Jiang.    The two leaders also exchanged views on Somalia and South  Africa, and briefed each other on their respective countries'  situations.    Mubarak invited Jiang to visit Egypt. Jiang accepted the  invitation.    After the talks, Jiang and Mubarak attended the signing of  an  agreement on the encouragement and reciprocal protection of  investments and an agreement on assistance in civil, commercial  and criminal matters.    In the evening, Jiang hosted a banquet for Mubarak and his  entourage.

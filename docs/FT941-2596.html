			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Market: Good news on inflation fails to lift spirits - Wall Street There was plenty of promising news on inflation this week, continued signs of strength in the economy, and an encouraging earnings forecast from a big manufacturer, yet it was not enough to lift spirits on Wall Street. If any more evidence of financial markets' jittery mood was needed, it came yesterday morning, when bond and stock prices dropped sharply after it was reported that Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had been called to to see President Clinton. Although the Fed said the meeting was routine, it was unplanned - Greenspan had to cancel an appointment in Texas to make it back to Washington DC in time. This prompted speculation among traders and investors that the meeting was somehow a signal that the Fed was about to raise interest rates again. Perhaps, the rumours went, the White House had got wind of plans for another monetary policy tightening, and wanted to call in the Fed chief to explain himself. The speculation was way off the mark. The president and the Fed chairman meet fairly regularly, and the White House said it had called Greenspan to Washington on Friday because Clinton was going to be difficult to contact over the following weeks due to a hectic travel schedule. Also, it would be extremely unlikely that if the president wanted to dissuade the Fed from raising interest rates, he would choose to do it at so public a meeting. Yet, the speculation surrounding the Clinton-Greenspan parley was enough to take 17 points off the Dow Jones industrial average in the first few minutes of trading, and send the benchmark 30-year government bond down almost a point, pushing the yield back above 6.9 per cent. Fortunately, once everyone had calmed down, the stock market came to its senses, and the Dow recovered its early losses. Bonds, however, remained anchored in negative territory, perfectly illustrating the mess the Treasury market is in. For bond yields to have jumped back to 6.9 per cent in a week when all the news on inflation was positive defied logic. First, the February producer prices index was released on Tuesday, and it showed an increase of just 0.1 per cent in 'core' producer price inflation (excluding the volatile food and energy components). Then, a day later the consumer prices index was reported to have risen by only 0.3 per cent last month, a figure that was in line with expectations and one that put the annualised rate of consumer price inflation 0.3 percentage points below the 1993 - which was itself the lowest inflation rate recorded in years. Finally, on Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia issued its monthly report of local economic conditions. It noted that prices of goods sold in the region had moderated during the month. This was especially welcome news, because it was the Philadelphia's Fed's warning about rising inflation in its local markets that had triggered a February sell-off of bonds. Yet none of this was enough to lift bond market investors' spirits, and the gains Treasuries had earned midweek were quickly wiped out on Thursday and Friday. Admittedly, stocks fared better, especially in the latter half of the week, but it was clear that both markets are not going to calm down in a hurry, whatever the inflation facts say. This week, thankfully, was not all about inflation. Secondary stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, put in a good showing. The Nasdaq composite reached an all-time high of 803.85 on Thursday, powered by strong demand for technology stocks. Traders said Nasdaq stocks had become oversold earlier this month, and with cyclicals and larger-capitalisation issues languishing, investors jumped into technology company and other growth-oriented stocks in search of bargains and quick gains. There was also some heartening news from a leading manufacturer. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of earth-moving and construction equipment, predicted healthier first quarter earnings than it had originally estimated, and announced plans to hire additional workers to cover a surge in demand. It was the third time since November that Caterpillar has had to add to its workforce. Ignoring inflation jitters, and the bearish bond market, this is the kind of news investors want to hear - a strengthening economy, growing demand for goods and services, an expanding labour force, and improving corporate earnings. Not surprisingly, all of this has done wonders for Caterpillar's share price. From a low Dollars 57 3/4 last year, Caterpillar's stock has soared more than 100 per cent. Monday    3862.98 + 00.28 Tuesday   3849.59 - 13.39 Wednesday 3848.15 - 01.44 Thursday  3865.14 + 16.99 Friday    3895.65 + 30.51</p>

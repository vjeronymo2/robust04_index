			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Regulator lays down rules for train operators The rules for train operating companies seeking to negotiate access to the railway network owned by Railtrack were set out yesterday by Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator. The handbook sets criteria for agreeing the details of timetables, performance incentives and track maintenance standards. It sets great store by open competition and flexible contracts. The guidelines have emerged from talks between the train operators and Railtrack and will be applied to future negotiations as the operators move into the private sector. The aim is to ensure that agreements are reached which protect the interests of travellers; promote the development of the rail network; and enable companies providing railway services to plan for the future. Issues on which the document sets rules include: Access agreements must be flexible enough to allow for effective railway operations without the need continually to consult the regulator. But they should not allow agreements which deliberately flout the regulator's intentions. Agreements must contain a 'reopener provision' to allow changes to be made to, for example, franchise periods and levels of charges, when the regulator publishes policy statements in November and April. Timetables which make it difficult for Railtrack to franchise routes to other operators would be subject to very close scrutiny. Railtrack will be expected to show that it has plans to renew track which matches the sums it sets aside for depreciation in its accounts. Agreements must also include clauses which provide an incentive to Railtrack to improve the performance of the track network. Railtrack and the train operators must negotiate agreements which compensate the train operators if maintenance work takes longer than planned and they are unable to use the track. Train operators will be expected to adopt flexible computer networks which do not tie them into expensive and inappropriate systems.</p>

			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Glaxo awaits Zantac patent ruling A DECISION in the lawsuit over the world's biggest selling drug, Zantac, may not be made until the end of the year, the drug's maker, Glaxo, said yesterday. US District Court Judge Terrence Boyle, presiding in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, has retired to consider the evidence from 16 expert witnesses brought by Glaxo and Novopharm, a Canadian maker of generic (unbranded) drugs. Sales of Zantac, an ulcer treatment, are worth about Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.3bn) a year. If Novopharm won the case, it would be able to sell a generic version of Zantac from 1995. Mr Ian Smith, a drug sector analyst at broker Lehman Brothers in London, estimates that Glaxo would then lose Dollars 700m of revenue in the first year alone. The case was brought by Glaxo after Novopharm sought government permission to make generic Zantac. Novopharm is challenging one of Glaxo's two main patents on ranitidine hydrochloride, the active ingredient in Zantac. It is arguing that a specific crystalline form of the drug, known as Form 2, is not sufficiently innovative to warrant a patent. Novopharm says that the two versions are chemically the same, but Glaxo says Form 1 has never been sold and Zantac is based on Form 2. A less specific patent for ranitidine hydrochloride runs out in 1995, but Form 2 is protected until 2002. Over the past eight days Judge Boyle has heard eight witnesses from each company presenting legal and chemical arguments on the originality of Form 2. The outcome of this case is likely to affect another being brought against Glaxo by a Canadian generics maker called Genpharm. That case is due to be heard in May 1994. These companies are struggling over the future of a money-spinning drug at the peak of its earning power. Sales over the next few years are likely to fall. Zantac's arch-rival Tagamet, made by UK company SmithKline Beecham, comes off patent next year. Generic drug manufacturers are poised to launch a cut-price version. Zantac is also being challenged by a newer drug from Swedish company Astra. At the same time government pressure on the pricing of drugs generally remains high, especially in the world's biggest market, the US.</p>

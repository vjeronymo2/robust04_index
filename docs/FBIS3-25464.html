A  Cameroon Government communique issued yesterday confirmed the  clashes between Cameroonian and Nigerian forces on the Bakassi  peninsular. Casualty figures are not yet known, but the event  is being taken seriously in Yaounde, the Cameroonian capital.  Our correspondent Jean Mater Ndi reports from Yaounde.    [Begin Ndi recording] It is the first time that the Cameroon  Government talks about this problem in such a solemn fashion.  According to the communique, on the night of 18 February a  detachment of the Nigerian Army launched a series of attacks  against Cameroonian troops on the Bakassi peninsula in the  English-speaking south-eastern Cameroon. According to the  communique, Cameroonian troops responded and pushed back the  attackers.    It should, however, be noted that this incident is just an  extension of a situation existing since 21 December when 500  Nigerian soldiers occupied certain areas of Cameroonian  territory in the Gulf of Guinea. In the face of the negative  attitude of the Nigerian Government, while remaining vigilant on  the ground, Cameroon has opted for international arbitration.  The Yaounde authorities have decided to take the case to the UN  Security Council, the International Court of Justice at The  Hague, and an OAU central body for the prevention, management,  and resolution of conflicts.    Cameroon reaffirmed its sovereignty over the Bakassi  peninsula, citing in its defense the German-British treaty of 11  March 1913, the rule of intangibility of frontiers decided by  the referendum of 1961 attaching the former eastern Cameroon to  the southern part of Cameroon under British trusteeship. The  government also cited the Mawa Declaration of 1975 demarcating  the maritime borders between the two countries. [end recording]</p>

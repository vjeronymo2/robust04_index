			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Arts: Tunnel opens to closed minds To celebrate the opening of the Suez Canal Verdi created his most popular work, Aida, first performed in Cairo in 1871 to great acclaim. To commemorate the most spectacular engineering achievement of the twentieth century, the Channel Tunnel, we had, well, some really nice Kentish choristers singing their hearts out in a tent. It is a scandal, a striking expression of loss of national nerve and ambition, that the artistic contribution to the opening of the Channel Tunnel on Friday was so negligible. The finger must point at Alistair Morton, chairman of Euro Tunnel, who might have spared a borrowed mite from the billions invested in the Tunnel to create an occasion. The government, too, looks shabby and unimaginative, while local authorities, displaying their ambivalence to the project, pled poverty. Worse, there had been plans to do something interesting. There was going to be an arts festival. Impressive figure followed impressive figure as festival director. First Luke Rittner, then Michael Nyman, and finally Gavin Henderson, who each, to their amazement, discovered that they had to raise the million or so needed themselves by going cap in hand to business and government. Things became more farcical with the delays in the opening. About the only new work inspired by the venture, Michael Nyman's, TGV, actually celebrates, not least in its music, the French express train which makes British Rail look like Barkis and his cart. It was first performed last autumn in Lille when the TGV linked Paris to the north French city which had helped pay for the work, another embarassment for the British. Naturally any attempt to have a joint British-French artistic celebration floundered. The French went their own way and the citizens of Calais on Saturday night were able to get drenched listening to a new piece by Berio on the banks of a canal. The English concert was much more humble, but probably more enjoyable, the choirs of Ashford, Folkestone and Dover coming together with the few French singers that the Pas de Calais could spare for some choral favourites. There was one appealing oddity in the programme, unearthed by conductor Mark Deller: 'The song of the railways', commissioned from Berlioz in 1846, by who else but the town of Lille, to celebrate the first coming of the train. It is a rousing piece of popular art, as catchy as an operatic chorus, and well worth this timely revival. Its disappearance is attributed to a disgruntled citizen stealing the parts before the second performance because he had not been invited to the celebratory ball. But one musical footnote is hardly comparable to Aida. There will of course be plenty more events for the Channel Tunnel to celebrate - the appearance of the first paying passengers for example. It should start planning now. It could get advice from South East Arts which has done its best, by commissioning photographic exhibitions on the theme of the Tunnel and forging artistic exchanges with France, to make something of this rare occasion when the eyes of the world are focused on its region. For South East Arts feels neglected, and with justification. Its citizens receive much less arts expenditure per head from the Arts Council than anyone else in the country. The Council seems to think they can go to London for their artistic fix, a belief belied by a British Rail timetable. Still South East Arts is putting the Tunnel fiasco behind it and getting back to basics. It has just given Kent Opera a grant, a small sum but one that will help Norman Platt's much admired creation, killed off by the Arts Council to universal opprobrium in 1989, to rise again, with performances of Benjamin Britten's church parable, The Prodigal Son, opening in Bath on June 9th. A work by Purcell, perhaps even a masque, is planned for 1995.</p>

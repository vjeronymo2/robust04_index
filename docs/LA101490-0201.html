			<p><P> October 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOW COMES THE HARD PART IN LAGUNA'S LAND PURCHASE;  </P> <P> FINANCING: THE CITY HAS AGREED TO A PRICE, BUT IT STILL MUST RAISE THE MONEY TO  MEET THAT PRICE. TO PAY OFF THE FINAL INSTALLMENT, IT IS COUNTING ON STATE OR  FEDERAL MONEY AND PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS.  </P> <P> Now that the dust has cleared in the fight over a scenic stretch of Laguna  Canyon, how likely is the city of Laguna Beach to raise the nearly $80 million  it needs to buy the property?  </P> <P> The short answer: Financial experts say the city's plan to come up with the  first $40 million seems pretty solid.  </P> <P> It's the second half of the $80 million that's still up in the air. And one  thing is clear -- it will be a lot harder to get, experts say.  </P> <P> Last week, the Irvine Co. agreed to sell more than 2,000 acres in Laguna Canyon  to the city rather than build more than 3,000 homes. The price tag: About $78  million, a considerable amount of money for a city of 25,000 to raise but $27  million less than the value one independent appraiser put on the land.  </P> <P> In order to pay the first installment of the $78 million, the city must  persuade voters by a two-thirds margin to tax the city's property owners  another $60 or so a year in order to raise $20 million plus interest. A  two-thirds vote is tough to get, especially when people are being asked to tax  themselves. City officials believe that $20 million was the maximum amount  voters would support.  </P> <P> Even though Laguna Beach is a liberal Democratic enclave in conservative Orange  County, the vote is expected to be close. That is despite the city's  environmental leanings and a poll purportedly showing 80% of the residents  supporting the bond issue. The group that helped negotiate the compromise with  the Irvine Co. -- the Laguna Laurel Advisory Group -- is backing the political  campaign. But time is short: The election is Nov. 6.  </P> <P> One thing in the bond issue's favor is that observers say much of the Laguna  Beach business community is solidly behind the bond issue, in part out of  self-interest.  </P> <P> "They didn't stand to gain much from the development of Laguna Laurel, which  was going to have its own stores," said Salvatore Maddi, a Laguna Beach  resident and professor of social ecology at UC Irvine. "It wasn't likely to  have enhanced their businesses, plus it would have added to the terrible  traffic problems around here."  </P> <P> Assuming the bond passes, the city will use it to meet part of a $33-million  down payment due next year. In return the city gets part of the 2,150 acres.  </P> <P> The city has another $4 million in a fund to buy open space and says it will  borrow another $5 million on the $850,000 it takes out of its parking meters  each year. County government will kick in $2 million in the first year -- the  first of five annual contributions that will total $10 million. But that still  leaves the city $2 million short in the first year. And that's not all.  </P> <P> There are three smaller payments due in 1992, 1993 and 1994, all under $5  million. After each payment, the city gets another chunk of land. But on each  payment the city faces a shortfall of at least $1 million.  </P> <P> Then there's a big final payment in 1995 of $33 million, and right now the city  only knows that $2 million will come from the county. Selling the $20-million  bond to investors shouldn't be much of a problem. Nor should it be much of a  burden on the city's finances, experts say. The money will come directly from  the city's property owners in the form of higher property taxes. It won't come  from the $25 million a year it costs the city to operate, so it shouldn't put a  strain there.  </P> <P> And the city has no other bonds it is paying off. In fact, it hasn't issued a  bond in so long that neither of the big bond-rating services rates the city  anymore. (Small cities that are already built out don't need to issue many  bonds.)  </P> <P> It isn't even unusual for a city to start a project with financing from a bond  when it knows it is going to come up short and have to get more money from  somewhere else, said Mark Campa, an assistant vice president at Moody's  Investors Service Inc., one of two big companies that rate municipal bonds. The  other source the cities often turn to, he said, is a government grant.  </P> <P> What is unusual is for a city to use a bond to buy vacant land in order to keep  it empty, although a few other California cities have done so, according to  Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., the other big bond-rating company.  </P> <P> Whatever happens, the city won't issue another bond, city officials say. It  wouldn't be politically palatable even in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> How will the shortfall be made up each year? Laguna Beach says it is betting  that the money will come from state or federal funds and from private  contributions.  </P> <P> However, it is hard to say whether that is a good bet, although the state is  probably good for at least some of the shortfall.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach got $10 million in 1988 from a statewide open space  land-acquisition bond issue passed by voters, about $4 million of which is left  and will be applied toward the Laguna Laurel purchase. But that money was  earmarked specifically for the city.  </P> <P> The city is planning to enter the competition for up to $15 million available  from a state wildlife habitat measure approved by voters in June. Another bond  issue on the November ballot -- Prop. 149 -- doesn't set aside a large chunk of  money specifically for Laguna Beach, although officials think $3 million to $4  million will be available to the county.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach probably can make a good case for the money, even though the  picturesque little seaside city of 25,000 is already girded by a substantial  greenbelt.  </P> <P> But "there's usually a good deal of competition for this money," said Shirley  Willd-Wagner, a parks specialist at the state Department of Parks and  Recreation, which oversees the money.  </P> <P> "I think it's going to require a lot of work" to find the extra money, said  Paul Freeman, a consultant hired by both sides. "But everybody thinks it's  achievable."  </P> <P> Last week's settlement raises another interesting question: How much profit is  the company foregoing by selling to the city?  </P> <P> The privately held company won't say. But it's clear, say experts and even the  city of Laguna Beach, that the company could have made more money selling the  land to home builders if public pressure hadn't forced it to reconsider the  huge project.  </P> <P> The land -- acquired by Irvine Co. Chairman Donald L. Bren in 1983 when he  bought control of the giant landowner -- cost a lot less then when compared to  its value nowadays. So while the company is most likely foregoing a substantial  profit, it's by no means taking a loss.  </P> <P> But home builders say it's almost certain the company could have made perhaps  tens of millions of dollars more -- by one informal estimate, closer to $100  million -- by selling the land to home builders. Even Laguna Beach concurs.  "There's no question they could have made more money selling it to builders,"  said Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank.  </P> <P> A recent appraisal just released in detail at the end of the week and paid for  by the company and its opponents estimated the value of the land at $105  million. Neither side disputes that estimate.  </P> <P> But then there's also the matter of $30 million worth of road work the Irvine  Co. promised the county it would do to lessen the impact of the extra traffic  that Laguna Laurel would have generated. (The land is outside the city limits  in county jurisdiction.)  </P> <P> Had the project been built, the company probably would have passed on most of  that $30-million cost to the people who bought the homes in the form of higher  home prices. In other words, it wouldn't have cost the company very much.  </P> <P> Now, however, the $30 million will come out of the company's pocket. So most of  it has to be subtracted from the $78 million the company is getting for the  land since there will now be no homeowners to pass the costs to.  </P> <P> Also off the top of the $78 million comes whatever the company has spent in  more than 10 years of appearing before government hearings and preparing  environmental impact reports. The company says it hasn't calculated what that  figure is. But assume, experts say, that it's safe to subtract at least several  million dollars more from the $78 million.  </P> <P> That leaves the company with something in the mid-$40 million range to show for  the sale.  </P> <P> By contrast, if a developer paid $105 million for the property tomorrow, he  could reasonably expect to resell all the land to home builders for $311  million, according to the appraisal by Gary L. Vogt and Associates in Irvine.  </P> <P> Even after deducting the $85 million the appraisers estimated it would cost to  grade the land, put in utilities, pay property taxes and interest on loans, the  new owner could reasonably expect a profit of 15%, or nearly $47 million,  according to the appraisal.  </P> <P> Then there's the interest on the $78-million purchase price, which the Irvine  Co. will also forgo over the next five years. That would have added about $23  million, the company says.  </P> <P> Finally, there's the fact the Irvine Co. demands that builders who buy land  must pay the company a certain percentage from the sale of the homes they  build. The company gave up building its own houses several years ago; now it  merely sells improved land to home builders.  </P> <P> "It's clear to me the company's side of the deal was not wholly driven by  financial considerations," said one big home builder who has bought land from  the company. "I don't think there's any doubt the Irvine Co. is giving up a  small fortune on this." On the other hand, going ahead with the project meant  fighting a clutch of lawsuits and protesters marching through the canyon, some  of them promising to stand in front of the bulldozers. Those are costs that  can't be quantified but are very real nevertheless: Another massive  demonstration against the project, like the one that drew about 8,000  protesters to Laguna Canyon last fall, might have damaged the benevolent public  image the company is trying to cultivate.  </P> <P> Developing the project, in other words, might have been financially feasible  but had become politically unfeasible.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NERVY NEON;  </P> <P> IT DARES DESIGNERS TO TAME ITS MOODS  </P> <P> When we think of neon, it's usually in conjunction with Art Deco restaurants  and nightclubs full of hard surfaces and brassy music. These days, however,  lighting specialists are using neon to achieve an opposite end, to dramatically  enhance discrete areas in private homes.  </P> <P> Neon dares designers to be subtle. It is a light source that insists on  claiming one's attention. It can easily overwhelm other design elements. Even  in a large home, a bit of neon goes a long way.  </P> <P> "A house that would use neon would have to be contemporary, postmodern," says  Tustin lighting designer and architect John Lomeli. "It doesn't lend itself to  a classic, traditional house."  </P> <P> While neon is being used in new ways, it remains more fashionable than  functional. "Neon is nothing new; it's coming around for the second or third  time," Lomeli says. "I think it came back because Art Deco came back."  </P> <P> Designers face a challenge in taming its attention-grabbing nature, but neon  seems to be going through a boomlet because it has a number of attractive  qualities.  </P> <P> "There are variables you have with neon that you don't have with fluorescent  light," says Sam Barker, president of Sebco Distributing, a Santa Ana firm that  specializes in low-voltage, energy-efficient and decorative lighting.  </P> <P> Designers use neon to provide a soft reflected light around the roof line of a  room, or to draw attention to a piece of art. Often, the neon itself is the  artwork. "It's decorative lighting, not task lighting," Lomeli points out,  adding that it is popular for use in coves because it gives depth and form to  an architectural detail.  </P> <P> Although neon isn't a light source to read by, it has several advantages over  fluorescent light that make it highly effective in some situations.  </P> <P> "Neon is a detached element. You can put it on the ceiling, on the walls, on  the floor, because it doesn't have to do anything," Lomeli says.  </P> <P> Neon is dimmable, and it comes in more than 50 colors, including eight shades  of white. Neon tubes will also last for 2,000 to 50,000 hours, compared to 750  hours for an average incandescent light bulb.  </P> <P> Neon lighting uses a transformer at one end of the tube to excite the neon gas.  The excited neon glows red. If argon and mercury are introduced into the tube,  the light turns to shades of brilliant blue. Colored glass is also used to  expand the range of colors available. Neon tubing comes in several diameters.  The smaller tubing is used for architectural effect.  </P> <P> "Neon is glamorous. Neon is fun," Lomeli says. "It creates, and it participates  in, the illusion. Neon can be cold, it can be warm. It has a color palette that  can create mood."  </P> <P> Lomeli also calls neon "friendly," although he notes that not everyone will  feel comfortable with it. He says that research indicates young people have a  much greater tolerance for harsh lighting than do older people, and to many  older people neon seems harsh.  </P> <P> The neon light doesn't have to dominate the room, however, and in most cases it  shouldn't. "You don't want the light to be the focus of the room," says Ralph  Raya, chief executive officer at RWR Pascoe Engineering in Costa Mesa. "With  lights, we're creating a contrast to enhance the architectural elements. When  we are looking for pure architectural light, we go to neon."  </P> <P> Barker has used neon to accent localized areas in Orange County homes. At a  home in Emerald Bay with a skylight in the two-story entryway, Barker used neon  set in a soffit to outline the skylight, creating a distinctive halo effect.  </P> <P> At another home, the owners wanted to create the illusion that sunlight was  coming through eight leaded glass panes. The area where the lighting had to be  placed was difficult to reach, and Barker used neon because it requires less  servicing than fluorescent lights.  </P> <P> Neon also works well when the light is filtered through glass blocks. "It's  like saying ham and eggs," Lomeli says. "Glass block is back for the third  time."  </P> <P> While neon can be more effective than other forms of lighting in certain  situations, the reverse also holds true. On one lighting job, an architect  wanted a lighted step up to a bathtub with a dramatic view of the Irvine  valley. Originally he wanted neon behind the blocks.  </P> <P> With that approach, Barker says, it would have been difficult to service the  neon easily. Instead, he used incandescent grain-of-wheat bulbs in a flexible  polycarbonate tube, and ran the tubing across the top of the blocks that curved  around the base of the tub.  </P> <P> The downside of neon has been its initial cost. Installing neon costs roughly  twice what fluorescent does, Barker says.  </P> <P> Raya says that depending on the project, neon can compete with fluorescent  lighting on price. The space needed for installation of neon units is less than  that for fluorescent light. And fluorescent lights are very expensive to dim.  Over the long term, neon consumes less energy and requires less service. While  fluorescent lights have a tungsten filament that eventually burns out, neon has  no filament and will keep plugging indefinitely.  </P> <P> Besides the architectural restraints that influence neon's use, building code  restrictions have kept neon from wider residential acceptance. For safety  reasons, building codes currently limit voltage used in the home to a maximum  of 1,000 volts. Extended lengths of neon require use of a number of small  transformers.  </P> <P> Technological improvements, however, are making neon more feasible for use in  homes. New transformers are available that greatly reduce the voltage  requirements. And modern units sense overheating problems and shut themselves  off. When the glass in an older neon light broke, the traditional transformer  wouldn't shut down and there was the risk of fire.  </P> <P> The new units are also smaller and have better shielding.  </P> <P> The new transformer technologies are so new that most existing codes don't yet  recognize them, even if they're UL approved, Barker says. However, updated  codes regarding neon are in the works.  </P> <P> One consideration in using neon is the local availability of the tubing. Barker  says neon tubing is fragile enough and often so intricately shaped that  shipping it is risky business. As a further precaution, Raya says, "it's  important that whoever manufacturers the tube be the one who installs it."  </P> <P> Once in place, neon requires minimal maintenance. If a tube needs replacing,  the quality of the light won't change with the new tube. "If you don't break  the tube, it will last virtually forever," Raya says. The light output "will  depreciate, but a new tube will (fall) in the same spectrum."  </P> <P> Creating the tubing for neon lighting demands an artistic flair and a  craftsman's skill. Rather than the assembly line uniformity of fluorescent  tubes or incandescent bulbs, every neon tube seems to have its own distinctive  shape. The swirls and curves of a neon design are imparted by glass blowers,  and "there aren't enough (of these) glass benders around," Barker says.  </P> <P> With the increasing interest in neon, further technological developments may  extend its usefulness and reduce its cost. Sam Barker says that researchers are  refining a low-voltage battery that will power a neon tube. He has already used  a low-voltage neon system aboard a boat, to light an etched door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOW DO NEON LIGHTS WORK  </P> <P> Neon is a colorless, odorless, inert gas. The commercial applications for neon  lighting were quickly recognized in the early 20th century. Today, neon tubing  comes in several diameters and more than 50 colors. Neon tubes last for  2,000-50,000 hours, compared to 750 hours for an average incandescent light  bulb.  </P> <P> BACKGROUND ON NEON  </P> <P> Neon gas was first discovered in 1898 by the British physical chemists Sir  William Ramsay and Morris W. Travers, who named the gas after the Greek word  meaning new. About that time physicists were experimenting with generating  radiation by striking an area between electrodes in an evacuated tube  containing only small amounts of vapor. In Paris in 1910, Georges Claude filled  a tube with neon gas and found that when high voltage was applied to the two  electrodes at each end, an electrical discharge occurred, which caused the tube  to glow a deep red.  </P></p>

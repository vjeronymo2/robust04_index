			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent Sergey Knyazkov </F> under the "Events and Comments" rubric: "Bugle to Sound March  Order?: Talks Determining Future of 14th Army"]    [Text] As previously reported in KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, the  eighth round of Russian-Moldovan talks is opening in Kishinev.  Listed on the agenda are a draft of the Agreement on the Status,  Conditions, and Procedure for the Withdrawal of the 14th Army, a  number of other important issues governing the activity of  troops, and social and pension coverage for military personnel.    The interests of Moldova, the Dniester area, and Russia are  focused on the 14th Army. Moldova, acting with the republic's  integrity in mind, is calling for the withdrawal of the 14th  Army by the middle of this year. The reasoning here, according  to Moldovan Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs Ion Butnaru, is  that the army's withdrawal may "accelerate the resolution of the  conflict between Moldova and the Dniester area."    Completely different is the view held by the leadership of  the unrecognized Pridniestr Moldovan Republic, in that it  expects the new leadership of the Moldovan parliament to provide  not statements promising a resolution to the Dniester area  conflict (something which have been given in abundance), but  rather solid, document-based guarantees for reliable protection  of interests of the PMR [Pridnester Moldovan Republic]. However,  there are as yet no guarantees; the sole guarantee of peace and  security on the left bank of the Dniester, in the opinion of the  Dniester area residents, continues to be the 14th Army. And this  in spite of the fact that relations between the PMR's leadership  and the military authorities of the Russian Army have, for a  number of reasons, suffered a noticeable decline. In all  likelihood, the PMR's recent decision to appropriate and render  as republic property all the weapons and property of the 14th  Army is a reflection of this situation and an attempt to force  Russia to play a more active role in resolving the conflict  between Kishinev and Tiraspol.    In response, the 14th Army's military council demanded that  the "provocative" decision be rescinded, and Commander  Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed issued the order "to employ  weapons, firing for effect" to repel any attacks on Russian  service personnel and military installations. The RF [Russian  Federation] Minister of Foreign Affairs also made a strong  statement on this subject. Nonetheless, Russia still faces  holding difficult talks with Kishinev, even after condemning the  acts perpetrated by the Tiraspol authorities, since we are  interested in extending the mandate of the 14th Army's presence  on Moldovan soil, possibly as a basis of the Russian Army.    This is where Kishinev must be realistic. Withdrawing the  Army by the end of August and beginning of September 1994 is  absolutely impossible. In addition, redeploying weapons and  equipment, which are manned by local draftees and contract  servicemen in the amount of 85 percent, is something which even  the people of the PMR will not permit. And these realities must  be deal with whether one wishes or not.</p>

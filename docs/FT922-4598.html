			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Management: A Texan's radical cheek - The slick style with which H Ross Perot is packaging his bid for the White House is making other candidates rethink strategies Until H Ross Perot rode in from Texas, short in the saddle but long in the pocket, it did not appear that the packaging of presidential candidates this year would differ much from recent elections. The flag and the family (for President Bush), the pain and the hope of change (for Governor Bill Clinton) would be the predictable leitmotifs in the mainstream media, leavened, or sullied, by the usual dose of negative political advertising. Now, win, lose or draw, Perot may be in the process of changing that calculation. His wealth may be no more than an equalising factor, though one not enjoyed by previous independent candidates. But it is his unconventional approach to the media in its twin role as a conveyor of information and image which threatens to stand accepted wisdom as much on its head as did the Nixon campaign of 1968, so expertly chronicled in Joe McGinnis's book, Selling of the President. The Perot approach runs on two tracks. The first is to treat the establishment media as precisely that - part of that same establishment which he says is running the country into the sand. Symptomatic of this was that he chose to announce his interest in the presidency on a television talk show, and has spent most of his time since on what might be described as 'celebrity' programmes which tend to be stronger on style than substance. This genre, he has said, is what 'the people' now tune in to. The second stems from his understanding that this is now an electronically wired country, no longer so reliant for communication and information on conventional newspapers, TV and radio. His is a world of massive phone banks, electronic 'town meetings' and tele-conferences, where different and distant parts of the country can be hooked into one network to receive the message and, as in the ubiquitous talk shows, vent the complaints. Typical was last Friday's political 'event', which featured a live address by Perot - and subsequent 'two-way audio interaction' - from Orlando, Florida, to audiences in the capitals of five other far flung states - Ohio, Alabama, Kansas, Wyoming, and Idaho. The most that even a mobile conventional candidate might manage in the space of a single day would be airport rallies, and local 'soundbite' news coverage, from three of the six places at best; and the cost of the chartered jet alone might well exceed that of Perot's electronic network. There is a word for this bypassing of the accepted means of political communication; it is telepopulism, a variant on a political tradition as old as the country itself. In his way, Ronald Reagan was a telepopulist president, preferring to use his office as a 'bully pulpit' to go over the heads of the body politic. But his was of a less electronic kind, beyond the use of the Autocue. His principal approach was to charm the pants off the established media, in order to get his message over. Perot has leaped beyond this by ignoring both. He allows the traditional political media to ask its traditional political questions. But he considers himself under no obligation to reply as others might because he has established, as he would have it, his own independent means of communication. 'I'm not sure,' he has said, 'how much people read any more. What happens on TV is what really impacts on people.' And TV, with the proliferation of cable, is not what it was in the age of domination by the three commercial networks. He is also, by trade, a master salesman who understands that products and people need the right image, for which he is prepared to pay. Though he says he is not going to hang around 'having my nose powdered,' his press secretary says media buyers and other expertise will be contracted for in due course. For the moment, he recommends that those who want to know more about him read Wings of Eagles by Ken Follett, the 'fictional' account of the rescue of two of his employees from a Tehran jail in 1979 which casts Perot in heroic mould. But it has emerged that he had editorial control over the book. It will be interesting to see if a new 'biography' of Perot, promised by Random House for July publication, carries similar conditions. The problem for Bush and Clinton is whether to fight fire with fire, or, if not, how to deflate the Perot bubble. Clinton has begun to experiment with electronic hook-ups which play to his policy-oriented strengths and had previously exposed himself to some of the television programmes which Perot has subsequently adopted, though mostly to rebut charges about his marriage and sex life. Bush still insists that 'I won't go on Phil Donahue' - the daytime programme for housewives. Instead, the president has reached into Madison Avenue with the conventional recruitment of Martin Puris, of Ammirati &amp; Puris, and Clayton Wilhite, of D'Arcy, Masius, Benton and Bowles, to devise new and less stodgy advertising and media strategies. But Americans these days do not 'feel good' as they did in the 1980s. This leaves the most likely recourse for Bush and Clinton to take the route of 'attack advertising' against Perot - and for him, if his pugnacity and patent dislike of Bush is any guide - to respond in kind. The early primaries had seen some flexing of the offensive muscles in both parties, though against lesser targets. A Bush commercial in car-producing Michigan reminded that Patrick Buchanan, the 'America first' polemiscist, drove a Mercedes. This countered a Buchanan commercial in Georgia implying that Bush was soft on pornography and gays: a Clinton commercial in Florida, with its large retired Jewish population, implied that Paul Tsongas was anti-Israeli, while Jerry Brown's advertising came close to implying that Clinton ordered up a cull of blue collar workers in Arkansas every Wednesday. It has long been assumed that Republican strategists have been collecting material on the private life of Clinton and the outlines of skeletons in the closet of Ross Perot, the ruthless tycoon, have already been unearthed. Perot himself has a penchant for ordering up private investigations of those he dislikes, too. It could get real dirty. Or, then again, Perot may fade - but not before bringing about a sea change in the marketing of presidential candidates.</p>

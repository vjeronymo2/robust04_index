			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Government seeks way round Pergau ruling Britain may use its overseas aid budget to fund Malaysia's Pergau dam project, in spite of a High Court ruling last week that the government had acted illegally in making such donations. Amid growing controversy about the link between aid and international arms deals, officials at the Treasury, Foreign Office and Overseas Development Administration (ODA) have been examining ways to pay more than Pounds 200m to Malaysia without contravening the judgment. The High Court ruled last week that the ODA could not make direct payments for the Pergau dam project because it does not promote the development of a country's economy, as required by UK law. Treasury officials are now examining a scheme whereby the ODA could be required to make the payments indirectly so that Britain continues to meet a commitment made by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, three years ago. Under the proposal, the cost of Britain's aid donation to Malaysia would be met from the Treasury's contingency fund. The Treasury would then make commensurate cuts in the ODA's budget. The Foreign Office is understood to have warned that this method of paying the Malaysians could run counter to the spirit of the High Court judgment and might invoke further legal penalties. However, Foreign Office officials will be keen to ensure that the payments do not come from their own budget. Under the agreement with the Malaysian government, the ODA agreed to use its aid and trade provision to provide Pounds 234m in staged payments to help build the dam. The government still has to pay a total of Pounds 216m of these payments, which meet the costs of borrowing at concessionary interest rates to help fund the dam. The next payment, of Pounds 15m, is due on December 20. The controversy over the Pergau dam comes amid speculation that the UK has used development aid to forge a Pounds 6.1bn arms deal with Indonesia. Last night Baroness Chalker, the overseas aid minister, denied any connection between weapons contracts and aid to President Suharto's government. 'Our programme is targeted on human resource development, the environment, good government and transportation,' she said. 'We have repeatedly expressed our concern about Indonesia's human rights record. The Indonesian government recognises the need for improvement. I can confirm that at no stage has there been any linkage between our aid programme to Indonesia and the sale of arms.' However, UK military officials are planning a four-month military tour of Indonesia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region next year to promote UK naval equipment. It is understood that Westland-built Lynx helicopters will be demonstrated to potential buyers. The aid-for-arms allegations are set to be the focus of a Commons foreign affairs debate on Thursday, when Mr Hurd will face questions over claims that the UK's aid budget has been targeted at countries buying military equipment. The government is also facing a renewed public challenge over its defence policy with the launch today of a national campaign against official credit cover for arms sales. The campaign over the Export Credits Guarantee Department is being organised by the World Development Movement, the lobby group which won the High Court ruling against Mr Hurd over the Pergau dam funding. The group said the export credits department was being inundated with letters calling for an end to an estimated Pounds 322m annual subsidy to the defence sector.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sheila A. Samonte] </F>   [Text] The country's debt planners may be praying for more  rain.    Partly because the financial system is still relatively  awash  with dollars, a senior Bangko Sentral [Central Bank] official  said monetary authorities are confident government will be able  to service its $1.1 billion maturing obligations with the Paris  Club creditors sans any restructuring agreement.    "Even if these debts are not restructured, since we have  more  dollars ... we need not use up our gross international reserves  (GIR)," the official yesterday told BUSINESS WORLD.    Earlier, fiscal and monetary officials said the country may  no longer be able to fully reschedule its maturing Paris Club  debts in the next three years with the external financing gap  programmed to dwindle from $500 million this year.    The country serviced about $750 million in maturing  obligations last year. Another $234 million was paid during the  first quarter, while $560 million is scheduled in the second  quarter.    A three-year extended fund facility (EFF) from the  International Monetary Fund (IMF), seen to be approved this  June, is expected to enable the country to negotiate for a fifth  rescheduling agreement for its $1.1 billion maturing obligations  with the Paris Club.    Ironically, the high liquidity of the system -- mainly  brought about by the continuous deluge of from overseas contract  workers funds [as published] -- is testing the limits on the  country's healthy GIR position, which stood at about $6.3  billion as of mid- April.    Bank treasury officials were surprised when the Bangko  Sentral suddenly shifted gears and slowed down on its dollar  buying tack the other day after weeks of heavy buying. From a  total volume of dollar purchases of $1.06 billion as of  mid-April, the Bangko Sentral slowed down its support of the  peso with its current total volume now standing at about $1.2  billion, or a difference of about $141 million within the almost  two-week period.    The peso gained 78 centavos to the dollar the other day, to  close at P27.457 [Philippine pesos] to the dollar from the  previous day's P27.535.    As of about 2:30 PM, a trader said the last done deal stood  at P27.23. "With Bangko Sentral intervention, it may close at  P27.35," he predicted.    The Bangko Sentral has lately been buying only between $2  million and $3 million on the average per bank, the Bangko  Sentral official admitted.    He, however, said the Bangko Sentral is "still following  market (movements)." A primary reason for the heavy buying tack  it earlier adopted may be inflation, which monetary authorities  are closely watching out for because of the system's excess  liquidity situation.    "It's not that we're not buying much, but there really is  low  corporate demand due to last quarter's uncertainty in the  market." Investors overbought dollars anticipating that the  uptick in the peso exchange value would be carried over in the  first quarter of the year, the source said.    The interbank call loan rate (IBCLR) again surged, closing  at  a high of 68 percent (value dated Wednesday) or about 12  percentage points short of the record-high rate registered  end-September last year when the peso plummeted at a record-low  against the dollar. The average IBCLR was at 45.5625 percent,  5.875 percent higher than the previous day's average of 39.6875  percent.    "It's a very unusual situation," a treasury official  described.    The foreign exchange rate is seen to taper off to "normal"  level within two months' time, in anticipation of huge dollar  outflows as banks negotiate for more import demands. The Bangko  Sentral official said there has been a significant uptick in the  number of 60-day letters of credit being opened recently.    Still, at this point, treasury officials held mixed views on  where the upsurge in dollars come from.</p>

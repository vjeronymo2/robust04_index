			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Clarke's subtle differences with George Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, agreed at their meeting on March 30 that a further cut in interest rates might be warranted if the economy weakened and inflationary pressures remained subdued. But the official minutes of the meeting, released yesterday, show a nuanced difference in their approach to lower rates, with Mr Clarke more supportive of an eventual easing of borrowing costs than Mr George. The meeting, which by all accounts was short, took place at a time of rising long-term bond rates and turbulence on financial markets which overshadowed evidence of continuing steady non-inflationary growth in Britain. It ended with Mr Clarke concluding that 'it was not appropriate to change interest rates at the moment, in particular because of current market volatility'. According to the minutes, Mr George came to the conclusion that the latest evidence did not justify a further cut in interest rates from the 5.25 per cent base rate set in February. The governor said it remained 'possible that a further cut would be warranted in the future if there were hard evidence of activity turning out weaker than expected and inflation projections were revised down'. But he added: 'It would also be very unwise to consider an interest-rate cut in current market conditions.' Mr Clarke agreed that market volatility was an important factor and that a move on interest rates could put the credibility of monetary policy at risk. 'However, he felt that the markets had overreacted to events' and that 'there was no evidence in recent data of a deterioration in the prospect for inflation'. The minutes show the chancellor taking a subtly different approach to Mr George by setting less tough inflation conditions for a rate cut and worrying about any delay in tackling a possible economic slowdown. Mr Clarke 'felt that if activity weakened and inflationary pressures remained subdued, there might be a case for a further cut in interest rates. 'He was also concerned that waiting for cast-iron evidence of a slowdown in activity before moving interest rates would risk delaying too long.' By showing broad agreement, the latest minutes supported Mr Clarke's denial this week of a clash between himself and Mr George. Instead, they give a picture of two men who relish intelligent debate over economic policy issues. As the chancellor told the Confederation of British Industry dinner on Tuesday night: 'I share the same aim of low inflation and sound money. I decide, but we discuss and seek to agree.'</p>

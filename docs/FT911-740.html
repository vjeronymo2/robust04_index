			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Arts: Tokyo &amp; Endellion Quartets - Queen Elizabeth and Wigmore Halls The qualities of the Tokyo Quartet are rare and precious: tone as supple as fine leather, each note precisely directed, each line drawn taut with an athlete's muscular control, the ensemble faultless in blend and balance. In a Tokyo concert one soon learns to take for granted standards of execution out of the reach of all but a few quartets; but the quest for technical exactitude no longer inhibits the artistic freedom of the performances as in the early days of the group's existence it sometimes seemed to. The conversational side of Tokyo quartet-readings has blossomed; the four players achieve both unanimity of purpose and individuality of character. In Monday's South Bank recital their Beethoven (Op. 18 no. 1, in F) and Mozart (K575, in D) made for a gripping first half. Neither performance could be described as 'European', or steeped in the manners of the 18th century: there was little intimation of the Haydn-like sleights-of-hand that Beethoven was setting out to equal (or even outdo), and, in the Mozart, little attempt to search out nuances of gentle wit or smiling suggestiveness beneath the courtly facade. In the performances of less remarkable quartet-groups these limitations might be regretted. Because the Tokyo playing was so strong and so masterly, one accepted the style on its own terms - without qualification, with pleasure and admiration. A similar experience was offered by the Brahms Piano Quintet after the interval, with Barry Douglas a virtuoso pianist unfailingly sensitive to his string-playing partners. It was not subtly hued Brahms, shaded with nostalgia, hesitation, and regret; but it was definite, superbly disciplined, and ringingly powerful. The Endellion Quartet is this month embarked on a Wigmore Hall Beethoven cycle. The first instalment, on Wednesday, was very much a mixed bag: even after one had succeeded in drumming the long-lined beauty of the Tokyo sound out of mind and memory, it did seem that the players were falling prey to an unusual amount of technical flaws (the intonation of the leader, Andrew Watkinson, can prove alarmingly insecure under pressure). What's more, and in contradiction of the Endellion's current high standing among English quartets, it was hard to gain any impression of real purchase upon Beethovenian musical argument. The C minor (Op. 18 no. 4) was unremittingly bland, the 'Harp' (Op. 74) uncomfortably out of focus; and even though in the big B flat, Op. 130 (given with Beethoven's revised finale), there was greater evidence of technical control and tonal consistency, no 'long view' was presented to the listener. One hopes later concerts in this cycle will more convincingly explain why the Endellion decided to embark on one.</p>

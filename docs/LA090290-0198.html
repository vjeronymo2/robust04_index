			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EDISON'S DEFENSE GETS DOWN TO BUSINESS IN SHUTOUT VICTORY IN HONOLULU;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: CHARGERS INTERCEPT THREE PASSES AND LIMIT IOLANI TO 25 YARDS RUSHING  IN 12-0 TRIUMPH.  </P> <P> Edison High School football Coach Dave White spent game day snorkeling in  Hanauma Bay, maintaining a low-key approach toward his team's season opener.  </P> <P> But White and his team were all business Friday night at Aloha Stadium. The  Chargers limited Iolani to 25 yards rushing in a 12-0 victory in front of 4,200  fans.  </P> <P> Edison scored the only points it needed in the second quarter when Chip  Anderson blocked a punt that rolled out of Iolani's end zone for a safety and a  2-0 lead. The Chargers had problems getting untracked on offense and had to  settle for a field goal by Brent Hanson and a three-yard touchdown run by  Travis Balding in the final quarter.  </P> <P> "This looked like the first game of the year in Hawaii," White said. "There  wasn't a lot of consistency or continuity by our offense. We didn't look poised  at times, especially in the first half, but we got a shutout."  </P> <P> Edison intercepted Iolani quarterback Paul Ah Yat three times and limited  Hawaii's top returning quarterback to 101 yards passing with a strong pass  rush. Ah Yat completed eight of 25 passes and was sacked five times.  </P> <P> "I don't think that team has ever seen defensive linemen as quick as ours,"  said Mike Cunningham, Edison's standout free safety. "I'd say 80% of the time  we didn't have to worry about their passing game because our line was putting  the pressure on him (Ah Yat)."  </P> <P> Cunningham was clearly the best player on the field, returning five punts for  81 yards, catching six passes for 77 yards and intercepting a pass. Mike Eidam  and Danny Steinle also had interceptions for Edison.  </P> <P> Edison's special teams were also impressive. Hanson, who doubles as a punter  and kicker, averaged 43.2 yards per punt and put three kickoffs into the end  zone.  </P> <P> "We did some good things, but we still have a long ways to go," White said.  "Cunningham made some great individual plays. Our kicking game was very good  and we got three interceptions.  </P> <P> "But it looks like our defense and kicking game is going to have to carry us  for a while. We lost all of our offensive starters except Cunningham and it  showed."  </P> <P> Edison struggled to get 61 yards rushing and quarterback Josh Gingrich was  sporadic, completing 11 of 20 passes for 128 yards.  </P> <P> Tailback J.R. Schusterick gained 55 yards in 16 carries. He had eight runs in  which he was held to no gain or minus yardage.  </P> <P> "I think we were trying to do too much offensively," Cunningham said. "Our  defense did well, but we had some mental mistakes. But I think everybody will  be happy going home with a win."  </P> <P> Edison's victory celebration at its hotel was interrupted by police officers.  About 300 parents and boosters gathered in the hotel lobby and when  cheerleaders began shouting, "Fight, fight, fight," hotel administrators called  the police, thinking a fight had started.  </P></p>

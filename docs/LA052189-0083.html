			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOURNING THE DEATH OF KEDG  </P> <P> Goldirocks went for a walk in the woods. She came upon a cottage and decided to  go in listen to the radio. First she tried KNAC; it was great -- but then it  got too hard. Then she tried KROQ, but she didn't feel like dancing. Then she  tried KEDG; it too was great, but then it became K-LITE and got too soft.  </P> <P> Goldirocks is now a stationless orphan, constantly channel-hopping -- looking  for a home. Is there a place for her?  </P> <P> VICKIE COLEMAN  </P> <P> Westminster  </P></p>

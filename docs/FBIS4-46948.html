			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Pichugin, with commentary by the </F> International Life Department, under the rubric "The Steepler  Company Is Automating the Duma": "Deputies Have Each Received an  Automated Work Station"]    [Text] As soon as the State Duma of the Russian  Federation made a determination as to its location, the  management of its staff began to urgently resolve the issue of  automating the activities of deputies. On 4 May, Chief of the  State Duma Staff Andrey Voykov and General Director of the  Steepler Company Maksim Selivanov signed a general agreement on  the creation of the Duma Data and Communications Complex (IKK).  The first stage of the effort ended as early as today: The  computer network has been installed, tested, and started up;  Steepler has embarked on user training, and the deputies have  begun to test the complex at work and submit individual wishes.  According to a business plan submitted by Steepler, the  tentative cost of the complex comes to $30 million.    No official competition or tender to automate the State Duma  was held. At any rate, in the words of company president Andrey  Cheglakov, Steepler has not happened to encounter competition,  even if the Duma staff considered alternative variants. Mr.  Cheglakov believes that there was simply no time to hold a  tender in keeping with all the rules. Indeed, 100 days have  already passed since the Duma began its work, but its location  was not finally determined until the end of April. As soon as  the specific floor space became known after the move into the  building of the former State Planning Committee, Mr. Voykov, who  has great experience with automation, made his choice.    An extremely tight schedule for making deliveries and  performing work was one of the conditions of the project.  Steepler has accumulated great experience in the area of  comprehensive automation of enterprises (its customers include  the Staff of the President of Russia, the Bank for Foreign  Trade, and Surgutneftegaz). Steepler has included in its staff  specialists who at one time took part in the computerization of  the CPSU Central Committee, the Staff of the USSR President, the  USSR Supreme Soviet, and other structures. Incidentally, the  perestroyka history of automation of deputy work began with an  order from Anatoliy Lukyanov. The Supreme Soviet he headed was  equipped with Macintosh computers made by the Apple company with  specially designed automated work stations for deputies. The  fate of this complex is traceable up to the October events of  last year in the White House, and thereafter the trace is lost.  In view of the fact that Steepler has the status of wholesaler  (large wholesale supplier) of the Hewlett Packard company, the  current IKK of the Duma has been designed on the basis of  network equipment, computers, and peripherals of this American  company. A dozen Epson dot matrix printers and Panasonic  communications and office equipment account for an insignificant  proportion of the total volume of equipment.    Each Duma deputy will receive a work station worth  $15,000-20,000. It will be possible to quickly dismantle the  entire complex and move it to another building: The Duma is  making provisions for the event of moving yet again. Mr.  Cheglakov views the assignment of the Duma automation order  specifically to a Russian company also as a manifestation of  protectionism: This is an effective way for the state to support  Russian business. Perhaps counting on the continuation of such  practices, Steepler, which used to bet on developing a  dealership chain, has changed priorities in its operations  somewhat. At present the company gives preference to the  implementation of large projects involving the comprehensive  automation of enterprises.    [Boxed item]  <H5>  Commentary </H5>   The world understood long ago that legislative authorities  wishing to work efficiently must be computerized. The case of  the U.S. Congress is perhaps the most impressive. The  computerization of the Congress began as early as 1974. Annually  no less than $1 billion is appropriated to maintain a colossal  data and computer network. The House of Representatives and the  Senate have their own networks; not only each legislator but  also his aides have computerized work stations. However, giving  everyone a computer is just the beginning.    The effectiveness of operation of a network depends on its  interaction with nationwide databases. The computer networks of  the U.S. Congress have access to all databases of the country  (there are about 10 that are the most important), and have an  opportunity to retrieve any data, from a quote from a provincial  newspaper on any topic to data about world industrial output  broken down by sector. There also is a database of the Congress  itself drawing on the Library of Congress. At present, the  transfer of its records to laser disks is being completed.    As a result, the staff of the U.S. Congress is capable of  not  only criticizing or knowledgeably supporting the draft laws of  the administration, but also of developing in detail a  full-fledged alternative draft budget (this means thousands of  pages of text). In general, computerization is a good foundation  for legislative fertility: During one session the U.S. Congress  passes more than 20,000 laws, and is in a position to monitor  the execution of any one of them.

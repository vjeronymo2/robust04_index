			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION GIVES LELAND SPARKS OK TO PLAY  </P> <P> Leland Sparks, a fifth-year senior at Santa Ana Mater Dei High, has been  cleared to play football by the Southern Section Executive Committee,  Commissioner Stan Thomas said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sparks, who transferred from Van Nuys Montclair Prep three weeks ago, had been  granted a fifth year of eligibility by Southern Section officials two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> At the time, however, Sparks' transcripts from Montclair Prep showed that he  had not completed the required 20 units during the spring semester and  therefore was academically ineligible.  </P> <P> Wednesday, Southern Section officials reviewed another transcript provided by  Montclair Prep, which showed that Sparks had met the requirement for  eligibility.  </P> <P> "We had a corrected transcript, and in a (class) where no grade appeared  before, a passing grade has been inserted," Thomas said. "He now meets the  required 20 units."  </P> <P> Sparks, a wide receiver/defensive back who has been practicing with Mater Dei  for a week, still had a grade-point average for the spring semester of less  than the required 2.0. However, he can be placed on academic probation, which  would allow him to play.  </P> <P> Lyle Porter, Mater Dei principal, said Sparks would not play tonight against  Riverside Poly.  </P> <P> Porter is reviewing Sparks' class performance, and a decision should be made in  the next week on when he will be allowed to play.  </P> <P> Derek Sparks, Leland's cousin, also transferred to Mater Dei three weeks ago  and is playing football. He is on academic probation. CHRIS FOSTER  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE VEGETARIAN: PUMPKIN'S NIGHT OUT AS GNOCCHI  </P> <P> Despite its versatility, creamy texture and high vitamin content, pumpkin seems  to have been so stigmatized by its annual role as jack-o'-lantern that we  rarely use it for anything but desserts. After all, how can you get serious  about a vegetable that virtually invites you to make a face of it?  </P> <P> Here's how: try these rich, chewy gnocchi. And be sure to use a fresh sugar  pumpkin because canned pulp is too watery to hold the flour and won't work.  </P> <P> PUMPKIN GNOCCHI  </P> <P> 1 (2-pound) pumpkin  </P> <P> 3 cups unbleached flour, about  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> Dash sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup melted butter  </P> <P> 1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese, about  </P> <P> Cut pumpkin in half lengthwise, scoop out stringy pulp and seeds, then cut  pumpkin into quarters. Fill deep baking dish 1/3 with water. Place quartered  pumpkin in dish, shell side down.  </P> <P> Cover dish with foil and bake at 375 degrees 45 minutes to 1 hour or until fork  pierces pumpkin flesh easily. Remove pumpkin from baking dish and allow to  cool.  </P> <P> Spoon pumpkin out of shell and into large mixing bowl. Mash with fork until  consistency of mashed potatoes.  </P> <P> Measure 2 cups pumpkin pulp and place in bowl. Add flour 1/2 cup at time,  mashing to blend with pumpkin, until dough forms that may be handled.  </P> <P> Take golf-ball sized piece of dough in hands and roll into log shape, about 2  1/2 inches long. Cut in half and press lightly in center of each to make  indentation. Place on lightly floured wax paper. Continue until all dough is  used.  </P> <P> Bring large pot of lightly salted water to boil. Add gnocchi several at time.  As soon as gnocchi rise to surface, remove with slotted spoon, allowing water  to drain well. Place in warm, covered serving dish. Continue until all gnocchi  have been boiled.  </P> <P> Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar into melted butter. Toss gnocchi with melted  butter, then toss again with Parmesan cheese to taste. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P>  Note: Gnocchi may be refrigerated overnight. Boil and butter just before  serving.  </P></p>

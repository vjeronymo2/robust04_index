NHTSA is denying this petition because the agency believes that, in common usage, the words ``caution'' and ``warning'' are synonymous and that either word properly achieves the intended effect. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mr. Daniel Cohen, Chief, Frontal Crash Protection Division, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, NRM&hyph;12, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Telephone: (202) 366&hyph;2264. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> On September 2, 1993, NHTSA published a final rule (58 FR 46551) requiring that manufacturers install air bags to satisfy automatic crash protection requirements for the front outboard seating positions in certain motor vehicles, beginning on September 1, 1996. The final rule also requires that three labels bearing specified information related to air bags be placed in air bag-equipped vehicles. S4.5.1(b)(1) of the rule requires one label to be permanently affixed to the sun visor of each front seating position with an air bag. This label would have read: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Caution <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> To Avoid Serious Injury: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> For maximum safety protection in all types of crashes, you must always wear your safety belt. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Do not install rearward-facing child seats in any front passenger seat position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Do not sit or lean unnecessarily close to the air bag. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Do not place any objects over the air bag or between the air bag and yourself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See the owners manual for further information and explanations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 29, 1993, American Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki) submitted a ``request for interpretation'' regarding the wording of the sun visor label. Suzuki requested that manufacturers be permitted to use the signal word ``WARNING'' as an alternative to the signal word ``CAUTION'' in the heading. Suzuki pointed out that the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) had issued a standard (Z535.4&hyph;1991) for signal words on product safety signs and labels. The standard contains a hierarchy of signal words signifying different degrees of potential personal injury. In this hierarchy, ``caution'' signifies a potential for ``minor or moderate injury,'' and ``warning'' indicates the possibility of ``death or serious injury.'' Since accommodating Suzuki's request would require a change in the wording permitted by the regulation, instead of an interpretation of the existing wording, it was treated by NHTSA as a petition for rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 10, 1994, NHTSA published a notice (59 FR 11200) responding to two petitions for reconsideration of the September 2 rule and three requests for interpretation of that rule (including Suzuki's). In response to Suzuki's request, the agency stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA added the phrase ``CAUTION, TO AVOID SERIOUS INJURY'' in the final rule to ``attract occupants' attention to the label and provide a brief statement of the risks of improper use and consequences.'' NHTSA concluded that substitution of the word ``WARNING'' would also achieve these goals, and is therefore permitting its use. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> NHTSA therefore amended S4.5.1(b)(1) of Standard 208 to permit manufacturers to use either word in the required air bag label. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a petition dated May 12, 1994, Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety (Advocates) requested that NHTSA reverse its decision to permit the word ``WARNING'' as a substitute for the word ``CAUTION.'' Advocates styled its petition as a ``petition for reconsideration of an interpretation.'' However, the challenged action was a regulatory amendment, rather than an interpretation. Advocates' petition was received too late to be treated as a petition for reconsideration of a regulation under 49 CFR &sect;553.35. Therefore, NHTSA is treating the letter as a petition for rulemaking. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The petition sets forth substantial and procedural objections to the March 10 amendment. As to substance, Advocates believes that the word ``WARNING'' will cause vehicle occupants to be unnecessarily concerned. It disagrees with NHTSA's conclusion that ``CAUTION'' and ``WARNING'' are equivalent, citing the stronger nature of the word ``WARNING'' in the ANSI hierarchy of signal words. Advocates added that it thought the entire label concept was unnecessary, but that it reluctantly accepted the September 2 final rule's use of the word ``CAUTION'' because it was less aggressive than the word `'WARNING.'' It believes that ``[t]he message now conveyed is clearly one of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> danger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of likely serious injury'' (emphasis added). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency did not rely on the ANSI standards when deciding to permit the use of the word ``WARNING.'' In fact, Suzuki's petition was granted based on the conclusion that the words ``WARNING'' and ``CAUTION'' would achieve the same results since they have similar meanings. This similarity is evident in the following dictionary definitions: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=16 g=1 f=1 --> Random House Dictionary of the English Language (unabridged): <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=14 g=1 f=1 --> caution&blank;a warning against danger or evil; anything serving as a warning <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Travel: Stopover sickness - The Practical Traveller EASILY the worst flight I have suffered in years was a recent jaunt from London to Bali aboard Garuda, the hapless Indonesian state airline, writes Michael Thompson-Noel, Travel Editor. First we stopped in Paris. Then we landed in Abu Dhabi. Then Singapore. And then we changed flights in Jakarta for the last leg to Bali. Total flying time, from take-off at Gatwick to touch-down in Bali: 23 hours, 25 minutes. Total travelling time, door-to-door, from Notting Hill in London to the Grand Hyatt resort, Bali: 27 hours, 45 minutes. The return journey to London was just as painful. As a result, I had to take to my bed for three days with systemic collapse. I was not greatly pleased by this carry-on, and vowed in future always to monitor the travel arrangements made on my behalf. When I spoke to Garuda, the airline said that at present, because of international agreements, it was prevented from flying more than three times per week between the UK and Indonesia, and was in any case not permitted to fly direct to Bali. From the end of June, however, a new agreement ought to improve its service to Bali. With luck, it will have two flights a week between London and Bali, stopping only once, at Abu Dhabi. There is a clear lesson here - always study the fine print of travel brochures, and quiz travel agents and airlines closely on the nature of flights offered. Do not be fobbed off. What you want, wherever possible, is a non-stop flight. If they tell you it is 'direct', interrogate them relentlessly to find out what they mean. Bali is an attractive holiday isle. But you would want to get there speedily. What is the point of spending thousands on a Bali holiday, only to see large chunks of time gouged from the start and end of it because of Garuda's magical mystery tours?</p>

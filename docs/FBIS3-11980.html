			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Paz, 28 Mar (EFE) -- Former Bolivian President  Jaime Paz Zamora's "irrevocable" resignation from political life  over his and his party's alleged involvement in trafficking has  surprised Bolivian political circles.    Senate President Juan Carlos Duran, the top leader of the  ruling Nationalist Revolutionary Movement (MNR), said Paz  Zamora's decision to withdraw from political life is personal.    Duran said the Movement of the Revolutionary Left (MIR) must  now weigh the situation and define its political future.    Miguel Urioste, acting president of the social democratic  Free Bolivia Movement (MBL) -- which is allied to the MNR --  said the time is not right "to prey on a fallen man" because  this would hurt the image of Bolivian democracy, adding that  "history will judge what has happened."    Deputy Ricardo Paz Ballivian, of the opposition Conscience  of  the Fatherland (Condepa), regretted Paz Zamora's decision,  adding that the former president was "deeply affected" by  accusations against him and his family.    "A party is an institution that cannot disappear because it  is an alternative for the Bolivian people," said Paz Ballivan  regarding the MIR -- the party he founded -- and its future.    Deputy Jerjes Justiniano, of the leftist Democratic  Socialism  Alternative (ASD), said Paz Zamora is a "scapegoat" for things  done by some MIR leaders, adding that "institutions are not bad,  only the men leading them are bad."    Jorge Landivar Roca, head of the Nationalist Democratic  Action (ADN) -- a former MIR ally and member of the ruling  coalition that governed the country between 1989 and 1993 --  said Paz Zamora's recognition of mistakes during his presidency  was an act of "courage."    Current MIR President Oscar Eid -- who is also involved in  the trafficking report -- said his party will not discuss its  immediate future until the investigations on the alleged  "narco-links" are concluded.    Eid said that when undisputable MIR leader Paz Zamora  resigned, the party lost its main "orientation." Eid added:  "Our former leader recognized his mistakes with dignity and  courage. Just as achievements receive praise, errors have a  cost."    MIR bloc leader Carlos Borth said party followers are  disoriented and paralyzed by their leader's resignation and the  accusations against various MIR leaders.    Borth said he will ask for an emergency meeting to analyze  Eid's possible separation and to form a new executive board.    During the week MIR leaders testified before the Justice and  Judicial Police Committee of the Bolivian Congress, the body  responsible for investigating the alleged "narco-links."    Paz Zamora is considered to have the most important  international career of the past years. He issued a dramatic  message on 26 March ending his political career under the burden  of accusations linking him with drug trafficking.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / French Greens discuss strategy FRENCH ecologists, battered by failure in elections three months ago and divided over whether to stay independent or to forge alliances with the Left, met over the weekend to chart a course for the future, Reuter reports from Paris. Mr Antoine Waechter, Greens leader, and Ms Dominique Voynet, viewed as his challenger, sought to minimise their longstanding differences as the party began a two-day gathering in Paris. Ms Voynet said she did not envisage a fusion with Socialists, as called for earlier this year by Mr Michel Rocard, Socialist party caretaker leader, but simply wanted a clear opposition to face conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 'We have to risk opening up, but that does not mean renouncing the independence we have always favoured,' Ms Voynet told the meeting of some 570 party activists. Mr Waechter, whose camp has the edge over Ms Voynet's among party militants, said he did not define independence in the same way. But the differences would help 'enrich' the party, he said. The Greens' standing slumped in the March general elections that swept the Socialists from power and gave a centre-right coalition a crushing parliamentary majority. The Greens had an election pact with rival ecologists, Generation Ecologie. However, in spite of pre-election predictions of strong results, the combined ecologists garnered less than 8 per cent of the vote and failed to win a single seat. The Greens' customary respect for democracy in party proceedings meant some 140 issues were put down for voting on Saturday - on amendments to a text on the party's strategy and identity.</p>

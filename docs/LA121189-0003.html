			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: BOWLING JOINTS WANT YOU TO STRIKE THE WORD ALLEY FROM YOUR  VOCABULARY  </P> <P> Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers.  Centers. Centers. Centers. Centers.  </P> <P> I am doing penance for referring to bowling alleys. I recently posed the  rhetorical question: Would you rather live in an area known for its golf  courses or its bowling alleys?  </P> <P> I got a hot response from Diane Elliott, marketing director for Leisure Time  Sports Inc. of El Cajon, which runs six bowling alleys/centers/lanes/places/  establishments in San Diego County.  </P> <P> Elliott wrote that I'm obviously outdated, biased and sexist. All of this from  my comments regarding golf versus bowling. Wow, wait until she hears my  political ideas!  </P> <P> She invited/challenged/dared me to visit North County Lanes in San Marcos to  see how things have changed. I accepted/acquiesced/knuckled under.  </P> <P> North County Lanes is one of Leisure Time's newest: a clean, well-lighted  place, with 60 lanes, video games, cable television and free child care. (Try  asking your golf pro for that.)  </P> <P> Also, a lounge, snack bar and, this being the holiday season, a fully loaded  Christmas tree. The chandelier is a nice touch.  </P> <P> There are senior leagues on most afternoons and junior bowling on Saturday.  Nearly all leagues are co-ed.  </P> <P> Jim Murtishaw, the teaching pro at North County Lanes, is constantly correcting  people who say alleys.  </P> <P> "Bowling has an image problem it is trying to shake," he said. "Some people  just refuse to believe that bowling is no longer a bunch of beer-bellies  smoking cigars and knocking down pins in some cellar."  </P> <P> That image is obsolete at North County Lanes. Like pool halls before them,  bowling alleys have been converted to "family fun."  </P> <P> I remain retrograde, however. I worry that something has been lost in the  sanitizing and wholesome-izing. The old hairy-knuckled alleys had their place  in the social order.  </P> <P> As either Mike Royko or Joseph Campbell once said, there are several hundred  thousand social workers in this country but only one Minnesota Fats.  </P> <P> There is wisdom there somewhere.  </P> <P> New and Improved?  </P> <P> The political whirl.  </P> <P> * Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt held a fund-raiser Sunday at the La Jolla home  of investment broker Michael Hands. She needs to pay off a campaign debt of  $140,000.  </P> <P> Aren't you glad the "new politics" has given us council members who don't need  to run expensive campaigns and beg for money from the well-heeled?  </P> <P> * Here are names being floated as possible contenders for Lucy Killea's  Assembly seat.  </P> <P> Among Democrats: former Killea aide Chris Crotty; school board member Susan  Davis; San Diego City Councilman Bob Filner; attorney and former Fair Board  member Byron Georgiou; Rich Grosch, former aide to Mike Gotch; community  college Trustee Evonne Schulze, and attorney Howard Wayne.  </P> <P> Among Republicans: one-time Killea opponent Earl Cantos Jr; Jeff Marston,  former aide to Gloria McColl, and Wayne Raffesberger, aide to Ron Roberts.  </P> <P> But It's Supposed to Be Fattening  </P> <P> Tres mas.  </P> <P> * The San Diego Truffle Works is working on a chocolate Truffle Lite.  </P> <P> State law requires food to have 30% fewer calories to be called "lite." Truffle  Works owners Todd and Karen Keegan have trimmed only 20% off the usual 375 to  425 calories per 2-ounce confection.  </P> <P> Research and development continues. I'll keep you posted.  </P> <P> * The Navy hopes to airlift the 300 officers and sailors from the destroyer  Kinkaid back to San Diego by Christmas.  </P> <P> The Kinkaid had been due back this Friday, before it collided with a merchant  ship Nov. 12 off Malaysia. Repairs in Singapore and then Subic Bay will take  until early spring.  </P></p>

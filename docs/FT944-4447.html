			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Opinions on EU swayed by poll questions Sir, The survey of attitudes to the EU in Britain and Germany ('Poll shows wide opposition to single EU currency', December 5) reveals that popular bewilderment, not to say sourness, takes a very similar form in both countries. But I was also heartened to learn that 39 per cent of British respondents thought the present very close political links between EU member states should 'remain unchanged'; of those 40 per cent, a majority thought they should be even closer. German opinion is very similar. The respondents' demand for a referendum on a single currency stands at 64 per cent in Britain, and 1 percentage point higher in Germany, which did not surprise me. On the great majority of important subjects, proposing a referendum is invariably popular. The hard fact remains that some issues lend themselves better than others to the kind of 'yes' or 'no' decision-making, which is all that a referendum can offer. There is clearly no way of forcing the electorates to concentrate on the issue at hand. The September 1992 Maastricht referendum result in France was, for instance, above all a reflection of the low standing of the government of the day. In Ireland the treaty was widely thought to mean abortion on demand would be introduced as of right. I hesitate to be pedantic, but note that the exact form of the question in your survey relates to a referendum on whether the EU should introduce a single currency. The question for us is rather: should Britain remain outside a single currency were the EU to go ahead with the commitment (contained in the Maastricht treaty) to introduce the single currency by 1999 at the latest? This is a clear pointer to the prodigious difficulty of formulating questions not only in referendums but in opinion polls. There was one thing in your report that took me aback. I had always assumed the German public to be well-informed. You have put me right. The 57 per cent in Brandenburg who know the Commission is based in Brussels get a pat on the head for their 'above-average' performance. I will draw a veil over the 38 per cent in the East Midlands who got it right. It depressed me but I was not very surprised. As Goethe put it, against stupidity the gods themselves strive in vain.

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Tories warn of big tax rises under Labour: Chancellor pledges basic rate of 20p in the Pound 'when affordable' THE Tories yesterday launched what amounts to their first pre-election offensive as Mr John Major was joined by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in claims that taxes would 'go through the roof' if there were a Labour government. Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, called the assertions absurd. Mr Lamont reiterated the Tories' pledge to reduce the basic tax rate to 20 pence in the pound. He underlined, however, that the reductions would be made only when they were 'affordable'. Speaking in Oxford last night, Mr Major claimed Labour pledges would mean higher taxes for everyone. The Labour party's promises would mean 'a whopping tax increase not just for the rich - certainly for the rich - but a tax increase for each and every taxpayer', he said. The basic rate of income tax would have to rise 10p in the pound if Labour's taxation plans were put into effect, he said. Mr Lamont, using figures drawn from the costings of Labour policies that the Tories presented in June, said that a taxpayer on Pounds 14,000 would be, on average, Pounds 1,000 a year worse off under Labour. But Mr Smith accused the Tories of going for 'the big lie' and warned that the move was intended to divert attention from the state of the econ-omy. He attacked the Tory pledge on reducing income tax, saying: 'We do not think that can be done and also afford the money that needs to be spent on the health service and education.' While ministers believe that emphasis on prudent tax cuts is a vote-winner, a survey for today's Independent newspaper and BBC's Newsnight found that 71 per cent of those asked said they thought the country would gain more from increasing public spending than from cutting income tax. The NOP poll also shows that if there are tax cuts, most people would prefer a reduction in VAT to a cut in the basic rate. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, sought to pre-empt yesterday's onslaught by insisting at the weekend that 88 per cent of all earners would not suffer higher taxes under Labour. The new top rate of income tax at 50 per cent would affect only people earning 'well over Pounds 30,000', while the removal of the ceiling on national insurance contributions would apply only to those earning more than Pounds 20,280 a year. There would be no increase in the basic tax rate of 25 per cent, Mr Kinnock insisted. While the Tories are keen to emphasise their commitment to being the party of lower taxation, they are conscious of the need to maintain their reputation for economic competence. The Tories' nationwide campaign, on the theme of 'Labour's tax bombshell', involves more than 1,000 posters. Thousands of leaflets with figures for claimed tax increases for people on incomes from Pounds 5,000 upwards will be distributed over the coming weeks. Mr Lamont said that anyone who did not accept that Labour would have to increase taxes across the board to pay for its 'wish list' of policy pledges, was 'living in Cloud Kinnockland'. The Tories say that, in a year when the Labour programme was being fully implemented, their plans would cost an extra Pounds 35bn. The costings assume that Labour's planned tax changes would raise up to Pounds 10bn and that the remaining Pounds 25bn would have to come from increasing the standard tax rate from 25 per cent to 35 per cent. Labour countered that the Tories would increase VAT if they won the election, drawing the parallel with the increase after their 1979 victory from 8 per cent to 15 per cent. Mr Lamont said he had no plans to raise indirect taxes, and emphasised that the last 5p reduction in the standard rate of income tax had been achieved without a corres-ponding shift to indirect taxation.

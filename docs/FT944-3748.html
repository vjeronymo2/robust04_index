			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Management: An explanation for advertising I had cocktails the other evening with a living national treasure. Well, not exactly cocktails. He drank Scotch and I drank tomato juice, though after 1 1/2 hours they seemed quite sophisticated. In Japan, I think it is, they have an official system of numbering their LNTs. Thus a poet in Fukuoka might be Living National Treasure Number 29, while a master potter in Nayoro might be No 137. If Britain had such a system, Jeremy Bullmore would be a designated LNT for his contribution to the world of advertising and thus to the world of business. He is a businessman's businessman. He was 65 recently, and has lost none of the charm, wit and incisiveness that are the trademarks of London's most famous adman. I used to think that his distinguishing talent was his ability to explain what advertising is about to outsiders. But his real significance, probably, has been his ability to explain what advertising is about to admen - what it is and isn't, what it can do and can't. He has been the conscience of advertising, as well as its inspiration. And not just in Britain. He joined the London office of the J Walter Thompson agency in October 1954, and retired from it in December 1987. He started as a trainee copywriter, became a writer-producer, and eventually creative director. From 1976 to 1987 he was chairman of Thompson in London. He was also a member of Thompson's international board, and for six years chairman of the UK Advertising Association. Since 1988 he has been a non-executive director of The Guardian and Manchester Evening News, and of the WPP Group, which owns Thompson. I caught up with the LNT on his home territory in Mayfair, in a tiny pub in Farm Street a few doors along from WPP and only a stone's throw from his former agency. I had wanted to ask the LNT if he had ever known a period in business like the present one, when the word 'boom' appears to be a dirty one. I said: 'Advertising is booming, isn't it? In the first half of this year UK advertising enjoyed real growth close to 8.5 per cent, and is expected to continue at something like that rate for quite a while. 'When I was a reporter covering the ad business, in the early 1980s, agencies would have been ecstatic at growth like that - which, of course, they were used to. There were parties every day, people rolling in the street, joy unconfined. But now it's all so quiet. People working slavishly, too busy to count the money. Have you ever known a period like it?' 'No,' said Jeremy, 'not in 40 years, but then you are using boom in the technical sense, extracting it from the figures, whereas it doesn't feel like a boom and nobody's got the time even to mention the word - partly or even mainly because of fear of nemesis, God and downfall. No one is tempting fate. Even the go-for-its aren't mentioning the boom word.' 'Go-for-its?' 'Yes. In business there is always a struggle between the go-for-its and the tooth-suckers. This is especially true in advertising. At present, the go-for-its are in thrall to the tooth-suckers. And the longer the tooth-suckers remain in the ascendancy, the longer the pain will last.' 'Are you a go-for-it?' 'Not at all. I am an in-between. Call me a finger-crosser. I hated a lot of that stuff in the 1980s. It takes the joy out of life if you have to be mindlessly expansionary all the time, always saying go-for-it, whereas the present mood suits me. I quite like caution. At present there is a good balance between optimism and caution which suits my temperament. For advertising, it's healthy. It came to a point in the 1980s when some clients were telling their agencies that what they wanted was famous advertising - advertising that people would talk about. 'It was a vanity thing, and really quite preposterous. Somehow, advertising had become confused with 'creativity' and the winning of awards - a minor art form instead of part of the commercial process. Believe it or not, there were debates going on about whether agencies should be 'marketing' or 'creative' shops. The reason for advertising was being lost sight of.' 'And that reason is?' 'The only reason for advertising is that your client is better off having spent his money with you than he would have been if he hadn't' The collected thoughts of Jeremy Bullmore can be found in his book, Behind the Scenes in Advertising (NTC Publications). Chapters include: What sort of family does this Jaffa cake come from?, The hair restorer that didn't, High noon at Elkhart, Indiana, and Never use irony in Chicago. It has a sensationally brief introduction by fellow adman David Ogilvy, which starts: 'I read this book in bed last night. Fascinating.' But pay no heed to Ogilvy. Behind the Scenes in Advertising is one of the best books on the business you are likely to find or need. Just what you would expect from an LNT.</p>

Deadline for Their Destruction May Not Be Met"]    [Text] Saratov Oblast -- Around now a terminal was to have  been built on the banks of the Volga in Saratov Oblast to strip  out [peretarivaniye] chemical agents from their containers  [yemkosti] and subsequently detoxify them. That at least is  what the draft first stage of the state program for the  destruction of chemical weapons envisages. However, local  residents, worried by leaks at stores that have been here a long  time, have sounded the alarm and are objecting to new  installations with this kind of specialism.    Russia's president signed the Paris Convention on the  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons a year ago, in January 1993.  According to the Convention, the first installation for the  destruction of chemical agents must be tested within two years  at most. Half this time has already elapsed and Russia still  has no laws, no concept, no approved state program for chemical  weapons destruction. Meanwhile leaks of poisonous substances  from containers that have eroded have been recorded at the  arsenal sited on the territory of Saratov Oblast.    The village of Gornyy, where 690 tonnes of mustard gas, 225  tonnes of lewisite, and 210 tonnes of their compounds are  stored, is not far from the Volga. The chemical weapons that  have been here for ages, packed in metal barrels and railroad  tankers, pose a potential danger.    The strength of the harmful chemicals will be reduced by a  factor of 1,000-10,000 when the chemical agents are stripped out  at the new terminal. The plan is to reprocess the reactive  matter obtained in Shikhany, 100 km from Gornyy, where the  top-secret State Institute of Organic Synthesis Technology  [SIOST], which developed chemical weapons in the recent past, is  located.    Doctor of Sciences Aleksandr Kochergin, the institute's  director, said that several technologies have been developed for  the destruction of the stocks from the arsenal in Gornyy.  Whereas the situation is clear with regard to the mustard gas,  a choice has not yet been made with regard to the lewisite and  its compounds. In the opinion of SIOST scientists, the most  preferable option is for this kind of chemical agent to be  recycled [utilizatsiya] since it contains costly arsenic used in  microelectronics, laser technology, optics, and pharmaceuticals.  In other words, the recycling technology presupposes not only  expenditure on chemical weapons destruction but also  considerable income from the reprocessing of chemical agents  into particularly pure arsenic, which Russia does not currently  produce.    This technology can also be used to recycle  arsenic-containing adamsite -- an irritant chemical agent  produced early this century, which has been shipped to Shikhany  from throughout the former Union -- of which more than 8,000  tonnes have been buried straight in the ground at the testing  range of the military institute next to SIOST. The huge Russian  adamsite dump is a source of great worry not only to the public  but also to scientists, who are voicing misgivings over the  possible environmental contamination from these stocks.    It may seem to the uninitiated that there are no particular  problems with the destruction of the Saratov arsenal. It is  only the choice of technology and the construction of a terminal  and recycling installations that are holding things up.  However, one must not forget that we are talking about chemical  weapons, which are to be destroyed in densely populated areas  right next to the Volga. This is a very sensitive subject for  the residents of the area since the environmental background  here is unfavorable enough as it is. In the city of Volsk, for  instance, which is no more than 5 km from Shikhany as the crow  flies, the arsenic content in the soil is already several times  in excess of the maximum permissible concentrations owing to  three local cement plants using so-called pyrite cinders, which  contain arsenic, in their manufacturing process.</p>

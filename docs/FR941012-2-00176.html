			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Develop a series of clearly stated educational messages about missing and exploited children.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These messages, delivered through media, teleconference, publications and other sources should be designed to communicate the human, economic and social costs of the victimization of missing and exploited children and their families. These materials should explain the need to prosecute offenders who commit crimes against children, point to sources of human services, and promote prevention measures. These messages should translate the latest available information about the nature of the problem into themes that can be clearly communicated in communities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Develop information vehicles for dissemination to targeted audiences.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These vehicles could be public service announcements and other public education materials that are tailored to parents and different professionals who see the evidence of the problem in communities. These materials should be of a type that can be economically reproduced and widely distributed.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Develop an approach for evaluating the effectiveness of these materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Survey information or focus groups could be vehicles used to evaluate the ability of public education materials to impart key facts about prevention, intervention services, and the need to prosecute crimes against children committed by adults.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Goal 2: Develop Effective Community Approaches  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OJJDP will identify, design, and make available  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> effective community approaches  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> for addressing the problems of missing and exploited children and their families. These approaches will deal with specific aspects of family abduction, non-family abduction, thrownaway children, and otherwise missing children.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Strategies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluate relevant information from Title IV funded activities to identify gaps in existing knowledge and identify ways to fill those needs.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information needs to be developed to establish risk factors that can be used to identify potential abductors in family and non-family cases so that prevention and intervention tactics can be more sharply focused. More also needs to be learned about relatively new categories of missing children such as thrownaways and otherwise lost children.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Design multi-agency methods for dealing with specific types of missing and exploited children to include chronic runaways, thrownaways, and victims of family abductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Issues related to confidentiality and information sharing among the range of agencies involved in missing and exploited children cases should be addressed in order to promote inter-agency collaboration. Comprehensive case management methods should be adapted to address the needs of missing and exploited children and their families for each of the categories of missing children cases.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Develop training and technical assistance materials and prepare a Title IV Technical Assistance Catalogue. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

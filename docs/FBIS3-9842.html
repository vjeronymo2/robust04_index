[Klaus] There is no simple reply to this question. The  Environment Ministry's work is not satisfactory. However, it is  necessary to carefully consider whether this is due to the  complexity of the problems with which the ministry is dealing or  a consequence of the minister's own work, whether it is due to  the ministry's being too big and heavy-handed or whether some  other factors might be at play. I do not ascribe primary  importance to differences of views or to the exceptional  complexity of environmental problems. I think, rather, that the  reasons this ministry's activity has been very unsatisfactory  for almost two years [since Frantisek Benda became minister] are  of a subjective nature and do not rest with the minister alone.    [Krejci] The annual rate of inflation fell below 10 percent  for the first time in February. Is this a permanent trend?    [Klaus] The rate of inflation is now nearing the level we  consider probable over the long term. When we say that the last  figure for the annual rate of inflation is 9.7 percent, it does  not mean that I can pledge that, in the months to come, it will  be 9.4 or 10.1 percent. Anyway, in this area we are moving in  regions that are a world apart from the other postcommunist  countries, and I think we are beginning to approach the Western  level. Nevertheless, the rate of inflation is still at least  double the European Union average, and getting near this average  is still a question of a few more years. The adjustment of  individual prices to their balanced level over the long term is  still under way, and this process is pushing prices up rather  than down.    [Krejci] Czech Social Democratic Party [CSSD] Chairman Milos  Zeman has supposedly contacted some politicians in Slovakia and  proposed the creation of a Czechoslovak Union. What do you  think about that?    [Klaus] Milos Zeman, the CSSD chairman, is incorrigible in  many ways, including, it seems, in this matter. Every sensible  person in our country and in Slovakia knows that this issue is  absolutely not on the agenda and that this is a mere shooting of  arrows somewhere where there is no target and no spectators.</p>

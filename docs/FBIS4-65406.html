			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [`Mue'-signed report: "Brussels White Paper Reveals </F> Considerable Differences Between Bonn and Paris"]    [Text] Finance Minister Theo Waigel clashed with Jacques  Delors, the president of the European Union [EU]. It was  apparently unavoidable and overdue. Delors vehemently rejected  Waigel's proposal to form an independent team of experts that  would review all legislation of the EU "as to whether  unnecessary regulations can be eliminated and whether reliefs  for the enterprises are possible." At the finance ministers'  meeting in Brussels on Monday [16 May], Delors made no secret  that he understood this proposal as a vote of no-confidence  against himself because the Commission has been examining the  tangle of EU rules for quite some time.    Bonn's financial leader does not deny that. His proposal has  a completely different background. The Commission's efforts are  taking place under the motto "subsidiarity." It is discussing  the distribution of the competence between the community and the  member states. Waigel's suggestion, however, is partly an  attempt to translate the findings of the so-called "White Paper  on Growth, Competitiveness, and Employment" into practical  economic policy in the community of the Twelve. The leader of  the Christian Social Union has recently criticized that this  White Paper, which was drafted by Delors and his aides behind  closed doors, threatens "to fall apart because of the lack of a  cohesive concept." In fact, the White Paper contains some ideas  that the Federal Government supports: More Europewide norms and  standards to ensure a more efficient use of the single market,  EU-wide tax and financial reliefs for small and medium-sized  enterprises, open external borders and flexibility of the labor  markets, as well as deregulation and consistent privatization.  Yet the main emphasis of the White Paper is on "trans-European  energy, transportation, information, and communications  networks," whose rudimentary establishment alone, however, would  involve over 300 billion German marks.    It is true that Delors' arguments that the national states  are primarily responsible for deregulation, privatization, and  the general reform of the political preconditions for  competitiveness and job-creating investments, but that Brussels  should be entrusted with planning trans-European networks are  logical. However, one cannot ignore the fact that the  Commission is increasingly fascinated by the prospect of  launching large projects involving huge sums that would make it  possible to indulge in the redistribution ideology to an even  greater extent. Even the Brussels news service AGENCE EUROPE,  which is completely loyal to the Commission, announced recently  that the EU working group, "Networks," is making good progress,  whereas the group, "Employment," which is considered more  important in Bonn, is lagging behind. Delors' policy is totally  in keeping with the thought pattern of his home country. The  two governing conservative parties, the Gaullist Rally for the  Republic and Giscard d'Estaing's liberal-conservative Union for  French Democracy, are basing their current campaign for the  European elections on the "large building programs" that are  currently being drafted in Brussels.    The EU heads of state and government want to examine what  has  become of the White Paper in about four months. They will  probably have to make enormous efforts to cover up the fact that  the economic concepts of the northern and the southern member  states are hardly compatible. The dividing line runs between  France and Germany. As early as the most recent summit in  Brussels in December, when the White Paper was presented,  dissonance arose spontaneously. The Commission pointed out the  significance of a solid budget policy to the member states,  always trying to use the "networks" as a vehicle for obtaining  permission to take up capital at its own initiative.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksander Prochorov, Director of the Institute </F> of General Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences: ``The  Plight of Science''; first paragraph DELOVIE LYUDI comment]    [Text] The Nobel Prize winner and one of the creators of  the laser, Alexander Prochorov, claims that Russia is joining  the ranks of the third-grade science power and unless the  government's attitude to science does not alter, the process  will be irreversible.    The golden years of Russian science were the end of the  1940's and the beginning of the 1950's. Salaries, provisions and  equipment were all of the very best quality. In retrospect, this  had its good and bad aspects, but the fact remains that  scientists were well looked after. The results were positive:  for years the world has been using a particle accelerator which  was designed and made by Soviet scientists during those glorious  years. It was at that time too that work began on developing the  laser principle of producing high-intensity radiation, for which  the author of this article, together with Nikolai Basov and the  American Charles H. Townes, was awarded the Nobel Prize for  physics. In those years research began into space and astounding  progress was made. The list of examples goes on. Western  scientists who are aware of the collapse of Russian science are  tempted to ask, ``How is it then that the Soviet Union managed  to break ahead?'' American colleagues remark how the successes  of the USSR influenced the policies of the U.S. Congress and  administration on basic science and scientists in that country.    In Russia, the situation has deteriorated, a process which  began under Nikita Khrushchev. The policy of ``uniting science  and practice'' was carried out ruthlessly. Whole institutes  which carried out academic research were handed over to  industry, including the Institute of Computing and Mathematics,  the Institute of Oceanology and others. Fundamental research was  placed on the back burner. The result in a number of important  branches of science was lamentable. Specialists attracted by the  ``introduction into industry'' abandoned a number of ideas in  the field of microelectronics. No attention was paid to the idea  of ultra-pure materials or to high-quality diagnostic equipment.  As a result, the computer Pamyat, which was way behind those  being made abroad, was developed. Now, Russia is so  ``successful'' that her scientists wonder whether they will ever  catch up with the Americans and the Japanese.    It is true that even in bad times there have been people in  government who have well understood the importance of basic  science. Many significant developments were made under the  patronage of the military, but secrecy problems arose. As a  scientist, it was clear to me that without exchanging  information it would be impossible for science to move forward.  I managed to stop many feeble attempts to make research work at  the Institute of General Physics secret. It is curious to  remember the complaint of one Russian who bemoaned the fact that  he, who had the power to classify any of a scientist's projects  as "top secret" and forbid him to travel abroad, was unable to  classify his thoughts.  <H5>  CATCH 22 </H5>   The deterioration which is taking place in Russian science  has already caused the country to be relegated to the third  world, and in five years this process will be irreversible.  Within the Academy of Sciences, a fall in scientific and labour  discipline has become commonplace, as has the desertion of  scientists for other spheres and the attempt to move abroad at  all costs. The Presidium of the Academy has increased the  salaries of scientists, but mostly this remains true only on  paper, as the government cannot fund it. A stratum of  self-styled ``pensioners'' has already formed amongst  scientists. These scientists appear at their institutes mainly  on the days when their allowances are paid (they cannot be  called salaries), while in the rest of their time these  candidates and doctors of science earn extra money by building  dachas for businessmen, quietly growing crops on  their plots of land, or turning to business. Of course, a number  of institutes, including the Institute of General Physics,  retain their former glory: the group of those devoted to science  remains intact; foreigners come, offering contracts and joint  projects. However, the West sees Russian scientists as cheap  labour. Leading Russian scientists are being offered salaries on  a par with those in Malaysia or Mexico. Proposals have been made  to buy out laboratories or even whole institutes and, naturally,  to dictate the research programme.    Russian science has been forced to sell its most important  files, expensive equipment and materials, and designs which are  the last word in scientific thought and which any other country  would not sell at any price. In saying this, I do not wish to  give the impression that I am against partnership or cooperation  with foreign scientists. I myself was born in Australia, and  have lived abroad and enjoyed the hospitality of foreign  scientists. The Institute of General Physics is working on a  number of joint projects, including with the U.S., South Korea  and France. Yet the sale of scientific developments and  strategic supplies in the hope of saving what little remains  signals the beginning of a collapse.    However, even these necessary sales cost the Institute  dearly. It is told, ``You earn hard currency, therefore you must  be a commercial organization, and references to your research do  not give you the right to request a discount on electricity,  water or materials,'' which are needed in great quantities for  carrying out the work. Incidentally, references to our research,  or to the need to keep up scientific funding are not even heeded  at government level. Several appeals on the part of scientists,  including the president of the Academy of Sciences, to both the  Gaidar and the Chernomyrdin governments, had no success. The  matter is usually dealt with by petty clerks who take care to  remind representatives of institutes that there are many mouths  to feed.    Although the current powers include, as never before, many  people with scientific degrees--there are even correspondent  members and academicians--such an attitude reflects the lack of  understanding regarding the scope of basic science which, given  the chance, could make breakthroughs in high technology. Even in  former times, advanced, promising ideas were not always taken on  board. At the time when laser technology was being developed, a  director of industry had to be invited to the Institute to  attend seminars describing the future for laser technology. At  least then scientists were trusted, but now the lack of  understanding is deepening, as is the economic crisis.  <H5>  RICH MAN, POOR MAN </H5>   In this situation, all that remains to do is to fold one's  arms and wish success to those who find a work placement abroad  and sign a long-term contract. What else can one do, if the  average salary at a scientific institute is 25,000 rubles (25  dollars at the beginning of September). How can these people and  their families survive in comparison, newspapers advertise jobs  for painters with a salary of R150,000. Comments to the effect  that science must be reorganized and freed from its excess  weight are disturbing. What is needed is a normal level of  financing, the provision of equipment and materials, and of  course, control over the results.    The fact that Russian science is lagging behind is growing  more noticeable by the day, and, what is more, the advance of  scientific knowledge in the rest of the world is accelerating.  It is cause for concern that Russian scientists have nothing to  report to world conferences on technology. Russia might once  again miss the boat, for instance in nanotechnology, where  scientists are working on the level of atomic structures. A new  era of laser technology is about to begin, and here Russia is  behind: there is no money available to finance this work, and  nothing, as is known, will come of nothing. One cannot even  order foreign science magazines--there is no hard currency. At  the Institute of General Physics work has been stopped on  crystal growth. The effect this will have on microelectronics is  clear: all materials will have to be imported. Indeed, even  Russia's own manufacturers are driving her towards this. For  example, zirconium oxide, which is used in the manufacture of  fianite currently costs so much that it is cheaper to buy it  abroad. Yet due to the shortage of hard currency, work in this  field will also have to cease. Financing in the field of  fiber-optic communications, laser physics, solid-state physics  and optics, where Russian institutes have high-class designs  attracting the interest of foreign countries, is nowhere near  sufficient. Thanks to a number of contracts with foreign firms,  some of them are still managing to get by.    If developments are not made in the field of fiber-optic  technology, the country as a whole will be unable to make any  progress. People wrongly believe that cellular communications  are an alternative, but one of the disadvantages of such systems  is the ease with which conversations can be overheard. With  fiber-optic systems, however, it is impossible to listen in on  conversations: i.e., not only military, but any commercial  secrets will be better protected. I believe that Russia has all  that is necessary to create a fiber-optic network herself.    Russia is a country rich in talent and ideas, but most of  all  it must be hoped that she does not destruct science herself. It  can be saved today, but tomorrow will be too late.</p>

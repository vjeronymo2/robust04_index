			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Call to impeach Yeltsin after supreme court ruling THE IMPEACHMENT of Russian President Boris Yeltsin was demanded yesterday by Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. The call came after the supreme court ruled that Mr Yeltsin had broken numerous articles of the constitution. The Supreme Soviet will meet today to consider calling on Friday a special session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the conservative-dominated full parliament, to discuss impeachment. His opponents would need to muster a two thirds majority vote in Congress for impeachment, though he refuses to recognise that Conress alone has power to remove him. Mr Khasbulatov said: 'We face today a direct attempt at a coup d'etat. . . It is as clear as day that there is every ground for impeachment.' The court's judgment said Mr Yeltsin's address to the people on Saturday, his assumption of 'special rule' and his demand for a popular vote on who should govern the country, on a new draft constitution and electoral law, added up to about a dozen infractions of the constitution. The judgment, described as 'mild' by a court official because it did not call for impeachment and agreed with Mr Yeltsin's aims of continuing reform and safeguarding the country's integrity, nevertheless defined his actions as lawless. A parliamentary session yesterday afternoon was almost immediately postponed by the speaker as Mr Yeltsin's mother was buried in Moscow. Even hardline deputies agreed on the need not to be thought callous in pursuing Mr Yeltsin on a day of mourning. The impeachment threat is now very real. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, said in a radio interview that it was 'expected' by the president and the government. A senior presidential official who asked not to be named said that if the decision were taken, the president would ignore it. This would face the parliament and its allies with the harsh choice of attempting to enforce it by causing Mr Yeltsin to step down and replacing him with General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president. Mr Khasbulatov said that, if impeachment were passed, Gen Rutskoi should take over as acting president for a period of about three months until fresh presidential elections were held. Three points of conflict became clearer: The enforcement of an impeachment ruling could lead to rival forces attempting to deprive Mr Yeltsin of office, or protect his retention of it. Regional and republican leaders who defy a presidential order, signed yesterday to carry through reforms, face dismissal - but could rely on local support to continue their defiance. Mr Khasbulatov directly appealed to officials at every level not to follow the president's lead but to 'stay within the limits of the constitution' - a direct invitation for rival factions supporting the president and parliament to form throughout the country. However, Mr Boris Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance, seized the opportunity presented by special presidential rule to call for the sacking of Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman. In a letter sent to Mr Gerashchenko and to Mr Yeltsin, Mr Fyodorov accused the central bank chief of 'sabotaging' the government's fight against inflation and refusing to give information on the levels of credit being granted 'despite dozens of appeals'.</p>

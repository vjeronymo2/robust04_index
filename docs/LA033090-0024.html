			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEETING STATE'S WATER NEEDS  </P> <P> Do the water resource people, the developers and the politicians know something  about our future water supply that the general public doesn't know?  </P> <P> At the same time that we hear about the possibility of a water shortage and the  necessity for rationing, there is no talk of restrictions on the building of  high-rises and housing developments that take millions of gallons of water  every day. We have substitutes for many things but certainly none for water.  Who is to say that our drought won't continue?  </P> <P> I think we are owed an explanation for this inconsistency by those who should  have control of the situation.  </P> <P> DENTON A.

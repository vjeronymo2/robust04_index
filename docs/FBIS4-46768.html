			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ernst Chernyy, member of the Civic Chamber under </F> the Russian Federation President, expert for the Association of  Independent Professionals and candidate in geographical  sciences: "On the Hobby-Horse of Nationalism One Can Ride Only  Into the Abyss"]    [Text] Anyone who wanted to could, and probably even now  still can, buy on the street a copy of the newspaper RUSSKIY  PORYADOK (No. 9, 1 December 1993-January 1994) and learn from it  that point 5 of the "code of honor" of the Russian National  Unity provides that: "A fellow brother-in-arms, being a  full-fledged representative of the Russian Nation, is obligated  to restore justice in regard to the Russian people through his  power and his weapon, without appealing to judicial and  other institutions" (here and henceforth the italics are  mine--E. Ch.). Point 6 of this same code explains: "The  brother-in-arms resolves any questions guided only by national  legal consciousness in accordance with the powers and  authorities granted to him by the Chief Brother-in-Arms, and  is not subject to any other laws." The most  remarkable Point 3 of the code states: "Any encroachment on the  honor and dignity of a brother-in-arms is a crime  against the Russian nation." So there you have it! What is  this--megalomania or someone's angry will, which wants to turn  the country into a theatre of military operations? Point 14 of  the code declares: "A brother-in-arms is obliged to always  remember that Russia has no friends. One who forgets  this becomes a traitor." This is medieval blackness... Yet it is  so similar to that which the CPSU [Communist Party of the Soviet  Union] and the KGB [Committee for State Security] were in their  time able to do with our country, turning it into an enemy of  the whole world! On the next-to-last page of this newspaper,  from the text of this oath which appears very much like a  military one, we may learn that a brother-in-arms is obligated  to keep military, national and state secrets. A  national secret--this is something altogether new. We did not  experience such a thing even under the leadership of the CPSU  and the KGB. And since there are national secrets, then,  naturally, we must "have a cautious attitude toward all persons  of other faiths and toward foreigners." In short, it is a  textbook of hate. And this at a time when the United States has  put an end to racial discrimination, and when the last country  of classic apartheid, the Republic of South Africa, has embarked  upon the path of racial conciliation. In our country, along with  the outward fascists, it is the communists who have taken the  national idea into their arsenal.    The formation of pro-fascist organizations began as early as  the mid-80's, with the blessings of gorkom [city committee] and  raykom [rayon committee] functionaries. The CPSU and KGB began  to formulate groups which had the outward appearance of  different directionality, and on which they could subsequently  rely. When the appointed hour struck, the confusion of the true  CPSU and KGB leaders was short-lived. All went to their  pre-arranged "apartments"--the various parties, movements and  fronts. They scattered, like some animal from a fantastic  fairytale which breaks into many miniature copies of itself at  the moment of danger. Perhaps only the main headquarters of this  party and the levers of control are hidden from prying eyes.  However, it is unlikely that this evokes any doubt among  attentive observers regarding the existence of a well-managed  system. The strong anti-democratic communist-nationalist  newspapers have also been preserved: SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, PRAVDA,  ZAVTRA and many other smaller ones.    Very indicative was the emotional phrase of GKChP [State  Committee for Extraordinary Situation] Oleg Shenin (former CPSU  Central Committee member), upon the announcement of cessation of  work at the last session of the court: "The USSR shall be  restored!" As they say, they will not haggle over the price. And  the effort to unite the former Soviet republics will be similar  to the effort to bring all the powderkegs to one place--closer  to the bonfire.    Without troubling themselves over the reasons for the  disintegration of the USSR, the national-communists, finding  their scapegoats in the democrats, essentially never understood  why the country fell apart. Yet A. Solzhenitsyn knew about this  even 40 years ago, and not only knew, but wrote about it in the  "Archipelago" [Arkhipelag GULAG] which, unfortunately, not that  many of our fellow countrymen have read. (Otherwise, perhaps,  the elections last December would have gone quite differently.)  Aleksandr Isayevich wrote the following: "Rulers change. The  archipelago remains. It remains because this state regime could  not stand without it. Disbanding the Archipelago, it would  itself cease to exist." (Arkhipelag GULAG, part 7). The prophecy  has come to pass: First they liquidated the terrible  archipelago, and the rest collapsed by itself. The foundation  disappeared. No, it was not Yeltsin who tore down that old  building. It could exist only on the foundation of fear and  camps. So, for a normally thinking person, the consequences  turned out to be quite predictable.    The loud national-communist pseudo-patriots are calling  Russia not to the future, but to the past--to the musty world of  totalitarianism of reaction and terror. Yet Russia is a country  just like Germany or France, except that it had fallen behind  them by some 300 years due to the Mongol yoke and the extended  feudalism which was associated with it, whose chains were broken  only 130 years ago. It is easy to understand that mutual  guarantee and communal land ownership were necessary to the  feudal lords in order to keep people who had no rights under  submission. When the bolsheviks came to power, they merely  resurrected feudalism in a somewhat different form, replacing  the landowners with numerous party furers, and the commune with  kolkhozes. Today the national-communists assure us that this is  the "Russian way." That means they must again turn the people  into a mindless herd which they can drive to conquer world  supremacy, which the Zhirinovskiy followers need so much.    For this it is necessary to have enemies, both domestic and  foreign. In order to find them, the musty national thesis is  once again dragged out, remarkable in its primitiveness and  maliciousness, as is, we might add, also the approach to the  freedom of conscience--the intimate relationship of man with  God, a sphere where considerable progress has been achieved in  recent years. From the standpoint of the new specialists on  freedom of conscience, the nationalists: "Freedom of activity of  religious confessions, religious communities and individual  cleriks will be provided only in that measure in which it  strengthens the spiritual powers of Russians and those living in  Russia."    Yet in pre-revolutionary Russia, the national question as  such did not exist on a background of religious inequality.  Today, in connection with the weakening of religion over recent  decades, the ethnic torch is being fanned. We will note that  among the irreconcilable active Russian nationalists we may find  also the half-breed Zhirinovskiy, and this leads us to think  that the fanning of the nationalist flames is primarily a  political matter, and only at the lowest level--the level of the  lumpenized masses--does it take on a primitive nationalist  coloration.    Primitive because it would be laughable to speak of the  purity of a nation where even the emperor and the nobility were  not ethnic Russians. The lower strata of society were also not  ethnically pure in a complete sense--the 300-year Tatar yoke  stirred everything up. Those whom we today call Russians are a  mixture of Eastern and Western Slavs, Mongols and Ugro-Finns,  Khazars and persons of Scandinavian extraction, native residents  of the North and Siberia and persons of Baltic extraction. There  is a bit of everything here, and this, we must believe, is not a  shortcoming, but rather an advantage. And so for this very  reason, we should hardly seek out ethnic purity today among the  citizens inhabiting Russia, even in the newspapers ZAVTRA and  RUSSKIY PUT, and moreover prohibit mixed marriages and consider  them a crime, as the RNE [Russian National Unity] program calls  for. At the same time, it seems that one of the forms of  racism--anti-Semitism--in many cases is still a definite means  of achieving mercenary political goals. One such example is  Zhirinovskiy. However, he is not the only one. Entire  organizations such as the Russian National Council, the Slavic  Council, the Union of Russian Communities, and the Front for  National Salvation, not to mention the openly fascist  organizations, are shamelessly exploiting Russian nationalism  for their own political purposes.    Those who are busy searching out domestic enemies can divide  citizens into those who are more and less Russian. Therefore,  today we should fight not for the rights of nations, but for  human rights. This approach is broader and guarantees protection  for all. The tendency of slipping into the protection of rights  by national or linguistic principle will more often hinder than  help.    Nevertheless, the president and the MFA [Ministry of Foreign  Affairs] as represented by Kozyrev and its other leaders are  ever more often following the lead of numerous nationalistic  organizations in speaking of the rights of the Russian and the  Russian-speaking population, and not about the protection of  human rights, as is directly provided by the Constitution. The  protection of Russian and Russian-speaking citizens must be the  specific case of protection of human rights everywhere, wherever  they are violated. The success of international and national  rights protection organizations and their actions has always  been associated with the emphasis of attention on general human  rights.    Ultimately, we must admit that the idea of statehood on an  inter-ethnic basis is movement ahead, while the idea of national  limitation is obvious backward movement, as proven by world  experience.    In conclusion, here is one more quote from the "code of  honor" of the Russian National Unity, which emphasizes the  extremely aggressive character of the principles of this  organization, excluding it from the political sphere and  relating it to the number of openly terrorist organizations:  "Persecution of foreign and domestic enemies of the Russian  Nation, no matter how far beyond the boundaries of Russia they  may be found, is a matter of honor for the brother-in-arms." We  may draw our own conclusions. But who must be the first to draw  them? And where, ultimately, are our wonderful laws which are  called upon to defend civic peace in the country?    Freedom and democracy have come to us over difficult roads.  Can it be that our imprudence, carelessness and irresponsibility  will force them to leave our boundaries?</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Japanese jobs market improves Japan's ailing jobs market perked up slightly in January, to the markets' surprise, but the underlying unemployment rate continues to rise, William Dawkins in Tokyo reports. Unemployment inched down to 2.7 per cent in January, from a revised 2.8 per cent in the previous month, the first fall for nearly two years. The number of jobs available rose slightly to 67 for every 100 people looking for work, from 65 in the previous month. However, the January jobless rate still stands at a six-year high and the number of companies announcing early retirements and freezes on recruitment continues to rise. The total out of work rose by 21 per cent from the same month last year, to 1.84m, the government's management and co-ordination agency reported.</p>

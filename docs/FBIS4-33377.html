			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Opposition leaders yesterday decided to suspend  the talks they are holding with the government under the  governability pact. The opposition decided to withdraw from the  pact because the Colorado Party has filed a petition asking the  Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a law that prevents  military and police officers on active duty from being members  of political parties.    The decision to withdraw from the talks was announced  yesterday by Juan Manuel Benitez Florentin, president of the  Authentic Radical Liberal Party [PLRA]; by Miguel Angel  Montaner, president of the Christian Democratic Party [PDC]; and  by Victor Sanchez Villagra, president of the Febrerista  Revolutionary Party [PRF].    The opposition leaders noted that they were withdrawing from  the interparty board until the respective executive boards of  their parties decide the course of action to be taken. They  will have to decide whether to withdraw once and for all from  the interparty talks because the Colorado Party failed to honor  its promise to request the annulment of Article 2, not of the  entire law. [passage omitted]    The PLRA, PDC, and PRF members are already discussing the  possibility of forming a united opposition front to decisively  support the transition process to democracy. They believe  President Wasmosy is now lacking adequate political support  because even the Colorado Party executive board has made a  proposal that contradicts the president's decision. [passage  omitted]    The PRF yesterday issued an official communique to state its  position on the governability pact. The PRF announces that it  is withdrawing its representatives from the interparty board in  protest over the Colorado Party petition that the law  temporarily suspending the party memberships of military and  police officers on active duty be declared unconstitutional.    The communique adds that the PRF categorically rejects the  duplicity observed in the Colorado party's political actions  because, on the one hand, it committed itself to  institutionalizing the Armed Forces and the Police, but on the  other, it is revealing its regressive goal of attempting to  revive the nefarious practice of identifying the party with the  state and with the Armed Forces, a concept which is absolutely  totalitarian and which we thought had been eradicated.</p>

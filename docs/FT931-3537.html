			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Benefits 'must target the poor' THE COST of Britain's welfare state will continue to rise unless services are targeted at the poor, Professor Dennis Snower of Birkbeck College, London, said yesterday. He said in a pamphlet published yesterday by the non-partisan Centre for Economic Policy Research that middle-income groups should be helped to make their own provision. He says most welfare services are inherently resistant to productivity growth. Their real cost will rise inexorably, threatening the ability of the welfare state to help those in genuine poverty. Prof Snower says redirecting welfare services is the only way to maintain society's responsibility to its poorest sections. But it would also allow tax cuts for the middle classes, leaving everyone better off. He says loans against human capital would be the best way for most people to cover periods of unemployment, pay for healthcare and finance education and training. Thus employed people could borrow against future earnings, making them more willing to retrain or accept alternative jobs. He says students should borrow more of the cost of their higher education so that they would 'internalise' its costs and benefits. Banks are unwilling to lend against human capital because they find it hard to collect debts. Prof Snower says the government should guarantee such loans as it can trace people through the tax system. He also endorses wage subsidies for the unemployed, a measure ministers have been considering in the run-up to today's Budget. He says un-employed people should be given the option of using their benefits to provide vouchers for employers that hire them - with the voucher worth more the longer the person has been unemployed.

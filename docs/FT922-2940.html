			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Euro Disney: The Story So Far - Queueing for flawed fantasy / Euro Disney has been promoted as a playground for the European family of the 21st century. But after three months how successful has the FFr2.4bn complex been in capturing the imagination and money of a continent? FT writers report IT IS 8.30am, a Sunday on the French Whitsun holiday weekend at the Disneyland Hotel, a fanciful new 'turn of the century' pink confection where child or adult guests can be tucked into bed by Mickey Mouse. Just outside, costumed cast members - Disneyese for workers - are taking up their positions beside the turnstiles at the entrance to the Magic Kingdom, Euro Disney's new FFr2.4bn (Pounds 244m) theme park 20 miles east of Paris. Above, in one of the Disney hotel restaurants, Rotterdam snooker hall owner Mr Lucos van Straalen and his wife Henny are ploughing through the FFr140-a-head breakfast. 'The second we've finished this we'll be out there and you'll be first on the rides,' Mr van Straalen assures his seven-year-old son Kim. Then he looks out; the crowds are already surging down Main Street USA, past its 'Victorian shop' merchandising opportunities towards Sleeping Beauty's Castle and the make-believe beyond. Attendance this sunny holiday Sunday - 90,000 say cast members - ought to be good news for Euro Disney which confirmed earlier this month that 'operating uncertainties' meant it might not be profitable this financial year. Theme park attendances and hotel occupancy had 'fluctuated considerably' since the April 12 opening. The seven-week total of 1.5m theme park visitors, an average of slightly more than 30,000 daily, would if replicated over 52 weeks achieve the company's 11m a year target. But Euro Disney must boost summer attendances; visitors will be much scarcer on cold, short winter days. A 'one night free for two nights paying' offer at its six hotels at the resort has been introduced for a limited period for visitors not already on discounted package deals. Yet even after Sunday's high turnout management were refusing to be interviewed or to confirm the 90,000 figure, their highest in a single day. In truth Sunday was not a triumph; although the gates closed for four hours to 3pm to limit admissions it was already too late to prevent Euro Disneyland falling short of the maxim enshrined in its 'The Magic is You' staff brochure; 'Exceeding our guests' expectations is our ultimate goal each and every day.' 'It was dreadful, quite impossible; two hours wait to go on a ride is ridiculous,' says ambulance driver Mr Jean-Jacques Siuda, one of four adults and three children from Perpignan, southern France, who have flown up for two nights at Euro Disneyland. 'We gave up and came back to the hotel swimming pool; I wouldn't mind but at home we have the sea.' The van Straalens, appalled at the queues but too scared to head for Paris - 'French is a difficult language for us' - drove instead to the Asterix theme park. Not so good, they say, but quieter. Dusseldorf catering worker Mr Markos Weggen, who had come by train with friends for two days, went to Paris for a few hours. Mr Weggen, sporting a cowboy style neckerchief, has been to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. 'They're better organised out there; they've some way to go in organisation here,' he said. Yet apart from their frustration at the queues all these people said that, overall, they had a great time. In many respects the project has been a feat of organisation; the three-phase development is due to cover 4,801 acres, a fifth the size of central Paris, by 2017. Upgraded road and rail links to the site are impressive and high-speed TGV trains will from 1994 further shrink journey times for its 340m European catchment population. Whatever one thinks of the site's gaudy buildings, relentless jollity and shameless bastardisation of history and culture, the scale of work since contracts were signed in 1987 is awesome. As well as the theme park there are six new hotels with 5,200 beds, ranging from the Hotel Cheyenne, a pastiche Wild West town, to the New York, loosely based on Manhattan, and the 'Victorian' Disneyland. Yet vital details of strategy seem unsatisfactory. Visitors complain about poor signs at railway stations and roads feeding the resort. Some large travel agents in Britain, an important market, lack information on the resort. These deficiencies, and the queues, may just be teething problems. But Euro Disney has a fight on its hands to overcome anti-American prejudice, fear of traffic jams and sensitivity to the park's FFr225 (FFr150 for three to under 12s) one-day admission charge among the French. The company declines to confirm unofficial information that the level of French visitor throughput is well below forecasts. However, it is trying to boost local attendances. This may be an uphill struggle. 'It's American kitsch on French soil,' says a French middle class white-collar worker at his house in Marne la Vallee, the new town development zone where Euro Disneyland is located. 'The Frenchman is an individualist, he hates being taken by the hand and led around.' Eight miles away, Leeds David Moutrie, his wife Michelle and their two small children are ordering a FFr200-a-head meal at Walts restaurant. They are about to discover they cannot have a glass of wine; no alcohol is served in the theme park. 'The same Frenchman who'll go to Disney in Orlando and come back telling his neighbours it's fantastic will describe Euro Disney in Marne la Vallee as a cultural Chernobyl,' says Mr Charles Boetto, president of the Syndicat d'Agglomeration Nouvelle des Portes de la Brie, a local authority council covering the five parishes around the Disney site. An independent politically and a banker by career - he is a former assistant vice-president of American Express in France - Mr Boetto wants Euro Disney to succeed. His council has already borrowed FFr230m for infrastructure upgrading around the site and is raising another FFr500m loan. But he also wants the project to foster more broadly based economic expansion; he worries about overdependence on tourism. The Euro Disney shares, he believes, were overpriced due to speculation, but he fears their falling value may frighten the banks, slowing development. He is critical too of Euro Disney's handling of housing problems among its 16,000 full-time, part-time and short-term staff: the company blames a mix-up with the French authorities. Mostly paid FFr6,000 gross for an 169-hour month of shift work - 15 per cent above the French minimum wage - the bulk of the staff, drawn from 86 nationalities, can ill afford Parisian rents. Mr Boetto says the 6,000 population of his five parishes has been suddenly swelled by 1,600 cast members. One tiny village, Magny le Hongre, now has a population of 350 locals and 800 young newcomers. Since April 1 more than 1,000 staff have left. 'A lot went because it was chaotic at first,' says a genial English waitress at Festival Disney, a charmless eating and drinking area just outside the park gates. Among those who quit was a 22-year-old French medical student living nearby who signed up for a weekend job. After two weekends at the 'Disney University' - one for brainwashing, he says, and one for training in till and credit card handling - he donned a Tyrolean costume and started work in a Fantasyland shop for a pre-opening weekend for subcontractors' families. It was frantic, he says; he stood at his till 11 hours non-stop. The next weekend virtually the entire shop personnel had changed. After 10 hours he locked his till to go and eat. A French senior manager was unimpressed; a row ensued. A brief career as a smiling Tyrolean was over. A waiter in one of the best hotels - no names are revealed here as cast members are forbidden from talking to journalists - says he believes Euro Disney management are learning. 'I don't think they realised what Europeans were like, that we ask questions and don't think all the same. But it's getting better; they're listening more to the staff.' Written Euro Disney Look rules for cast members are rigorous. The right weight must be maintained, nails exceeding 7mm beyond the fingertip are banned, deodorant is obligatory and wigs forbidden, except with doctor's verification. Body language rules warn against crossing the arms, urge an upright, listening posture and recommend sincere voice tone. There is strong approval among visitors for the park's sparkling cleanliness and lack of litter. Cast members are strikingly good natured, friendly to visitors and, apparently, each other. 'I've never seen as many smiling Frenchmen in one place,' laughs American Mr Todd Stephenson, completing a PhD on 20th century American cultural history. His view on the Euro Disney resort? 'It's a big mishmash'. French visitors are a minority. Some are intimidated at being addressed in English, especially in the hotels. 'Vous parlez francais?' asks an anxious Frenchwoman, wandering forlornly down the Hotel Cheyenne's Wild West street. She is seeking in vain a conventional French restaurant - American food is another deterrent to French visitors. Equally, some English speaking visitors complain about park commentaries in French. The hotel rooms are good but expensive. Prices for most of the year - from FFr750 a room to FFr2,750 at the Disneyland Hotel - are however mitigated by the fact that four can sleep in one room by current discount deals. Many French visitors are aghast at the room prices but they are mostly day trippers or staying at nearby business hotels at cut-price weekend rates. Visitor spending varies dramatically. The Moutries' four-day, three-night package, including return flight from Yorkshire, cost them Pounds 1,500, including hotel and park admission. They will spend up to Pounds 700 more on food, drink and incidentals. They were given free cowboy hats and a meal at the Buffalo Bill Wild West Show. But it cost them FFr1,000 to get in. Lingerie saleswomen Monique Tesniere and Josiane Montegu from Rouen have paid just FFr300 each for a two-day, one-night package, including coach and overnight stay in a Marne la Vallee business hotel. There are few grumbles about the admission charge but French visitors particularly talk of knowing many people deterred by cost. Visitors do grumble though about the cost and choice of goods in the park shops. 'I refuse to pay FFr49 for a little Mickey Mouse statue,' says Parisian waitress Raymonde Bergon. Euro Disney has keenly exploited its perceived sales opportunities, from wheelchair hire to macs. But in one area - alcohol - it seems diffident. The 1,100-room Newport Bay Club, for example, allegedly western Europe's biggest hotel, has only one small bar. As the park is 'dry', drinkers congregate at Festival Disney, supervised by unsmiling security men and CRS riot police with guns. Euro Disney confirms it is unhappy with this area but declines to give details. The drink issue raises the question of quite who the resort is aimed at. Is it for the small children who whimper in terror at the superb dragon snorting beneath Sleeping Beauty's Castle? The adolescents who crave more white-knuckle rides, such as Discoveryland's Star Tours voyage into space? The adults who want a few beers, or more time to appreciate the high-quality artwork of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride? Can an American theme park in Europe please all ages and nationalities? And in what country, if any, is this fantasy never-neverland which started with a Hollywood mouse? It is not, except in the most literal sense, in France. 'I think as far as the management is concerned it just happens to be in the middle of Europe handy for a big population,' says Mr Moutrie. 'If somebody said to me when we get back, have you been to France, I'd be tempted to say no.'</p>

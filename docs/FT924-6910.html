			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Canada warning on drug exports CANADA'S generic drugs industry has warned that the sale of cheap medicines to many developing countries will be jeopardised if proposed legislation to tighten patent protection for brand-name pharmaceuticals is passed. The warning is part of a rearguard action by the industry against a bill, C-91, introduced in parliament in Ottawa this week. It will extend the same 20-year patent protection to medicines as applies to other products. This fulfils Canada's pledges under the Uruguay Round trade talks. It means the end of a 23-year 'compulsory licensing' system which has allowed cheap, generic medicines to be distributed within a few years of the brand-name products. Compulsory licensing has made Canada's generic industry one of the world's biggest. The industry is angry that Bill C-91, likely to become law in the next few months, will be retroactive to last December. This provision would nullify pending compulsory licensing applications on about 35 products. An official at Apotex, the largest generic producer, said the new licensing curbs would hamper exports, which make up a quarter of the company's total output. Apotex sells to 80 countries, from Vietnam to Morocco and Iran. Apotex says many developing nations follow Ottawa's lead in approving medicines for sale. 'If we're not licensed to sell it in Canada, we can't export it,' the official added. The industry contends that by delaying introduction of their products, the new law will raise drug costs. Ontario's Drug Benefit Plan, providing free medicines to the elderly and welfare recipients, estimates generic products save it CDollars 80m-CDollars 100m (Pounds 42-Pounds 52m) a year. The argument is complicated by drug companies' commitment to new research spending in Canada. Glaxo and Merck are among those recently opening new facilities. Health-care administrators acknowledge that costs can be contained by encouraging brand-name companies to develop new drugs to keep patients out of hospital. The predicament of the provinces, which administer health-care services in Canada, is shown by a dispute over AZT, the Burroughs-Wellcome Aids drug. Apotex has challenged Burroughs' AZT patent and is trying to persuade the provinces to buy its cheaper, generic version. Ontario has deferred a decision until the court case is resolved. Meanwhile, it is sticking with AZT.</p>

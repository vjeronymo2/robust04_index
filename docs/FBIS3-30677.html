The articles sharply condemn the terrorist attack.    The commentary of MAGYAR NEMZET notes:    "Nothing can justify this brutal action against defenseless  and innocent people. For the time being, one can only guess  what steps will follow in the wake of the attack against the  Bosnian capital, (and also against the civilized world). It is  obvious that the chances for resolving the crisis through  negotiations are diminishing.    "The Muslims demand that the West use air strikes to deter  the Bosnian Serbs from the continued siege of Sarajevo and the  ongoing violent territorial conquests, or that the West make it  possible, for the Bosnians to protect themselves by lifting the  arms embargo.    "Meanwhile, there are more and more calls in the western  capitals, as well as in the Brussels NATO command, for military  intervention. Islamic countries may decide to provide  assistance to Bosnia, seeing the continued helplessness of the  western states and international organizations.    "It became clear after the Sarajevo market-place drama that  the international community must take steps, either through  military actions or by introducing stricter sanctions. It must  force an end to the war as soon as possible, and achieve a final  settlement through negotiations. Otherwise, the leading world  politicians and the international organizations, be it the  United Nations or NATO, could once and for all lose their  credibility, and will always have to bear responsibility for  this," writes the article in MAGYAR NEMZET.</p>

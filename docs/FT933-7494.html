			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Bundesbank lifts rate cut hopes: Sharp appreciation of D-Mark would be 'undesirable', says Tietmeyer THE Bundesbank yesterday prompted renewed speculation about the likelihood of further cuts in German interest rates by saying these might be possible as long as inflation and monetary developments permitted. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, deputy-president and president-elect of the Bundesbank, also said a substantial appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe was 'undesirable' because of the need to preserve exporters' competitiveness. Coupled with an observation about the possibility of more small cuts in interest rates - as long as inflation and movements in money supply allowed such a step - Mr Tietmeyer's comments led yesterday to a further depreciation in the value of the D-Mark against most European currencies. Mr Tietmeyer's comments were contained in a speech he was due to give at a bankers' conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Mr Tietmeyer did not attend the conference but the speech was distributed by the German central bank as an authorised policy statement. The French franc, in particular, continued to strengthen against the German currency, helped by the effect of two cuts in the Bank of France's lending rates earlier this week. The franc closed in London at FFr3.478 against the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.495 but eased in late New York trading to FFr3.4846. Mr Tietmeyer's comments revived speculation about the timing of a cut in the German discount rate from its current level of 6.75 per cent. It was unclear yesterday when the Bundesbank would judge the time to be right for a reduction given current monetary conditions in Germany. Money supply figures published on Thursday showed broad money, or M3, climbing at 7.5 per cent in July on a seasonally adjusted, annualised basis  -far above the 4.5 per cent to 6.5 per cent target range. As Mr Tietmeyer was careful to make clear in his manuscript, inflation and money supply developments are central to interest rate decisions. 'It is by no means a foregone conclusion that they will cut next Thursday (after the Bundesbank council meeting),' said Mr Joachim Fels, economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt. It was the Bundesbank's decision not to cut the discount rate at its council meeting on July 29 which led to the immediate crisis in the European exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of August, when the bands in which ERM currencies are allowed to fluctuate were widened. The wider bands meant that the implications of German monetary policy were now less important than before, Mr Tietmeyer's manuscript said. 'The individual countries now have more room for manoeuvre for interest rate movements,' he said. 'Such increased flexibility is certainly a gain, since the inflationary risks in the individual countries currently differ.' As a result the Bundesbank would not have to pay so much attention to the direct implications of German monetary policy in neighbouring countries. 'Although of course a major appreciation of the D-Mark within Europe is undesirable in the light of German exporters' need to remain competitive,' he added. The D-Mark has appreciated by 7.4 per cent against other European currencies since the beginning of September last year, exacerbating German industry's problems amid the most serious economic downturn since the second world war. Figures published this week reveal a weakening in exports, which were down 5.8 per cent in May.

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / UK Company News: St James's Place Sir Mark Weinberg, joint chairman of St James's Place Capital, the financial services group, received a 73 per cent pay rise last year, from Pounds 305,000 to Pounds 529,000. This followed a leap in group pre-tax profits from Pounds 12.3m to Pounds 81.1m in the year ended March 31 1994. Sir Mark's Pounds 224,000 increase accounted for almost one quarter of the rise in the group's total wages and salaries bill, which increased by Pounds 1m to Pounds 4.7m. However, Lord Rothschild, the other joint chairman, took a pay cut from Pounds 311,000 to Pounds 297,000. Excluding the joint chairmen, emoluments of the highest paid director moved up from the Pounds 305,001 to Pounds 310,000 range to between Pounds 330,001 and Pounds 335,000.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Politician whiskey fetches Pounds 11,462 at Christie's Fourteen bottles of Scotch whisky, part of the cargo of the SS Politician, which ran aground in the Outer Hebrides in 1941, sold for Pounds 11,462 at Christie's in Glasgow yesterday. Six went to a Glasgow restaurateur. The wreck inspired Sir Compton Mackenzie's novel Whisky Galore. The 1949 film, starring Gordon Jackson (left) and James Robertson Justice, immortalised the story of thirsty islanders who plundered the wreck and thwarted officialdom.</p>

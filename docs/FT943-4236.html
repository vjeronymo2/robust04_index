			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: Conoco to spend Pounds 1.7bn in UK Conoco, the US oil company, yesterday said that about half of its international investment was destined for the UK. Mr Constantine Nicandros, chairman of the Houston-based subsidiary of the DuPont Corporation, confirmed that about Pounds 400m (Dollars 619m) a year would be spent in the UK throughout the rest of the decade, much of it on developing new natural gas reserves. Conoco last week boosted its share of the Britannia gas project to 43 per cent. Britannia, the biggest remaining undeveloped gas field in the UK sector of the North Sea, would consume about Pounds 700m of the Pounds 1.7bn which Conoco plans to spend on UK exploration and development over the remainder of the decade, Mr Nicandros said. Initial production from Britannia, expected around 1998, would go to UK customers. But Conoco was keen to find international markets for the gas even though a direct route to continental Europe had been ruled out. Conoco is a member of an industry group studying the feasibility of building a gas pipeline between the east coast of England and Zeebrugge in Belgium. Mr Nicandros said Conoco's heavy commitment to the UK stemmed from the fact that it felt 'very comfortable' with the legal and political environment. In addition, liberalisation of the domestic gas market would give the company a chance to use its strong position in gas to make inroads into the downstream part of the industry. Conoco, along with PowerGen, owns Kinetica, one of the UK's larger independent gas marketing companies. Three-quarters of Conoco's investment programme is aimed overseas, including its recently launched Polar Lights project in Russia, but Mr Nicandros said the foreign share would soon fall to 55 - 65 per cent as it assumes a more 'aggressive' role in the expanding US gas market. However, it remained keen to take advantage of the 'enormous opportunities' arising worldwide from political change. This included the possibility of securing deals with politically-sensitive members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, who wanted western technology and capital to develop their reserves. 'I don't care what you call such deals as long as both we and the country have the chance to make some money,' he said. Mr Nicandros said there was a danger that the ambitious restructuring among the US majors and other international oil companies would result in a misplaced focus on short-term cost-cutting. That could be to the detriment of creating long-term value, he said. Although Conoco last year cut Dollars 400m, or 15 per cent, from its cost base and expected to reduce it by another Dollars 150m this year, 'nobody ever got rich by cutting costs'. Mr Nicandros also rejected the notion prevalent among some oil companies that employees are easily replaceable and transitory figures. 'We've shaken employee loyalty . . . but the social structure of a business is important. You must give both job and social satisfaction,' he said. Conoco Australia, part of the Houston-based group, is to partner Australia's MIM Holdings in the potential development of a coalbed methane gas project in central Queensland, adds Nikki Tait in Sydney. The Conoco subsidiary will fund a ADollars 22m (USDollars 16.1m) exploration, research and trial production programme over the next two to three years, receiving a 50 per cent stake in the project in return.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 24 (TANJUG) -- Some 400 Iranian  terrorists have arrived in the former Yugoslav republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina over the past month alone, writes the  Belgrade magazine INTERVJU. This evidently shows that the  Islamic world is ready to openly support Bosnian Muslim leader  Alija Izetbegovic, it says. The terrorists are sent to Bosnian  (by way of the Croatian capital Zagreb and the port of Split) to  illegally arm the Muslim troops loyal to Izetbegovic and train  them for terrorist actions, the paper writes.    As admitted by Izetbegovic's rival Fikret Abdic, the first  group of about 2,000 mercenaries and terrorists from Islamic  countries arrived two years ago and were deployed mostly in the  area of Zenica and throughout central Bosnia. Abdic is the  leader of Muslims in western Bosnia who do not recognize the  fundamentalist Muslim authorities in Sarajevo.    The United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and  Izetbegovic's ambassador to the U.N. Muhamed Sacirbej claimed at  the time that the group included not more than 'several hundred'  mujaheddin.    The Turkish daily MILLIYET last year for the first time  mentioned about 1,300 fighters from Iran, Libya, Tunisia,  Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malaysia and  Syria in Bosnia.    Alongside with the illegal arrival of mercenaries, UNPROFOR  has been including in its force an increasing number of troops  from Islamic countries. About 1,500 Turkish, 3,000 Pakistani  and 1,200 Bangladeshi troops are expected to join U.N.  peacekeepers in Bosnia next summer and autumn.    Last summer, Washington advised all U.S. nationals not to  travel to former Yugoslavia because they could become the target  of Islamic extremists from the ranks of the Iranian hezbollah,  INTERVJU writes. It also cites the opinion of an expert for  terrorism in the U.S. Congress, Joseph Bodenski, who has  described the Balkans as Iran's springboard for Europe. The  paper also cites a part of Bodenski's report to the Congress  which said that more than 50 hezbollah experts had been sent  from Balbec to Bosnia in November 1992 to train local troops and  carry out terrorist operations.    The objective was to deploy in Bosnia a brigade of 2,000  Iranian commandos and prepare the situation for a military  conquest in the Balkans, and later in Europe. Miroljub Jevtic,  an expert in Islam at the Belgrade faculty of political science  told INTERVJU that `The arrival of hezbollah to Bosnia and the  radicalization of Izetbegovic's army is yet another indicator of  the defeat of the U.S. and Western European policy in former  Yugoslavia.' Jevtic says that Izetbegovic has tricked the U.S.  and Europe into believing that the Bosnian Muslims, like the  Europeans, would not accept Islamic fundamentalism and terrorism  as a form of political struggle for an Islamic state in Europe,  and later, under pressure to accept peace, threatened the West  with a new war.    After Geneva peace talks two weeks ago, Izetbegovic made  threats to the West saying that he was prepared to use a secret  weapon against it, i.e. to raise the entire Islamic world, if  his territorial demands were rejected. Radical international  organizations `Muslim Brothers' and `Salah Jedid' have also been  cooperating with the Sarajevo government.    Under the earlier communist Yugoslav regime, the  organizations provided schooling for their members in several  Yugoslav towns and had headquarters in Sarajevo.</p>

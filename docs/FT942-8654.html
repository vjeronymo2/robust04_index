			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Brent Walker set 'to move on' Brent Walker has reached the stage where its two main trading subsidiaries can cover the cash interest due on its Pounds 1.4bn of debts, Mr John Leach, finance director, said yesterday. This had been the purpose of the refinancing and the group could 'move on from there'. The bookmaking and public house group, which nearly foundered before its refinancing in 1992, and a further adjustment to its funding terms this year, yesterday reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 319.1m (Pounds 427.4m) for 1993. The deficit on shareholders' funds increased from Pounds 602m to Pounds 863.3m. Sir Keith Bright, chairman, said the group expected to receive a decision from the arbitrator in the dispute with Grand Metropolitan over the 1989 purchase price of the William Hill betting shop chain by the end of the year. Operating profits from continuing businesses were up 14 per cent at Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 49.5m) before exceptional items in spite of tough trading conditions, Sir Keith said. Turnover from continuing activities was ahead by 9 per cent at Pounds 1.68bn. Although the interest charge was Pounds 211.8m (Pounds 204.4m), the group only paid about Pounds 54m of this in cash, with the restconverted into preference shares. Operating profits from William Hill rose by 16 per centto Pounds 47.5m, although first-half profits had fallen after the Grand National fiasco last year. Mr Leach said the move to Sunday betting indicated a relaxation in regulations surrounding betting which would be good for William Hill. The Pubmaster chain of pubs made Pounds 11.1m, down from Pounds 12.5m, but Mr Leach said volumes had risen in the first quarter of the current year and business had stabilised. The changes to the group's financing terms meant that proceeds from sales of pubs could be reinvested in the estate. The property and leisure activities, many of which are to be sold, contributed operating profits of Pounds 5.53m (Pounds 4.31m). Central expenses took Pounds 6.47m (Pounds 6.31m). Mr Leach said the group hoped to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m from disposals in the current year. In March the Spanish businesses were sold, the main cause of a provision in the 1993 figures of Pounds 42.1m. Others due to be sold included the two casinos in Essex. Exceptional costs of Pounds 23.1m (Pounds 246m) included Pounds 9.36m of refinancing costs, which included the fees for the aborted flotation of William Hill. The group's accounts have again been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the group will continue to have the support of its banks. The balance sheet includes the William Hill assets at Pounds 697.2m, although a valuation of the assets at the year end showed they were worth Pounds 486.1m. The company said it would not change the figure in the books until it knew the outcome of its dispute with GrandMet.</p>

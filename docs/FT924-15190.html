			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Given a later opening date, lower short-term revenue projections, and the formal admission that shareholders will almost certainly have to stump up more money, it is perhaps surprising that Eurotunnel's share price fell by just 15 per cent yesterday. The most dispiriting feature of the company's interim report, though, is the continued level of uncertainty. True, the long-running dispute with TML is no longer the main issue. Differences between the two sides have narrowed appreciably. If anything, the balance of advantage has swung Eurotunnel's way. On the other hand, the company can still provide no assurance as to when the first dividend will be paid, and there is no new estimate for the peak financing requirement and when it will be reached. Market guesses range from Pounds 0.5bn to Pounds 1bn more than existing funds. What is clear is that the effect of compound interest on borrowings needed to replace lost cash flow in the early stages will be painful. The only consolation for original investors is that the project is closer to completion: as the timing of the first payout recedes they can at least look forward to utilising their perks.</p>

The requested exemption would let Chase, such U.S. Investment Company and such custodian maintain foreign securities, cash, and cash equivalents (collectively, ``Assets'') in the custody of Chase-Mexico, an indirect subsidiary of Chase located in Mexico. For purposes of the application, the term ``foreign securities'' includes (a) securities issued and sold primarily outside the United States by a foreign government, a national of any foreign country, or a corporation or other organization incorporated or organized under the laws of any foreign country, and (b) securities issued or guaranteed by the Government of the United States or by any state or any political subdivision thereof or by any agency thereof or by any entity organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof which have been issued and sold primarily outside of the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 4 KYODO -- The majority of Japanese  surveyed are aware and supportive of Japan's bid to become a  permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, according to a  government survey released Saturday [4 June].    The survey conducted by the Foreign Ministry showed 58.9  percent of respondents knew that Japan's permanent membership is  being discussed in connection with the reorganization of the  Security Council.    The poll also found that 52.9 percent think Japan should  hold  a permanent seat on the council, while 14.8 percent think  otherwise.    The survey, conducted between late January and February on a  sample of 2,000 people aged 20 years or older, is the first of  its kind conducted by the ministry. Of those polled, 1,420  replied, ministry officials said.    The officials expressed relief over the results of the  survey, saying that public interest has been high ever since the  government began stepping up debate on the issue last July.    Among those supporting Japan's permanent membership, 41.2  percent said that as an economic superpower Japan should  actively participate in building world peace, according to the  survey.    Another 27.5 percent replied that permanent membership by  Japan, a nonnuclear state which professes pacifism, would  contribute to world peace, while 25 percent said it is strange  that Japan cannot contribute its opinions on important  decision-making in the U.N. when it is making great financial  contributions.    Also among the supporters, 41.2 percent said Japan should  make contributions as much as possible, including participation  in U.N. peacekeeping activities, within the limits of its  war-renouncing Constitution.    But 38.8 percent said that although Japan should make the  utmost in contributions within constitutional limits, it should  not make any military contributions, including joining  peacekeeping activities.    Of those opposed to Japan's permanent membership, 60.7  percent replied that Japan should not take part in making  decisions on international peacekeeping which involves military  might, while 36.9 percent expressed concern over the greater  responsibilities of becoming a permanent member, according to  the poll.    Also, 20.2 percent said Japan is not great enough as a  nation  to become a permanent member.</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Money Markets: Liquidity added STERLING futures rallied yesterday morning after the Bundesbank decisively deflated the expectation of a Lombard rate rise by injecting a generous amount of liquidity into the German money market. In the afternoon, however, futures were falling back to their opening levels as sterling tested its low against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges. Dealers continue to fear that sterling's predicament in the European exchange rate mechanism, less than 4 pfennigs above its floor against the D-Mark, will force a rise in UK base rates in the short term. One commercial bank dealer suggested yesterday that the British government should now lift base rates by  1/2 percentage point to avoid signalling an even larger increase later. The Bundesbank's decision to inject DM4.2bn into the money market shortly before 9am eased the strain on the currency and futures. German call money had been over the Lombard rate level, convincing the market that a Lombard rate rise was imminent. September short sterling was at a low of 89.59 as the funds were injected, and immediately rallied 7 basis points to a high of 89.66. December short sterling rose 5 basis points to a high of 89.67. The mood was later checked. Sterling sank to a low of DM2.8118 against the D-Mark and, as usual, futures followed. The September contract finished at 89.65 and the December contract at 89.66. Poor retail sales figures in the UK had no impact. The market has already priced in Britain's economic plight. Trade in cash was thinner. The Bank of England was again helpful in its money market operations, forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn and removing most of it in the early round. One dealer suggested that the Bank is being accommodating to keep short dates soft and take pressure off the currency. One-month money closed yesterday  3/16 per cent down on the offered side at 10 per cent. Three-month Libor was unchanged at 10 1/4 per cent. In the early round, the Bank bought Pounds 704m of Band 1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 220m in a repurchase agreement at 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, it bought Pounds 70m in Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 137m in Band 1 bank bills and provided late assistance of Pounds 180m.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Election concern depresses prices A MOOD of despondency settled over the government gilt-edged securities market, as the bonds shed around 1 1/2 points on the week on a wave of concern about the Conservative government's prospects in the April 9 general election. The unveiling by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, of a Budget which many judged to be less than helpful to the Tories' chances set the tone. Many in the City were disappointed the Budget failed to feature the sweeping tax cuts which might have formed a good platform for the Tory election campaign. Dramatically, Mr Lamont also indicated the government's finances were in a far worse state than many had expected. This will lead to a surge in issues of gilts over the next two to three years to pay for an increase in borrowing, and the result of this will be to depress prices of the bonds. But it was the feeling that the Tories might be losing their grip on voters' sentiments which had the biggest effect on the gilt market. Many investors view with trepidation the prospects of Labour forming the next government, largely due to theories that Labour would be likely to push up government borrowing still more or cause a run on the pound. That was behind both the severe markdown in gilt prices - which wiped out the gains of January and February and pushed up yields to around their levels at the beginning of the year - and also the soggy tone of sterling. The pound lost nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs on the week to close at 2.855. With the pound trading at around 9 pfennigs below its central DM2.95 rate in the European exchange rate mechanism, the gilt market is extremely cautious about whether the government will be able to push through an early cut in base rates. Many believe a cut is needed to revive the ailing economy. However, the sentiment is growing that, because of the need to defend sterling, the UK authorities might soon after the election have to push up lending rates, rather than bring them down. That could happen, on the assessment of many in the markets, irrespective of the political colour of the next government. Reflecting this sentiment, last week's rise in yields was especially pronounced at the short end of the yield curve, which reflects expectations of changes in base rates, which have been held at 10.5 per cent for more than six months. The short-dated 10 per cent Treasury stock maturing in 1994 dropped from 100 21/32 at the close of the previous week to 99 7/8 on Friday, with its yield up 35 basis points (0.35 per cent) to 10 per cent. There was a less pronounced change for the longer-dated 9 per cent Treasury stock due in 2008, which closed on Friday at 96 15/16 , from 95 1/2 the week before, with the yield rising to 9.54 per cent from 9.37 per cent. There is a distinct possibility of a further rise in yields this week, resulting from a batch of economic data which is expected to paint a bleak picture about economic prospects. Next Thursday's unemployment statistics are expected to indicate a rise last month of about 35,000 in the official jobless total, now at about 2.6m. Even though the outlook for inflation looks reasonably good - next Friday's announcement about retail price inflation is expected to put the headline figure last month at 4 per cent, after 4.1 per cent in January - the political impact of the less than cheerful news on the economy will probably be negative for gilts. 'Everything is looking a bit fragile at the moment,' said Mr Gwynn Hacche, an economist at stockbroker James Capel. As for the PSBR, Mr Lamont said the figure for the fiscal year beginning on April 1 would be Pounds 28bn, after Pounds 14bn in 1991-92. Many had previously reckoned these two figures would be nearer Pounds 25bn and Pounds 12bn respectively. According to the Treasury, there is worse to come in 1993-94, when the PSBR is likely to be Pounds 32bn, or 4.75 per cent of gross domestic product. Given the Treasury's poor record on forecasting in recent years, and the tendency of the government to look on the optimistic side when it comes to economic prospects, many in the gilt market reckon the true figures will be far higher, which last week served to deepen the general mood of gloom affecting gilts.</p>

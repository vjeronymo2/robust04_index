			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> GROUP REACHES OUT TO DISABLED CALLERS  </P> <P> A nonprofit organization in Anaheim has begun a publicity campaign to make  handicapped people in Orange County aware of special telephone services that  may be available to them free.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of good services for disabled people available in the state,"  said Brenda Premo, executive director of the Dayle McIntosh Center for the  Disabled. "Unfortunately, the people who design these services don't think  about the importance of marketing these services to the people who need them  the most."  </P> <P> Premo said Pacific Bell, General Telephone and other companies in the state are  legally required to offer telephone services to the handicapped but that  efforts to publicize the services have been poor.  </P> <P> With the help of a $45,000 grant, the Dayle McIntosh Center has taken the  matter into its own hands by starting a publicity campaign called "Dialog,"  which sends telephone company representatives to the community to give  presentations on equipment and services. The center has also designed  information posters for speech and hearing centers and rehabilitation hospitals  throughout the county.  </P> <P> "Our grant money is helping us to reach out to people with disabilities, their  families and the people they work with to let them know the kinds of services  that are available to them," Premo said.  </P> <P> Such services include a speaker phone, which allows a caller to talk into a  microphone and hear the person on the other end without having to hold a  receiver. For the visually impaired, large number overlays can be installed.  Amplifiers are available for the hearing impaired, and for those who are deaf,  a typewriter device connected to the telephone allows callers to type their  messages to an operator, who relays it and types back a reply. Those who are  both deaf and blind may be able to receive a Braille version of this device.  </P> <P> "We have everything from an amplifier for Grandma to a special telephone that a  person with only head movement can activate by puffing on a switch," said Joy  Tyo, manager of disabled services at Pacific Bell. "I think this is an exciting  time. Equipment is now very small and compact because of rapid advances in  computer technology. I think it's only going to get easier and easier for the  disabled population to use the telephone and experience that independence that  we all depend on."  </P> <P> To apply for disabled telephone services, call Pacific Bell, Deaf and Disabled  Services, 1-800-772-3140 or the General Telephone Special Needs Center,  1-800-821-2585.  </P> <P> The next Dialog presentation is scheduled for 12:15 p.m. Tuesday at the Anaheim  Convention Center. Call (714) 772-8285 for details. GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

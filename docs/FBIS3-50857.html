			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Javier Dario Restrepo from the "24 Hours" </F> newscast]    [Text] The Army's general command reported this afternoon  that the crimes attributed to the corps' intelligence network  are being investigated by the Prosecutor General's Office, the  military authorities, and the inspectors general of the Armed  Forces and the Navy. Preliminary information has been reported  by LA PRENSA. This is the story:    Journalists who attended the funeral of Ismael Jaimes, LA  OPINION editor in chief in Barrancabermeja, thought they knew  who the assassins were. Today they have learned the truth -- a  Navy intelligence network led by Colonel Rodrigo Quinonez became  a gang of killers.    Two of the Navy members who were part of that intelligence  network turned over to the Prosecutor General's Office and the  Attorney General's Office testimonies and evidence on  approximately 100 assassinations that were planned and carried  out like routine business. This can be heard during a taped  conversation regarding the identification and death of an  informer.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified speaker] That is how  it will be done.    [Second unidentified speaker] That is the least important  thing because if an appointment is made, meaning he is told he  must go to a certain place on a certain date.... [pauses] all we  have to do is leave a message [words indistinct]. He can be  called and an appointment can be made for two days later, or  something like that. The young man will go and he will be told  to be alert because a man -- whose description he will be given  -- will arrive. Juan Carlos knows him.    [First speaker] How can [words indistinct]?    [Second speaker] We can call him from here. [end recording]    The document published by LA PRENSA again reviews the fact  that military members have been corrupted by the war and have  become assassins.    [Begin journalist Gonzalo Guillen recording] I believe it is  one of the most monstrous things that have happened in this  country. It is one of the most atrocious crimes because the  state is assassinating the people. [end recording]</p>

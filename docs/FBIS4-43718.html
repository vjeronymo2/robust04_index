			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The preconditions for establishing  European works councils in the European Union (EU) could be  created soon. Fritz Verzetnitsch, president of the European  Trade Unions Confederation (ETUC), was optimistic following  talks between an ETUC delegation and Chancellor Helmut Kohl in  Bonn today that a guideline to this effect will be adopted  during Germany's EU presidency, which starts on 1 July.  European works councils are the necessary answer to the  increasing internationalization of decisions made by big  companies.    At the same time, Verzetnitsch made clear that European  trade  unions expect the EU to step up initiatives to combat  unemployment and to expeditiously adopt a European social  charter. Europe's social unity is limping behind schedule, he  claimed.    Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said that the chancellor  and the ETUC delegation agreed that combating unemployment is  the central task of the EU and its member states. European  integration must be given a fresh impetus.    Chancellor Helmut Kohl confirmed that guidelines on the  establishment of European works councils, on part-time work, and  on short-term employment contracts are a high priority for the  German Government. Great importance is attached to the social  dialogue with trade unions and employers' associations in the  European unification process. A Europe geared to people's needs  requires unions and management who help shape social realities  in the member countries and in the Community, the chancellor  stressed.</p>

			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REVIEWING A LEGEND  </P> <P> Using O'Day's age (almost 70) and her well-publicized personal problems against  her is a cheap shot.  </P> <P> Contrary to what Liska writes, O'Day was never known for her "bell-clear"  instrument. She never had a voice and is famous for that fact. She is also  famous for not having any vibrato because her uvula was accidentally cut during  throat surgery when she was a child.  </P> <P> She's the first to admit that she's not a singer. She's a song stylist renowned  for her timing and interpretation, and for that reason she's considered one of  the four or five most important vocalists of the century.  </P> <P> ALAN EICHLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

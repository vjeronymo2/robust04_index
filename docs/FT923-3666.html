			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Bertelsmann net income up 6% BERTELSMANN, the German publishing, music, and commercial television group, has made a favourable start to its current financial year and expects its earnings growth to surpass the 6 per cent rise in net income to DM570m (Dollars 407.1m) it managed in 1991-92. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said: 'We are satisfied with the development so far in 1992-93.' He expected turnover and profits to rise by around 10 per cent. Turnover in the financial year to June 30 1992 rose by 10 per cent to DM16bn, of which 38 per cent was achieved in the buoyant domestic market. Operating profits were 16 per cent higher at DM1.4bn before start-up costs on new projects of DM310m - sharply up from DM183m - and tax. Mr Wossner said the jump in these costs partly reflected the need to take full ownership of a Berlin publishing venture after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, whose Maxwell Communications was a partner in the project. Bertelsmann has also been investing in newspapers in east Germany, the Premiere pay-TV channel in Germany, and new music labels in the US and UK, as well as expanding its book club activities. It has also begun a new business magazine, Capital, in France. Mr Siegfried Luther, the finance director, said most of the turnover increase came from existing businesses and around 2 per cent from new ventures such as newspapers in Dresden and Berlin. Cash flow was 8 per cent higher at DM1.3bn and net indebtedness down considerably from DM363m to DM43m. In the US, where Bertelsmann owns RCA music and the Doubleday, Dell, and Bantam publishing operations, Mr Wossner said economic weakness had affected business. 'Our profits are under strength there,' he said. The Doubleday book club was now in profit after heavy losses. In publishing and recording, Bertelsmann was investing heavily on restructuring and business growth. North American turnover is 22 per cent of the total. Group investments rose to DM2.8bn from DM2.2bn, although Mr Wossner said spending would come down to around DM2.5bn this financial year. The group defines its investments to include marketing efforts to recruit new book and music club members, as well as licensing rights and fees for new publications and recordings. The company also announced a move to make its DM725m of interest-bearing participation certificates more attractive. These carry no vote and are quoted. Bertelsmann will give up its rights to buy these back at historical values lower than today's market prices in return for greater flexibility in fixing the terms of future issues.</p>

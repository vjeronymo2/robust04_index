			<p>BFN     [Text] [No dateline as received] -- Georgia plans to  introduce its own currency unit, the lari, by next spring,  republican Deputy Prime Minister Teimuraz Basilia said in an  interview with Georgian television yesterday. He said that the  government and the National Bank are currently making efforts to  strengthen the coupon and to make it the sole means of payment,  ousting the Russian ruble from the market. However, Teimuraz  Basilia said, "Some members of the Cabinet of Ministers not only  do not support, but are even resisting all the measures we plan  to introduce, both in the money and credit sphere and  particularly in the area of privatization."    The deputy prime minister stressed that it is not a matter  of  no confidence in the government, but of the personal interests  of persons who would lose their portfolios if privatization is  carried through.</p>

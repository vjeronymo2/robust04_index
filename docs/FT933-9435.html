			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Playful studies in ambiguity - 'Pictures in Pictures' at the National Gallery The play within the play, the book or poem within the book, or poem, is an ancient literary ploy by which the writer may stand back from the work that engages him, to see it at an arm's length. The visual equivalents of such things are common enough: paintings are to be found in painters' studios, on patrons' walls and church altars and we take them, perhaps, as read; yet they are no less rich than drama or poetry in suggestive possibilities, complex or blindingly obvious as they may be. Not unreasonably, the second of the National Gallery's agreeably didactic series on pictorial themes and variations, illustrated from its own collections, is given over to them. At some 26 works the show is small, but wide enough in range, from Massys, Christus and Bellini to Degas and Cezanne, to make its several points. Does it make a shade too much of them? Paintings were ever ambiguous things, yet their study does seem to attract the more literal-minded among us, and here they make holiday. A joke explained, after all, is no joke, and an irony worried over instead of savoured lightly is an irony worried to death. The self-portrait is as ambiguous a subject as any, the purest solipsism, artist remaking himself as object, image, art. And here is Murillo at his most virtuoso, painting himself within a painted frame within the frame, save only that his hand emerges to grasp that second, internal frame, as it were to frame the joke. It is the nicest double-take, and should be left at that. Here too is the splendidly ambiguous portrait by Lotto of a Venetian lady in her finery, jewels at her breast, her sleeves richly slashed, who holds before her a drawing of the virtuous Lucretia. Do we really need to agonise over the question of whether she herself was truly virtuous, or quite otherwise? Not really. More reasonable is the iconographical reading of the two Vermeers, of women respectively standing and sitting at the virginals, the one in a cool, pure morning light, the other in a richer, darker interior. The one stands before a Cupid who holds up a single card, the other sits before an identifiable genre brothel scene. Both engage the viewer directly, the one with a quizzical, the other a more inviting gaze. The point is there to be taken. In Hogarth's 'Marriage a la Mode' suite, such moralising is quite overt, gleefully, maliciously so, images of classical rape, conventional piety and low life at its grossest variously set to point the vicious satire, as the Earl and his Countess sink by stages into the abyss. But even here the hints and references, though often quite particular in themselves, are marginal to the central narrative, wilfully half-masked or hidden in the shadows, as though little more than private jokes on the artist's part, the onus on us to notice them at all. Is that, after all, as it still should be? I was certainly grateful to have pointed out to me, in the great Canaletto of the festive procession from the church of San Rocco, what might be Canaletto himself at the back of the crowd, seizing the moment to show off his own painting, opportunistically hung along with those of his contemporaries on the facade of the neighbouring Scuola, to prospective clients. The youthful Cezanne, too, takes as his subject one of his own works, or rather its stretcher, the canvas turned face to the wall and stacked behind the studio stove. Boilly's grisaille of a girl at a window is a virtuoso performance, presenting his own painting as though it were a print, margin, mount and all. But the most charming category of work is at once the most natural and the least minatory or moralistic. Artists have painted artists at work since ever they worked together in shared studios, or models were persuaded to sit to them. Grouped around the life model or still life, it is easy enough for the artist's attention to shift to the colleague, pupil or apprentice engrossed in the common matter at hand. Vaillant's youth sits drawing from the cast after Michaelangelo: Metsu considers, with the greatest tenderness, a young woman as she addresses herself to a still-life spread out across a table. Saint Luke, in the character of Flemish master-painter sits at his easel in his studio, palette in hand, his materials on the stool beside him, his symbolic ox, as it might be his dog at his feet. It is by a follower of Massys . . . and of the master himself? Perhaps - but who can say? Themes &amp; Variations: Pictures in Pictures.

			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Mackay relaxes law fees change LAWYERS taking cases on a conditional, 'no win, no fee', basis are to be allowed to charge up to twice their normal fee if they win, Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor said yesterday. Lord Mackay had originally set the rise in fees for a successful outcome at 20 per cent but has raised this to 100 per cent after representations from the legal profession. Lawyers will be able to enter into conditional fee arrangements with clients in cases of personal injury and insolvency and for the European Court of Human Rights.</p>

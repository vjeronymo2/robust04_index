			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Interpretive Advice or No Objection Letter (Section 16.30)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal set forth the requirements that a person must meet to obtain interpretive advice or a no-objection letter under part 16. Although these requirements are not detailed in former part 16, the OCC based them on Banking Circular 205, OCC Staff No-Objection Positions, which has been in effect since July 26, 1985. The final rule adopts this section as proposed, with minor clarifying changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Escrow Requirement (Section 16.31)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal required the use of an independent escrow account if the funds received in an offering were to be certified as capital or if there was a minimum amount to be sold in an offering. One commenter opposed this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule modifies the escrow requirements. Section 16.31 of the final rule allows the OCC to require any funds received through an offer or sale of securities to be held in an independent escrow account at an unrelated insured depository institution when the OCC determines it is in the best interest of the shareholders. A bank does not have to use an independent escrow account unless the OCC has notified the bank that an escrow account is necessary. However, the OCC generally expects banks to use independent escrow accounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Fraudulent Transactions and Unsafe and Unsound Practices (Section 16.32)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal prohibited untrue statements of material fact, omissions of material fact, and acts or practices that operate as a fraud in the offer or sale of a bank security. The language in this section of the proposal was substantially similar to the language in section 17(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77q). The section 17(a) prohibitions apply to offers and sales of bank securities regardless of whether the prohibitions are restated in part 16. The OCC believed that restating the prohibitions in part 16 furnished warning that the prohibitions apply. The proposal further provided that violations of the fraudulent transactions section also constitute unsafe or unsound practices under 12 U.S.C. 1818. This section of the final rule is adopted as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

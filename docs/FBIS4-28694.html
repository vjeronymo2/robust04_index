Your  choice of our country as the first destination for your first  visit abroad since your assumption of the SLORC chairmanship is  regarded as a great honor to our republic. This visit is an  event of great significance in the history of relations between  our two countries. We highly value this visit and are confident  that it will contribute not only to further strengthening our  ties of friendship and cooperation, but also to building peace,  stability, friendship, and cooperation among countries in this  region.    Your Excellency the chairman, ladies and gentlemen, Laos and  Myanmar are two neighboring countries sharing a common border.  They also share a similar history, that is they were colonized  by foreign powers.    The peoples of Laos and Myanmar have maintained friendly  ties  and brotherly affection since ancient times. We are both  Buddhist followers who practice a similar culture, traditions,  and customs and constantly make religious merit together. We  also assist and support one another at all times. The Lao  Government and people would like to express our sincere thanks  to the government and people of Myanmar for donating rice and  other relief aid when we encountered difficulties and shortages  in recent years. At the same time, we are very proud of the  incessant growth and development in our fine relations of  friendship and cooperation. This is seen concretely in the  exchange of visits by delegations at various levels, the mutual  visits by our peoples, and the solution of various problems  between our countries with a sense of sincerity and mutual  understanding, for instance the speedy demarcation of the common  border between Laos and Myanmar that recently concluded with  great success within a short period of time.    We are very pleased to see that thanks to the persistent  pursuance of its policy and the effective administration of the  country by SLORC chaired by Your Excellency, the Union of  Myanmar has become more stable every passing day. As a result,  the socioeconomic development in your country has produced  effective results. With rapid steps in socioeconomic  development, the material and moral life of the people of  Myanmar has now clearly improved. Myanmar's status and role in  the international arena has also been consolidated and its  cooperation with other countries broadened. I would to take  this auspicious opportunity to wish the fraternal people of  Myanmar new and greater achievements in defending your national  independence, unity, and stability so that you will be able to  build their country into a wealthy, strong, and prosperous  entity.    Respected Your Excellency the chairman, ladies and  gentlemen,  in recent years, we the Lao people, have actively carried out  national development and construction in accordance with our  policy of comprehensive restructuring. We have made certain  initial important achievements in this endeavor. Our country  has now attained peace and stability. Our socioeconomic  development has made continuous progress. Our country's  potential in various fields have been comprehensively exploited.  With the consolidated use of our inner strength and in  coordination with the [words indistinct] foreign investment and  international assistance and cooperation, the material and  cultural life of our multiethnic people has been gradually  upgraded. Nonetheless, we have not yet been freed from under  development. Therefore, the Lao Government and people regard  national construction and development as our important tasks  aimed at improving the well-being of our people and making our  country prosperous.    To achieve the aforementioned esteemed goals, in addition to  mobilizing every consolidated potential of our nation, we also  regard the creation of favorable external conditions as an  important issue. That is why the LPDR has pursued the foreign  policy of peace, independence, (?friendship), and cooperation  with all countries regardless of the differences in our  political systems and on the basis of the five-point principle  of peaceful coexistence. We continue to consistently pursue the  policy of building good relations and promoting cooperation for  mutual benefit with neighboring countries, thereby contributing  to enhancing peace, stability, friendship, and cooperation for  development in this region.    As for the Union of Myanmar, we can see our two countries  possess many similar potential and special characteristics. The  two sides should consult and exchange views to look for better  and more effective forms and methods of cooperation at various  levels. We hope that the visit by Your Excellency the chairman  and your wife and delegation will open a new era for  strengthening, deepening, and broadening the relations and  cooperation between our two countries, thus making the  friendship and brotherly affection between the peoples of Laos  and Myanmar (?grow even stronger).    In this atmosphere of intimacy and warmth, I invite all  distinguished personalities, ladies and gentlemen to toast with  me to the lasting friendship and increasingly fruitful  cooperation between the LPDR and the Union of Myanmar, to the  health of His Excellency General Than Shwe and his wife, to the  health of all delegates from the Union of Myanmar, and to the  health of all ladies and gentlemen attending this banquet.    Thank you.</p>

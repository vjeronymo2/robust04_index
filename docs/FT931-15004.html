			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Testing times for Clinton team: Jurek Martin reports on the perils of being offered a job in Washington IT IS one thing to be chosen to serve as a senior member of a US administration. It can be another successfully to run the gauntlet of official and media scrutiny and be confirmed, unscathed and with reputation intact, in the job. This has been very much the experience of President-elect Bill Clinton's nominees. It is still unlikely that any will either be rejected by the Senate - the fate of Mr John Tower, President George Bush's defence secretary-designate - or have to withdraw from consideration - as happened to Mr Ernest Lefever, a controversial Reagan choice in 1981 for a senior State Department position. But such is the intensity of interest in the life and careers of those chosen that few emerge unbruised. Probably even more know that they were not selected because of something in their backgrounds that rendered them too suspect. Those conspicuously affected by publicly disclosed problems include: Ron Brown, commerce secretary-to-be: on Wednesday a gala in his honour was cancelled because its cost was being underwritten by corporations he might find himself dealing with in the cabinet. Though the event was planned before he was nominated and to recognise his achievements as Democratic party national chairman, it looked too cosy for comfort and Mr Clinton urged him to call it off. Zoe Baird, the choice for attorney general: the New York Times reported yesterday, on the basis of information supplied to Mr Clinton's staff and to the FBI by Ms Baird herself, that she had employed a Peruvian couple as housekeepers knowing them to be illegal aliens. The practice may be commonplace, especially in Washington, but is potentially embarrassing for anybody picked to be the country's chief law enforcement officer. Warren Christopher, nominee for secretary of state, has had to address the issue of what he knew 25 years ago as deputy attorney general about US army covert surveillance of civil rights and anti-war activists. This investigation, not in the least threatening to his confirmation, is the handiwork of Senator Jesse Helms, the Republican Senator from North Carolina and self-appointed scourge of anybody associated with President Jimmy Carter's foreign policy. Robert Reich and Laura Tyson, prospective labour secretary and head of the Council of Economic Advisers, have been on the receiving end of much professional jealousy from classical economists. Mickey Kantor, chosen to be trade representative, a field in which he has no track record, has similarly been denigrated by trade specialists. More generally, lots of egos have been bruised by Mr Clinton's relentless pursuit of diversity in his appointments, to the point where any number of disgruntled hopefuls now freely complain they have been left out because they are white and male. This has been very much a 'top down' transitional operation, run by the Clintons themselves and using their extensive networks of contacts. Mr Richard Riley, the able former governor of South Carolina and education secretary-designate, has been their chief Washington eyes and ears, with genuine vetting influence, but real power has continued to reside in Little Rock. This can frustrate the capital's barons who expect to be able to place their people in senior jobs, especially since Mr Clinton seems to take his time making up his mind. However, the Clintons are also the victims of circumstance. All prospective nominees to senior positions are subject to rigorous FBI background checks. Mr Frank Weil, Mr Carter's first commerce secretary, recalls the alarm of fishermen at his Maine holiday home at being contacted by the FBI. Ms Baird, presumably sensing a problem that could not be kept under wraps, volunteered her information. Investigations are also pursued by both the media and the political opposition, a fact of life with which Mr Clinton himself is only too familiar from last year's campaign. Republican questioning of nominees has to date been pretty soft and unrevelatory, but the process has barely begun, with as many as 1,000 appointees subject to Senate confirmation. Transitions are, by definition, ephemeral, but they are also dangerous, particularly when a different party takes over the administration. By the time Mr Carter took office in 1977, the word in Washington was that if his government was no better than his transition staff then it would not fare well. No such closet conviction yet seriously attaches to Mr Clinton's transition. Mr Brown is the only nominee whose professional career seems to conflict with Mr Clinton's promise of a new and open way of doing things, but even his critics acknowledge that he has been good at whatever task he has turned his formidable talents to. Interest will also soon switch to Mr Clinton's policies and away from those he chooses to implement them. From the president-elect's perspective, the inauguration probably cannot come soon enough.</p>

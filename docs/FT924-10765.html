			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Survey of Hungary (9): A fragile peace - Foreign policy makers see stability in the EC THE post-Maastricht disarray in western Europe is viewed with a mixture of foreboding and disbelief in Hungary, where full membership of a strong European Community is the one policy goal which is shared by all political parties. With over 3.5m ethnic Hungarians living in neighbouring states since the 1920 Trianon Treaty cut the country to one third of its former size, Hungary looks towards the Community not only as inspiration for its own social and economic progress but also as the ultimate protector of the rights of minorities in this part of Europe. Confidence in the EC's ability to effectively defend these rights has been dented by events in Yugoslavia. For the Community to help preserve the fragile new democracies, Hungarian foreign policy makers believe it needs both a strong Commission and an extensive body of binding EC law. It also needs the political will to demand compliance with Community standards on human rights as the pre-condition for trade, aid and other concessions. The idea that widening the community to include the newly sovereign east and central European states would weaken efforts to 'deepen' the community and its institutions finds little echo in Budapest. 'We have no desire to dilute the powers of the European Commission. 'We think that the stronger and more united the EC is, the easier it will be to join,' said a senior official of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum. Neither does Hungary share the concern about long-term prospects of a new German hegemony in Europe felt by other countries in the region which were occupied during the war. Having worked closely with Austria during the last decades of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and as an ally of Nazi Germany in the last war, Hungarians have fewer hang-ups about Germany than the former 'subject nations' of the Hapsburg Empire who suffered most from Nazi occupation 50 years ago. At the same time, however, Budapest is acutely aware of the historical resentments against Hungarians in surrounding states such as Slovakia and in Transylvania where Hungarians were the rulers and are now the ruled. Ugly scenes at a recent football match in Bratislava when Slovak riot police, faces hidden by Balaclava helmets, were let loose against Hungarian supporters showed how easily passions can be aroused. After years of increasingly fraught discussions over the fate of the Gabcikovo dam, originally conceived as a joint, communist-era Hungarian-Czechoslovak power project on the Danube, the EC finally stepped in earlier this month by inviting both Hungarian and Slovak delegates to Brussels in a last minute search for a compromise. Until now the Hungarian government has refused to be provoked and tried to settle problems - including the future of the Gabcikovo dam and those connected with refugees from the fighting in Croatia and over-flights by Yugoslav aircraft - through diplomatic channels. But this has opened up the government to charges of weakness by Hungarian nationalists who complain, for example, at the government's inability to restrain Mr Gheorghe Funar, the Romanian nationalist mayor of the Transylvanian city of Cluj from banning Hungarian street names, a gratuitous insult to its large ethnic Hungarian minority. With fragile coalition governments in power throughout the region, the temptation to revive latent ethnic animosities as a diversion from the problems of implementing meaningful reforms is high and probably rising. Much depends on the strength of the Hungarian government's will to prevent incidents escalating into full scale international crises. Hungarian traders meanwhile are in the forefront of attempts to forge a new economic and political relationship with the former Soviet republics. With over 80,000 Ikarus buses throughout the former Soviet Union needing spare parts and oil and gas enterprises short of pipes and machinery, Hungarian traders have created new direct trade and barter links with energy producing areas such as Tatarstan and Bashkiria.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S., CZECHS SPLIT DAVIS CUP MATCH  </P> <P> Last-minute replacement Petr Korda ambushed Brad Gilbert in three quick sets  today to give Czechoslovakia a 1-1 tie in its quarterfinal Davis Cup clash with  the United States.  </P> <P> In the opening match in Prague, Aaron Krickstein took advantage of wildness by  tiring Milan Srejber of Czechoslovakia to win a five-set battle that lasted  nearly four hours, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (4-7), 6-3.  </P> <P> Korda, a wiry left-hander who was named to play singles for Czechoslovakia when  Davis Cup veteran Miloslav Mecir withdrew with a back pain, needed just one  hour, 44 minutes to defeat Gilbert 6-2, 6-3, 6-3.  </P> <P> Korda, ranked 26th in the world, kept Gilbert off balance with his hard serve  and kept the fifth-ranked American running from side to side until he had a  chance to hit a winning shot.  </P> <P> The doubles team of Rick Leach and Jim Pugh, ranked No. 1 in the world, faces  Czechoslovakia's Tomas Smid and Karel Novacek on Saturday. The reverse singles  matches, with Krickstein taking on Korda and Gilbert playing Srejber, will be  held on Sunday.  </P> <P> The survivor of the series will advance to the semifinals in September against  the winner of this weekend's contest between Austria and Italy.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, Wally Masur beat Kelly Evernden today in straight sets at Brisbane,  Australia, to lift Australia into tie with New Zealand in the World Group  quarterfinal at Milton Tennis Center. Masur triumphed 6-3, 7-6 (7-0), 6-1,  dominating Evernden with a powerful serve-and-volley game.  </P> <P> Mark Kratzmann and Darren Cahill of Australia will play Evernden and David  Lewis in the doubles on Saturday, with the reverse singles slated for Sunday.  </P> <P> India won both of today's singles matches against Japan at Chandigarh, India,  to take a 2-0 lead in the opening round of the Asia-Oceania zone contest.  </P> <P> In the first match, Indian national champion Zeeshan Ali defeated Hidehiko  Tanizawa in straight sets 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. Srinivasan Vasudevan won the second  match for India, beating Shuzo Matsuoka 6-4, 6-1, 7-6 (8-6).  </P> <P> And in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Hong Kong took a 2-0 lead over Malaysia in  today's second round Asia-Oceania match.  </P> <P> Mark Bailey defeated V. Selvam 0-6, 6-2, 6-4, 2-6, 8-6 and Colin Grant defeated  U. Muralidharan 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.  </P> <P> The two countries play the doubles match on Saturday and the reverse singles on  Sunday.  </P> <P> Playing in Shanghai, China defeated the Philippines in both opening singles  matches in today's first-round of the Asia-Oceania group.  </P> <P> Xia Jiaping outlasted Roland So in a four-hour, 40-minute match 4-6, 5-7, 6-4,  6-3, 6-2, and Pan Bing defeated last-minute replacement Danilo Pila 6-0, 6-0,  6-0.

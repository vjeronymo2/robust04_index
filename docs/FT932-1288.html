			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / On a diet after an eating binge: Relentless expansion triggered a cash crisis at Ferruzzi, but will the rescue plan work The wall of television screens across one side of Ferruzzi's Ravenna headquarters has stopped responding to the instructions of the tourists it is meant to serve. Instead of providing visitor information on the former capital of the western Byzantine empire, the touch-sensitive screens are out of control, flashing up a series of random facts and images. In some ways their behaviour reflects the crisis at Ferruzzi itself. Italy's second-biggest private company has grown feverishly since the mid-1980s through ambitious takeovers. But increasingly, the relentless expansion appeared to be proceeding without direction, triggering the group's cash crisis. It is now up to Ferruzzi's bankers, which have lent it almost L31,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn), to take control at the request of management and the Ferruzzi family. As a first step, Mr Guido Rossi and Mr Enrico Bondi have been appointed as chairman and chief executive of the two main Ferruzzi companies - Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin), the main holding, and Montedison, its biggest industrial subsidiary. The new management, which will be installed formally after Ferfin's and Montedison's annual meetings later this month, will replace members of the founding Ferruzzi family. The clan, headed by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, son of founder Mr Serafino Ferruzzi, and Mr Carlo Sama, married to one of the founder's three daughters, has stepped down from active management and handed over its controlling 48 per cent of Ferfin to the banks. The company's overambitious growth was based on easy credit and buoyant markets. A single, domineering figure was at the helm, (first Mr Serafino Ferruzzi and later Mr Raul Gardini), while other talented managers were spread thinly over a growing empire. Worse, Ferruzzi's complex structure fostered opaque accounts and impeded bankers and shareholders in supervising its dealings. Such weaknesses were masked during the booming 1980s, when strong profits created a mood of confidence. They emerged only when recession struck in the 1990s. Declining demand hit Ferruzzi's core chemicals business. Rising interest rates accentuated the financial burdens on its cash flow. Devaluation of the lira last September swelled the group's foreign debts in lira terms. Although borrowing costs have eased in recent weeks, Ferruzzi's financial position remains precarious. Ferfin lost L1,519bn last year, and its earnings continue to be overshadowed by massive financial charges. Plans for a rescue - shrouded in secrecy - are being masterminded by Mediobanca, the merchant bank leading a committee of Ferruzzi's five biggest bank creditors. Observers believe the proposals entail an urgent acceleration in streamlining the group, a strategy belatedly put forward by the Ferruzzi family. Two years ago, Mr Sama announced Ferruzzi would turn its back on the diversified acquisitions which have taken it into insurance, finance and even broadcasting, in favour of its core agro-industrial, chemicals and energy businesses. The aim was to cut borrowing costs and make the empire more manageable. As a first step, Ferruzzi raised about L1,800bn by selling its Erbamont pharmaceuticals subsidiary in March to Sweden's Procordia group. But the slimming process, which began in earnest only this year, was sidetracked by family disputes (see below), delays in finding buyers in a recession and a desire within the family to build an ever-bigger empire.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    PROFITS/LOSSES AND SALES OF HOLDING COMPANY AND MAIN SUBSIDIARIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                      Profit/loss Lbn            Sales Lbn  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             1991         1992        1991        1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Feruzzi Finanziaria          115       -1,519     17,790        19,900 Montedison                   168       -1,244     15,732        16,698 Calcestruzzi                  76           26        540           614 Edison                       122          152        532           572 Fondiaria                     91         -576      5,069***     6,102*** Eridania Beghin-Say     FFr 754m   FFr 1.28bn   FFr 1.28bn    FFr 49.7bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ***Premium income  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Seoul vernacular newspapers on 28 March  carry articles and editorials on China's new proposal for a  solution to the DPRK nuclear issue.    The moderate TONG-A ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,800-word  article by correspondent Kim Cha-un from UN Headquarters under  the headline, "The Significance of the Alternative Plan on the  `Statement in the Name of the President of the UN Security  Council.'"    Noting that with the "new alternative plan" proposed by  China  on 25 March regarding the UN Security Council moves for adoption  of a resolution on North Korea, discussion of the North Korean  nuclear issue at the council has entered "a new phase," the  article predicts that this proposal will bring about "a  temporary stumbling block" in the West's plan to cope with North  Korea in the future, and shows doubt as to whether North Korea  will "obediently follow" the statement of the president of the  UN Security Council which has no "binding force," unlike the  resolution. The article also points out a possibility that this  plan may "spoil" the atmosphere of the international community's  "hardline measures" against the North Korean nuclear issue by  giving North Korea time to drag on the issue. In spite of this,  the article notes the recent Chinese proposal is winning "more  affirmative reaction" by the West, and illustrates the reason  for this as follows: First, with this proposal, one can sense  that China's basic position on the North Korean nuclear issue is  "changing" and that China agrees with the UN Security Council's  "interference in and action" for the North Korean nuclear issue.  Second, the West is hoping that such a change in China's  attitude will exercise "a decisive influence" on North Korea,  because China's supoport for a statement by the president of the  UN Security Council means that China raises the "same voice"  with the United States and other Western countries "opposing"  North Korean nuclear development. Third, Western diplomats  believe that China's "joining" in the efforts of the security  council for a solution to the North Korean nuclear issue is  "more important" than anything else. Thus, it is highly likely  that the West will "accept" the Chinese proposal for adopting  the statement of the council president during negotiations with  the Chinese side next week. The article predicts, however, that  the two sides will have a "tug of war" over the "contents" to be  included in the statement.    The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word article  by reporter Kim Cha-su, entitled "The Government's Position on  the 'Alternative Plan Proposed by China.'" The article notes  that the government showed an "affirmative reaction" to the  Chinese proposal for adopting a statement to be issued in the  name of the UN Security Council president because it believes  that "winning support from China" is "more important" than  anything else. The government hopes, the article writes, that  the "same voice" raised not only by the five permanent committee  members of the security council, including China, but also the  10 non-permanent committee members, will work as even "greater  pressure" on North Korea.    The article observes that the purpose of the Chinese side in  proposing the statement is to give North Korea "room" to accept  an "additional inspection" and that by doing this, China will be  able to explain to North Korea that if North Korea does not  "comply with" the demand of the international community, China  can "no longer" stand only on the side of North Korea. The  government, however, maintains that the "contents" of the  statement proposed by China should not be "remarkably" different  from "a draft resolution" pushed by the security council's  permanent members including the United States, and that the  statement should include a content clarifying that "next-stage  steps" will be taken according to the North Korean "attitude,"  referring to the remarks of the IAEA director-general that if  another inspection of North Korean nuclear facilities is not  conducted within six weeks, safeguards are highly likely to be  "suspended." The article points out that during the ROK-PRC  summit in Beijing, the ROK will ask China to support the  security council's resolution in return for the ROK's acceptance  of the Chinese proposal. ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu will  bring the result of his talks with Chinese leaders to the United  States and based on this, will discuss "measures" henceforth  with the security council's permanent members, including the  United States.    The TONG-A ILBO also carries on page 3 a 1,300-word  editorial  under the headline, "A Pitfall in the Resumption of Dialogue."  Pointing to "affirmative" moves of the UN Security Council and  the ROK Government concerning the new Chinese proposal, the  editorial writes that with emphasis put only on the nuclear  issue, the issue regarding "tension" between the North and the  South Korea has been "put aside," and denounces North Korea's  "persistent refusal" of inter-Korean dialogue and recent remarks  on "Seoul becoming a sea of fire." The editorial says that there  is a "high possibility" that North Korea's "antinational,  menacing act" may be "overlooked" if North Korea expresses  "readiness" to accept additional inspection, changing its  attitude. But the editorial urges the North to "apologize" for  its "abnormal acts" and to basically change its attitude, so  that it may be recognized as "a dialogue partner."    The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO publishes on page 3 a 1,200-word  editorial under the headline, "How Long Should We Put Up With  the Statement of the Security Council's President?" The  editorial notes that with China's proposal for a security  council president's statement, the North Korean nuclear issue  will likely return to the "condition of one year ago" because  the North has not shown any change in its attitude, and  expresses "doubt" as to whether the ROK Government's support for  the Chinese proposal is "appropriate." Criticizing the  government's "excessive appeasement attitude," the editorial  stresses that the "stick," while not necessarily meaning  "confrontation," is more effective for bringing North Korea to  the dialogue table.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (9): Controversy persists over conservation issues - David Lascelles looks at mining, natural gas and forestry developments in the Indonesian part of Borneo Kalimantan, as the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo is known, is a huge wilderness, thinly populated and rich in resources. The terrain extends from high mountain peaks, through lush rain forests to the mangrove swamps and lazy rivers of the coast. Despite difficult working conditions - torrential rain and few roads - the island has important industrial projects, particularly in East Kalimantan where some of the richest energy and forestry resources lie. But development is controversial: it creates social and economic strains and stirs up environmental concerns. Sensitive to international criticism, the Indonesian government has been arguing that development and conservation can go hand in hand in developing the area's potential.</p>

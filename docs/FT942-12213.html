			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A purchase of 500 Footsie futures contracts minutes before the close of trading enlivened an otherwise quiet day in derivatives, writes Clare Gascoigne. The trade, pushed the June future to 3,155, although it fell back to 3,139 in after-hours dealing. There was speculation that it was linked to an over-the-counter option expiring next week. June opened down 12 at 3,109, and drifted to a low of 3,096 with a very weak bond market and the release of US economic data. A gentle rally took it back to around 3,134 before the final trade.</p>

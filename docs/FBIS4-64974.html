			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mark Kranenburg: "It All Revolves Around the </F> Color Purple"]    [Text] Extreme subtlety. That is what the first stage of  the government formation is all about. The art for all involved  is to keep their options open, while the others show their true  colors. The recommendations to the Queen from the leaders of the  four principal parties all perfectly respect this approach. The  job of Tjeenk Willink, charged by the Crown to investigate  whether a proposed government formation will succeed, is to try  and read between the lines and, above all, proceed with extreme  caution.    It all in fact revolves around the color purple. The only  party to clearly come out in favor of a "purple" coalition  [comprising the PvdA [Labor Party], the D66 [Democrats 66], and  the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] is the D66,  the big election winners. The PvdA and the VVD are not going  any further for the moment than to say that they do not rule out  such a coalition. Both of them are also keeping their options  open to enter into a coalition that includes the CDA [Christian  Democrat Party]. So far the positions adopted are just as  inflexible as they were before the election. Tjeenk Willink can  now try to make them more flexible in order to establish which  coalition option should be the first to be investigated. In  other words: Which three parties will be the first to sit down  at the negotiating table.    If that is indeed the PvdA, the VVD and the D66, then it  will  be the first time since 1918 that the CDA has not been involved  in forming a government. But it takes some time and explaining  to set aside around 75 years of history. This is why it was  decided to appoint Tjeenk Willink in order to consider which  coalition possibilities are worth subsequently exploring. His  mission is limited and he is under no obligation to do very  much. He must simply consider "which possibilities exist, on  the basis of the election results, for the formation of a  government which can count on fruitful cooperation with the  parliament. He also has to prioritize the coalitions  possibilities and see what method of investigating offers the  best prospects of quickly forming such a government." The key  word here is prioritize.    For D66 leader Van Mierlo, this prioritization is clearly  established. He is the only one to have expressed before the  elections a clear preference for a coalition consisting of his  own party together with the PvdA and the VVD. Not out of an  anti-CDA feeling, as he stressed again yesterday, but because a  genuine alternative government is in the interests of a healthy  democracy. But do the other partners needed to form a "purple"  coalition share this opinion?    PvdA leader Kok was still keeping his options open in  yesterday's recommendation. In any event, he wants a government  founded upon a "progressive basis." This would have to be  formed by the PvdA and the D66. Whether or not they should be  joined by the CDA or the VVD depends on the agreement which can  be reached on the government program.    VVD leader Bolkestein wants his own party and the D66, the  two election winners, to be included in the new government.  Whether the third party is to be the CDA or the PvdA would also  depend for Bolkestein on the agreed government program. Tjeenk  Willink's job is to bring an end to this policy of awaiting  developments on the part of the three parties. The  recommendation from CDA leader Brinkman to the Queen can be of  help to him [Willink] in this respect. Brinkman stated that the  first option to be investigated should be the "purple" coalition.    If the negotiations between the PvdA, the VVD and the D66  fail, then the door is open for the CDA to participate in the  government formation process. But in that case with one trump  card: The knowledge that a coalition without the CDA is not  possible. That would be a very strong negotiating position.  The other parties are fully aware of this, which explains their  hesitant behavior.    Tjeenk Willink's mission is limited. PvdA leader Kok has  spoken of a "lengthy period of consultation." At some point  Tjeenk Willink will have to decide whether or not there is any  point in Kok, Bolkestein, and Van Mierlo sitting down at the  negotiating table. In fact it is only the first two who are  really involved. It is well-known for example that Kok and  Bolkestein have totally different opinions regarding the  introduction of a basic social security system. Tjeenk Willink  will probably not be able to avoid investigating whether or not  they are prepared to come to a compromise on this. How exactly  they will achieve it is then a matter for the next round of the  formation process. That is the moment for CDA leader Brinkman  to start getting worried. And if certain subjects remain  excluded from any discussion between Kok and Bolkestein, Van  Mierlo must then assess the situation.</p>

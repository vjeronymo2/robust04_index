			<p><P> November 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> VACCINE SEEN SUREST WAY TO AVOID MISERY OF FLU SEASON;  </P> <P> INFLUENZA: OLDER AMERICANS CAN ESCAPE THE ILLNESS AND ITS SOMETIMES DEADLY  COMPLICATIONS WITH A SIMPLE PREVENTIVE MEASURE. AND NOVEMBER IS THE BEST TIME  TO GET THE SHOT.  </P> <P> The old adage "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" holds true for  the flu.  </P> <P> Each winter millions of Americans suffer the fever, aches and pains of  influenza. Most recover from the effects in a week or so, but for many older  people the flu and its complications are extremely serious.  </P> <P> While the body's immune system is busy fighting the flu, a person is less able  to resist pneumonia, another life-threatening infection. Older people and those  with chronic diseases such as heart disease, emphysema, asthma and diabetes  have the greatest risk of developing pneumonia along with the flu.  </P> <P> And older people are more likely to require hospitalization. Flu and pneumonia  combined are the sixth leading cause of death in the United States, and 80% to  90% of the deaths are in people 65 and older.  </P> <P> But flu and its complications need not be deadly, and can be prevented by  vaccinating high-risk individuals six to eight weeks before the season begins.  </P> <P> Influenza is caused by a virus that infects the nose, throat and lungs. Flu  travels quickly, especially during winter in crowded indoor places like malls,  grocery stores, theaters and hospitals. When someone with the flu coughs or  sneezes, droplets containing particles of the virus spread to others.  </P> <P> After infection, symptoms usually appear in two to four days; the disease  continues to be contagious for another three to four days.  </P> <P> Once the virus enters the body, it multiplies and causes a variety of  well-known complaints, including chills and fever, headache, runny nose, sore  throat and a dry cough. Extreme weakness and muscle aches and pains often last  for several days. If the virus invades the lungs, viral pneumonia can develop.  </P> <P> To prevent the flu, people 65 and older and residents of nursing homes and  other chronic-care facilities should be vaccinated. Also, health professionals,  nursing home workers and family members who live with someone older than 65  should get a flu shot to avoid spreading the disease to those at risk.  </P> <P> Unlike other viruses, the flu virus changes from time to time. Because  different strains of the virus tend to spread flu each season, a new vaccine is  prepared every year. It contains strains of the flu virus recently circulating  worldwide and believed likely to hit during the coming winter. Nicknames such  as the "Spanish flu" and "Hong Kong flu" refer to places where large outbreaks  of new flu strains have first appeared.  </P> <P> The vaccine is made from highly purified, killed viruses. Because the flu shot  does not contain infectious viruses, it does not cause the flu. The most common  side effect is a sore arm, which occurs in less than one-third of those  vaccinated and usually lasts only a day or so. A few people also may develop a  brief low-grade fever and some minor aches and pains, which begin six to 12  hours after vaccination and can persist for one or two days.  </P> <P> If a person has no special reason not to take aspirin, low doses (such as one  tablet every three to four hours) usually will relieve these symptoms.  </P> <P> Immediate allergic reactions, such as hives, rarely occur after influenza  vaccination. Anyone allergic to eggs, which are used to grow the virus for the  vaccine, should not receive the vaccine, as some egg protein may be present.  </P> <P> Because the flu vaccine takes several weeks to work, the best time to be  vaccinated is in November. A vaccine also is available against the most common  types of bacteria that cause pneumonia. The flu shot can be given at the same  time as the pneumonia vaccine without increasing the side effects. The flu shot  must be given every year, but the pneumonia vaccine should be given only once.  </P> <P> In addition to the flu shot, an antiviral drug -- amantadine -- can prevent  infection by certain strains. The drug is useful for people who have not had  the vaccine or as extra protection for those who have been immunized.  </P> <P> When taken soon after the early signs are felt, amantadine reduces the duration  of fever and other symptoms. It also can prevent infection if taken during the  entire four- to six-week course of a flu epidemic.  </P> <P> After people stop taking the drug, they become susceptible to the virus again.  It occasionally causes difficulty sleeping, impaired concentration and  dizziness, and has been associated with falls in older people. As with all  medication, patients should take it only with a doctor's recommendation.  </P> <P> INFLUENZA / PNEUMONIA DEATH TOLLS  </P> <P> Age breakdown for 1987 deaths  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.31IN:2.00IN:1.89IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Under 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Over 65  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Deaths from flu and pneumonia  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 987  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 60,542  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Deaths from flu  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 15  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 533  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE></p>

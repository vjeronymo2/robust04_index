			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: MPs should declare all Sir, As a result of the Financial Services Act, financial advisers and sales people must declare to would-be investors exactly whom they represent and (from the new year) the commissions they will receive in cash terms. Given the continuing concern over cash for questions, perhaps MPs should follow a similar line. Before their questions are accepted, their speeches allowed and their parliamentary votes counted, perhaps they should make it clear at the time exactly whose interests they are representing and the financial rewards they have or will receive.

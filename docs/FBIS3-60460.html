In a statement to AL-DUSTUR, he said that those who  contracted the disease in Jordan during the past stage are only  94, of which 62 are Jordanian citizens. Out of the 62 cases, 40  contracted the disease outside Jordan because they suffer from  hemophilia, which requires regular blood transfusions.    He said that the remainder contracted the disease in Jordan  during the same period.</p>

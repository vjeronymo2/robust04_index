			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Statistical Report by the Chelyabinsk Oblast Statistics </F> Administration: "Socioeconomic State of the Oblast in First  Quarter of 1994"]    [Text] The main indices characterizing the socioeconomic  state of the oblast during the first quarter of 1994 are as  follows:                                      First quarter 1994    First quarter 1994 as                                    (actual prices)       a percentage of first                                                          quarter 1993 (in                                                          comparable prices)   Industrial production output      -                     68*   Production of consumer goods,     272                   68  billions of rubles   including:   food products                     82.7                  72   alcoholic beverages               41.7                  76   nonfood products                  147.6                 64   Capital investments from all      211.4                 71  sources of financing, billions  of rubles   Housing put into operation from   104,300               114  all sources of financing,  square meters of living area   Average daily dispatch of         118,900               66  freight by rail transportation  (divisions of the Chelyabinsk  Oblast Railroad), tonnes   Freight deliveries by             8.4                   41  public-use motor vehicle  transportation, millions of  tonnes   Purchases of livestock  products, all categories of  farms:   livestock and fowl, tonnes        16,600                73*   milk, tonnes                      54,500                65*   eggs                              13.311 billion        95*   Retail trade turnover of          411.2                 79  officially registered trade  enterprises and public  kitchens, billions of rubles   Paid services, billions of        50.8                  35  rubles   Exports, millions of dollars      44                    130  U.S.   Imports, millions of dollars      22                    139  U.S.   Profit (January-February),        249.7                 4.6-fold greater**  billions of rubles   Per capita monetary income (in    90,700                6.1-fold greater**  March 1994), rubles   Aggregate consumer price index                          661  (March 1994 as compared to  March 1993)   * index of physical volume of production   ** in existing prices    <H5>  FINANCE </H5>   During January-February 1994, R249.7 billion [rubles] in  profits were received by enterprises and organizations of the  oblast. This represents a 4.6-fold increase in profits over the  same period of last year. All sectors showed a positive  financial balance over the course of the two months except for  transportation, where losses amounted to R6.4 billion. Almost  one-third of all the losses in the sector were incurred by  virtue of the enterprises and organizations of Chelyabinsk.    The nonpayments problem continues to be a critical one. The  credit indebtedness of enterprises and organizations amounted to  R2.3212 trillion as of 1 March 1994, of which R1.1673 trillion,  or 50.3 percent, constituted delinquent indebtedness. The share  of enterprises with delinquent indebtedness to suppliers  comprised 65.6 percent of the total delinquent indebtedness;  only 8 percent was indebtedness to the budget. Bank-credit debts  totalled R331.9 billion over this period, including 23.5 percent  attributable to delinquent debts. A large amount of the total  indebtedness is attributable to industry. The indebtedness with  respect to loans procured amounted to R11.1 billion.    The large amounts of delinquent credit indebtedness are  related to the presence of debit indebtedness. Thus, as of 1  March 1994, debit indebtedness amounted to R2.3379 trillion,  including delinquent debit indebtedness of R1.3037 trillion, or  55.8 percent. A large portion of the delinquent indebtedness is  attributable to the delinquent indebtedness of purchasers  (R1.1673 trillion, or 89.5 percent of the total debit  indebtedness).    It is mainly due to the lack of funds in settlement accounts  of enterprises and organizations of industry, construction, and  agriculture that the timely payment of wages to workers is being  delayed. The percentage of enterprises in industry that were in  violation of the time frame for payment of wages was 34.6  percent of the total number of enterprises in debt. In  construction, the percentage was 25.4 percent, and in  agriculture--40 percent.  <H5>  LEVELS AND INDICES OF PRICES AND RATES </H5>   The consumer price index characterizing the change in actual  family budget expenditures was 134 percent for March as compared  with December 1993.    A determining influence on the overall consumer price index  was exerted by sharp increases in the cost of paid services to  the populace (costs rose 2.5-fold in March over the level of  December of last year). The maximum rise in prices and rates was  observed for housing and public-utility services (sixfold),  including a 14.4-fold increase in services of the housing  sphere. The rate of growth of passenger transportation costs  continues--the March level was 307.6 percent of the December  level. The trend towards accelerated price increases was  maintained for consumer services (1.7-fold), communications  services (2.3-fold), and tourist and health resort services  (twofold).    Prices of consumer goods were 28.4 percent higher in March  1994 than in December 1993. In general, price increases for  consumer goods over the period in question slowed down  significantly, especially with respect to food products. Food  product prices rose 29 percent over December 1993 levels,  including a 1.8-fold increase for fish and other maritime  products, cheese, and vegetables; 1.7-fold increase for  potatoes; and 1.5-fold increase for milk, dairy products, canned  vegetables, and edible fats. Rapid price growth was maintained  for vegetables, canned vegetables, and ice cream.    Prices for nonfood products rose 28 percent over the levels  of December 1993, including a 1.9-fold increase for printed  publications, 1.7-fold increase for flaxen fabric and matches,  and 1.6-fold increase for detergents, thread, toys, and  gasoline. Accelerated price increases were characteristic of  children's clothing and footwear, knitted underwear, rubber  footwear, glassware, stationery, television sets, radios, and  medicines.    The consolidated index for wholesale industrial production  prices was 144 percent in March over the December 1993 level. A  significant price increase was noted in the fuel industry (price  index of 171.4 percent over December). Increased prices in the  fuel industry, the metallurgy complex (where the index was 116.5  percent), and chemical industry (116.4 percent) brought about  price increases in the machinebuilding industry (where the index  was 205.4 percent over December 1993). The index for output of  the building materials industry increased 1.9-fold. Significant  price increases were observed with respect to the output of  light industry (154.1 percent) and the food industry (124.1  percent).  <H5>  INDUSTRY </H5>   The sharp production decline continues in industry. Physical  volume of production decreased 32 percent as compared with the  first quarter of 1993, 34.1 percent in March. The production  decline was most significant in ferrous metallurgy,  machinebuilding, light industry, and the building materials  industry. The financial condition of enterprises, the payments  crisis, and problems with production output sales are ever more  frequently forcing enterprises to halt production partially or  completely, to shift operating mode to one of shorter work  periods, or to direct employees to take unpaid or only partially  paid leave. Whereas 35 enterprises monthly on the average stood  idle last year, the number for the first quarter of this year  was double, and in March production stopped at 94 enterprises.    In the fuel and energy complex, electric power generation  diminished by 19.8 percent, and coal production decreased 21  percent. In ferrous metallurgy, reduced demand resulted in a  36.6-percent decrease in the production of rolled metal, a  13.3-percent decrease in the extraction of iron ore, a  38.9-percent reduction in the smelting of cast iron, and  41-percent decrease in steel smelting.    In the chemical and wood-processing industry, production of  sulfuric acid decreased by 21.9 percent, and mineral fertilizer  output by 31.9 percent. The reduction in output of synthetic  resins and plastics was especially sharp--constituting only 3.6  percent of the level produced during the first quarter of last  year. Only the output of medicinal preparations increased, their  growth constituting a 13.3-percent increase over last year's  levels. Timber-producing enterprises produced 137,800 densely  packed cubic meters of commercial timber over the three  months--42.1 percent lower than the level for the first quarter  of last year. Sawn lumber production decreased by 33.8 percent.    The most perceptible production decline was seen at  machinebuilding enterprises. Production of metal-cutting machine  tools, excavators, bulldozers, and tractors was reduced by more  than half. Motor vehicle production decreased by almost 23  percent. The volume of sector output decreased by 42.3 percent  on the whole.    Production output of enterprises of the construction  industry  was reduced significantly in connection with decreased volumes  of construction and the insolvency of clients. The volume of  production output of these enterprises was reduced 37.5 percent.  Production of cement decreased by 47.3 percent, asbestos-cement  sheeting by 86.4 percent, precast reinforced-concrete parts and  components by 33.5 percent, construction bricks by 43.3 percent,  and construction glass by 40.5 percent.    The output of commodities for the populace diminished to a  greater extent than did industrial and technical production  output. In January-March consumer goods were produced totalling  R272 billion--32.2 percent less in comparable prices than in the  first quarter of 1993. In this regard, production of food  products decreased the least amount--by 27.5 percent, while  production of cultural and domestic products decreased by 31.6  percent and light-industry commodities decreased by 56.6 percent.    Light industry continues to experience deep crisis.  Production volume in this sector was reduced more than twofold  over the three months. The production output of light industry  totalled R19.2 billion, or just a little more than R5,000 on the  average per inhabitant for garments, knitted articles, and  footwear. Production of knitted articles diminished by half,  socks and hosiery--by three-fourths, and leather footwear--by  almost 57 percent.  <H5>  THE AGRO-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX </H5>   As of the start of the spring sowing season, agricultural  enterprises of the oblast were supplied to the 98.5-percent  level with seed for spring crops, including wheat--96.7 percent,  millet--117.5 percent, and buckwheat--80.9 percent. Seed  potatoes were supplied to the extent of 86.1 percent. The  insurance stock for spring-crop seed amounted to 29,400 tonnes  (59.6 percent of the demand). As of the beginning of April of  this year, agricultural enterprises had 4.4 times less diesel  fuel on hand than last year, and 2.7 times less gasoline. As of  the same date, 21.7 percent of tractors and 24.9 percent of  trucks were in a state of disrepair. A significant portion of  these were to be found on the farms of Varnenskiy, Nagaybakskiy,  Nyazepetrovskiy, and Chesmenskiy Rayons.    Over the three months of the current year, 27,600 tonnes of  livestock and fowl (live weight) were sold for slaughter; 84,000  tonnes of milk and 151.7 million eggs were produced. These  figures are smaller than those for last year by 0.5, 24.6, and  4.9 percent, respectively. One cow yielded 395 kilograms of milk  on the average--91 kilograms (18.7 percent) less than last  year's level. The average egg-laying capacity per hen decreased  by 3.3 percent, amounting to 58 eggs over the past three months.    The decreased livestock production volumes were caused both  by the diminished productivity of livestock and fowl and by  their reduced numbers. As of 1 April, agricultural enterprises  had 622,900 head of cattle (88.9 percent of the level as of 1  April 1993), 221,500 cows (93.2 percent), 268,900 pigs (90.6  percent), 395,100 sheep (81.1 percent), and 7,666,600 fowl (98.3  percent).    The share of total sales volume of livestock and fowl  attributable to state purchases was 70.5 percent for the first  quarter of this year; milk, 93.5 percent; and eggs, 91.4  percent. Some 16,600 tonnes of livestock and fowl were purchased  by all categories of farms over this period, 54,500 tonnes of  milk, and 133.1 million eggs. This is less than the levels for  the same period last year by 27.4, 34.8, and 5 percent,  respectively. In March the purchase price (not considering  subsidies) of one kilogram of meat or poultry (live weight)  amounted to R919, which was 3.1 percent less than the previous  month's level. For milk, this figure was R201 (2.5 percent  greater), and for eggs--R640 (3.2 percent greater).    As of the beginning of April of this year, there were 7,191  peasant farms covering an area of 418,700 hectares (58 hectares  per farm, on the average).  <H5>  CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION </H5>   We continue to see a decline in the scale of construction.  Volumes of capital investments directed towards development of  this sphere amounted to R211 billion in the first quarter, a  decrease of 29 percent from first quarter of last year.  Operations at a number of construction sites came to a complete  halt.    As before, the main source of capital investments continues  to be the funds that enterprises and organizations have at their  disposal--R140 billion, or 66 percent. Some R71 billion, or 34  percent, were allocated from the republic and oblast budgets.  Thirty-nine percent of the total volume of capital investments  were used by state enterprises and organizations; 60 percent--by  joint-stock companies. Fifty-seven percent of all funds were  directed towards the construction of production facilities.    The volume of capital investments directed towards housing  construction decreased by 30 percent. The volume directed  towards construction of schools, preschool institutions,  hospitals, and clinics decreased by a factor of two or three.  Total housing space commissioned amounted to 104,300 square  meters--1,711 new apartments. This represents an increase over  last year in housing commissioned of 13,000 square meters, or 14  percent. The number of individual residences put into operation  increased 2.5-fold; individual builders constructed 57  single-family dwellings, totalling 5,300 square meters in area.    Some R3.6 billion was targeted towards measures to eliminate  the aftereffects of radioactive contamination, of which R3.4  billion went to the construction of residential housing  facilities.  <H5>  PRIVATIZATION OF HOUSING </H5>   As of 1 April 1994, 326,700 state apartments were  privatized.  This is 28.3 percent of the total number of apartments subject  to privatization. In January-March of this year, 27,400  apartments were converted to citizens' property (8.4 percent of  the total number of privatized apartments).  <H5>  TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS </H5>   Freight shipments continue to diminish. The volume of  freight  hauled by public-use transportation decreased by 17 million  tonnes (48 percent) from the level of first quarter 1993,  amounting to 19.1 million tonnes. The volume of freight  transported by rail decreased by 34 percent, motor vehicle  transport by 59 percent, and air transportation by 55 percent.    No improvement is being seen in transportation services  provided to the populace. The number of vehicles being put into  service is being reduced, and routes are being eliminated or  curtailed. In March, 7 percent of the scheduled bus and trolley  bus trips in Chelyabinsk were not completed, as was the case for  up to 3 percent of the streetcar trips. With respect to suburban  and intercity bus travel, 5,000 trips were not completed in the  first quarter, and about 500 trips were accomplished with  schedule violations.    With respect to railroad transportation in January-March, 42  passenger trains (1.5 percent) arrived an average of 1.5 hours  late. Regarding domestic airline traffic for Chelyabinsk  Airport, 18.5 percent of flights were completed with schedule  violations, the average delay being almost three hours. With  respect to Magnitogorsk Airport, the applicable figures are 10.7  percent and 2.5 hours.    Communications enterprises rendered services during the  first  quarter valued at R16.9 billion, including services to the  populace of R3.9 billion. This is 10.7 times greater, in actual  prices, than the figure for the same period of last year. At the  same time, the physical volume of communications services  rendered continues to diminish.  <H5>  THE CONSUMER MARKET OF GOODS AND SERVICES </H5>   In January-March of this year, consumer goods valued at  R411.2 billion were sold to the oblast populace. This is 5.3  times greater, in actual prices, than the figure for the first  quarter of last year. In comparable prices, however, the volume  of goods acquired was 21 percent less.    The major portion of commodities (63 percent) were acquired  in private stores. The share attributable to state trade was 27  percent, consumer cooperatives 6 percent, and enterprises of  other forms of ownership 4 percent.    The trade volume of public-kitchen enterprises amounted to  R31.9 billion, 16 percent less than last year, in comparable  prices. The share of production output done on premises was 65.2  percent.    The volume of food product sales rose to R235 billion in  January-March. In product volume, however, this represents a  reduction of 10 percent from the level of the same period last  year. The sales volume of main food products in organized trade  is decreasing, including a 33-percent reduction in sales of meat  and poultry, 48 percent in sausage products, 46 percent in fish,  32-39 percent in eggs and margarine products, and over 50  percent in canned meats and fish. A 12-percent smaller volume of  vodka, beer, and other alcoholic beverages was sold.    At the same time that sales volumes of food products in the  retail trade network decreased, increases were seen in sales of  nonorganized trade, on the kolkhoz markets, for example, where  the sales turnover of agricultural products rose 1.4 percent on  the whole throughout the oblast.    The sales volumes of nonfood products decreased by 32  percent, in comparable prices, amounting to R176.2 billion.    Paid services to the oblast populace during the first  quarter  of this year amounted to R50.8 billion, 9.2 times greater in  actual prices than the 1993 level, but 65 percent lower in  comparable prices. Privately owned enterprises provided almost  14 percent of the total volume of paid services and 39 percent  of the volume of consumer services.  <H5>  MONETARY INCOME AND EXPENDITURES OF THE OBLAST POPULATION </H5>   The monetary income and expenditures of the populace over  January-March of 1994 rose more than fivefold over the level of  the same period last year, reaching the level of R818.3 billion.  The greatest rise in income was seen in February--a 1.3-fold  increase over January income, amounting to R60 billion. The  growth of income in March was 20 percent less than the February  level (R54 billion).    Calculated on a per capita basis, the income of oblast  residents came to R59,200 in January, R75,800 in February, and  R90,700 in March. A slowdown was also observed with respect to  growth of ready cash at the disposal of the populace and  withdrawal of monetary assets out of the oblast. In  January-March 1993 this rate of growth was 13.5-fold, and this  year--6.7-fold.    The consolidated consumer price index for the full circle of  goods and services continues to exceed the growth of income and  consumer expenditures: 661 percent in March 1994 over March  1993, while incomes over this period rose 6.1-fold and consumer  expenditures--5.6-fold.    The amount of funds directed towards consumption in February  of this year in all sectors of the economy, calculated on a  per-worker basis, reached the level of R147,900. This is 6.7  times greater than the level of February 1993, and 2.3 percent  greater than the level of the previous month.    The level of average monthly wages reached R137,600 in  February--6.6 times greater than the level for the same period  last year and 1.2 percent greater than the January level.  Average monthly wages in February decreased by 27.4 percent from  the January level at institutions of culture and art, and by  16.9 percent at planning and research organizations for  construction support.    The highest wages in February were received by workers in  financial and credit institutions and organizations--R332,400,  and workers in transportation enterprises and  organizations--R212,700. The lowest average monthly salary was  observed at agricultural enterprises--R54,400. Wages in sectors  of the nonproduction sphere were 5.9 percent higher than in the  production sphere, amounting to R142,000. The highest wage in  the oblasts of the Urals region was paid in Sverdlovsk Oblast  (R143,500), the lowest was paid in Kurgan Oblast--R105,000.  <H5>  LABOR </H5>   Average authorized worker strength in all sectors of the  economy totalled 1,348,400 people in February, 4.3 percent lower  than the level for the same period last year.    Significant personnel strength reductions were seen in the  organizations of data processing centers--by 19.2 percent, at  procurement enterprises--by 13.4 percent, and at planning and  research organizations for construction support--by 11.3  percent. The average authorized worker strength doubled at  enterprises engaged in general commercial activity in support of  the market, and increased by 17.2 percent at institutions of  culture and art, organizations of housing and municipal  services, and organizations of the nonproduction varieties of  provision of consumer services to the populace.    As of the beginning of April, 24,700 unemployed were  registered with the employment service, including 22,600 people  (91.5 percent) receiving unemployment compensation. Of the  latter number, 34.9 percent constituted young people aged 16-29,  and 64.3 percent were women. Some 14,100 individuals were  entered in the register of unemployed over the quarter, of whom  94.8 percent were authorized to receive unemployment  compensation. (During the first quarter of 1993, 9,200  unemployed were placed on the register, 8,900 of these being  authorized to receive unemployment compensation). Some 7,300  unemployed were removed from the register over the accounting  quarter, including 3,300 (45.1 percent) who were placed in job  positions.    On the whole, the number of workers being discharged is  double the requirement for manpower. Thus, the number of persons  unemployed will increase still further.  <H5>  FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS </H5>   In January-March 1994, the oblast volume of foreign trade  turnover through direct ties amounted to $65.98 million in  foreign trade prices. Goods and services valued at $43.951  million were exported, including exports to industrially  developed countries of $32.753 million (74.5 percent), to  developing countries--$411,000 (0.9 percent), and to remaining  countries (the former CEMA countries, republics of the former  Yugoslavia, China, Korean People's Democratic Republic, and the  Baltic countries)--$10.787 million (24.6 percent).    Oblast imports through direct foreign trade ties were valued  at $22.029 million. Some 54.8 percent of the total volume of  imports was attributable to the industrially developed  countries, 5.8 percent to developing countries, and 39.4 percent  to the remaining countries.    The foreign trade balance with respect to direct cooperation  between oblast enterprises and organizations and foreign firms  was a positive one in the amount of $21.922 million.  <H5>  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION </H5>   A gradual decrease in pollution is being observed against  the  background of overall production decline. Thus in 1993, 1.5453  million tonnes of pollutants were discharged into the  environment by surveyed enterprises. This is 34.4 percent less  than in 1990 and 15.3 percent less than last year.    The oblast Committee for Ecology and Utilization of Natural  Resources is monitoring compliance with environmental  legislation. Enterprises paid fines in the amount of R26.3  million for various violations of this legislation.</p>

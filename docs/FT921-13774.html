Shares in the conglomerate, which has wide ranging agricultural, manufacturing and leisure interests, have dropped from 230p in late November to 150p last night. Concern centres around the 'tycoon factor' - ie. what would happen to the company when it loses its driving force, Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, 74. There are also worries about its high level of debt, difficulties in generating organic growth, and falling mineral prices. Its pre-tax profits for the year ended last September have probably fallen to about Pounds 245m, from Pounds 273m a year earlier. Some analysts think the dividend may be cut this year from last year's 16p a share. Interim results from Budgens on tomorrow will be the first news on how things are progressing at the food retailer, where institutional investors installed a new management team last April. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits of about Pounds 1m, and will be interested to hear how Sunday trading is holding up, now that other food retailers have clambered aboard the bandwagon which Budgens was one of the first to get rolling. Newman Tonks, Europe's largest maker of architectural hardware, will report on Wednesday a steep drop in pre-tax profits for the year ended October. They are likely to fall to about Pounds 15m, from Pounds 23.2m a year earlier. The decline is no surprise given the abysmal UK housing market. The group's strength abroad, coupled with tight management, will have helped minimise the blow. Analysts are pencilling in a slight pick up for the present year.

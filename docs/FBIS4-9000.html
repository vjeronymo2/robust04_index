			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From BTA's 20 April "Press Review"] </F>   [Excerpt] Sofia, April 20 (BTA) -- The government's future  prospects following demands for its complete overhaul by two  parliamentary groups -- the biggest one, of the Bulgarian  Socialist Party (BSP), and of the Movement for Rights and  Freedoms, dominate the dailies.    "L. Berov Hasn't Got Hepatitis But Was Isolated  Deliberately"  runs a front-page headline in DUMA, the BSP daily. It quotes a  knowledgeable source of the hospital in which the prime minister  is being treated as saying that "since last Thursday [14 April]  there have been no medical reasons whatsoever to keep him in  quarantine". He definitely has not got hepatitis, the whole  affair was either deliberately provoked or resulted from  doctors' incompetence, the source said. On March 11 Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov had a quadruple bypass operation following  heart failure and on April 13 the government Press Office  announced Berov had been hospitalized with hepatitis symptoms.  According to DUMA, in the middle of last week blood tests ruled  out hepatitis, while the tests that are being done in Germany  are part of the stalling and suspense tactics. Government  sources commented that Berov is well aware of the political  intrigues over his condition as well as of the imprudent and  foolish steps taken by some cabinet ministers in his absence.  The prime minister intends to resume his duties later this week.  His hepatitis is "political", according to a signed article in  DUMA. It also says that the Socialists strongly insist that "the  reform and the new composition of the cabinet should reflect the  political weight of the parties as judged by the electorate".    DEMOKRATSIYA calls Berov's illness "diplomatic jaundice".  Quoting reliable sources, the daily of the Union of Democratic  Forces (SDS) says "the motive behind the whole affair was to  allow Berov to trifle with his patrons and stall the cabinet  overhaul".    In an interview on national radio this morning Health  Minister Tancho Gugalov denied these allegations by saying that  to his knowledge the prime minister's illness had not been  contrived for some purpose.

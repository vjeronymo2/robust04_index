			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / International Company News: German regional bourses unveil central SE deal GERMANY'S regional stock exchanges yesterday agreed to join the Frankfurt bourse to create a central stock exchange holding company. The seven exchanges, led by Dusseldorf, will set up their own company to take the 10 per cent stake offered to them by the Frankfurt exchange in Deutsche Borse AG, which will be set up to run Germany's stock markets on a centralised basis. Mr Rudiger von Rosen, managing director of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, welcomed the move saying it would strengthen the will to unite the resources of the eight bourses as part of the drive to become more competitive in Europe. The regional exchanges - the others are Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Berlin, Bremen and Hanover - said they intended to share with Frankfurt, the country's dominant bourse, the responsibility for creating a modern German stock exchange system which met international demands. They have set up a company called Deutsche Borsenbeteiligungs to acquire the stake in the new stock exchange holding. Dusseldorf will own 44 per cent of this company, Munich 18 per cent, Hamburg 13 per cent, Stuttgart 13 per cent, Berlin 6 per cent and Bremen and Hanover 3 per cent each. Banks and brokers in Frankfurt and other German trading centres will also participate in Deutsche Borse. The Bonn government has already said it favours setting up Deutsche Borse, calling it a 'decisive breakthrough' which combines the advantages of increased centralisation of stock exchange services with the opportunities provided by regional trading. This was one of the measures included in the finance ministry's paper produced in January aimed at helping increase Frankfurt's strength as a world financial centre to rival London, New York and Tokyo. The other measures were the outlawing of insider trading and fairer treatment for investors, in line with international rules of conduct.</p>

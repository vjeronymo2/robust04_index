According to the prime minister,  the number of initiated privatization procedures exceed those  initially planned, while the concluded deals fall short of those  envisaged.    Over the past year the Agency for Privatization with the  Council of Ministers initiated 49 privatization procedures and  concluded 13 deals for sale. The ministries and committees  authorized to privatize put up for privatization another 293  smaller units, 49 of which were sold.    Stepping into office in the last days of 1992, Prof. Berov's  cabinet pledged to become the cabinet of privatization. A year  later the most severe of criticisms are leveled exactly at that  sphere of the government's activity.    In the spring of 1993 the cabinet declared that it was  adopting a course toward mass socially-oriented privatization  and in September tabled for discussion at parliament a draft  amendment to the effective Privatization Act. So far, the draft  has been shelved by the MP's. "We hope that the draft amendment  will be put to the vote by the end of this January," Prime  Minister Berov says in his analysis. The 1994 national budget  bill, too, has yet to be passed by the same time.    Under the government privatization project, all Bulgarian  nationals above 18 years of age living in this country will  receive 25,000-leva registered privatization bonds. The Council  of Ministers is presently drawing up a list of some 500  enterprises which will be put up for privatization. The list  will include units of various profitability and financial states  and will leave out those facing bankruptcy, Prof. Berov says.    The World Bank and the IMF have pledged their support for  the  project.</p>

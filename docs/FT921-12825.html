			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (9): The Sheep went astray, and Monkey business may be subdued THE YEAR of the Sheep failed to bring the Tokyo stock market the peace and calm that are symbolic of the sign. Instead, the Gulf war, stock scandals and Red Monday hit a market already reeling from the sharp falls experienced in 1990. The last quarter of 1991 offered no cheer. In October, the big four brokers (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi) did penance for their loss-compensation to favoured clients, allegations of stock-price manipulation and connections with gangsters, by suspending business at branches for up to six weeks. While the Nikkei stock average managed to close the year on a positive note, thanks to the surprise cut in the official discount rate on the last day of trading for 1991, it remained 3.8 per cent lower from the end of the third quarter, and down 4.5 per cent on the year. Average daily turnover remained below 300m shares during the fourth quarter, and turnover for the year fell to 91.7bn shares, the lowest since 1982. Individual investors, disgusted with the special treatment of larger institutional investors, continued to sell off holdings, moving to investments with secured returns. This, in turn, squeezed the flow of new money into investment-trust funds, active traders in the stock market. The spate of poor interim corporate profits, announced during October, clearly reflected the slowdown of the Japanese economy, adding to the pessimism among investors. The active buying by foreign investors, which had supported share prices in the third quarter, gradually faded, and selling by domestic investors at higher levels prevented shares from rising. Meanwhile, in contrast to the sluggishness in the cash market, trading in the stock futures market boomed. Arbitrage activity between the futures and cash stock market grew to record highs, prompting authorities to blame futures-related trading for the volatility in the cash stock market. With the Year of the Monkey, the Tokyo stock market has entered its third year of weakness, the longest post-war correction period. Forecasts of a recovery remain mixed, and although further cuts of the discount rate by the Bank of Japan are expected this quarter to help business confidence, some fund managers point out that lower interest rates will not necessarily mean higher prices. In the Pacific Basin, Hong Kong remained firm during the fourth quarter, and was one of the best performers of the year, rising over 40 per cent. Despite increasing inflation, the currency's linkage to the US dollar has caused interest rates to fall, resulting in excess funds flowing into property and equity investments. Although the Australian market faltered in the last three months of 1991, on the year it gained over 25 per cent, due to the deepening recession and a decline in interest rates. In contrast, Singapore regained its strength towards the end of the year, as the appreciation of the Singapore dollar helped soothe imported inflation. South Korea's opening of its stock markets to foreign investment at the beginning of this month is also worth noting. Up to Dollars 3bn of new money is expected to flow into the market from foreign investments. Although equity holdings by foreigners are limited to 10 per cent in a company, this will provide underlying support for the market. The economic environment, with high inflation and an increasing current account deficit, remains unfavourable to the stock market. But with the National Assembly and presidential elections anticipated, prospects for increases in money supply providing economic stimulus ahead of the political campaigns may be good news for equities.</p>

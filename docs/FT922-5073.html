			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / De Klerk visit to Russia puts end to decades of antipathy MR F W de Klerk yesterday used the first state visit of a South African president to Russia since the war to declare that ' we have turned our back on apartheid and will not return to it'. He denied that the stalemate in talks on reform of the South African constitution was because 'the whites are demanding a constitutional veto'. He said that the search for a new constitutional basis for the republic was 'to create through negotiation not a win-lose situation, but a win-win situation'. The South African president's visit officially ended decades of polemics between the Soviet Union and South Africa, during which Moscow supported the South African Communist party with large cash injections and - according to documents published over the weekend by the daily Izvestia - prompted it to attempt an armed uprising in the 1930s. Mr de Klerk said that he had come to Russia 'because communism is dead - I would not have come before that and would not have been welcome before that'. In spite of this perception, his visit has been criticised by pro-Communist deputies in the Russian parliament - while the African National Congress has also criticised his trip, and said it would oppose a visit by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, and any other foreign leader while the apartheid system still oper-ated. South Africa restored diplomatic relations with Russia in February. Mr de Klerk announced a 'modest' credit line of R100m (Pounds 19.4m) to assist trade between the two countries. Russia and South Africa, as the world's two main gold and diamond producers, have a strong mutual interest in their price levels. The president denied, however, any intention of pursuing a cartel in either, referring journalists to Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the former chairman of Anglo American Corporation, the large South African mining group. The two presidents signed a communique stressing the need to ensure democratic elections in Angola and to reach a ceasefire in Mozambique. Mr de Klerk said that he envisaged South Africa becoming the 'hub' of an economic union of 11 to 12 Southern African states, including Namibia and Mozambique, with 'exciting prospects' for economic development.</p>

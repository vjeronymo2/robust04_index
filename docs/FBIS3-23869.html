Medvedev, member of the personnel </F> certification commission, by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not  given: "On the Invisible Front; the Eyes and Ears Will Remain"]    [Text] "Fighters of the invisible front," "knights of  the cloak and dagger"--these romantic labels have stopped  accompanying employees of the KGB, and later, of the Ministry of  Security. At first, they were deprived of the halo of the  infallible, and afterwards a quiet attempt was made to get rid  of them. The latest attempt at such a radical riddance was the  reorganization of the Ministry of Security into the Federal  Counterintelligence Service (FCS), with fundamental changes in  functions. The personnel certification commission also appeared.  Our interlocutor is N. Medvedev, a member of the commission.    [Uglanov] Nikolay Pavlovich, has the president decided to  completely get rid of the very mention of the KGB and the  Ministry of Security?    [Medvedev] In accordance with his edict, the functions of  the  GB [Security Service] are being changed. Now, these are  counterintelligence organs. With the change in functions, there  is also a change in the qualitative composition of personnel.  Certification of the personal qualifications of personnel, of  course, is going on, with their political views being taken into  account. And it is clear: These organs should serve the state.    [Uglanov] But whom did they serve?    [Medvedev] Also the state. But how? Ideological and  political  functions that were not natural for a normal state were being  performed. And after the reformation of the KGB all that  occurred was a change in the signboard. All of the traditional  approaches of serving the state remained.    [Uglanov] Well, for example?    [Medvedev] In Penza Oblast, security organs publicly  arrested  the head of administration of the oblast before the elections  (he was appointed by the president). The Procuracy and the court  investigated this incident, and the case was closed--"There was  no reason to find fault with the head of administration." But  the Ministry of Security and the heads of administration are  associated with one and the same structure--the authority of the  president. And this is what the question was--how to serve the  state.    [Uglanov] Does the commission have access to lists of the  agents of the Ministry of Security among the deputies,  journalists, politicians, and others?    [Medvedev] There is a person on the commission's staff who  can have such access.    [Uglanov] But do you not feel sorry for generals who served  faithfully and truthfully?    [Medvedev] A majority of those who are presented to the  commission will be certified. We are reviewing those who were  removed by the managers of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service--N. Golushko and S. Stepashin. But I, for example, have  doubts about the Penza leadership and the heads of this  department in St. Petersburg and in Leningrad Oblast. This is  associated first and foremost with questions of a political  nature.    [Uglanov] Thus, will the reduction of the leadership of the  Ministry of Security be noticeable or not?    [Medvedev] It will be.    [Uglanov] And will the buildings, for example in the center  of Moscow, be vacated?    [Medvedev] I think that part of them, yes. But they will be  occupied by the Border Troops Service.    [Uglanov] Will secret collaborators of the KGB fall under  the  reduction.    [Medvedev] With the change in Ministry of Security  functions,  I think so. But for purposes of counterintelligence work,  everything will be done. The eyes and ears will remain. But  there will be no surveillance for ideological and political  reasons.    There also will be no thoughtless reductions. We will not  create the kind of situation where an embittered professional  would pass into the criminal and shady sphere.    [Uglanov] It is most likely that the hunt has already  started  for generals and their brains.    [Medvedev] Yes, and not only for generals. But all of the  specialists will remain. I do not rule out a situation when we  will even have to increase the number of workers for new  functions.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> U.S. JUDGE UPHOLDS MINORITY CONTRACTS  </P> <P> A federal judge has upheld the validity of San Francisco's contract preference  system for minorities and women over a claim of reverse discrimination by white  contractors. The challenged city ordinance provides preferences in bidding to  minority and women construction contractors in the city. U.S. District Judge  Thelton Henderson refused to issue a temporary restraining order to block  enforcement of the law. The 1989 ordinance is "an attempt to end the old boy  network" that allowed white contractors to dominate the construction business  with the city, according to Deputy City Atty. Mara Rosales. Associated General  Contractors of California Inc., a nonprofit California corporation  headquartered in Sacramento, challenged the ordinance. The group, representing  700 general contractors, contended the city violated the equal protection  clause of the Constitution by adopting a policy of discriminatory awarding of  contracts in favor of certain racial and ethnic minorities. The suit also  maintained the system violated the city Charter.  </P></p>

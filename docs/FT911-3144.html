			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / World Trade News: Dutch hope to buy ECGD short-term export business NCM, the Dutch credit insurance company, said yesterday it had a 'substantial' chance of being chosen by the UK government to purchase the short-term export insurance business of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). Mr Harry Groen, chairman of NCM, said that if the Dutch company were selected, it would finance the deal through its own internal resources and through a placement of shares with its existing shareholders, mainly banks and insurance companies in the Netherlands, and, to a lesser extent, in the UK, Germany and Switzerland. He described the possible purchase of a major part of ECGD as a unique opportunity which would lead to a doubling of NCM's premium income. NCM, whose official name is Nederlandsche Credietverzekering Maatschappij, is one of four companies on the UK government's short list. The other three are Assicurazioni Generali of Italy, and Sun Alliance and Trade Indemnity of Britain. Bids for the Cardiff-based ECGD division must be submitted by April 30. The Dutch company yesterday unveiled annual results which showed 1990 after-tax profit up 18 per cent at Fl 33.6m (Pounds 10m). Mr Groen said 1991 results should at least match last year's figures. Premium income for NCM's own account showed a marginal increase to Fl 271.7m from Fl 271.4m in 1989. Claims were up 17 per cent at Fl 121.7m. Apart from insuring commercial risks for its own account, NCM also handles the reinsurance of political risks on exports for the Dutch government. Although Mr Groen acknowledged there were some sensitivities among exporters in the UK about a foreign company buying a former government agency, he said NCM was fully capable of serving British exporters and there would be no conflict of interest with its Dutch operations.</p>

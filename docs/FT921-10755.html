			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Turkey initials Black Sea economic pact TURKEY and eight former socialist states around the Black Sea initialled a broad framework for economic co-operation yesterday, in a bid to revive stalled trade relations following dissolution of the former Soviet Union, writes John Murray Brown in Istanbul. The accord, unveiled by Turkish President Turgut Ozal in Istanbul, groups Turkey with Russia, Ukraine, Moldavia, Georgia, Romania and Bulgaria, as well as the neighbouring states of Armenia and Azerbaijan which are without direct access to the Black Sea. The formal agreement is expected to be signed in June, allowing Turkey and former Comecon members to revive trade links and to co-ordinate policy on issues from the environment and transport to telecommunications, infrastructure and fisheries. Turkish companies are supplying digital switches to Azerbaijan, power to Bulgaria and are involved in construction work in Russia and Ukraine. Turkish officials are also examining the possibility of a freeport at Trabzon to provide Armenia and possibly Azerbaijan with access to the Black Sea. 'We live around the same sea. It will be to our interest to develop the infrastructure,' Mr Ozal said. Turkey had extended more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 560m) of export credits to the Soviet Union, but officials say all new loans are frozen while arrangements with republics are worked out. The former Soviet Union represented a growing market for Turkey, with two-way trade worth about Dollars 1bn for the first eight months of 1991  - much of it underpinned by Soviet gas sales. Turkey's total trade with the world exceeds Dollars 20bn. Turkey plans to buy 4.5bn cubic metres of gas in 1992 from Soyuzgaz. But officials in Ankara are keen to conclude deals with Iran and Qatar in case of uncertain Russian supply. A Russian official said Black Sea co-operation would help 'regulate a situation which could otherwise become very messy'.</p>

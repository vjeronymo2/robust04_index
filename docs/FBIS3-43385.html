Army tanks returned fire against  opposition militiamen who fired machine guns around the national  television building and the Saint Exupery school in  Brazzaville's southwestern Bacongo district, the witnesses said.  A Malian national was killed in the crossfire as he passed by  the school on a motorbike, according to a hospital source,  bringing the death toll since early December to at least 95.    Calm had returned to the capital by midday Wednesday,  witnesses said, although public transportation was still  interrupted in the Bacongo district. Elsewhere in the capital,  security forces carried out search operations for illegal  Zairean immigrants, whom the government has accused of belonging  to the opposition militia.    Prime Minister General Joachim Yhombi-Opango said Wednesday  that the government would not use force against the civilian  population, but that the security forces would "render harmless  all marginals who have not understood the democratic process."  Addressing officers of the Brazzaville military garrison,  General Opango said a "systematic recycling" of President Pascal  Lissouba's personal security forces would be carried out.    The opposition coalition has complained on several occasions  that the president's security units were responsible for  violence in the capital.    General Opango called for more discipline among the army,  the  police and the gendarmerie, which he said must "remain  apolitical but obedient to civilian power." He also confirmed  the president's December 31 announcement that a recruitment of  army soldiers would be held "in all districts of the country in  order to purify its ranks."    Soldiers currently account for a mere 33 percent of army  personnel, with the rest comprising officers and  non-commissioned officers, the prime minister explained. The  last recruitment drive for the armed forces, which currently  total about 20,000 men, was held in 1983.    In the meantime, the opposition coalition announced that it  favoured the formation of a national union government to bring  an end to the country's political crisis. Opposition leader  Bernard Kolelas said in a statement that the new government  should be formed after the arbitration commission announces its  verdict on the contested results of the recent legislative  elections.    The commission is to publish its report on February 5.</p>

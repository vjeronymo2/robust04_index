			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> AFTER BIG VICTORY AT LEMOORE, SERVITE HAPPY TO BE AT HOME  </P> <P> After traveling 220 miles for a first-round game in the Southern California  Regional Division III basketball playoffs, Servite High School will be in its  cozy gymnasium in Anaheim at 7:30 tonight to play Corona del Mar in the  semifinals.  </P> <P> Servite (18-11) traveled to Lemoore, about 50 miles southwest of Fresno, for  the opening round Tuesday night and held on for a 57-55 upset of the division's  third-seeded team.  </P> <P> The Friars won despite missing the front ends of three one-and-one free throw  opportunities in the final 30 seconds. It also was missed free throws that cost  Servite the Southern Section 3-AA division title, when the Friars made only 13  of 27 in a 51-49 overtime loss to Estancia at the Bren Center.  </P> <P> The scene changes tonight to Servite's gym -- capacity: 950 -- where the Friars  have won six of seven games this season, losing only to Bishop Montgomery.  </P> <P> Estancia Coach Tim O'Brien, whose team split with Corona del Mar in Sea View  League play and beat Servite for the 3-AA title, called the game a tossup.  </P> <P> "Servite has a size advantage, but Corona del Mar may be a little quicker,"  O'Brien said. "Servite gets a big plus playing on (its) own home court. It's  going to be a low-scoring game. If either team scores over 50 points, it's a  shocker. A four-point lead will be a big lead in this kind of a game.  </P> <P> "Both teams have to feel fortunate to be where they're at after losing on  last-second shots in the CIF (Southern Section) title games. Servite will have  to start making its free throws in the clutch to beat a team like Corona."  </P> <P> Corona del Mar (20-10) advanced with a 67-65 victory over second-seeded San  Diego Lincoln as forward John Paulsen scored a season-high 30 points. Corona  del Mar outscored Lincoln, 10-4, late in the fourth quarter to overcome a 57-55  deficit.  </P> <P> In another Division III game:  </P> <P> Dos Pueblos (17-13) at Estancia (21-9): Dos Pueblos finished tied for fourth in  the Channel League and earned an at-large entry into the Southern Section 3-A  playoffs. Dos Pueblos defeated Corona del Mar, 39-38, on a last-second shot by  center Chris Gaines in the 3-A title game. Guard Ken Ardouin had 19 points in  Dos Pueblos' 72-46 victory over San Diego University in the first regional  game.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Estancia overcame a flat first half to beat Tulare Western, 90-61,  Tuesday. Estancia will be facing a height disadvantage but guard Agustin  Heredia has been a force in his past three games, averaging 29 points. Estancia  has made 46 of 55 free throws in its past two games.  </P> <P> In Division I:  </P> <P> Manual Arts (27-3) vs. Mater Dei (31-1) at Chapman College: Manual Arts won its  first Los Angeles City Section title since 1981 with an 84-72 victory over  Crenshaw in the title game. Guard Marcel Capers averages 16 points and 11  assists a game and had 15 points in a 73-72 victory over Bakersfield in  Tuesday's quarterfinals. William Celestine, a 6-5 senior center, averages 12  rebounds and five blocked shots.  </P> <P> Mater Dei got its 23rd consecutive victory by beating North Hollywood, 76-64.  Forward Andy Karich scored 26 points and made three three-point shots. Center  Derek Stone has been hampered by an ankle injury but teammate Charlie Andres  has picked up the slack, scoring 23 points and getting 14 rebounds in two  games. Andres had 15 points and 14 rebounds in Mater Dei's victory over Loyola  in the Southern Section 5-A title game.  </P> <P> In Division IV:  </P> <P> Laguna Beach (23-6) vs. Santa Clara (25-0) at Ventura College: Coach Ed Bowen  led Laguna Beach to a 58-54 victory over Santa Clara 28 years ago for the  Southern Section 1-A division title at Oxnard High. "They had won three  straight 1-A titles when we went up there and beat them," Bowen said. "I'm  revved up to play them again. I think they're as good as any team around,  including Mater Dei."  </P> <P> Santa Clara, behind forward Shon Tarver, has won 47 consecutive games since  losing to Edison in the Estancia Tournament in December 1988. Laguna Beach  guard John Trevino regained his shooting touch in a 71-37 victory over Coronado  Tuesday, making five of eight three-point shots.  </P></p>

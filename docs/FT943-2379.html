			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / US official pessimistic on health reform bill A senior US budget official warned yesterday that no healthcare reform bill was likely to pass through Congress this year. He stressed, however, that the need for reform had not gone away, writes George Graham. 'It obviously does not look like we are going to be successful this year,' said Mr Robert Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office. But he told a conference at Boston College that effective reform of the healthcare system remained essential in order to keep the cost of healthcare from continuing to erode US disposable incomes. The chances of completing such a large and controversial piece of legislation in the three weeks before the end of the present congressional session seem - as most observers see the matter - to be virtually non-existent.</p>

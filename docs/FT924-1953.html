			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Eurotrack down despite Spanish celebrations CELEBRATIONS in Spain after its weekend winnings at the Edinburgh EC summit, and an extension of last week's Swiss recovery were not enough to take the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index into positive territory, writes Our Markets Staff. Nervous selling in France, Germany and Italy carried more weight. PARIS featured the Total warning that 1992 earnings would be much weaker than the year before. The CAC-40 index lost 20.44 to 1,738.26 in turnover of FFr1.9bn. Total, down FFr6.7 at FFr227.30, said that the fall in full year earnings could be as much as 47 per cent but that the group would maintain the FFr7 dividend. The warning affected other stocks and Elf, which said last week that it expects a 35 per cent drop in 1992 net profit, shed FFr5.90 to FFr323.30. LVMH, down FFr60 at FFr3,434, continued to feel the effects of last week's gloomy forecasts from the UK drinks group, Guinness, in which it has a cross shareholding, as French brokers downgraded the stock. FRANKFURT digested a mixed bag of brokers' comments after last week's losses, and took its declines to a fifth straight day in thin trading. The DAX index ended down 6.26 at 1,469.75, its lowest for nearly two months, as turnover fell from DM4.9bn to DM3.1bn. Volkswagen and Klockner-Werke led the losers: VW said that it was planning 12 days of short-time working in the first quarter of 1993 and the steelmaker returned from suspension after filing for court protection from its creditors. VW touched a new 1992 low of DM238 before steadying to close DM6 down at DM241 on the session; it recovered further to DM243.50 in London. KW resumed trading after a one-day halt, dropping DM17.50 to a new 1992 low of DM41. Retailers weakened on less than spectacular pre-Christmas sales. Kaufhof dropped DM12 to DM479 and Asko by DM19 to DM656. In the construction sector, Bilfinger &amp; Berger lost DM23 to DM787 and Hochtief DM20 to DM920. MADRID improved strongly as a number of positive factors converged: November inflation figures showed a fall in the year-on-year rate from 5.2 to 5.1 per cent; there was reaction to Friday's cut in the reserve requirement for banks by the Bank of Spain; and satisfaction about the deal which Spain had achieved at the Edinburgh summit. The general index put on 3.20 to 215.53 in good turnover of some Pta15bn. Banks were in favour with Popular up Pta250 or 2.3 per cent at Pta10,950 and BBV by Pta55 to Pta2,465. Repsol was lifted as foreign institutions switched out of other European oil stocks, and closed Pta45 higher at Pta2,765. MILAN dropped on poor economic data and privatisation nerves. The three banks due for privatisation were the hardest hit as the Comit index fell 9.29, or 2.2 per cent to 413.52. BCI fell L267, or 6 per cent to L4,168; Credito Italiano dropped to L2,640, down L149, on the kerb and Banca di Roma was indicating L1,675 on the kerb after closing officially L146 lower at L1,740. Investors were worried that political infighting might impede the privatisation process. ZURICH extended last week's rally, the SMI index closing 21.7 higher at a new 1992 high of 2,015.3. Banks were mixed but SBC rose SFr6 to SFr287 on the attraction of its dividend yield; among pharmaceuticals, Roche certificates rose SFr30 SFr4,010 and, in foods, Nestle put on SFr25 to SFr1,115. AMSTERDAM saw DSM continue Friday's slide as the group confirmed that it plans to cut back production of polymers and the CBS Tendency index shed 0.7 to 104.0. DSM closed down Fl 3.40 or 4.5 per cent at Fl 71.40 while Hoogovens was 30 cents down at Fl 22.50 on worries over the European steel industry. BRUSSELS closed down for the fourth consecutive session as the Bel-20 index shed 3.91 to 1,112.65. Solvay, which had earlier hit a new 1992 low of BFr10,850, managed to recover just before the close to end BFr100 higher at BFr11,200. Petrofina, which said after the close that it may cut its 1992 dividend by 50 per cent from BFr421 in 1991, managed a BFr10 rise to BFr7,950. OSLO continued Friday's fall on profit-taking and the all-share index slipped 9.85 or 2.5 per cent to 376.07. Investors also remained uncertain whether the government's fiscal package to boost industry would be approved by parliament. The industry index was down 15.38 at 670.39, Norsk Hydro losing NKr4 to NKr150. Shipping lost 12.99 to 321.19 with Bergesen A losing NKr5 to NKr100 and the B shares down NKr5.50 at NKr100.50. STOCKHOLM was stronger with the Affarsvarlden index up 5.6 at 888.7 in turnover of SKr505m. The banking and financial sector reversed Friday's falls with S-E Banken A shares rising SKr1.50 to SKr11.50. Trelleborg B shares closed up SKr1.50 at SKr58.50. HELSINKI continued to fall on profit-taking after recent strong gains, the Hex index closing 15.9, or 1.9 per cent lower at 840.7. Bank and finance company shares declined by 4.9 per cent and the forestry sector by just 1.6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- December 14                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open         10.30       11.00      12.00  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1042.24       1041.74     1041.01    1041.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1117.09       1115.78     1114.69    1115.64  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00         14.00       15.00      Close  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1039.30       1039.16     1040.89    1041.18 FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1114.54       1113.97     1115.70    1116.33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 11    Dec 10     Dec 9     Dec 8     Dec 7  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1044.03   1049.63   1054.06   1051.12   1056.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1117.72   1123.58   1133.46   1135.64   1137.52  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1042.32; 200 - 1117.77 Low/day: 100 - 1038.85  200 - 1112.82  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / EC seeks US troops for 'safe areas' in Bosnia THE EUROPEAN Community yesterday called on the US and Russia to send troops to bolster an expanding United Nations-led effort to create 'safe areas' for refugees in eastern Bosnia. The call reflects a stiffening of European opposition to the Clinton administration's plans to arm the Bosnian Moslems and a determination to press ahead with economic sanctions to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign the Vance-Owen peace plan. The US, meanwhile, yielded to European pressure by announcing it was delaying a final decision about military action until after next weekend's Bosnian Serb referendum on the peace plan. It conceded this was because it had failed to persuade its European allies of the need for more immediate action. Mr Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the US believed stronger measures were necessary on Bosnia. But the US was 'looking to reach agreement with our allies on the steps that we can take together'. During a diplomatic mission to Europe last week, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, made no secret that the US favoured arming the Bosnian Moslems to the riskier course of direct US military intervention. The latest EC initiative - seeking US and Russian troops to bolster a 'safe areas' effort - may therefore be seen as an attempt to sidetrack the military options. During a meeting of EC foreign ministers in Brussels, the Europeans played down differences with the US over the Bosnian conflict. Ministers declared that all options, including military, remained open; but they soon showed a desire to seize the diplomatic initiative from Washington. Mr Alain Juppe, French foreign minister, won support for his view that the recent split in Serb ranks over the Vance-Owen plan was a significant development, resulting from sanctions on the Serbian regime headed by President Slobodan Milosevic. Ministers agreed it was necessary to test Mr Milosevic's pledge to seal the border with Bosnia, possibly by sending EC civilian observers as part of an international group to see if economic supplies such as fuel and spare parts were filtering through to the Bosnian Serbs. Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday accused their former patrons in Belgrade of stopping them from leaving their self-styled state, saying Serbian police had refused to allow them to cross the frontier. But the EC proposal likely to draw most attention is the French idea to renew invitations to the US - along with Russia and other big powers - to join the UN-led international peacekeeping effort in Bosnia. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, said he welcomed the French plan, which aims to put teeth into the UN resolution to protect Moslem refugee enclaves encircled by Serbian artillery. French officials said the plan was to use US, British, French and Russian forces to enter safe areas for the Moslems, raising the stakes for Bosnian Serbs. Mr Juppe commented: 'They will think twice before attacking (these areas).' The Clinton administration has remained wary of agreeing to send US ground forces until the warring parties commit themselves to the Vance-Owen plan and a ceasefire is in place. A senior UK official, noting that the Europeans, particularly the British and French, have already put troops in place to assist in humanitarian operations, said: 'There is always a different view among those people who are on the ground and those who are spectators.' During the Brussels talks, EC foreign ministers dismissed the Bosnian Serb referendum as a stalling device. Ministers also condemned the latest outbreak of violence against Moslems in central Bosnia, laying the blame with the Croats. Ceasefire agreed, Page 2</p>

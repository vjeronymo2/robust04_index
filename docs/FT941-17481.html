			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: International flows As for international flows, much depends on the behaviour of US markets. A striking aspect of last autumn's peak in the US bond market was that equities continued to gain. This could be natural for this stage of the cycle. If the bond market is rattled by the pace of the recovery, that should be positive news for corporate earnings and therefore equities. If the UK follows this pattern, equities should start outperforming gilts again once a firm economic recovery brings a halt to base rate declines. Yet the UK is much more dependent on international flows than the US, and the risk remains that a market upset there will cause US investors to retrench across the board. They, too, have been seeking to escape low returns on cash, but even cash becomes attractive when other markets are falling. With luck, the Federal Reserve will tighten just enough to preserve the recovery while protecting the bond market from long-term inflation worries. Such a soft landing would allow other markets to continue upwards. But it requires delicate judgment as regards the timing and amount of any interest rate rise. One false move and the reverberations would be felt across the world. Then even the UK's relatively good economic prospects would not protect its equity market from sharp correction.</p>

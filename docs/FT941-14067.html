			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): LVMH depressed in Paris after announcement Individual stories predominated in yesterday's trading, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was preoccupied with LVMH after the group announced that it was to rejig its cross shareholding structure with Guinness of the UK. Under terms of the announcement the UK group will sell its 24 per cent indirect stake in LVMH and take a 34 per cent direct stake in Moet Hennessy. The group also said that it expects the changes to give it a cash pile of some FFr11bn. LVMH closed down FFr138 or 3.4 per cent at FFr3,899, after a low of FFr3,635; and those of associated groups Bon Marche and Christian Dior lost FFr47 and FFr30 respectively to FFr735 and FFr360. The CAC-40 index shed 16.86 to 2,257.81 in turnover of some FFr5.3bn. FRANKFURT closed lower in directionless trading although traders were not surprised by the Bundesbank's decision to leave interest rates unchanged. The DAX index fell 18.18 to 2,116.20. Turnover was DM9bn and in the post-bourse the Ibis indicated index lost a further 34.2 to 2,098.36. Metallgesellschaft, fell DM7 or 3 per cent to DM237.50 and after the official close announced that it would, in the medium term, become a management holding company with three operating divisions: trading, chemicals and plant construction. Elsewhere, activity was generally muted although Continental managed to go against the trend, adding DM2 to 262. AMSTERDAM retreated moderately as the large multinational groups were affected by a slightly weaker dollar. The AEX index slipped 2.35 to 424.98. DSM retreated Fl 1.60 to Fl 109.10 on further investor worries about its positioning in the petrochemicals sector, while Akzo was off Fl 2.90 at Fl 207.00. Fokker went slightly against the trend, up 90 cents at Fl 21.20, but off a high of Fl 21.80, as it announced that it had won an order to supply aircraft to the UK. ZURICH finished mixed after a volatile day. The SMI index fell 3.5 to 3,045.9. with today's expiry of the Soffex SMI index future producing some uncertainty. Nestle eased on sustained profit taking ahead of its announcement of sales figures for 1993. However, the shares picked up from a low of SFr1,316 to finish SFr10 easier on the day at SFr1,332 with the 5.4 per cent rise in sales proving at the upper end of expectations. Registered shares in Sandoz erased earlier losses to finish SFr30 to SFr4,180 on its announcement of a 4.7 per cent rise in sales during 1993. MILAN continued steady, the Comit index adding 0.36 to 617.71, although some heavy selling was seen late in the day. The insurers were marked down amid speculation that a decree which would see the sector reimbursed for some of their contributions to the state insurer, Ina, ahead of its privatisation, could be delayed because of the forthcoming election. Generali fell L769 to L38,090 and SAI was L573 lower at L17,564. Montedison edged L4 higher to L956. Continuing heavy volume of trading at 86.4m shares prompted speculation that the creditor banks might be shifting their holdings. MADRID pulled back after Wednesday's record close as profit-takers emerged. The general index shed 1.61 to 341.62. Banking stocks were hit hardest. Banco Central Hispano shed Pta75 to Pta3,205 and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya eased Pta50 to Pta3,045. Endesa remained firm, finishing Pta80 ahead at Pta7.940 after peaking at a record Pta8,100. WARSAW climbed to a new high but market analysts commented that they expected a correction ahead of the listing of Bank Slaski on Tuesday. The index rose 339.2 or 2.2 per cent to 15,420.8 in turnover of 3,400bn zlotys. ISTANBUL rose 5.7 per cent after falling for more than four sessions, as the currency stabilised against the dollar following recent volatility. The composite index ended up 1,520.28 at 27,024.86. ATHENS continued its correction for the second consecutive session with a fall in the general index of more than 3 per cent. The index ended at 1,132.11 in high volume of 4.7m shares.

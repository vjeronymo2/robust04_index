			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Increase in unfair dismissals is alleged EMPLOYERS are increasingly sacking staff just before they qualify for protection against unfair dismissal, the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux said yesterday. The association pointed to 'growing exploitation' of employees during the recession, reflected in an increasing number of complaints to bureaux on employment issues. Such complaints represent the third-largest category of enquiries dealt with by the service after consumer debt and social security. The association yesterday published a report on the problem and pointed to several cases which, it said, illustrated exploitation. A bureau in Oxfordshire reported a case of a man dismissed after 23 months and 3 weeks allegedly because he visited the toilet too often. Bureaux also reported an increase in employers unilaterally changing employees' terms and conditions, particularly in hours and pay. A bureau in Taunton reported a 17-year-old youth who worked part-time for a fast-food restaurant was dismissed because he objected to compulsory Saturday working. His sister, who also worked at the restaurant, was made full-time and expected to work 50 hours a week with no overtime pay. The association's report made several recommendations to restrict exploitation. It wants employees with six months' service to be able to claim for unfair dismissal. The current threshold is two years. At present full-time employees must have accumulated two years' continuous service before they can claim unfair dismissal. Part-time workers working between 8 and 16 hours a week have a qualifying period of five years. 'Without any doubt this lack of protection against unfair dismissal is the dominant theme in the hundreds of thousands of employment problems the CABs service deals with each year,' the association said.

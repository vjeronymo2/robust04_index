			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Second Phase of Negotiations to </F> Start"]    [Text] Upon his return from New York and Brussels,  Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  Foreign Minister Stevo Crvenkovski refuted any reports of an  alleged "Vance plan" for resolving the Greek-Macedonian dispute.  "We have worked together these past few weeks with Cyrus Vance  and Matthew Nemitz on a possible solution for the dispute, but  no final agreement has been reached thus far," Crvenkovski  stated. "We expect the second phase of the negotiations to  start in about 10 days or to reach some kind of an agreement in  the meantime." He expressed hope Cyrus Vance's efforts would  eventually result in reviving of the talks.    In regard to his meetings with various U.S. officials,  Crvenkovski said they have shown clear support of the  independence and territorial integrity of Macedonia and all that  is achieved by this small state in the course of the past two  years. He also pointed out the entire media in the United  States wrote in favor of Macedonia during his visit, condemning  at the same time the Greek embargo and behavior.    He said his meeting with the Western European Union  President  [WEU] van Ekkelen proved very useful. Besides discussing the  situation in the region, they have agreed in principle to  establish various kinds of cooperation between the WEU and  Macedonia.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At a meeting on September 14, 1989, RSPA updated THLPSSC on the status of the draft NPRM. Committee members discussed many issues, including product supply to customers, disposal of test water, and the time needed for compliance. Although no vote was taken, THLPSSC members representing industry indicated agreement with the need to test the older untested or inadequately tested pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RSPA has decided to adopt final rules in this proceeding despite THLPSSC's negative vote in 1988. RSPA did so because THLPSSC's primary concern was that the rules be cost beneficial, and the final regulatory evaluation supports that conclusion. Also, RSPA has addressed THLPSSC's other concerns elsewhere in this preamble in response to similar concerns raised by commenters. The THLPSSC's reports of the 1988 and 1989 meetings are available in the docket of this proceeding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Wording of Final Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The final rules are worded differently from the proposed rules. However, other than the substantive changes discussed above, the changes in wording are for editorial or clarification purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In several existing rules, the word ``hydrostatic'' or ``hydrostatically'' is replaced by ``pressure,'' because under subpart E carbon dioxide pipelines may be pressure tested either hydrostatically or pneumatically. Also, the title of subpart E is changed from ``Hydrostatic Testing'' to ``Pressure Testing.'' In &sect;&sect;195.304(b) (1) and (2), the word ``hydrostatically'' is not changed to ``pressure,'' because these rules concern factory testing of components, not post-construction pipeline testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule incrementally increases the current information collection burden under &sect;195.310. Section 195.310 requires operators to keep certain records of each test required by subpart E of part 195 for as long as the tested facility is in use. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved this increased burden under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended (44 U.S.C. chap. 35). The OMB approval number is 2137&hyph;0047.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rulemaking Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866. Therefore, it was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. In addition, the final rule is significant under DOT's regulatory policies and procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979) because it involves a substantial change in regulations affecting certain existing pipelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several operators and API suggested revisions to the draft ``Economic Evaluation'' RSPA prepared in support of the NPRM. Also, some of these commenters and others responded to our specific requests in the NPRM for information to aid us in assessing the impact of the final rule. How RSPA dealt with these comments is discussed in the final regulatory evaluation, a copy of which is in the docket. The final regulatory evaluation shows net benefits resulting from the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on the facts available about the anticipated impact of this rulemaking action, I certify pursuant to section 605 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605) that the action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because few, if any, small entities operate pipelines subject to part 195.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12612 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rulemaking action will not have substantial direct effects on states, on the relationship between the Federal Government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with E.O. 12612 (52 FR 41685), RSPA has determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

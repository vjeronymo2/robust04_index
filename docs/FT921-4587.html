			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Sansui in deal to swap equity for loans TWO companies linked with Macao casino magnate Mr Stanley Ho are to increase their shareholding in Sansui, the troubled Japanese consumer electronics group owned by Polly Peck International, the failed conglomerate of Mr Asil Nadir. However, the two companies, Grande Holdings and Semi-Tech (Global), have dissolved an arrangement under which they would have jointly acquired an interest in Sansui. Instead, they will hold their stakes separately. The two companies said the cancelling of their previous agreement would provide them with greater flexibility in monitoring their interest in Sansui and better suit their respective business strat-egies. The new arrangement means Semi-Tech will acquire between 19 per cent and 21 per cent of Sansui in return for a loan to the company of USDollars 30m. Grande has undertaken to provide a loan of USDollars 50m (Pounds 28.4m) as a requirement of the purchase of its 32 per cent. Collectively, the two companies will increase their interest in Sansui from 32 per cent to more than 50 per cent. The amount of equity they will own depends on the outcome of a plan by Polly Peck's administrator to sell a 49.1 per cent interest in Sansui's Italian subsidiary, the Imperial Group. Sansui recently reported unconsolidated losses after tax for the year to December 31 1991 of Y11.3bn (Pounds 49.8m) and net extraordinary losses of Y61.9bn.</p>

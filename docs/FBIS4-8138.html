			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Romanian President Ion Iliescu by Polish </F> Television representatives; place and date not given: "There Is  No Other Way But To Further Consolidate the Democratic  Organization of Society and Promote Economic Reforms and the  Transition to the Market Economy"]    [Text] [Reporter] Mr. President, a few months ago you  said that the atmosphere in Europe is more favorable toward  Romania. Would you still say that today?    [Iliescu] Yes, generally speaking I would say that this is  still valid today, despite the fact that new elements of tension  have emerged in Bosnia and Yugoslavia and that we are faced with  a tense moment in our domestic political life, linked to the  ongoing negotiations among the parties. However, regarding the  overall perception of Romania in Europe, I would say that my  assessment still applies.    [Reporter] What can you tell us about the internal  atmosphere currently prevailing in Romania?    [Iliescu] There are two elements. First, the difficult  situation of the economy and the people's social and living  conditions. There has been a general deterioration in the past  four years, due to the dismantling of the internal structures of  the former centralized economic system and the transition to the  market economy, which is a most complicated and difficult  process. Second, there is the international aspect of our  economic relations, characterized by the disappearance of our  traditional markets and of our traditional sources of energy and  raw materials. All this has created a very difficult situation  for our economy. To all this, one should add the external  sources of tension -- such as Yugoslavia, the former Soviet  Union, or the loss of the traditional markets in the Arab  countries, in the wake of the Gulf crisis -- and the general  world recession and economic crisis. All this has had a most  unfavorable impact on our economy. Right now, our industry only  works at half capacity, unemployment has become a widespread  phenomenon, with more than 1 million people out of a job, and  inflation is growing at an intensive pace. All this has led to  the deterioration of the people's living standard and is a  source of social tension and dissatisfaction for the population.  The second aspect refers to the political situation. After the  last elections, the Parliament has acquired a structure that  does not allow any party to have a majority and form a stable  government.    [Reporter] Does that mean that the government does not have  a majority in Parliament?    [Iliescu] It does not. The party that supports the  government only has 34 percent of the seats in Parliament. It  is the largest number of Parliament seats obtained by a single  party. Consequently, we tried to put together a coalition  platform after the last elections held in the fall of 1992. I  even suggested the creation of a national unity government, with  the representation and involvement of all political parties. At  that time, I thought that, in view of the difficult conditions  of the country, that initiative would have been useful and might  have constituted a political signal for the readiness of all  political forces to make a common effort. However, the  opposition parties did not accept my proposal. They wanted to  join the government, provided that they held the "levers of  power," as Mr. Corneliu Coposu, president of the National  Peasant Christian Democratic Party [PNTCD], said, that is, they  wanted to hold all instruments that would enable them to control  the power. But how can one control all levers if one does not  have the majority in Parliament? One must achieve certain  relations and understandings and even a coalition with other  parties. Consequently, we did not manage to form a coalition and  not even a political pact of all parties -- something that I  suggested at the time -- as a foundation and framework for  cooperation, as happened in Spain with the Moncloa Pact. Such  round tables and talks took place even in Poland and Hungary,  where a kind of political accord was struck among the political  forces there. But all these proposals were rejected and we were  obliged to form a minority government, which has always had to  perform some balancing act in order to promote the legislative  initiatives. In the past two-three months, I have tried to  initiate new dialogues with all political parties in this  respect.    [Reporter] How do you assess these dialogues?    [Iliescu] It was good, sincere, and open dialogue, and, what  is more, it was my dialogue with all the political parties. A  round table is now going on among the parties, since reaching an  understanding should be the result of consultations among the  parties. I am not a partner in political discussions among the  parties. I have only mediated this dialogue. The Social  Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR], which supports the  government, is now engaged in such negotiations. We will see  what the final result of these discussions is going to be.    [Reporter] What can you tell us about the trade unions?    [Iliescu] This is the second aspect of the problem. In  this climate of social tensions, the trade unions are obviously  very active and there have been movements, strikes, claims, and  so forth. However, I believe that all this has also had a  positive aspect. I have personally met with the representatives  of the three most important trade union federations and we  conducted a pretty civilized dialogue. They are now conducting  talks with the government representatives to finalize the  problem of the collective contracts for this year. There are  many claims, of which quite a few are pretty unrealistic, in  view of the real situation, but there are also certain positive  elements. The trade unions have declared their endorsement for  the Memorandum with the IMF, but at the same time they are  asking for social compensations that are not realistic in view  of our current possibilities. Therefore, all this should be  discussed and negotiated and I believe that such talks could be  held right now.    [Reporter] Who, in your opinion, holds the true power in  Romania?    [Iliescu] It depends on what you mean by that, since our  country is now organized on democratic bases and it has a  democratic Constitution, which includes all elements  characteristic of a democratic state. There are concrete  provisions in connection with the role of each element of power:  the Parliament, with its prerogatives, the government, as an  executive body, the presidency, as a mediating element between  the levers of power, and so forth. We have this scheme of our  country's organization and there is no concentration of power in  the hands of a single person or institution.    [Reporter] What do you think about the discontent among  Romania's population?    [Iliescu] It is a normal reaction. When a country's economy  collapses, you cannot improve living standards. It is obvious  that people are not satisfied with explanations alone, since a  popular revolt took place in Romania -- a social explosion which  characterized the Romanian revolution of December 1989 -- and  the most important reason for that revolt was the low level of  the living standard. Of course, everybody accepts the idea that  we have more freedom and democracy, but they are dissatisfied  with the fact that the living standard has not gone up. This is  obvious to everyone. However, we must take into consideration  the objective situation and openly discuss it: There is no  other way but to further consolidate the democratic organization  of society and promote economic reforms and the transition to  the market economy. But all this requires effort, work, and  social discipline as well as the acceptance of this reality by  everyone.    [Reporter] Is this your perception of the new democracy?    [Iliescu] I do not understand what you mean by that.    [Reporter] There are new democracies in all our countries,  in Poland, Romania, and the former Soviet Union. You said that  this is the road toward the new democracy, am I right?    [Iliescu] By new democracy -- since democracy has existed  before, in history -- I mean the existence of the new reality of  the state's democratic organizations, since we did not have  democracy before, in our country. It was the monopoly of a  single party, since we had a totalitarian regime here and a  dictatorship of a single family and single man. Hence, one  cannot talk of democracy in our country. Now, we have entered a  new stage of our development -- a democratic stage for the  Romanian society.    [Reporter] You once said that Romania is isolated in Europe,  but Romania is a member of the Council of Europe, it is the  first country that signed the Partnership for Peace scheme, and  so forth. Do you still maintain that your country is isolated in  Europe?    [Iliescu] I have never said Romania was isolated. This may  be the interpretation of others. We may be more or less pleased  with the level of our relations and links with other states of  international political forces, but I do not think and never  thought that Romania has been isolated in this period. There  is, of course, the issue of the range of our relations. Now,  this is another aspect, linked to the development of our  relations and the degree of trust extant on the continent. I  noted many similar expressions of discontent from many leaders  or political forces from Eastern or Central Europe in connection  with the support received from the West. Even Mr. Lech Walesa  has often expressed his discontent with Western support and the  West's real opening toward our countries, which are now going  through such a very difficult period of changes. Mr. Vaclav  Klaus, the prime minister of Czechoslovakia [as published] --  one of the countries with the best situations in this respect,  which has not faced the same difficulties as Romania -- is still  displeased with the climate of cooperation with the West. The  Western countries have developed a kind of protection screen  vis-a- vis our countries. I said that at a meeting of the World  Economic Forum held in Crans-Montana, last year: I said that  the last chance for the Western countries currently going  through an economic recession as well as for us is to open  economic relations between us and to grant each other mutual  support for the economic recovery in our countries.    This would be a chance for the West to overcome the present  economic situation. We will thus be able to say that we all  have the political strength to revise and inaugurate a new  philosophy and perception as well as a new understanding of the  economic relations among all the European countries. We have  overcome the "iron curtain" in political, military, and  ideological relations, but we are witnessing the raising of a  new economic curtain. We must overcome this situation, too, so  as to create better conditions for our economic relations, on  the basis of equal partnership. I said that, if the West looks  upon our countries only as a hinterland for the developed  countries and a potential market for their products and not as  equal partners, both of us will suffer. We must jointly build a  new community of equal partnership on our continent.    [Reporter] How do you see your integration in Europe's  political and cultural life?    [Iliescu] I believe that this will be achieved by life  itself, since all our countries are European and European  history and culture is the synthesis of all national cultures  and histories of all European countries. After a long  separation in two parts, we will have to build a new Europe, a  new united Europe, which can make use of all these assets and  all this patrimony of our culture.    [Reporter] What is your opinion about the relations between  Romania and Poland?    [Iliescu] I believe that we have a very good tradition of  relations throughout history and we can say that our countries  have gone through some very troubled times. Our nations have  had to suffer throughout history because of the great European  powers. We are situated in this part of Europe, where the  interests of three great European powers, which dominated this  region, met: the Ottoman Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire,  and the Russian one. For several centuries on end, we suffered  because of this foreign domination. In its turn, Poland did not  have a better situation either, since its geographical position  placed it between two large empires, the Russian and German one.  Therefore, there are many similarities between our destinies in  this respect. At the same time, there have been mutual  sentiments of solidarity between our countries during some very  difficult moments of our history and I can say that the Romanian  people have always nurtured sentiments of friendship, empathy,  and solidarity for the Polish people. I believe we should use  this tradition to the benefit of both countries. At this point,  we are going through similar difficult moments in our history,  since we are building the new structure of our democratic states  and an economy that must be efficient, competitive, and useful  for our nations. All this will be achieved with great efforts.  In these circumstances, our cooperation can be useful for both  our countries and I believe that we have a lot to do to improve  the cooperation between us. I believe that there is room for us  to make a greater contribution -- I am particularly referring to  the political forces and leaders of our countries -- to building  a network of cooperation in all respects, that is the political,  economic, social, cultural, scientific, and human spheres.    [Reporter] Who in Romania wants the return of King Mihai?    [Iliescu] You know, at this time of change, when we are  faced with great hardships, many people look back and think that  it was better in the past. We have all sorts of people struck  by nostalgia -- people longing for the near past, which is not  considered as having been democratic, but which provided greater  stability for the people and a kind of social protection; and  people longing for our country's pre-war past. The latter see  the monarchy as a solution for Romania, but I believe that we  should be looking forward, not backward. The only way for us is  to go toward the future, not the past.    [Reporter] What is your opinion about the nostalgia -- or  maybe we should call it empathy -- for Marshal Antonescu  [Romanian dictator during World War II]?    [Iliescu] Again, it has to do with people longing for the  past. Of course, we must write an objective history of our  country, since it has been deformed. Antonescu is a very  controversial figure. For some people, he was a hero, because  he led the country at a very critical moment, when our country  was threatened from the outside, after the dictatorship of King  Carol II was demolished and the fascist-Iron Guardist elements  came to power, with Antonescu's help. Antonescu was the savior  of the Romanian state at that time and he also took the decision  to liberate the territories occupied by the Soviet Union.  Therefore, he is considered a historical hero by some people,  who nevertheless ignore the fact that Antonescu was also an ally  of fascist Germany and of the Romanian fascists, with whose help  he took over power. They also disregard the fact that he pushed  Romania not only into the war against the Soviet Union, but also  against the coalition of democratic states, and that he is  responsible for that before history. However, there will still  be many controversies on this subject.    [Reporter] Is it possible to achieve unification between  Moldova and Romania and when will this happen?    [Iliescu] This is a matter of history. We have to take  realities into consideration. Of course, from a historical and  legal viewpoint, the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact was an erroneous  decision and measure that led to the domination of this part of  Europe by both fascist Germany and the Soviet Union. At the  same time, we must also take into account the circumstances of  the post- war period and the existing international documents on  the stability of borders and the integrity of the present  states. These are also realities that we must accept. One  should also take into consideration the emotional aspect, that  is the subjective sentiments referring to our history and  theories as well as the feelings referring to our fellow  nationals living beyond the country's borders. However, in  politics one should also take reality into consideration. The  same applies to Poland: The problem of territories that have  changed hands during history cannot be resolved only with  sentiments, but must be examined with great realism.    [Reporter] In your capacity as president of Romania, how do  you see your country's future?    [Iliescu] I see it in the only possible way one can see such  things, that is optimistically. We must preserve our hope in a  better evolution for our country and I believe that we have good  reason to do so. We have a good human potential, which  represents the basic element of the evolution of contemporary  society. Despite the difficulties facing us, I have trust in  our people's potential, creativity, and capacity to overcome all  difficulties and integrate Romania in the civilized world.    [Reporter] I wish you all the best. Thank you.</p>

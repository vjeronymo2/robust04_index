			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Tarmac redeems pref shares Tarmac, the construction group, yesterday redeemed its outstanding Dollars 150m redeemable preference shares. In addition, swap arrangements associated with the redeemable preference shares have been determined at an after tax cost of Dollars 27m (Pounds 18.2m). That figure, some Dollars 3m less than anticipated in the rights issue circular in September, will be treated as a distribution in Tarmac's accounts for the year to end-December. Tarmac's shares rose 5 1/2 p to 172 1/2 p.</p>

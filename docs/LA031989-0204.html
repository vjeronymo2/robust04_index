			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Regarding Riva Berger Tooley's review of "Passion and Prejudice: A Family  Memoir" by Sallie Bingham (Book Review, Feb. 19). In the following sentence,  the word "age" was mistakenly substituted for "rage." The sentence should have  read: "Most of the points that the jittery author tries to make about modern  society become obscured by her rage."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Umtata Jan 25 SAPA -- Pan Africanist Congress [PAC]  National Director of Publicity Waters Toboti on Tuesday warned  of chaos if he were to be suspended from the organisation for  speaking out of turn. He told Radio Transkei he had not been  told about his suspension, nor had he received any  correspondence on the matter.    The PAC on Saturday suspended three members -- Mr Toboti,  Central Transkei Regional Secretary Mfanelo Skwatsha and Azanian  National Youth League member Chargin Mabaso -- with immediate  effect for violating procedures by raising party issues with the  media.    Mr Toboti Said: "It is very easy to start chaos and  difficult to stop it. I don't want to participate in the death  of the PAC. If they suspend me then 'die poppe sal dans' ('the  sparks will fly')".    He said he had been tried and convicted by PAC Secretary  General Benny Alexander on the advice of "thugs". The PAC said  it would comment later on Tuesday.</p>

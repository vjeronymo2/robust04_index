			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney shares rally on injection report EURO DISNEY, the troubled leisure group, yesterday saw its shares rally following a report that Walt Disney, the US entertainment company which is its largest shareholder, is considering bringing in an investor to provide new capital. The shares, which have fallen sharply during the past two weeks, ended the day FFr1.50 higher at FFr57.50 following a report in the Los Angeles Times quoting Mr Michael Eisner, Walt Disney chairman, as saying that the company might introduce an external investor. However, Walt Disney said yesterday that Mr Eisner had been misinterpreted. 'All he said was that we were discussing many things with Euro Disney,' it claimed. Analysts were sceptical that Walt Disney would be able to find another investor willing to take a stake in Euro Disney, given the severity of the European group's financial problems. Euro Disney, which has net debt of FFr21bn (Dollars 3.56m), lost FFr1.08bn in its last financial year to September 30 and is expected to make a net loss of at least FFr1.8bn this year. It announced last month that it had been forced to ask Walt Disney for financial support while it attempted to negotiate an emergency financial restructuring package with its banks.</p>

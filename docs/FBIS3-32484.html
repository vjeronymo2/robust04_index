The Cuban leader asserted that such contacts contribute to a  better knowledge and understanding of the island's realities,  which is currently confronting the most complicated situation in  the history of its revolutionary process.    Alarcon's statements were made during a long news conference  attended by a large and heterogeneous group of media  representatives from Belgium and other countries. The news  conference covered issues related to the Caribbean nation.    Among the issues recovered were the elections held in Cuba  in  February 1993, the island's international relations, the U.S.  blockade, the possible commercial liberalization, and the  people's support for those measures.    The Cuban Legislative Branch president heads a delegation  that has been visiting Brussels since last Sunday. They have  kept a tight program of interviews and meetings with leaders of  the European Parliament, the Belgian Government, and parties and  political organizations.    At the news conference, the visitor considered that those  contacts will help promote Cuba's ties with the European Union  and its political and executive branches and with the Kingdom of  Belgium.    Today, Alarcon met with Leo Tindemans, head of the European  People's Party faction in the European Parliament. Later, he  attended a dinner in honor of the Cuban delegation which was  hosted by the Belgian Coordinator, an organization that furthers  the lifting of the U.S. blockade.    This organization has more than 45 local political  organizations that support Cuba and tomorrow, there will be an  event in support of the Caribbean nation at the Free University  of Brussels.

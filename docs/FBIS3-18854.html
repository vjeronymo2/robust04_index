			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [RITZAUS BUREAU report: "Movement in Faeroese-British </F> Conflict"]    [Text] The Faeroe Islands and the United Kingdom have  taken a step forward in their efforts to reach agreement on  where the demarcation line between the two countries is to be  drawn.    After a new meeting in Torshavn, David Anderson, the chief  British negotiator, said that the demarcation line dispute may  be resolved within a few months. Because of large oil finds in  the sea between the Shetland Islands and the Faeroes, it has  become extremely important to reach an agreement.    David Anderson said that he would prefer that the two  countries reach a negotiated settlement rather than the matter  ending up before the International Court in The Hague. He  believes that it will take months -- rather than years -- for  the two sides to reach agreement.    Faeroe Islander Arni Olafsson of the Danish Foreign  Ministry,  the leader of the Danish-Faeroese delegation, said that the  British negotiators have moved a little from their original  demand, but that it is still impossible to say whether a  solution will be found within the next year.    The Faeroes are demanding that the demarcation line between  the two countries be drawn according to the median line  principle, while Britain was originally demanding a demarcation  line deep within the Faeroese economic zone.    Two major British oil finds -- estimated to contain a total  of 1 billion barrels of oil -- close to the edge of the Faeroese  fisheries zone have made it particularly urgent to resolve the  demarcation line dispute.    After a decision in principle by the Lagting [Faeroese  legislative assembly] that the country intends to begin  activities in the oil industry, the Faeroes have put seismic  surveys up for bid.    According to oil experts, if oil is found in the Faeroese  mineral rights zone, the demarcation line dispute must be  resolved before actual oil production can begin.</p>

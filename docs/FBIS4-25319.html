			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Chinese Economic News" column] </F>   [Text] A few days ago, the Civil Aviation Administration  of China [CAAC] and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation jointly issued a circular stating that, in the  future, foreign businesses will be conditionally allowed to  engage in investment in and operation of the civil aviation  industry in China in line with the principle of placing state  investment in a dominant position.    According to the circular, it is stipulated that foreign  businesses are allowed to invest in the construction of airports  for civil purposes, including runways, taxi-ways, and parking  aprons. In these jointly-funded projects, more than 51 percent  of the authorized capital must be controlled by the Chinese  side, and such posts as chairmen of the boards of directors and  general managers must be taken up by Chinese personnel.    The circular states that foreign enterprises engaging in the  investment of airport flight area may, subject to approval,  expand their scope of operation appropriately to include  terminal buildings, cargo warehouses, ground services, aircraft  maintenance, hotels, restaurants, food and fuel supplies, and  other supporting projects of the airports. The air traffic  control system, however, will still be monopolized by the state,  and foreign investors are not allowed to be involved in either  investment or operation.    The joint investment by foreign businesses and Chinese  aviation and transportation enterprises will be conducted by  setting up Sino-foreign aviation and transportation enterprises  in the form of joint ventures or cooperative entities. Foreign  businesses may also buy shares of Chinese enterprises  specializing in air shipment, or both sides may hold shares  reciprocally. In these enterprises, shares held by foreigners  should not exceed 35 percent of the authorized capital, and the  rights of voting held by their representatives in the boards of  directors should not exceed 25 percent.    Apart from the stipulation that chairmanships of boards of  directors and general managers are to be assumed by the Chinese  side, other members of the management at and below deputy  general manager level may, if necessary, be selected and  appointed by the general managers. In terms of taxation,  foreign-funded enterprises will enjoy the same treatment as  similar domestic enterprises.    Foreign airport authorities and aviation manufacturers are  not permitted to set up aviation and transportation enterprises  in China. Foreign investors planning to set up joint-funded  aviation enterprises should obtain approval from CAAC first,  which should be further examined and approved by relevant state  departments. The operating activities of these enterprises  should be put under control and supervision of CAAC and other  administrative bodies of various regions.</p>

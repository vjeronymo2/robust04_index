			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Kalon increase to Pounds 18.8m Bucking the general trend in the UK paints market, Kalon, the paints group, again achieved sharp profits growth and increased market share in 1993 on turnover boosted largely by acquisitions. Under FRS 3, pre-tax profits jumped 77 per cent to Pounds 18.8m (Pounds 10.6m), though stripping out 1992's Pounds 2.62m exceptional charges - Pounds 1.56m for the abortive bid for Manders, then a rival paints maker, and Pounds 1.06m on the disposal of the chemicals division - reduces the advance to 42 per cent from Pounds 13.2m. Of the Pounds 18.8m profits, Pounds 4.82m came from acquisitions, mainly Novodec, the French private-label paints maker bought for Pounds 22m in February 1993. Turnover grew by 34 per cent to Pounds 142.4m (Pounds 106.3m) including Pounds 34.1m from acquisitions. There was a turnround in interest - from Pounds 660,000 receivable to Pounds 150,000 payable. Mr Mike Hennessy, managing director, said this was because of the debt acquired with Novodec, higher financing charges and lower UK rates. Cash balances stood at Pounds 10.2m at the year-end, against Pounds 12.3m. In the decorative division, where sales were flat at Pounds 96.1m and profits up 6 per cent at Pounds 13.5m, retail paint sales slipped 1 per cent in both volume and value terms, while the total market fell by 7 per cent. Trade paint sales rose 15 per cent in volume and 11 in value as the market fell by 4 per cent in value. Total market prices fell by 4 per cent as the DIY sheds engaged in aggressive promotional activity. Kalon said there was evidence this had abated and that prices were now more stable, though raw material prices were edging up. The opening of 12 more Leyland trade centres is planned for 1994, to make 87 in all. The aim is for a chain of 110. In the specialist products division, now called Vallance since February's acquisition of that company for Pounds 6.2m, sales were Pounds 6.5m and profits Pounds 500,000. Mr Hennessy said that total sundry sales were Pounds 25m-Pounds 26m with Pounds 19m paint-related. The Vallance-enhanced division is expected to have sales of about Pounds 18m-Pounds 20m next year, with total sundries sales of up to Pounds 40m. With the French market - where Mr Hennessy said prices were crazy - up 10.5 per cent in volume, Novodec rose by 19.5 per cent. The Leyland brand was launched into France last week coinciding with the opening of the first trade centre in Lille. Earnings under FRS 3 advanced 91 per cent to 9.88p (5.17p), or, otherwise, by 37 per cent from 7.2p. A final dividend of 2.9p makes at 4.2p total, up 31 per cent. COMMENT The inexorable rise of Kalon continues. And there is nothing in the tea-leaves to suggest that this progress will falter. This is good news for Mr Hennessy's now infamous and whopping triennial bonus scheme, now due. In private paints - a mature business, which Kalon had a big hand in developing  -it has done well in difficult market conditions; witness ICI's dour comments last week. Trade paints - a developing business, especially in France - did even better. Expect both organic and acquisition-led growth in Europe to build on the French progress. In sundries - a newish market worth up to Pounds 500m - Kalon has a lot to play for, while other territories in Europe offer the group opportunities to replicate what it has achieved in the UK and increasingly in France. Forecast pre-tax profits for 1994 are between Pounds 21.5m and Pounds 22.5m, giving a p/e of between 16.3 and 15.5, which is cheap.</p>

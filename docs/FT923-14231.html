			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Japan posts huge May trade surplus JAPAN POSTED another huge increase in its current account surplus in May, with the broadest measure of Japan's external trade balance rising by 128 per cent to Dollars 9.49bn (Pounds 4.96bn) compared with a year ago. The trade surplus alone, which excludes invisible items such as tourism, rose by 85 per cent to Dollars 10.09bn, putting Japan on course for a possible record trade surplus this year. The steep rise in the trade balance resulted from a 4.6 per cent increase in exports to Dollars 24.8bn and a 19.4 per cent decline in imports to Dollars 14.7bn. The sharp deterioration in imports will put increased pressure on the government to enact measures that will stimulate the economy and increase domestic demand. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, has told his counterparts at the Munich economic summit that Japan is committed to a long-term programme to boost domestic demand, and is considering measures to increase government spending by between Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn) and Y7,000bn in the autumn. The government said the steep fall in imports was accounted for partly by a Dollars 1.2bn decline in purchases of gold for investment purposes. Exports were boosted by strong automobile and ship sales. The trend towards a large trade surplus, however, was expected to continue because of the continuing weakness of the Japanese economy and the expected recovery in the US. The recent rise in the value of the yen also boosts the value of exports while reducing the value of imports, although in the long run it should, in theory, stimulate imports while making Japanese goods less competitive internation-ally. Japan was in May a net exporter of long-term capital, amounting to Dollars 1.89bn, for the second month in a row.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) The Budget (What It Means To You): Hardship fears for pensioners - How VAT on fuel affects low-income families Correction (published 18th March 1993) appended to this article. THE chancellor's an-nouncement yesterday that domestic fuel and power will be subject to VAT, at 8 per cent in 1994-95 and and 17.5 per cent in 1995-96, is a bitter blow for low-income families. With gas and electricity representing about an eighth of the weekly household expenditure of low-income groups, charities such as Age Concern warned that the increases would hit these groups particularly hard. 'This could lead to a lot of discomfort for pensioners - and ultimately a lot more cold-related illnesses,' a spokeswoman said. She pointed out that the proportion of the weekly bill spent by pensioners on fuel and electricity is twice that of the average family. Pensioners warned that rising fuel and power costs could lead to them cutting back on both food and heating. Mr Bill Jones, a Merseyside pensioner, who is living a few pence above the official poverty line said: 'This is going to cost us about a quid extra a week next year. Quite simply that's a quid less a week to eat with.' He spends about a sixth of his and his wife's weekly household income on gas and electricity bills. Although the chancellor promised that the increased cost would be partly met by extra benefits, Age Concern fears this will do little to soften the blow for about 2m pensioners who would qualify for income support. As Mr Jones points out, under current benefit regulations, any rise in benefits is offset by a reduction in housing aid to him and his wife. 'If they were to give us a Pounds 20 increase in benefit that wouldn't make a damned bit of difference because it would be cancelled out by what they would take from us on the housing benefit,' he said. The rent for their housing association house represents more than a quarter of their weekly expenditure. Meanwhile, families with children pointed out that children's health could also be particularly hard hit. 'This is going to hurt us even harder than if he'd put VAT on kid's clothes,' said Ms Val Roberts, a single mother, who is struggling to find work as a textile designer. Her last electricity bill for the last quarter alone was about Pounds 250 - a sum she finds difficult to meet out of the Pounds 70 she receives weekly from income support and family credit benefits. 'This news is just terrible. If you've got children you do need the heat on.' Dennis Knowles is a principal at Coopers &amp; Lybrand CORRECTION IN ONE edition of yesterday's FT, we referred to Bill and Margi Jones, pensioners in Merseyside, as having an income of Pounds 190 a week. This should have read slightly less than Pounds 130 a week.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Hackney Tosca THE LITTLE Opera Box company was originally formed to give open-air performances at stately homes for English Heritage, but recently it has discovered the Hackney Empire. That is a splendid Frank Matcham theatre, of exactly the right size; all it lacks is an orchestra pit. The company first tried out Don Giovanni there, with some success (and a minuscule, one-player-to-a-part band.) Now its Mozart is back in tandem with a new staging of Puccini's Tosca. For that, Fraser Goulding conducts a Wren Orchestra somewhat enlarged, but still a mere shadow of the composer's intended forces. The single woodwinds and lone viola and bass are eked out by a resourceful electronic keyboard (Alastair Young), which also fills in harp, organ, bells and drums. This served well enough, most of the time; but one felt for the soprano and tenor in their most intense passages, denied the trampoline that only full string-sound can provide. Those creditable singers were Bridgett Gill in the title role, and Donald Stephenson as her Cavaradossi: the one strong, forthright and sensible in her music, the other upstanding and musical - but his experience is largely in German and British operas, and the voice is not naturally geared to the shameless, heart-baring thrust of Puccini's phrases (Edmund Tracey's English text is used). Closer direction might have raised the dramatic temperature, which remained obstinately mild. The company seems to have a policy of asking singers to double as producers: just as its Mozart was directed by the Tosca Sacristan (Andrew Gallacher), so its Giovanni (Brendan Wheatley) staged the Tosca. This may be a defiant gesture against the Cult of the Producer, but the result - in Tosca, at least - looks no more than dim, honest routine. Terence Sharpe's Scarpia is a near-exception. He presents the villain straight, as a bloated, baleful toad, with none of the dandyish manners that most Scarpias like to affect. If his baritone can sound husky and colourless in recitative and in half-voice, it rose potently to the key moments. He had properly slimy henchmen in Alan Rankin-Crooks and Mark Hathaway; Ian Comboy gave the fugitive Angelotti some fugitive life, while the Sacristan semaphored broadly. At the end the appreciative Hackney audience cheered the goodies and cheerfully booed the baddies. That was the kind of production it was. For jaded regulars like me it was a lesson to hear the score delivered so competently, but without liquid Italian voices or the gloss of a big orchestra: no disguises for Puccini's mechanical sequences, nor his barely varied repetitions of the main motifs. Tosca must surely be ripe for joining the same musical category as several Romantic concerti: great vehicles for virtuoso soloists of feeling, but otherwise pretty silly.

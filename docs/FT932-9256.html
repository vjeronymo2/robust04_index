			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Land Securities in Pounds 140m bond issue LAND SECURITIES, the UK's biggest property company, yesterday raised Pounds 140m for new property investment through a convertible bond issue and announced a better than expected set of results for the year to March 31. Its net assets per share fell by 9.2 per cent from 555p to 504p, which was a less severe fall than most City analysts expected. Its pre-tax profits rose by 2.6 per cent from Pounds 227.5m to Pounds 233.4m, and it raised its dividend by 5.1 per cent, reinforcing its reputation as the most financially stable company in the UK property sector. The shares rose 6p to 551p. Mr Peter Hunt, chairman, was cautious about the outlook for the property sector, saying that the recovery of the property market had historically lagged the rest of the economy. However, he said that the valuation yields of Land Securities' central London offices had improved, following a surge in investment in the sector by overseas buyers. Land Securities said it would use the proceeds of its bond issue to 'finance property acquisitions as opportunities arose' and for general working capital. It said it intended to buy buildings with growth potential, primarily outside London. Net rental income rose by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 380.7m. But the value of the portfolio went down by 7 per cent to Pounds 4.1bn, which represents a yield of 9.9 per cent on current income. The company has tried to shift the balance of its portfolio towards properties with more growth potential, with the acquisition of retail and industrial property and the sale of over-rented central London offices. During the year, the company spent Pounds 179.5m on acquisitions and Pounds 57.6m on developments and refurbishments. It made sales of Pounds 127.7m. Since March 1988, the value of the portfolio's office content fell from 60 per cent to just under 45 per cent, retail increased from 39 per cent to more than 50 per cent and industrial and warehouse property increased nearly three-fold to nearly 5 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 32.62p to 33.68p. A final dividend of 16.55p per share was recommended, making a year total of 22.85p, 5.1 per cent. Lex, Page 18 Further details, Page 29</p>

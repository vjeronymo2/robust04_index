			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Grigsby and Robert Shrimsley: "Major To </F> Lead Poll Battle From the Front"]    [Text] Mr Major is to put himself at the forefront of the  Conservative local elections campaign in spite of the claim by  party tacticians that the polls will not be a referendum on his  leadership.    This high-risk strategy, which will see the Prime Minister  touring the country, will make defeat a personal humiliation for  him. But it in part reflects Tory strategists' belief that the  elections will not be quite as bad for the party as pundits have  predicted.    At a press conference to launch the Tories' campaign in  England, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, said Mr Major  would be touring all the main target regions, especially London  and the West Midlands.    "You will find him in the areas where the action is," said  Sir Norman. Mr Major and other ministers would be out on the  stump "in a way that is unprecedented outside a general  election."    Speaking on the day that large tax rises came into effect;  Sir Norman said: "What the Conservative Party wants to do is get  behind John Major and put an end to this fruitless and silly  talk about the leadership."    Mr John Gummer, the Environment Secretary, said: "One of the  joys of John Major is that once he gets out many people  recognise the kind of greatness of leadership which he gives us."    Mr Gummer said that contact with the voters was one of Mr  Major's greatest strengths.    "The more he is about, the more people talk to him, the more  people see him, the more they understand what he said that,  whether people are for him or against him, he will do what is  right for the country."    Sir Norman and Mr Gummer said the Conservatives would  concentrate on local issues. Mr Gummer refused to be drawn into  speculating about the places where the party might gain seats.    Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, has forecast  that Labour could lose 200 seats and that it could not  realistically hope to take Wandsworth or Westminster from the  Tories or Tower Hamlets from the Liberal Democrats.    Yesterday Mr Straw ridiculed Tory expectations for the  elections pointing out that three weeks ago ministers had openly  predicted victory in Birmingham. Since then they have lost a  council by-election in a stronghold ward.    While the Conservatives did badly outside London in 1990  when  the seats were last fought Sir Norman said that they had their  best result since 1982 in the capital.    This means that they have more to lose, including control,  or  leadership, of a number of London boroughs including Brent,  Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Kingston, Redbridge and Harrow. They  could also be under pressure in Barnet, Bexley and Bromley. All  seats are at stake in the 32 London boroughs and the Scottish  regional and island councils. A third of the seats will be  contested in the 36 metropolitan districts, 114 shire and four  Welsh districts.    According to a System Three poll for THE HERALD in Glasgow  today, Tory support in Scotland is still at rock bottom -- 13  per cent.    The party is now in fourth place behind the Liberal  Democrats, who remain on 14 per cent for a fifth consecutive  month.    Labour has dipped a point to 46 per cent to remain easily  the  dominant party, with the SNP [Scotish National Party] closing  slightly from 25 to 26 per cent.</p>

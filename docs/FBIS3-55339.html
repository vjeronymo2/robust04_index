			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Kuchina] </F>   [Text] Riga January 10 TASS -- The Russian Embassy in  Latvia sent a note to Latvian authorities on Monday protesting  against the blockade of Russian military facilities by Latvian  paramilitary units.    Vladimir Ionkin, the press secretary of the Russian Embassy  in Latvia, told ITAR-TASS that the militants detained two  generals -- Nikolay Tailakov and Anatoliy Vodopyanov -- who were  sent to the facilities by the commander of the Northwestern  Group of Russian Troops. They handcuffed them and drove in an  unknown direction. The generals were freed only after the  intervention of the Russian Embassy. The Latvian authorities  sent their apologies for the incident and assured the Russian  Embassy that the facilities were being unlocked.    Early on Monday a group of Latvian militants stopped a car  of  the Russian ambassador and refused to let it pass despite the  ambassador's protests. After long deliberations they allowed  the car to pass but waved their guns at it.    The Russian Embassy issued a protest to the Latvian Foreign  Ministry, describing the incident as a potentially dangerous  provocation. The embassy expressed the hope that the Latvian  authorities will take the necessary measures to prevent such  incidents in the future. The note considered the incident as an  attempt to thwart the talks on the troop withdrawal.</p>

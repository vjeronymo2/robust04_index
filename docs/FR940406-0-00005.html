			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Training_7 CFR 272.4(d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 322(a) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 amended section 11(e)(6)(C) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act (7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(6)(C)) to specifically require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training for case workers provided by the State agency convey the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> goals of and methods for promptly and accurately certifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible households. The interim rule amended 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 272.4(d)(1)(i) to reflect this statutory language. A commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not think it was necessary for the Department to instruct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies to include this ``function'' of the Program in their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training programs. As the Department explained in the preamble  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the interim rule, this language was added to the regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to emphasize Congressional concern in this area as reflected by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Law 100&hyph;435. The Department is adopting the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(1)(i) as final without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, pursuant to section 322(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interim rule added a new paragraph (d)(2) to 7 CFR 272.4 to allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies, at their option, to offer training and assistance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to persons working with certain volunteer or nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations. In conjunction with this new option, the interim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule added a new paragraph (f) to 7 CFR 277.4 to provide that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses (e.g., travel costs, lodging, or meals) of the persons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> working with the volunteer or nonprofit organization who receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this training and assistance would not be reimbursed. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter was concerned that the interim rule language appearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in 7 CFR 277.4(f) could be misinterpreted to mean that travel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenses of State employees who work with organizations that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive this training would not be allowable. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agrees that the language could create this misinterpretation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, this final rule amends the interim provisions at 7  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR 277.4(f) to clarify this distinction. The interim provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at 7 CFR 272.4(d)(2) is adopted as final without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Information for Low-Income Households_7 CFR 272.5(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 204(a) and (b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435 and 7 CFR 272.5(c) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim rule allow State agencies, at their option, to inform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income households about the availability, eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, application procedures and benefits of the Food  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stamp Program. Pursuant to section 204(b) of Public Law 100&hyph;435,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the interim rule also amended 7 CFR 272.5(c) to specify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State agencies, at their option, may request reimbursement under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7 CFR part 277 for these outreach activities. The interim rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained a number of conforming amendments necessitated by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of these outreach activity provisions. 7 CFR 272.5(c)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was amended to specify that if a State agency elects to request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reimbursement for Program informational materials directed at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> low-income households, those materials must meet any applicable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bilingual requirements. 7 CFR 272.5(c) was further amended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require that prior to claiming such outreach costs, State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies must receive approval from the Food and Nutrition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service (FNS) of an appropriate amendment to their State Plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operations. In addition, 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) was amended to add a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference to the optional ``Program informational activities plan''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a component of the State Plan of Operation, and 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 272.2(d)(1) was amended to add the requirement that State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies submit the optional ``Program informational activity''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> planning document to FNS for inclusion in their State Plan of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Operation. Lastly, the interim rule added a conforming amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to 7 CFR part 277, appendix A, to remove paragraph C(14) which was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made obsolete.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter felt the requirement of 7 CFR 272.2(a)(2) which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mandates that State agencies submit a Program informational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities plan is burdensome. The commenter suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> budget justification contained on the form FNS&hyph;366A should be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sufficient to obtain the prediction of expenditures. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department disagrees. As State agencies begin to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outreach under Public Law 100&hyph;435, the Department wishes to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sure that controls are in place that ensure cost-effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spending. The plans provide important information on the kinds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of activities and services being planned as well as the sub-populations at which State agencies are targeting their efforts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having this information and the budget projection data will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enable the Department to assist State agencies in developing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most cost-effective outreach programs possible. Therefore, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule adopts the interim provisions pertaining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information for low income households as final without change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

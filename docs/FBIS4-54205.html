			<p>BFN     [Text] The government on 25 May decided to take firm  measures in conjunction with the United States and the UN  Command against North Korea's attempt to establish "the Korean  People's Army representative mission at Panmunjom," under the  assessment that its intent is to incapacitate the Military  Armistice Commission [MAC] as well as to conclude a peace  agreement with the United States through direct negotiations.    That day, the UN Command announced that it plans to ask  North  Korea to hold a senior secretaries' meeting of the committee at  the earliest possible date to discuss the issue.    Assessing the current attempts of North Korea as being  driven  by the hidden intention to disperse the international concern  focused on the issue of nuclear inspection, the government  decided to inform North Korea of its stance through a UN Command  channel rather than taking a formal government-level reaction.    Regarding this, a government authority said: "The issue of  substituting the present system of the Armistice Agreement,  including the replacement of the Armistice Agreement, should be  resolved independently by the North and South, the parties  concerned. This corresponds with the spirit of the North-South  Agreement," and added that "the North side should sincerely  abide by the Armistice Agreement and normalize the MAC at an  early date."</p>

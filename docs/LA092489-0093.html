LIBERAL VIEWS THAT CREATE RESENTMENT BETWEEN RACES'  </P> <P> Come on, Feiffer -- your Sept. 17 cartoon is so anti-white and racist it's  pathetic.  </P> <P> It's people like you who have the opportunity to express your liberal views  that create so much resentment between races.  </P> <P> Your cartoon was out of line to state "any black who's famous we love, any  black who ain't we kill."  </P> <P> Does The Times really pay you for this type of trash?  </P> <P> HELEN PENNINGTON  </P> <P> Port Hueneme  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'ROAD GANGS' ARE ON THE RIGHT TRACK  </P> <P> Re "On the Road Gang," July 22): I was most impressed.  </P> <P> For years I have wondered why the various governmental agencies have failed to  take advantage of incarcerated individuals and put them to work on something  that needed to be done in the public sector.  </P> <P> Your article demonstrated that someone is really taking advantage of a resource  and applying it to a public need. The best part is that those doing the work  are more than impressed that they don't want a repeat of the sentence. They're  reminded of it many times a day for many days, as they are grubbing in weeds,  picking up trash and using the portable johns.  </P> <P> R.V. JESSUP  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

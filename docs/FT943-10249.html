			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Ecuador airline to be sold The Ecuadorian government announced the sale of a 75 per cent share in the state airline, Ecuatoriana, following nearly a year of indecision that left the financially troubled airline grounded. The government has now pledged to assume the airline's debt portfolio, which exceeds Dollars 100m. The transformation into a stock company will take place in weeks. Ecuatoriana's routes to destinations throughout North and South America may attract investors. The only remaining company-owned aircraft was confiscated by creditors nearly eight months ago and since then has been stranded in Panama. Nearly all the airline's staff had been sacked, leaving only some 50 employees.</p>

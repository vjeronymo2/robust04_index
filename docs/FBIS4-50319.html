			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Martin Lee, legislative councillor and chairman </F> of the United Democrats of Hong Kong: "Dump This Colonial  Baggage"]    [Text] Governor Patten enjoys a widespread reputation as a  champion of press freedom. He has given numerous speeches  around the world on the topic, at one recent lecture in Dublin  declaring, "it would be the most seedy of betrayals" for  broadcasters such as Rupert Murdoch and Ted Turner to appease  China by self-censoring for reasons of commercial expediency.    But back in Hong Kong, it is a different story. Governor  Patten has consistently resisted calls from the Hong Kong  community to strike from Hong Kong's law books the draconian  colonial statutes which could be used to muzzle Hong Kong  journalists after 1997.    Hong Kong's colonial legacy means that our statute books  contain an array of repressive colonial-era laws -- laws that  permit the colonial government to stifle press freedom and free  expression in the name of public safety or good relations with  other countries. With three short years until the transition of  sovereignty to China, these anachronistic laws now constitute a  major threat to our rule of law and freedom.    Colonial laws are not meant to protect rights, but to  restrict them. As has been the case in almost all colonies --  where the government is not chosen by the democratically  established consent of the governed -- the laws are designed  principally to give whatever powers the government may need to  control the local population.    There is already ample evidence that China will try to  transfer its system of press controls to Hong Kong, as seen in  China's recent treatment of Hong Kong journalists. Would it  not, then, be the most seedy of betrayals for Governor Patten to  fail to remove the most unfair vestiges of colonialism -- those  laws which can be used to repress free speech and a free press?  Soon after Mr Patten was named Governor, the Hong Kong  Journalists' Association [HKJA] presented to him a list of the  17 most repressive colonial-era laws, including the Emergency  Regulations Ordinance, the Official Secrets Act, the Crimes  Ordinance (dealing with treason and sedition), the Summary  Offences Ordinance, the Police Force Ordinance and the Public  Order Ordinance. These laws, among others, contain  breathtakingly broad powers to crush freedom of expression and  authorise censorship of all media.    A closer look at the Emergency Regulations Ordinance --  dating from 1992 -- illustrates the threat colonial laws pose to  Hong Kong people's freedoms. The law reads: "On any occasion  which the Governor in Council may consider to be an occasion of  emergency or public danger he may make any regulations  whatsoever which he may consider desirable in the public  interest."    The menace to press freedom is clear: the first power the  statute grants to the executive branch is the blanket authority  to censor the press and to issue regulations for "censorship,  and the control and suppression of publication, writing, maps,  plans, photographs, communications and means of communications".    Moreover, this power to declare an emergency is so vague and  arbitrary that Governor Patten could wake up on the wrong side  of the bed tomorrow and declare a state of emergency.  Presumably he won't, but I do not need to point out the scope  for abuse this law will present after 1997.    Governor Patten promised to give the Emergency Regulations  Ordinance and the rest of the HKJA list urgent attention. That  was well over a year ago. To date, only three of the 17 most  egregious laws have been amended -- the Broadcasting Authority  Ordinance, the Television Ordinance and the Telecommunication  Ordinance. All of the other laws remain in effect.    The Governor's cavalier attitude towards press freedom is  further reflected by the fact that he still continues to resist  the numerous calls from the local community to establish an  independent Human Rights Commission, and opposes an Access to  Information Bill which would promote a truly open and  accountable government. The Government also rejected my request  to amend the Film Censorship Ordinance which allows films to be  censored on the grounds of "damaging good relations with other  territories" -- a provision used as recently as last January to  challenge the Foreign Correspondents' Club showing of a BBC  documentary about Mao. Because of the Government's refusal to  act, I will move a private member's bill later this year to  amend this colonial law.    Although Hong Kong is currently the freest society in Asia,  since 1989 Hong Kong people have been all too aware of how  fragile a commodity freedom is. In Hong Kong we assume that the  rule of law means laws that protect our rights, freedoms and way  of life. But when the laws themselves are bad, our freedoms are  in great danger.    Thus far, these anachronistic laws restricting press freedom  have not been widely abused because of the link to the UK's  parliamentary democracy. While the colonial government is not  accountable to Hong Kong people, it is accountable to a  democratically elected British Parliament some 13,000 kilometres  away. That is, if the Hong Kong government were to behave  irresponsibly, heads could conceivably roll in Whitehall. But  even this system of accountability once-removed will be removed  along with the Union flag on June 30, 1997.    Whatever trust we put in the integrity of Hong Kong  judiciary, judges must apply the law, and if the laws censor the  press, even the best judge would have to rule as the law  dictates. Clearly, if many of our draconian colonial laws  remain after 1997, they will be legitimately available to later  government officials to gag Hong Kong reporters.    The Singapore Internal Security Act is a sad case in point.  This statute was left on the books when the British colonial  administration departed from Singapore. Since that time, the  Singapore government has used this law to suspend civil  liberties and detain Singapore citizens indefinitely without  trial.    Francis Seow, the former head of the Singapore Law Society,  ran up against the Internal Security Act when he was punished in  the name of public safety for disagreeing with the Singapore  government. However ironic, the Singapore authorities can  effectively silence their critics by pointing out that since the  Internal Security Act was left by Britain -- a Western,  democratic country -- it would be a double standard to suggest  Singapore should not use this law as well.    Indeed, if we look around the region, the British colonial  administration has a lousy track record of leaving such laws in  the wake of a departure from former colonies. Malaysia, another  former colonial holding, has a statute similar to the Internal  Security Act which is also used to detain people for exercising  their political rights.    The draconian laws on our statute books are like land mines.  Like Singapore, Beijing will be only too happy to inherit these  repressive colonial laws. It would be a great tragedy if  Governor Patten and the colonial government are allowed to  repeat this mistake in Hong Kong, the most successful British  colony. Hong Kong people will suffer if these statutes are then  used to lock up offending reporters or to stifle political  dissent. Yet this is the course the British Government has set  in refusing to expunge these laws from our legal system.    It is not enough for Governor Patten simply to lament the  sad  state of press freedom in Hong Kong. This is an executive-led  government, and the executive has the power to introduce bills  to amend or repeal these laws. But his government has not taken  action thus far for much the same reason his colonial  predecessors long shut the door on Hong Kong people's legitimate  democratic aspirations: fear of offending China.    Especially in light of the obvious implications of the  arrest  of Xi Yang and other journalists, there can be no further  justification (if indeed there ever was) for the Government's  foot-dragging on reforming the colonial laws so open to abuse.    All our rights and freedoms are interlinked. Once press  freedom is gone, none of our other freedoms -- including our  free market and our free enterprise system -- is safe. Thus the  obligation to repeal these colonial laws and set up democratic  institutions to protect freedom is not just an administrative  responsibility. It is also a moral one. It would be the height  of hypocrisy for Governor Patten to leave Hong Kong with the  knowledge that he has left in place the means to stifle our  spirit of freedom.    Governor Patten, for all his oratory on the virtues of free  expression, is on the verge of leaving behind a set of laws  under which Hong Kong could have a bleak, Orwellian future.    Unless the Governor and his administration take immediate  action it could yet be the ultimate irony that after 1997,  Governor Patten's fine speeches on press freedom are banned in  Hong Kong under colonial laws he himself left in place.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Position of Labour's Scots MPs questioned - Devolution A PASSING remark by Mr Robin Cook has once again raised the political quandary posed by Scottish MPs being able to vote in Westminster on English and Welsh issues. Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has written to Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, asking whether 'the Cook doctrine' would inevitably apply to other opposition frontbenchers. The question resurfaced in a BBC Scotland programme on Friday when Mr Cook apparently ruled out continuing as health secretary once the Scottish parliament, pledged by Labour, was set up. Last night Mr Kinnock's office tried to defuse the issue with a statement stressing that the constitutional position would allow him to continue to choose his cabinet from among all elected MPs once a Scottish assembly was set up. Mr Cook's remarks were said by colleagues to reflect a personal rather than a party position. The Conservatives, however, indicated that they would continue to press Mr Kinnock on the issue - dubbed the 'West Lothian question' after it was raised by Mr Tam Dalyell, then MP for the now disbanded constituency. In his open letter to Mr Kinnock Mr Lang claims other Labour MPs who would be affected include Mr Gordon Brown, trade and industry spokesman, about five mid-ranking frontbenchers and Mr John Smith, shadow chancellor. Each of these, he argues, would be wielding powers in England on aspects of government business that Labour intends to devolve to the Scottish parliament. Mr Lang goes on to ask whether Labour's Scottish MPs would be excluded from all main departments of state or whether they would be allowed to hold only all-UK portfolios such as foreign affairs, defence and energy. 'If the latter, does not this limit the prospects of your English and Welsh colleagues occupying such posts,' asks Mr Lang. At the weekend Mr Bryan Gould, Labour's environment spokesman, partially tackled the question by hinting that the creation of English regional assemblies would help resolve the problem.</p>

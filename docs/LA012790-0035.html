			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATC FUNDING  </P> <P> Re Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's opposition to continuation of major city  subsidies for the Los Angeles Theatre Center, quoted in "Stage Watch" on Jan.  11:  </P> <P> Mr. Yaroslavasky: How about a half-cent arts tax on corporate earnings in Los  Angeles to fund the theaters? How about collecting the outstanding major  pollution infraction fines and earmarking them to fund the theaters? How about  suggesting alternative measures to fund the theaters?  </P> <P> Yes, there are people sleeping in the streets, but funds to help them should  not come from the arts and culture budgets. Theaters enhance the quality of  life; LATC is one of L.A.'s few professional theaters. We need more, not less.  </P> <P> DAVID ELLENSTEIN, Los Angeles  </P></p>

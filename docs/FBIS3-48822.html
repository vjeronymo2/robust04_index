The dissolved branches have more than  1,000 PBS members who have accused him of failing to develop the  constituency. The dissolution of the branches was confirmed by  (Bonong Mulung), a PBS official in Bengkoka. Members of the  dissolved branches were disappointed with PBS leaders who had  refused to listen to their views.    Meanwhile, (Tayu Memayu), a PBS member of parliament who  decided to quit the party said his main reason for quitting was  that the PBS would not be able to lead the state and promote a  multiracial society in Sabah. He said PBS leaders have always  given priority to one ethnic group only, adding that this would  worsen the state's racist policy. People now believe that if  PBS is returned to power, the hope for an economic recovery in  Sabah will be dashed.</p>

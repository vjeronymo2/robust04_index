			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] [Unidentified correspondent] First of all, President  Izetbegovic analyzed the latest agreement on the Bosniak-Croat  federation and the Contact Group's communique in Geneva.  Speaking at a news conference in Sarajevo about the  Bosniak-Croat agreement, President Izetbegovic stressed:    [Izetbegovic] "What we are interested in is their urgent  implementation [sentence as heard]. We will not allow the  dynamics of their implementation to be slowed down. We will try  to speed up their implementation and remove obstacles in the way  of achieving this.    ``Regarding other things, I can only restrict myself for the  moment to talking about the problem of whether or not to go to  these talks--something referred to in yesterday's communique--we  will go to these talks. We believe that a refusal to go to the  talks will be an own goal and will only help the aggressor to  continue waging the war and shift the blame on to us. We are  not for war but for peace.    ``As for the talks, of course--this is not a  precondition--but we expect and demand that in the meantime, in  the next few days, the problem of Gorazde be resolved in keeping  with the NATO pact ultimatum and the corresponding resolutions.  Above all, I am thinking of the withdrawal of Serb soldiers  from the three-kilometer zone. This is not a precondition for  attendance at the talks, but unless this happens, we believe  that this must be fulfilled--of course this is not a  precondition, this is a matter of carrying out of an earlier  decision that was not fully respected and that brings into  question the credibility of the international community, and of  course brings into question the justification and the reason for  organizing any conference or making any decisions if the  decisions cannot later be implemented."    [Correspondent] Dwelling on yesterday's communique by the  Contact Group, President Izetbegovic drew attention to both its  positive and negative points.    [Izetbegovic] "Positive--because we are persevering in  maintaining the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina and its survival  within the internationally recognized borders. Positive--also  because it advocates aid for reconstruction once peace is  established and furthermore, because it advocates resolve for  the implementation of the existing UNSC resolutions, the  continuation of humanitarian aid deliveries, and the free  passage of convoys, while refusing to meet the demand of the  Serb side to abolish the sanctions before the negotiations begin.    ``The bad points of this communique--not to say negative--we  see because it mentions Bosnia-Herzegovina as a union. As you  know we have opted for a federation. It also mentions the  notorious 51-49 percent division [words indistinct]. At the  same time, there is a certain degree of readiness in the  communique to gradually abolish the sanctions.    ``Finally, as far as the cessation of hostilities is  concerned, we are thinking of a temporary cessation and in our  opinion a four- month period is too long. A two-month period  would be quite sufficient if a political resolution is desired.  A four-month period is unacceptable."</p>

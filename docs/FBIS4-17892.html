			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Zelenin and Oleg </F> Velichko]    [Text] Damascus, 27 Apr -- Oleg Soskovets, Russian first  deputy prime minister, who is here on an official visit, and  Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Talas, today signed an agreement  on military-technical cooperation.    After the signing of the document, the Russian first deputy  prime minister said that the Russian president considers it  essential to resume cooperation between the two states that has  been partially lost of late. The signing of today's agreement,  Oleg Soskovets noted, shows the desire of Moscow and Syria to  engage in systematic cooperation in the military-technical  sphere.    Mustafa Talas appraised the agreement as "a first step in  the  right direction." He expressed the need for a restoration of  the former relationship with Russia. In this respect, he  particularly emphasized that Damascus "has strong friends in  Moscow." "The agreement signed today is evidence of this," he  said.    As for the essence of the document, an ITAR-TASS  correspondent was told by a well-informed source in the Russian  delegation that it is evidence of the beginning of a new  relationship. The two sides agreed to form a working  commission, which will set about its work in a few weeks' time.    Today, too, Oleg Soskovets had a three-hour meeting with  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. According to the deputy prime  minister, the Syrian head of state supported the main positions  in the agreement on military-technical cooperation.    After the signing of the agreement, Oleg Soskovets left by  air for Moscow.</p>

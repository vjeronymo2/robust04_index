			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Swedish outlook good, says PM The campaign for next month's Swedish general election moved up a gear yesterday as Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, issued a spirited defence of his coalition government's record, saying its market reform policies had to continue if Sweden was to achieve 'stable and high' growth rates for the rest of the decade. The four government parties, led by Mr Bildt's conservative Moderate party, trail the opposition Social Democrats in the opinion polls and are handicapped by record unemployment, a record budget deficit and the fastest-growing public debt in the developed world that together have cramped growth forecasts. But Mr Bildt, presenting a 100-page summary of the right-centre coalition's three-year term in office, insisted the government had paved the way for a return to economic growth after three years of recession. 'All the curves that pointed the wrong way in the autumn of 1991 now point in the right direction again,' he declared. 'Exports are growing, so is industrial production. Unemployment is going down again, as is the deficit in the state finances. Inflation is low and productivity has increased strongly in both industry and the public sector.' Mr Bildt's presentation followed a sharp attack on the Social Democrats at the weekend and signalled the start of what is set to be a bitter campaign. The Social Democrats responded by saying Sweden had its worst unemployment (currently about 14 per cent of the workforce) since the 1930s. 'We have a prime minister who has totally lost contact with the reality of ordinary people,' said Ms Mona Sahlin, their party secretary. The prime minister acknowledged that the budget deficit, which reached 13 per cent of gross domestic product in the last budget year, and the growing borrowing requirement, represented the greatest threat to recovery. But he said the coalition parties were committed to strengthening savings programmes, while continuing policies of deregulation, privatisation and reforming the welfare state. The Social Democrats are due to unveil their detailed economic programme on August 19. So far their main emphasis has been on raising some corporate and high-band income taxes and strengthening industrial investment.</p>

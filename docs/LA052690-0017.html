			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELEBRITY DEATHS: DAVIS, HENSON AND JILL IRELAND  </P> <P> Sammy Davis and Jim Henson, I will miss you. I find it very difficult to think  of a world without Davis and Henson -- two great men whose talent and  imagination gave so much to all of us.  </P> <P> I remember the first time I saw Davis in person. It was many years ago, but I  was so impressed with how such a big voice could come out of such a little man.  Many years later I thought he was wonderful in "Tap," even though the critics  didn't like the movie much. In many ways, he left some "big" shoes to fill.  </P> <P> "Sesame Street" and "The Muppet Show" were special favorites of my son when he  was little. Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, and Oscar brought smiles and laughter  into my home every day when we really needed it. His creative genius will be  sorely missed.  </P> <P> Heaven must be a happy place with Davis and Henson there, singing, dancing and  having lots of fun. Kind of gives us all something to look forward to!  </P> <P> AMY MAUGE  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach  </P></p>

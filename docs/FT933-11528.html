			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Debt tightens its grip and threatens to hit recovery: How consumers' debts have hardly fallen, leaving them still too frightened either to spend or to borrow TALES of families whose lives fell apart because they could not pay their debts were common during the worst months of the recession. Those stories have faded since the UK left the European exchange rate mechanism, interest rates came down and there was indisputable evidence of economic recovery. But official figures show that debt levels have barely left the heights of the recession, and the problem of households whose mortgage debts are greater than the value of their homes has worsened. The stubbornly high debt levels, together with weak personal wealth and high real interest rates, mean that people are likely to continue repaying their debts and avoiding further loans, possibly delaying a recovery in consumer spending. Net personal-sector savings have fallen as a percentage of personal disposable income since the end of the recession, but at 10.3 per cent are still much higher than in the mid-1980s when the savings ratio was 5.1 per cent. As a percentage of total personal disposable income, personal-sector debt rose from less than half in 1980 to more than disposable income in 1990. Last year it slipped back to more than 90 per cent of total income, an improvement on 1992 levels but still extremely high by historical standards. Meanwhile, the Bank of England estimates that the number of households with negative equity - mortgages worth more than their homes - rose from 1m in the second quarter last year to 1.8m in the first quarter of 1993. Mr John Wriglesworth, housing analyst at brokers UBS, believes it will take up to five years to restore the value of houses to pre-recession levels, pointing out that some house prices in the south-east fell by more than 30 per cent. He said: 'It is a five-year problem because we are not going to have another 1980s-style boom to bail people out.' High levels of debt and the persistance of negative equity could explain why the sharp reduction in interest rates, from 15 per cent to six per cent over two years, has had only a limited impact on consumer spending, and why the Treasury has a conservative forecast for an increase in consumer spending this year of only 1 1/4 per cent. A reduction in interest rates on that scale would normally be expected to produce a stronger recovery than this one is proving. The conclusion among most economists is that although the cost of servicing debts has been slashed, outstanding debt is acting as a significant drag on recovery, in particular by reducing people's desire to take on new borrowing. But why is it taking consumers so long to pay off their debts and regain the confidence to borrow? One problem is that with headline inflation of only 1.2 per cent, real interest rates are high. This means it is still very expensive to service debts. Another factor is the drop in personal wealth, particularly in relation to house prices. Wealth has risen compared with a year ago, but this reflects capital gains on the portfolios of life assurance and pension funds rather than rises in house prices. Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers in London, believes that although the increased profits will eventually be paid to households, in the short-term they are unlikely to alter people's willingness to borrow and spend. The factor that is much more likely to influence people's spending pattersn is house prices. Using a measure of personal wealth that excludes assets held by life assurance and pension funds, Mr Saunders calculated that personal wealth has risen in the past two quarters in real terms, but is still 4 per cent below a year ago and 19.5 per cent below December 1989. 'Net housing wealth - houses less mortgage debt - accounts for such a large share, 54 per cent, of total personal wealth. Thus real wealth will remain sluggish until house prices rise above year-ago levels,' he said. If Mr Saunders is right, the outlook for consumer spending remains uncertain. Debt is one factor constraining activity. Next year tax increases and slowing wage growth will add to consumer woes. Alternatively, the widely expected falls in unemployment and further increases in house prices may prove to be stronger forces in persuading consumers to borrow again. Indeed, some economists believe the problem of the debt overhang has been exaggerated. Mr Kevin Gardiner at SG Warburg Securities said that the bad news on debt is mainly confined to people in the south-east who bought houses in the late 1980s. He said consumer spending has remained fairly strong since the recession and predicts that soon the old problem of high consumer goods import penetration will reassert itself.</p>

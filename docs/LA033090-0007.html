			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> NEW WATER RULES TO BE MAILED TO HOMES  </P> <P> Notices explaining Ventura's water conservation ordinance and outlining the  water allocations each household will receive will be sent out today and  Saturday, city officials said.  </P> <P> The mailing to the city's 23,000 customers was first scheduled for March 23 to  kick off the city's public information campaign concerning water conservation  measures approved earlier this month.  </P> <P> The delay was due to "glitches in the computer system that puts the mailers  together," Ventura Public Information Officer Carol Green said.  </P> <P> Under the program, which becomes effective April 12, residential users will be  limited to 296 gallons a day, and multifamily residences to 196 gallons a day.  Users may be given bonuses if they can document undue hardships resulting from  the ordinance.  </P> <P> The first bimonthly billing period will be a trial, with no penalties being  assessed. But starting in mid-June, violators will be penalized with up to 10  times the normal rate for excess use. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST NORTH  </P> <P> He acts in secret and considers himself above the law. His agenda is entirely  his own. He holds his victims hostage using threats which speak to their most  basic fears and insecurities. What is the difference between Oliver North and  any other terrorist?  </P> <P> Nothing.  </P> <P> It is with profound regret, therefore, that I now read that independent counsel  Lawrence Walsh has found himself forced to drop his prosecution of the two most  important charges facing North (Part I, Jan. 6). This means that North has  succeeded in blackmailing the entire nation.  </P> <P> "Liberty and justice for all" . . . who don't frighten us. How sad.  </P> <P> JOHN DIBELKA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

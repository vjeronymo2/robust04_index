			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Sharp drop seen in spending on tourism projects INVESTMENT in new tourist facilities in England has fallen to its lowest level since the mid 1980s in spite of the competitive threat posed by the new Euro Disney park near Paris. The opening of Euro Disney in April will put particular pressure on the providers of short-break holidays in England, according to a report to be published next week by the English Tourist Board. The board warns that tourists might visit Euro Disney instead of taking short breaks in the UK. Euro Disney believes that more than 1m UK residents will visit the park in its first year. The board warns: 'The displacement effect could be substantial.' The value of new tourism and leisure projects in England fell to Pounds 873m last year, the lowest level since the board began compiling statistics in 1985. Last year's figure was down 19.5 per cent on 1990 and 49.7 per cent on 1989. Investment in theme parks and similar attractions in England amounted to only Pounds 23m last year compared with Pounds 32m in 1990, Pounds 60m in 1989 and Pounds 123m in 1988. The board says some English theme parks are planning additional investment. Chessington World of Adventures in Surrey is to extend its facilities, and Alton Towers in Staffordshire plans to spend Pounds 10m on a haunted house and other attractions. Both parks are owned by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times. Blackpool is to build a Pounds 6m rollercoaster at the Pleasure Beach. These sums contrast with the Pounds 15m that Euro Disney is expected to spend on marketing alone. The board says that English theme parks tend to attract day visitors who live up to three hours' drive away, so some parks believe they will not be directly affected by Euro Disney. It warns, however, that the large number of British tourists visiting Euro Disney will result in higher standards being expected of English attractions. The board has launched a code of practice to encourage tourist attractions to raise their standards of cleanliness and courtesy. Investment in new hotels was one area which held up reasonably well last year compared with the rest of the industry. Projects worth Pounds 337m were started last year, down 16.6 per cent on 1990 and 18.6 per cent on 1989. Projects worth Pounds 772m were completed last year, the second-highest amount on record. They include the Pounds 30m Sainsbury Wing at the National Gallery in London.</p>

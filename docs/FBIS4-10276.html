			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu, who returned to our  country on 30 March after chairing the OAS assembly, rejected a  UN report on the "laundering" of drug trafficking money in some  of our country's free trade zones.    Abreu categorically rejected this possibility. Nevertheless,  he said he would carefully review this issue.    Denying the document that circulated in the United Nations,  the foreign minister stressed: "There is not a single  possibility for Uruguay to be a drug trafficking center."    For his part, Jose Luis Ovalle, the Free Trade Zones  national  director, said this document is almost one month old. This  information has been picked up from the press, he said, adding  that the entire issue is inaccurate.    Abreu also pointed out that during his visit to the United  States to participate in the OAS General Assembly in which  current Colombian President Cesar Gaviria was elected new OAS  secretary general, he met his Argentine counterpart, Guido Di  Tella, with whom he discussed the Martin Garcia Canal issue.    During these talks, compliance with the agreements reached  by  the two countries on the Martin Garcia Canal was confirmed,  Abreu said.    Abreu added that Gaviria's appointment as OAS secretary  general is good news and that his candidacy allowed the  achievement of a Latin American consensus.    Gaviria will step down this year and take over the OAS  General Secretariat in August. Gaviria's candidacy was  supported by Uruguay and the rest of the Mercosur [Common Market  of the South] partners.    During Gaviria's campaign, Abreu conducted negotiations to  enhance a Latin American consensus, a political goal pursued by  the Uruguayan foreign minister for a long time.</p>

He said in a SABC [South African  Broadcasting Corporation] television interview such a move  would lead to other ethnic groups demanding their own separate  entities and the break up the country.    "(We) will be breaking up South Africa into a number of  different political entities which will destroy the economy," he  said. "We are against an ethnic solution," he said, adding  granting Afrikaners their demand for a volkstaat would inspire  other groups whose homelands have been reincorporated into South  Africa presenting similar claims.    But he said he was continuing talks with Conservative Party  and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leaders  discussing their demands for self-determination. He also said  his organisation would press ahead with efforts to persuade the  Freedom Alliance to take part in the forthcoming elections.    The Inkatha Freedom Party has announced it will not take  part.    Asked to state his message to South Africans, Mr Mandela  called for reconciliation. "We would like a spirit of  reconciliation to be accepted by all South Africans. We are not  here for retribution, we are here to try to contribute to the  building of of a new South Africa," said Mr Mandela.</p>

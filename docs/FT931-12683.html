			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Company News: NEC pulls out of fiercely competitive VCR market NEC, the Japanese electronics group, has withdrawn from the manufacture of VCRs in a move that highlights the increasingly harsh trading environment faced by Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers. The decision by NEC Home Electronics, NEC's wholly-owned subsidiary, to retreat from VCR production comes as the demand in Japan for audio-visual products has been particularly sluggish. 'We decided to withdraw from manufacturing VCRs as it is no longer profitable due to the fierce competition,' an NEC representative said. To keep up in the market it is necessary to include more and more functions on machines while prices continue to fall due to the popularity of mass market discount shops. 'I believe there are hardly any companies making profits from VCRs,' the NEC representative said. NEC will continue to supply VCRs manufactured by Sanyo on an original equipment basis. However, it will not distribute to mass sales discount stores where price erosion can occur. Instead, it will restrict distribution to its 6,000 affiliated retailers throughout Japan. The drop in the domestic market for VCRs is a growing headache for Japanese consumer electronics manufacturers which are faced with a penetration rate in Japan and the US of more than 80 per cent. VCR shipments in Japan have fallen from a peak of 7.15m to an estimated 4.3m last year and are expected to decline further to 7.2m in 1993. While NEC does not play a leading role in the Japanese VCR market, with between 5 and 6 per cent of market share according to the company, other major manufacturers of VCRs such as JVC and Matsushita, have also been forced by the fall in demand to cut back production. Last spring, JVC reduced its VCR shipments by 20 per cent.</p>

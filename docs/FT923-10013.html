			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / How To Spend It: Hoping for a sales boom WHEN IT comes to guns the trade is hoping for boom times. The established leaders in the field, James Purdey and Holland &amp; Holland seem to have a head start over their rivals. Customers from Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong and the US, are happy to join an 18-month waiting list for a pair of hand-built guns and pay Pounds 50,500 plus VAT simply to own guns by the hallowed names. Nevertheless, Asprey, the jewellers, in spite of the most unpropitious economic climate,has opened a gun room and now has its own craftsmen building sidelocks to the finest specification. As Edward Asprey, director in charge of the project, puts it: 'With other top London gun-makers around there was no point in us making guns unless we could match them for quality. I believe we have. 'London guns are still sought-after the world-over and with so many of the old names now gone we feel quite sure there is room for us in the market, too. Edward Asprey is a keen shot. He started with an airgun and graduated to shooting tin plates thrown by his father with a No. 2 saloon gun. There seems almost nothing he does not know about the sport. 'We have gone to immense trouble to make sure we give value for money. A pair of guns will cost Pounds 61,000 (inc VAT) but they will be deep-scroll engraved, will be self-opening, hand-built and will be presented in their own double leather case.' With such a new operation (the gun room only opened last November) you might think you could buy a gun in a hurry - alas no, the waiting list at Asprey is already up to 14 months. Those who are not in need of guns, but are seeking some of the appurtenances the sport requires, might like to know that there are very posh cartridges (from 12 bore to .410 calibre) with Asprey written all over them, as well as immensely chic leather cartridge bags and belts. Needless to say, like any proper gun-maker, the gun-room will repair and overhaul, doing anything from restocking to rebarrelling. For clothing, Asprey turned to Gieves &amp; Hawkes, feeling that the expertise of a professional tailor was required. So, there is now an exclusive range of shooting suits which can be bought off-the-peg or made-to-measure. The gun room at Asprey has its own entrance at 23 Albemarle Street, London W1X.</p>

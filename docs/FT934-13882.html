			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Sarajevo flame dies under Serb rain of death FIERCE artillery bombardments and the stench of explosives has reminded the inhabitants of Sarajevo that in spite of a two-month lull and the push for a settlement in Geneva, Serb besiegers can wreak havoc on their lives at any time. Using 152mm artillery, the biggest in their arsenal, Serb fighters have again been pounding the city from their positions on the heights. This latest onslaught mocks any attempt to maintain a semblance of normal life in the valley below. Efforts by the UN to clear the rubble-strewn streets, restore power, water and telephone lines or repair the tram lines in the devastated city appear utterly absurd, given the Serbs' ability to strike at any moment. The UN's 'clean city' operation has so far done little more than provide an extra role for its 5,000 soldiers encamped there. Bombarding the city with artillery and mortars as well as targeting civilian areas with anti-aircraft guns, Serb chieftains, bolstered by their Croat counterparts and western indifference, are killing whatever spirit remains in the Bosnian capital. Despite brave efforts to maintain a core of tolerance, many people fear they have lost the battle to preserve the centuries-old mixed ethnic identity of Sarajevo. As winter descends from the encircling mountains, people are desperate to abandon the city they all vowed to save. Exhausted, 'Sarajlija', the Serbo-Croat word for the city's inhabitants, no longer debate the future shape of their country. While they dismiss as 'unfair' the Geneva plan to split Bosnia into three, few hold out hope of a better agreement. They criticise their government sharply for failing either to obtain weapons or surrender. An overwhelming majority of citizens simply want the guns to fall silent. They spend their time devising ways to survive until somehow they can get out of Sarajevo. As they enter their second winter of war, the fear of bombardment is mingled with a dread of cold and disease. In the anxiety to tap into the city's barely functioning natural gas system, Sarajevo homes have become fire hazards, say UN officials. When Serb besiegers allow supplies through, city dwellers rig up a tangle of rubber garden hoses to channel in small amounts of natural gas. Epidemics pose another threat. Local entrepreneurs have formed a company to exterminate the rats which infest the city. There is also a fear of a breakdown in law and order. Gangsters have been snatching UN vehicles. While most people speak of an intense desire to leave instead of struggling through another winter, few have real hope of getting out. Even if the Moslem-led Bosnian government gives permission, Serb leaders have raised objections with the UN over 'violations' of the airport agreement which only allows transport of humanitarian aid. The spirit of Sarajevo still persists. Even after 18 months of war, vestiges of a cosmopolitan life have endured, distinguishing it from other cities in Bosnia under the control of Serb and Croat regimes. Performing artists and writers have worked to maintain cultural life, organising art exhibits, plays, concerts, and fashion shows, including one with materials made entirely of reinforced window plastic provided by the UN refugee relief agency. But this spirit of resistance is weak and no match for the Serbian guns. Even those most dedicated to its preservation say there is little chance of life in the city in the future. A combination of anger at their Serb adversaries and the incompetence of the west have weakened their will. With their bombs, Serb leaders appear ready to stop at nothing until the Moslems endorse a peace plan which formally puts an end to their Bosnian state.</p>

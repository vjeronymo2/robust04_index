			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (4): Golden age still prevails in the commercial sector - Banking DESPITE its small size, Cyprus has one of the most efficient and sophisticated banking systems in the world. And Cypriot-owned banks are already outgrowing the island, looking for fresh fields abroad. There are 12 banking institutions operating on the island, most of them privately owned, while Cyprus is also the base for some 20 offshore banking units. Banking services have developed considerably in recent years. Most banks now have fully computerised on-line systems, are connected to the Society for Worldwide lnterbank Financial Telecommunications (Swift), offer home and telephone banking and have modern dealing rooms for foreign exchange deposits. There are automatic telling machines (ATMs) in the main towns. As far as using advanced technology, Cyprus banks are abreast of many other countries, says Mr Philip Tew, a director of Lombard NatWest Bank which although it was incorporated in 1960, started full commercial banking services only a year ago. The island's location, its excellent telecommunications, air links and highly qualified labour force, make it attractive for any international organisation, especially if it wants to do business with the eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and North Africa. But with more than 450 branches and offices in the main towns, business centres and tourist resorts, offering all kinds of banking services, the domestic market looks saturated. There are also some 360 co-operative credit societies and savings banks which offer extensive services to the local population, sometimes on easier, more attractive terms. Even so, the 'golden age' for commercial banks still prevails in Cyprus. The recession and bad debts provisions that hit many international banks have not so far affected the island. According to figures provided by the central bank, total profits of the banking sector over the period 1980-90 showed an annual average growth of 24.4 per cent. Total assets grew from about CPounds 890m pounds to CPounds 3.5bn - an average annual growth rate of 16.6 per cent - while deposits increased by an annual average of 16.8 per cent and lending by about 14 per cent over the same period. Banking officials believe business in 1992 will be buoyant, especially with regard to tourism-related services such as hotels, restaurants, car hire and entertainment. The short-term outlook is good. Long-term prospects depend to a great extent on Cyprus's aspiration to move closer to the European Community. A great deal of adjustment would be needed to bring the relevant regulations into line with those of the EC and this could produce a lot of stresses and strains. Among other things, it would mean liberalisation of exchange controls and abolition of the 9 per cent ceiling on interest rates. Mr Michael Shadrach, local director of Barclays, says interest rates need to be deregulated. The 9 per cent ceiling set by law is an 'anachronism' because it does not apply anywhere else in Europe. He also says that the 7 per cent interest on deposits set by the authorities is not adhered to by all banks and this creates unfair competition. Even so, Barclays has expanded its operations in the past few years and now has 48 offices with more than 500 staff. It has set up several specialised units including a finance corporation and an insurance division. Competition among banks is intense, but Mr Shadrach says the real problem is 'the regulations which do not allow banks a decent return.' He believes, for example, that the minimum liquidity requirement set by the central bank (averaging 30 per cent this year) is too high and restricts the banks' ability to offer more credit to customers. But it is generally admitted that in view of the absence of any other mechanism, this is the only way the authorities can exercise monetary control over banks. Perhaps because of these constraints, two of the leading Cypriot banks have expanded into foreign markets, opening offices in countries with sizeable Cypriot communities. The Bank of Cyprus, the largest banking organisation on the island with a 45 per cent share of the market as far as commercial bank operations are concerned, plans to set up more offices in Greece (in Piraeus this summer and in Salonika next year) after the successful launch of its branch in Athens a year go. Mr Solon Triantafyllides, chairman of the group, said the bank hoped to open a representative office in New York this summer and was thinking of turning similar offices in Australia (Melbourne and Sydney) into fully-fledged banking units. Canada and South Africa are included in its future plans. Meanwhile, the Bank of Cyprus (London), with seven branches including one in Birmingham, is further extending its services by setting up a representative office in Manchester. The group, with more rey than 250 branches and offices in Cyprus and a staff of 2,000, reported a 3.5 per cent rise in profits last year while Mr Triantafyllides confidently predicted much higher profits this year cause of the expected tourist boom. Group assets reached CPounds 1.7bn, up 13 per cent. The Popular Bank, the second largest with some 150 offices and branches, is attempting to catch up by employing an aggressive marketing policy and is also reaching beyond the island. Founded 90 years ago, it moved to London and Birmingham a few years ago while recently it also set up representative offices in Australia and plans to do the same in New York. Last December, approval was given by the Greek authorities for the setting up of the European Popular Bank in Greece later this year. This is a joint venture by the Cyprus Popular Bank, the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation (which also has a 21.6 per cent holding in the share capital of the Cypriot bank) and a group of Cypriot and Greek businessman. The Popular Bank, with a 51 per cent majority holding, will retain management of the new bank. The Honkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation participates with an 11 per cent direct holding. Mr Kikis Lazarides, the group chief executive, said the aim of the European Popular Bank would be to expand rapidly in Greece and at later stage in other EC countries. The other Cypriot Bank, Hellenic, with 67 branches, is introducing new schemes to attract domestic business and increase its share of the market. Earlier this month it announced its 'Extra' account under which customers with savings accounts are able to issue cheques or use a cash-card for withdrawals while enjoying a 4 per cent interest on the minimum monthly balance. 'We consider it a revolutionary scheme which adds to our range of banking services,' said Mr Matios Clerides, of the bank's planning and marketing department. Another bank offering full services on the island is the Jordan-based Arab Bank which moved to Cyprus in 1984 and which now has 16 branches mainly in Nicosia and Limassol, the island's southern port city where there is also a small Arab community. Mr Chris Stephani, area executive, said the bank planned further expansion, including the construction of a head office in Nicosia. He said Arab Bank had boosted its market share through an injection of foreign exchange for the financing of big tourist projects and other development schemes on the island. The local banks have set up special units to cater for the estimated 900 offshore enterprises on the island. But they complain about 'unfair competition' from the co-operative credit societies which handle about 35 per cent of total local banking business. The co-op institutions, which have deep roots in Cyprus, especially among the rural population, accept deposits and offer loans to members especially for financing of houses, agriculture, trade and industry. They are controlled by the Co-operative Central Bank, which is also an importer and distributor of fertilisers and other agricultural items); they do not pay income tax and they are outside the control of the central bank. Total deposits with the co-op societies in 1990 exceeded CPounds 900m while laons reached CPounds 780m. In addition, long-term housing and other property finance is provided by the Housing Finance Corporation while medium- and long-term finance for development projects (mainly in the industrial and tourist sectors) is provided by the Development Bank, basically a government-owned institution which also offers feasibility studies and acts as business consultant.</p>

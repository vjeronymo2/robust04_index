			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up STRATEGY The performance of emerging markets over the first half of 1994 has been mixed with only the sub-Saharan region showing an improvement in local currency terms, according to research by Kleiman International, the US-based independent consultants. Among the more mainstream markets, India saw a half year rise of 13 per cent in dollar terms, in spite of higher inflation and lower economic growth prospects. But in Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia falls ranged between 21 and 25 per cent. In North Africa, Egypt advanced by 63 per cent in local currency terms helped by a pick-up in the country's privatisation programme, while Tunisia improved by 35 per cent. FUND LAUNCH A Russian equity fund is to be launched in September by Regent Fund Management, the Hong Kong-based group. The White Tiger Investment Company will aim for a size of Dollars 20m in the first 18 months, investing in traded companies on the Moscow and St Petersburg stock exchanges, with up to 20 per cent going to the Far Eastern region centred on Vladivostok. JORDAN Until now, 1994 has not been a good year for the Amman financial market, writes James Whittington in Amman. Investors have been jittery over progress in the Middle East peace talks and the market has so far been stuck in a downward slide. Last week the index fell to a year's low of 142.81 which represents an 8 per cent drop from the beginning of the year. Local analysts believe that this poor performance is set to change as Jordanian and Israeli negotiators meet in the region today to push forward their peace talks amid real signs of progress. They say the market has reached the bottom of its decline and an upward trend is now likely, although it will still remain highly sensitive to any disruptions in the peace talks.

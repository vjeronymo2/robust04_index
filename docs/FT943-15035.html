			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Church looks for finance stop-gap An attempt is to be made to give the Church of England a longer period to solve its financial problems by enabling the Church Commissioners to incur negative reserves. The Church faces serious financial difficulties following a sharp reduction in the amount available from the commissioners' efforts. This led to the commissioners proposing a Pounds 22m cut in their contribution to clergy stipends and other expenditure next year. But following complaints that this could cause permanent damage to the Church's structure, they agreed to try to limit the 1995 reduction to Pounds 12m. Because the commissioners are not legally empowered to run negative reserves, the Church's General Synod was told in York yesterday that as a last resort the gap between Pounds 22m and Pounds 12m might have to be bridged by loans to dioceses. Power for the commissioners to incur negative reserves would require parliamentary approval. Some Church leaders might be unhappy to support the proposal, as it would open up their financial problems to renewed scrutiny. A financial crisis was generated by a Pounds 800m reduction in the value of the commissioners' assets between 1989 and 1992, caused mainly by the collapse of the property market. A move to disestablish the Church from parliamentary control was defeated last night by the Synod by 273 to 110.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SWEET CHARIOT SWINGS LOW -- A STUDY OF BLACK BURIAL RITES  </P> <P> Africans who came to America in the dark holds of slave ships carried few  possessions. But they brought with them traditions no captor could eradicate.  </P> <P> Those traditions included customs associated with proper burials -- "to be put  away nicely," as it is said here.  </P> <P> Many of those burial practices have been continued to this day by the  descendants of early black Americans who have lived for generations along the  Southern Atlantic coast. Archeologist Elaine Nichols, 36, spent nearly two  years collecting material for her historical portrayal of how blacks in South  Carolina have mourned their loved ones and paid their last respects from the  days of slavery to the present.  </P> <P> The result, her moving exhibit titled "The Last Miles of the Way:  African-American Homegoing Traditions" opened recently in the new South  Carolina State Museum in this capital city and will continue through December,  before it is scheduled to begin a nationwide tour.  </P> <P> According to Nichols, who has lived in the Carolinas all her life, in the early  days along the Atlantic Coast, black burial grounds were almost always near the  water, the belief being the deceased would be carried back home to Africa,  "back home to heaven," by the ocean.  </P> <P> "The world of the dead was a watery world, an upside down world under the  living world," she explained, so "grave decorations would always include  dishes, plates, cups, saucers, items associated with water."  </P> <P> Some black graves in South Carolina continue to be decorated African-style with  personal possessions of the deceased, with charms and magical writing to  placate the spirit of the person buried there, said Nichols, who visited many  black cemeteries in the course of her research.  </P> <P> Among many blacks in South Carolina, Nichols noted, proper burial is associated  with protecting both the living and the dead. In that tradition, a person has a  body, a soul and a spirit. At death, the soul leaves the body to go to the  world of the hereafter, but the spirit remains close by. Without proper  precautions, she explained, evil spirits can wander around, haunt and harm  people.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Spirit Stopper  </P> <P> So one old custom, said Nichols, was to make certain the dead person's mouth  was tightly sealed by tying a piece of cloth under the chin to the top of the  head to keep the spirit from leaving the body.  </P> <P> Hats, including the flat black hats worn by women, were kept on indoors at  funerals as a gesture of respect. And the black armbands and crepe hearts still  worn by mourners on their sleeves in some areas is a tradition traced back to  the early days.  </P> <P> In another custom still practiced at some South Carolina funerals -- especially  those held in the coastal area called the Low Country, and on the offshore Sea  Islands -- babies and small children are handed from one person to another over  a dead grandparent's body. The hope is that the spirit of the dead relative  will not bother the child, and that the child will accept mystical powers  bequeathed by the deceased.  </P> <P> A dramatic photograph of this tradition, shot for National Geographic magazine  at a 1987 Sea Island funeral, is part of the exhibit.  </P> <P> To research such traditions, to authenticate what she already knew and delve  deeper into the origins, philosophy and practice of burial customs, Nichols  talked to hundreds of elderly black funeral directors, old black ministers and  black senior citizens throughout the state to gather information, photographs  and artifacts. She searched university archives, courthouse records, libraries  and newspaper files.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Importance of Death  </P> <P> "My intention is to show how blacks have responded to death over the years, to  explain the importance of death in black culture, to note how many of the old  customs still persist not only in isolated rural areas but South Carolina  cities as well," Nichols said.  </P> <P> When someone dies, according to the old way -- and occasionally still today --  all clocks in the deceased's home are stopped, all mirrors, pictures and  anything with glass are covered with black cloth or turned to the wall as a  protection against bad spirits.  </P> <P> Locks were traditionally cut from the deceased's hair, to be made into jewelry  or wreaths or placed in Bibles belonging to family and friends marking the dead  person's favorite passage.  </P> <P> And on the evening of the services, a time-honored practice that persists is to  stay awake and "set up" all night beside the body, praying, singing spirituals,  recalling pleasant memories of the deceased. Friends and relatives bring cooked  hams, fried chicken, salads and homemade pies for the all-night vigil.  </P> <P> Among the exhibit's photographs of famous black funerals is one from an 1895  issue of Harper's Magazine; another, of the 1937 funeral of Daniel Jenkins,  founder of the century-old Jenkins Orphanage for black children in Charleston.  It was one of the largest funerals ever held in the historic city. One photo  shows the Jenkins Orphanage Brass Band, which performed at the services in full  uniform.  </P> <P> Also on display as part of the exhibit, which was funded in part by the South  Carolina Humanities Council, are examples of the funeral home advertising fans  presented at church services, which were printed with photographs of the  departed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Black Undertakers  </P> <P> However, in many areas of South Carolina there were no black undertakers, and  no embalming until the 1920s and '30s. In those early days, families and  friends took care of the dead with two services -- one at the burial that took  place within hours of death, the other on a Sunday soon after, when it was  possible to gather together as many relatives and friends as possible for a  memorial service.  </P> <P> Film footage, which is part of the exhibit, shows a traditional "ring shout" at  a "praise house" funeral on St. Helena Island in the late 1930s. In it,  families and friends in a circle shout praises to the Lord, clap, sing  spirituals and perform a special "ring shout" dance -- in which no person  crosses his or her feet. Not crossing the feet, Nichols said, was considered  sacred -- as opposed to secular -- dancing.  </P> <P> Ring shouts were brought from West Africa, where they were part of traditional  tribal burial ceremony. In the Carolinas, the practice became common during  regular religious meetings at both praise houses and churches. "I have heard  that ring shouts still occur on rare occasions but have not seen one myself,"  Nichols added.  </P> <P> Praise houses were developed on plantations during slavery, she noted. These  were special structures where slaves worshiped during the week. On Sundays,  they would attend churches located some distance from the plantations.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Special Note  </P> <P> The exhibit takes special note of the role of black burial societies, which  flourished in South Carolina and elsewhere. The societies were membership  organizations that provided emotional and financial support at the time of a  death in the family. They were as important as churches. The earliest, the  Brown Fellowship Society, was founded in Charleston in 1790. Others included  the Sons and Daughters of Jerusalem, Queen Esther's Court, Bright Morning Star  Society and the African-American Order of the Owls.  </P> <P> Dues per family were as little as 25 cents a month in the 1920s and 1930s. When  a death occurred, the family would receive a cash payment of $250 to cover  funeral expenses. Members of the societies wore uniforms, attended meetings.  Society funds were invested in banks, real estate, businesses, schools and used  to promote social programs for members.  </P> <P> Another of the displays in the exhibit is a model of the Randolph Cemetery,  which was founded in Columbia in 1871 by 19 black men and named for South  Carolina Sen. B. F. Randolph, who was hanged by whites when he attempted to run  for reelection. Buried in the cemetery are the remains of nine black  Reconstruction-era representatives and senators. The real cemetery is now in  ruins, said Nichols, vandalized, with tombstones overturned and overgrown with  weeds. The model is an artist's conception of what it would look like had it  been properly maintained.  </P> <P> Her underlying hope, Nichols said, "is that through this exhibit, I will be  able to show one can find meaning in life by finding meaning in death."  </P></p>

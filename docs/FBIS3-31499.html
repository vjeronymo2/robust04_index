Imports totalled $12.530 billion, but this sum includes $713  million worth of MiG fighter planes given by Russia to Hungary  in partial repayment of trade debts accumulated in rubles before  the dissolution of COMECON. When the fighter planes are  deducted, imports total $11.817 billion, 6.8 percent up on the  previous year.    Government moves made last September to boost exports and  improve the trade balance resulted in a tangible rise in exports  in the fourth quarter of last year. While the monthly average  of exports in the first nine months was $716 million, it rose to  $820 million for the last three months of the year and to $866  million in December.    Customs statistics showed a trade deficit of $3.623 billion  for last year, including the import of the MiG fighters. The  trade deficit amounted to $2.910 billion, not including the  import of MiG fighters, and to $2.280 billion when other import  items which do not appear in the current account were deducted.    Exports of agricultural goods and food products fell by 26.6  percent, while exports of consumer goods fell by 20 percent.  The export of products manufactured on commission fell $758  million, exports of grain were down $384 million, and food  exports were $246 million less than in 1992. The latter three  items made up 77 percent of the decrease in exports last year.    Ninety percent of the decrease in exports was in sales to  industrialized countries. Western Europe continued to suffer  from the recession, with 64 to 65 percent of Hungary's exports  going to countries like Germany, Austria, Italy, France, and the  Benelux countries. The currencies of all of these countries  depreciated against the U.S. dollar last year.    Hungary's exports decreased by about 10 percent in volume  terms when adjustments were made in connection with the  appreciation of the dollar, Kadar said.    Exports to former socialist countries made up 26 percent of  total exports last year, while imports from these countries made  up 29 percent of the total.    Exports to the United States rose by 9 percent, exports to  Poland were up 12 percent, exports to Slovenia were up 30  percent, and exports to the Czech Republic and Slovakia were  each up 2 percent.    Figures for trade with Poland, the Czech Republic, and  Slovakia in the second half of 1993 had already begun to show  the effect of the free trade agreement signed early last year  which abolished customs duties and import quotas for 50 percent  of industrial goods.    Imports of consumer goods from the former socialist  countries  rose by 59 percent within an overall increase of 7 percent.  This compares to a 2 percent rise in imports of consumer goods  from industrialized countries.    Agricultural exports fell by $700 million compared to the  previous year, while imports rose by $100 million. Half the  increase was accounted for by products which were not in direct  competition with Hungarian produce, such as tropical and citrus  fruit.    Exports of machinery fell by 3 percent, while imports rose  by  15.1 percent, excluding the MiG-fighter planes but including  $150 million worth of Boeing aircraft bought by the Hungarian  airline, MALEV. The decline in the import of investment goods  ceased, Kadar said.</p>

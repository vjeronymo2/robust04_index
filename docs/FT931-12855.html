			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Letter: Call to amend commercial property legislation flawed Sir, The call by the governor of the Bank of England for commercial property legislation to be amended is flawed and displays a lack of understanding of the economics of the property market ('Commercial lease provisions criticised by Bank', January 21). First, on privity of contract, he should realise that a property lease is like any contract; it is for an agreed period between the two contracting parties. Under most commercial leases the tenant is entitled to assign his obligations, often to a letter covenant. It is absurd to suggest that by doing so the original tenant should escape his contractual obligations. It is also quite inappropriate for the governor to quote the example of Scots law on privity without acknowledging that tenants in Scotland do not have the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act. Even more importantly, in suggesting that the 25-year lease with five-yearly upwards only rent reviews should be abolished, the governor is again wrong. It would clearly be morally wrong to interfere with existing leases - just as contracted interest rates cannot be unilaterally altered. The terms of new leases will be a matter for negotiation between landlord and tenant. D I Hunter, property director, Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, 150 Vincent Street, Glasgow</p>

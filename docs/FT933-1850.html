			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Unit trust sales at August record THE UNIT trust industry had its best-ever August last month, with net sales reaching Pounds 981m, even higher than in August 1987, the peak of the 1980s bull market, Philip Coggan writes. The main influence seems to have been private investors. Net sales to retail investors were Pounds 555m, with UK balanced funds, which offer a mixture of bonds and equities, proving the biggest draw. Mrs Victoria Nye, director of communications at the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, said: 'UK balanced funds, especially when held in a personal equity plan, are particularly attractive to building society savers whose income has been falling over the past three years.' August was a good month for world stock markets, and that factor, combined with the the interest of retail investors, pushed the industry's funds under management to Pounds 84bn, the 10th consecutive month in which a record high has been reached. Gross sales of unit trusts in August were Pounds 1.8bn compared with Pounds 555m in August 1992. Repurchases from investors were Pounds 826m compared with Pounds 496m a year earlier. The number of unit-holder accounts also increased to 4.76m compared with 4.4m a year ago.</p>

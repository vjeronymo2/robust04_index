			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Court's decision hits Heath CE Heath, the insurance broker, yesterday said it would be taking an exceptional charge of about Pounds 22.75m in its next accounts following a ruling against it in the Australian courts. The action was triggered by a judgment in the Supreme Court of Victoria on June 8 upholding an appeal from the state Accident Compensation Commission which overturned decisions in lower courts and took the company by surprise. The share price fell by 24p on news of the announcement, which came days before the company's results are expected for the 12 months to March 31. Mr Peter Presland, chief executive, said: 'This has come as a bit of a shock. We have decided that prudence dictates we take it on the chin.' The award relates to litigation against CE Heath Underwriting and Insurance (Australia), a wholly-owned subsidiary, and other insurers, which wrote workers' compensation business in Victoria during the early 1980s. Mr Presland said the decision of the court was 'quite amazing and incomprehensible' and did not take into account the earlier judgments following initial hearings in March 1990. He said it was not possible to appeal further. The company had noted the existence of the Australian litigation in accounts over several years, but had not up till now expected to lose the judgment.</p>

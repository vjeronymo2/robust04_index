The MUST project is Brite-Euram funded and involves  researchers from Sprayforming Developments Ltd of Swansea,  United Kingdom; University, United Kingdom; Grundfos  International A/S and Magma GmbH, Germany. The aim is to  develop a process capable of producing cheaper forming tools,  dies and moulds for the wide range of manufacturing industries  that use this equipment. Among the applications being developed  in the pilot programme are tools for plastic injection moulding.    The basis of the technology is spray forming, a process in  which atomized molten metal particles impact with a substrate to  form a coherent deposit. The process is similar to powder  metallurgy (PM), but unlike PM the metal particles are not  allowed to solidify during flight.    Simultaneously with the spray deposition, peening shot is  projected through the spray cone so that it impinges on the  substrate at the point at which the deposit is being laid down.  The principle is that the molten spray particles are allowed to  splat on the surface of the substrate or mould to build up a  substantial deposit. On arrival, the splatted particles cool  rapidly spending only a few milliseconds in the liquid state  before cooling to the hot working temperature range. During  spray deposition, hard peening shot moving at high velocity is  propelled towards the depositing surface causing plastic  deformation of the top layer of the surface and finally  collecting at the bottom of the spray chamber.    The programme is investigating two potential routes for  MUST.  The direct route is potentially more cost effective, but may be  limited by the restricted number of former materials that can be  used and the poor replication of very smooth surface finishes.  In order to replicate smooth surfaces a hybrid route, that uses  electroforming to form the working surface of the tool, is also  being developed.    A paper on the MUST process, "Spray forming: Metal Sprayed  Steel Tooling for Tools, Dies and Moulds", is being presented at  "Composites Tooling III" to be held 24-25 February, 1994 in  Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

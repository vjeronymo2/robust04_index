			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 4 (CNS) -- The Guangzhou Municipal  Administrative Bureau and the Guangzhou Water Company signed  letters of intent separately with foreign businessmen recently  to sell some bridges, tunnels and 60 percent of stake in the  water supply company for a 30-year term. [sentence as published]    This is for the first time for the transfer of stake in  public utilities in China. [sentence as published] The letters  of intent mainly stated that a business group would like to buy  some public utilities in the municipality including the People's  Bridge, the Haizhu Bridge, the Haiyin Bridge, the Guangzhou  Bridge, the Pearl River Tunnel and 60 percent of stake in three  water plants. The two sides would set up a cooperative company  to run the four bridges, the tunnel and the three water plants.  The foreign investor accounts for 60 percent of stake in the  cooperative company and the Chinese side makes up the rest 40  percent. The term is set for 30 years and the management would  return to the municipality on expiry of the agreement. Economic  return that the foreign investor would receive is put at 17.5  percent from the municipal facilities and 17 percent from the  water plants.    The cooperative company is considered a franchised entity  and  the charging rate for bridge and tunnel toll as well as for  water rate is under the control of the municipal government.  The foreign partner of the cooperative company will offer  capital in accordance with its stake in the company to fund  construction of three new bridges and a water plant.    The opening of municipal facilities to foreign businessmen  for management is regarded as a breakthrough to raise capital.  Such practice would help alleviate long-term shortages of  capital for urban construction. Some persons are, however,  convinced that inflation would be brought about because the  basic expense for daily living has to increase as a result of  commercialization of the public utilities.    A formal agreement on these items will be signed this month.</p>

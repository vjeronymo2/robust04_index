			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK News (Employment): Training shunted to the slow track - Gloomy predictions from the voluntary sector LAST February Mr Patrick Coldstream, a director of two charitable companies providing training for the unemployed, met Mrs Sarah Hogg, head of the prime minister's policy unit. He predicted grave consequences for training providers from government changes in funding arrangements, and warned that voluntary bodies such as his would be hit particularly hard. To some extent his prophecy has been fulfilled. The voluntary sector's share of places is estimated by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) to have fallen from 25 per cent of the places on Employment Training, the scheme for unemployed adults, in 1990-91 to 15 per cent in 1991-92. Its share of Youth Training, the scheme for 16-to-18-year-olds, has been less affected, from 7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Charities are thought to comprise 5 per cent of the 7,200 organisations which train 16-to-18-year-olds on the two schemes. The remaining training providers include local authorities and commercial organisations. Debate has focused on the voluntary sector because of the announcement a fortnight ago that Fullemploy, a 19-year-old voluntary-sector training organisation catering mainly for ethnic minorities had gone into liquidation. Mr Coldstream helped to set up Fullemploy, which is seeking a purchaser. This week administrators were called to Apex Trust, a leading voluntary-sector provider, to see if liquidation could be averted. A financial crisis was caused there by a demand from the Department of Employment for repayment of Pounds 250,000. Apex trains mainly ex-offenders as well as being a lobby group whose backers include Dr George Carey, archbishop of Canterbury. Mr Coldstream says: 'If organisations as powerfully supported as Apex Trust and Fullemploy are collapsing, the whole network of voluntary-sector providers, many of which are small and perhaps less well-managed, must be vulnerable.' He says that cuts in funding of training schemes and changes in payment regimes over the past year were not always the immediate cause of problems even though they left 'no margin for financial error' among organisations. Unlike commercial training bodies, they have no capital. 'Fullemploy had a bad management patch in the late 1980s,' admits Mr Coldstream. 'It now has an excellent new management, but the organisation was never offered the chance to rebuild with confidence.' Fullemploy had managed to salvage its financial position but was refused a government grant because of Home Office fears about its solvency. Grand Metropolitan Community Services, a large training provider set up by the food and drink group, is considering the possibility of acquiring some Fullemploy contracts. It is fortunate in having core funding from its parent company, and has acquired several small training organisations over the past few years. But the next few months may see the demise of smaller training providers as ministers set out to negotiate new contracts with Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) for 1992-93. The problems affecting training providers, particularly those training the disadvantaged, began when the government gave responsibility for training to the 82 employer-led Tecs in England and Wales. The real value of government grants for Youth Training and Employment Training has been eroded since the early 1980s. The value of grants to Youth Training has been halved since 1983. When Tecs started, the government took their arrival as an opportunity to ask employers to shoulder even more of the financial burden of the two training schemes. In addition, payment for Youth Training became output-related, which meant that up to 25 per cent of payments to Tecs from the government were related to people gaining qualifications. This provoked problems among training providers, particularly those assisting special-needs groups. Many had their training places reduced. Some places were lost, but in some Tec areas contracts went to more general providers of training which offered Tecs more competitive rates. The NCVO claims those at special disadvantage have suffered disproportionately from cuts in funding in 1991-92. In May it estimated that, in the halving of adult training places in the voluntary sector, 75 per cent of the cuts involved people with special needs. Mrs Anne Weinstock, chief executive of The Rathbone Society, a Manchester-based voluntary organisation, says Tec directors, faced with funding cuts, are tempted to take a tougher commercial line. A second change that upset providers in the voluntary sector is the change by Tecs to funding providers in arrears. Before the creation of Tecs the government paid in advance. Concern over this has been expressed by Bridge Group, which represents many providers in the voluntary sector. It says many Tecs have been reluctant to offer providers grants to tide them over the funding changes. Tecs retort that providers would be financially liable if they defaulted. The response of Tecs to the effect of the likely demise of specialist providers, including Apex, is mixed. In part the argument includes division over whether special groups need special training or should be integrated. Some Tecs say that they foresee few practical difficulties in finding alternative providers for training places. Apex, they claim, had always been well-paid for its trainees, and other training providers would jump at their contracts. Others see problems. Mr Michael Hanson, the chief executive of South London Tec, faces the task of finding about 100 new training places if Fullemploy is not rescued. More importantly, Mr Hanson believes that the expertise of specialist providers is not readily bought. He says: 'Fullemploy in particular has built up a particular skill in training its client group, and it also built confident links with employers. That is not easily replaced.'</p>

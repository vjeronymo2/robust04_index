			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Watchdog attacks DVLA's accuracy More than one in three of drivers' records and one in four of vehicle records kept by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are inaccurate, says the National Audit Office. A report published yesterday by the office adds, however, that a number of the errors are 'relatively minor'. Large trade users of the agency's data, such as the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, are generally dissatisfied. The society said 3.6m of the 34m vehicle records had wrong or missing information at the time of the last vehicle census. The audit office also consulted the agency's institutional and commercial customers such as the associations of chief police officers. Eight of the 10 asked about driver data said they were satisfied or very satisfied while five of the six consulted on vehicle data were satisfied. The audit office was critical of the agency's failure to identify what level of accuracy was required by its customers or assess the cost involved. The agency deals with 12m driver and 60m vehicle transactions each year. It employs 4,500 people. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency: Quality of Service to Customers. HMSO, Pounds 7.40.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 30m refinancing for Hawthorn Leslie HAWTHORN LESLIE, the mobile phone group, has agreed details of a Pounds 30m financial restructuring with Svenska Handelsbanken, its bank. The deal, which is subject to shareholder approval, involves Svenska swapping Pounds 16m of the debt for convertible unsecured loan stock. If the loan stock were converted into ordinary and preference shares, Svenska would hold 29.9 per cent of Hawthorn's equity. Of the remaining debt, Pounds 10m is to be designated as an overdraft while Pounds 4.25m is to be a term loan and will be repaid from disposals and tax rebates. The restructuring also involves Svenska waiving interest on the debt, including the loan stock, if it amounts to more than 75 per cent of operating profits. Hawthorn must, however, pay a minimum of Pounds 1m in interest a year. Svenska said these were the only terms acceptable to it. Even so, the company said there was a 'very narrow margin for contingencies' in its projections and it might have to go to Svenska again for further finance. The aim of the restructuring is to get the company back to a position where it can service its debt and develop its mobile phone business, which is trading profitably. Its other activities have been sold, for Pounds 23m. When the deal goes through, its balance sheet will show a deficit of Pounds 22m, which would fall to Pounds 6m if the loan stock is converted. As such, the group is unlikely to pay dividends 'in the foreseeable future'. Mr Andrew Hankey, deputy chairman, who joined the company last spring and has been instrumental to the restructuring deal, is to become chairman. An incentive scheme based on share options is to be instituted for the management. There is a shareholders meeting on April 28, but holders of just over 75 per cent of the shares have given undertakings to vote in favour. The USM-quoted shares are expected to return from suspension following the meeting and publication of results for 1991. Hawthorn said trading in the second half of 1991 was encouraging. A change in accounting treatment will mean a restatement of 1990 figures, and reduce the Pounds 11.9m loss for the first half of 1991 by Pounds 2.4m. Hill Samuel, the merchant bank, has advised Hawthorn.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Crestfallen investors Sir, It is now generally accepted that the Crest share settlement system will disadvantage the private investor while increasing his costs of dealing. The Bank of England has virtually abandoned him to his fate on the grounds that a more efficient method of handling Stock Exchange transactions is necessary. The result will be to drive the few remaining private investors into the ever-open arms of the institutions. Is this what this government, supposedly committed to wider share ownership, wants? On the premise that it is better to ask a silly question and be a fool for five minutes than remain silent and a fool forever, I ask: 'Why do we need Crest?' The clamour for change started with the chaos induced by the large privatisation issues, mainly BT, which overwhelmed the existing system with a deluge of paperwork. With all major privatisation issues now behind us that situation is not likely to recur. Furthermore, this so-called paperless system appears to me to produce nearly as much paper at more frequent intervals as that which it replaces. The government has remained strangely silent on this issue. Is it not time that the Treasury spoke up in defence of the private investor?

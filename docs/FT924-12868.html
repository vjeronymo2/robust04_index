			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Units chief urges shift from equities THE unit trust industry risks being pushed into a marginal role in the UK savings industry unless it moves away from equity-based products, the chairman of the industry's trade association has warned. Mr Barry Bateman, chairman of the Unit Trust Association and chief executive of Fidelity UK, said: 'I believe our key problem is that the unit trust industry is equity-dominated. Currently over 96 per cent of our assets are in equity funds.' Mr Bateman, speaking at a seminar on the unit trust industry last week, noted that the bulk of Britain's savings market is concentrated in low-risk instruments such as deposits or short-term money market instruments. Sir Leon Brittan, a vice-president of the European Commission and chairman of its committee on financial inst-itutions, said the EC was considering several changes to rules on cross-border collective investment schemes to better enable companies to sell money-market funds Europe-wide. Europe-wide collective investment schemes, known as UCITS, have been sold since October 1989 with minimal success. The legislation allows UCITS to be sold in any EC country without special permission regardless of country of origin. Because of the terms of the legislation, most have been equity-based. Sir Leon said that in some EC countries, unit trusts comprising money-market instruments had seen very rapid growth, and allowing these to be sold across national borders would offer greater choice. He also said the EC was considering allowing UCITS to consist of so-called 'funds of funds', collective instruments whose underlying investments are shares in other UCITS. Other changes to the EC's UCITS rules will make it easier for fund managers to use derivative instruments to reduce risk and allow a fund manager to be based in a different country from the UCITS' depository.</p>

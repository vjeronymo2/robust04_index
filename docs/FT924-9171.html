			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading RELIEF over the UK government's success in the Maastricht debate led to renewed speculation about a cut in base rates and boosted activity in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo. A poor opening of 2,717 for the December FT-SE future contract was quickly followed by selling, which sent the contract to 2,713 as dealers focused on a dull overnight performance for Wall Street and Tokyo stocks. This proved to be the day's low as speculation about an interest rate cut gained the upper hand and led to a recovery in the fortunes of December. The session's high was reached just after lunch when December traded at 2,745, before profit-taking caused a brief loss of momentum. A quick burst of buying at the end of the day saw December finish at 2,739, up 11 from the previous session and around 12 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 17. Turnover was almost 8,000 contracts. In traded options, total volume of 28,309 lots was mildly below Wednesday's figure, although turnover in the stock options remained high. Asda was the most actively traded stock option again, on 3,842 lots, with the July 35 puts the busiest series. This was followed by BP, which yesterday reported third-quarter results. It traded 3,735 contracts. Some 1,284 lots were dealt in British Aerospace. BT and Grand Metropolitan were also busy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Craig Doonan] </F>   [Text] Durban April 24 SAPA -- African National Congress  President Nelson Mandela ended his gruelling election roadshow  in Durban on Sunday [24 April] with a strong message of  reassurance to whites, urging them not to leave South Africa and  guaranteeing their safety after this week's poll. He told a  crowd of more than 100,000 squashed into a field outside Kings  Park Stadium that the ANC had taken precautions against chaos  after elections. He did not elaborate.    "We have taken precautions in advance to ensure there is no  looting or interference in people's private property. We're  developing creative programmes in which people are taking part.    "Nothing is going to happen to the property of any family,  black or white. We're taking precautions because we want a South  Africa of national reconciliation, peace and unity."    The ANC president branded as "prophets of doom" those  predicting anarchy after the elections. In a direct appeal to  whites not to leave South Africa, Mr Mandela said: "I appeal to  whites in particular not to fear the future." The ANC  recognised the decisive role whites could play in rebuilding the  country, he said, adding that skills they had acquired had  become "the most valuable asset in this country".    Mr Mandela said he felt hurt by reports of whites leaving  South Africa and made an "earnest appeal from a man who has  spent 27 year in jail" for them to stay."All of you in this  country: Africans, coloureds, whites and Indians, this is your  country. This is our country.    "We appeal to those communities, who have benefited under  apartheid, do not leave us in the lurch at this critical moment."    A confident Mr Mandela brushed aside the Johannesburg car  bomb and the Ulundi killings at the weekend, merely saying he  would take up these issues in discussions with State President F  W de Klerk on Sunday night. He told the cheering crowd he did  not want to concentrate on violence by those wanting to disrupt  elections.    "We're going to deal with these issues. We've made enormous  progress despite the attempts of criminals.    "Leave the task of dealing with law and order with the  security forces."    The ANC president, however, criticised the security forces  for not confining the KwaZulu Police to barracks or weeding out  alleged hit-squads in that force, saying these issues had been  among the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  KwaZulu/Natal. "The SADF [South African Defense Force] and SAP  [South African Police] have done nothing of these things except  to run round in the streets."    Addressing indemnity for elements of the security forces, he  said the ANC would consider indemnifying those members who had  committed politically-linked offences between October 1990 and  December last year, but would not pardon those responsible for  current violence.    "I want to state very clearly that those people involved in  killing members of the ANC in Ulundi, no matter what position  they hold, will be dealt with according to the law," he told the  cheering crowd.    "They must pay for those crimes and they are going to pay."    Mr Mandela repeated that the National Party [NP] had no  chance of winning this week's election and slammed the NP for  emulating the ANC's election slogans and for claiming to be the  only party which could stop the ANC. The NP's statement came  while the whole world was ready to assist an ANC-led government  and amounted to stopping the ANC from "bettering the lives of  all".    The ANC was ready to govern and the people of South Africa  were ready to rid the country of minority rule, Mr Mandela told  a media conference after the rally. "They are not bluffed by the  National Party."    He said earlier the NP had used South Africa's cultural  diversity to divide people while the ANC regarded the cultural  mix as one of the country's strongest assets.    Reassuring minorities, the ANC leader said majority rule did  not mean "black majority rule". "All of you must pledge to be  part of the majority, not the minority. The National Party is a  government of the minority and can never be a government of  majority in this country.    "I would urge our white counterparts to have confidence in  the future. Stay here and help us."    Questioned on his feelings on the dawn of democracy in South  Africa, he replied: "I feel elated. At the same time, I feel  sad," explaining that many people who had made freedom possible  were not alive to see it happen.</p>

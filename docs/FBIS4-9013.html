			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Evgeniya Drumeva] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 19 (of BTA) -- Sweden's Foreign  Minister Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas today arrived on an official  visit in Sofia. This is the first visit a Swedish foreign  minister is paying to this country since 1985. Ms. Ugglas and  her Bulgarian counterpart later today are expected to sign an  agreement on reciprocal protection and promotion of investments.    "We want to strengthen and intensify the relations between  our two countries," Ms. Ugglas said upon her arrival at Sofia  Airport. "I am very pleased that I am the second Swedish  minister who comes to Bulgaria this year and I think this is a  good sign of increasing relations," she also said, referring to  a January 1994 visit by the Swedish defence minister.    Immediately after her arrival here Ms. Margaretha af Ugglas  met Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov.    European integration was high on the agenda of the meeting,  the Swedish Foreign Minister said after having met Foreign  Minister Daskalov. "Sweden sees Bulgaria as an important  partner in building the new Europe. I congratulated Bulgaria  for the agreement with the IMF. It means that Swedish balance  of payments support will now be freed and within the framework  of the G-24 there will be 20 million dollars in credits for  Bulgaria from Sweden and there will probably come another 6  million U.S. dollars also in credits. I also thanked the  Bulgarian foreign minister for the fact that Bulgaria, in spite  of the heavy burden, is respecting the UN sanctions against  former Yugoslavia. I told my colleague that Sweden is going the  contribute 2.5 million Swedish kronor to help improve the  checkpoints of the border crossings between Bulgaria and  Romania. That is a new Swedish contribution in the effort to  help the countries that are respecting the UN sanctions," Ms.  Ugglas said.    Asked to comment on the failure of the international  community's efforts in Bosnia, Ms. Ugglas said it was very  tragic. "Now there has to be a very determined joined effort on  the part of the United States, the European Union and Russia.  There has been too many conflicting signals and now it is very  important to move together," the Swedish foreign minister said  on this matter.    "I am very pleased with the talks because Sweden's support  is  essential for the reforms in Bulgaria. There are no open issues  in bilateral aspect, on the contrary: Sweden is a country which  supports Bulgaria in different spheres, including the settlement  of our foreign debt, which it does through sharing in the  financing within the framework of the G-24. Sweden is ready to  help this country cope with the difficulties arising from the  Yugocrisis through contributing to funds aimed to improve the  infrastructure along the Bulgarian-Romanian border. Sweden is  also ready to open export credit lines and to train Bulgarian  blue helmets, as it has longstanding traditions in this sphere.  It is ready to help Bulgaria get integrated into the European  Union," Foreign Minister Daskalov said for his part. He also  said he was invited to pay an official visit to Sweden.    The Swedish guest this afternoon is expected to meet  President Zhelyu Zhelev, National Assembly Chairman Aleksandur  Yordanov and acting Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. The  Bulgarian and Swedish foreign ministers will call a news  conference this evening.</p>

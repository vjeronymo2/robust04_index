The leader said: The year 1994 is a year of crucial  importance, because in this year many reform measures will be  introduced. We must handle well the relationship between reform  and development on the one hand and stability on the other and  maintain a stable political environment and a favorable economic  environment. Price reform will be carried out at a faster pace,  but the inflation rate should be kept below 10 percent. To  achieve this, we must first of all stabilize agricultural  production and ensure a plentiful supply of agricultural and  sideline products. The tolerance of the general population must  be taken into account when prices are adjusted. Therefore, it is  necessary to strengthen agriculture, which serves as the  foundation of the national economy, and improve our work in  rural areas. We must never relax for one bit on agricultural  production even under the conditions when the agricultural  situation is good; as our tasks become tougher, there will be  all the more need for us to put agriculture in the first place  of our economic work.    The leader pointed out: In adjusting the economic structure,  we must strike a balance between industry and agriculture, which  are two major sectors of the national economy, and increase the  proportion of agriculture in the economy. This concerns not  only agriculture but also industry. Industry is not plagued by  a lack of funds but by overstocking of products. The biggest  market is in the countryside. If the rural market cannot be  activated, the industrial foundation will become shaky and the  market as a whole will shrink. Therefore, we must adjust the  structure in terms of finance, capital construction, and other  aspects.</p>

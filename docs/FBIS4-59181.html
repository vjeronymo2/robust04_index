			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Bosnian Ambassador Omar Bahman on 10 May--read </F> by announcer]    [Text] The dramatic war scenes that we have witnessed over  the last two years have left the world traditionally unreceptive  to our arguments. The new dynamism in the rhythm of the media  activities by Islamic countries has provided an opportunity to  reaffirm Islamic identity in all spheres of life and work.  Starting today, all Muslims who speak and understand the  Bosnian language will be able to listen to the voice of truth,  the voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Bosnian  language. I hope that, God willing, this radio will prevent the  world community from washing the blood and tears of its victims  from its hands without any responsibility and will help to  expose the background of the shameful intentions of timid,  insensitive, and talentless politicians.    I have the honor to thank our Iranian brothers for their  exceptional efforts in launching this program. At the same  time, I hope that the day of our final victory and of justice  and truth for which the Bosnian people have been fighting is  very near and that, God willing, on that day we shall be able to  share our happiness with them.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE ARE THEY NOW? 6 STORIES REVISITED;  </P> <P> GALLERY: THE LANKERSHIM ARTS CENTER IS A NEIGHBORHOOD HAVEN.  </P> <P> Six months after its establishment, the Lankershim Arts Center in North  Hollywood has fulfilled its goal of becoming an outpost for San Fernando Valley  artists, according to Earl Sherburn, community arts director of the Los Angeles  Cultural Affairs Department.  </P> <P> Sherburn said the center has attracted about 200 people to the openings of each  month's featured exhibit, and several dozen visitors a day during the week.  </P> <P> The center has had six main exhibits and showcased the work of about 150  artists since it opened in June. "It's been very well-received by the  community," Sherburn said.  </P> <P> Sherburn said the center is already booked for exhibits through September.  Among the upcoming shows are Monticello Miller's "Oil on Photography" in  February and Candice O'Campo's sculpture exhibit in March.  </P> <P> The center originally intended to offer art classes on the second floor, but  renovation of that area has been delayed. An architect's report isn't due until  February. Sherburn hopes to hold classes by early summer. MICHAEL ARKUSH  </P></p>

After hearing Mr. Le Xuan Trinh, minister of state and head  of the government office, give a briefing on the actual  financial situation of the union and the responsibility of  Director-General Nguyen Van, and based on the views of various  responsible statement mangement sectors, on a protest note from  the Supreme People's Organ of Control, on the results of an  audit conducted by the Ministry of Finance, on inferences of the  personnel affairs section of the Ministry of Agriculture and  Food Industry and of the Lam Dong provincial party committee as  well as on the many public views reported earlier, and after  hearing various sectors express their views, Prime Minister Vo  Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai arrived at the  following decision:    1. The Vietnamese sericultural sector is one of the  country's high potential sectors. It has been and is providing  employment to hundreds of thousands of workers. However,  present and long-term development plans for the sericultural  sector must be carefully worked out. As the main end-product of  the sericultural sector is destined for export, we must accept  the mode of development and production in line with the market  system and international competition.    2. Violations committed in the past by the union of  sericultural enterpises in financial management principles were  grave. These include using short-term capital loans for capital  construction, especially for a number of projects which are not  necessary for sericultural production and are characteristic of  showiness, failing to develop any economic results. In a number  of projects built with short-term capital loans, the union has  failed to comply with state stipulations. The union's  expenditure management has not been strict enough. Its sluggish  debt payment has resulted in a higher interest rate which the  union can hardly afford. The responsibility for these  violations rests with Director-General Nguyen Van.    Director-General Nguyen Van used part of the loans obtained  from the state to buy silk cocoons from the people and to carry  out capital construction, such as buying certain equipment and  transportation means. He also built a number of projects such  as hotels and shopping centers just for show without taking into  consideration their economic results and the consequential bank  interest payments. He also failed to carefully consider various  factors such as product quantity and quality and production cost  when it comes to borrowing money from a number of countries to  import silk-reeling and weaving tools.    Comrade Nguyen Van is a cadre who has devoted himself to the  development of the Vietnamese sericultural sector. He planned  to develop a specialized sericultural production center in the  Bao Loc hilly area for use as a basis for nationwide  sericultural production efforts, trying to build a sizable  industry with Bao Loc as a center. However, having committed  such shortcomings is very grave. Noteworthy is the fact that the  prime minister has on several occasions warned Comrade Nguyen  Van, the minister of agriculture and food industry, and the  secretary of the Lam Dong provincial party committee about the  irregularities committed by the union in using its capital loans.    It is requested that the Ministry of Agriculture and Food  Industry's personnel affairs section and the minister of  agriculture and food industry sternly criticize Comrade Nguyen  Van for his irregularities, and that Comrade Nguyen Van be made  to face stern disciplinary actions given the fact that he is the  head of a giant union.    If Comrade Nguyen Van is willing to correct his wrongdoings  and continue to devote himself to the sericultural sector, to  place himself under the ministry's control, and to accept the  assistance of various state organs, he will be able to continue  his service with the sericultural sector. It is also necessary  for him to rectify the production and business activities of his  union to bring it back to effective operation and to clear up  its debts.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry must sternly  criticize the board of directors of the union and strengthen it  so it will become more competent to serve the cause of  sericultural growth and will see economic results as the  ultimate goal as opposed to any excessively showy formats  without taking into account economic results.    As for the union's party executive committee, the Ministry  of  Agriculture and Food Industry must provide the Lam Dong  provincial party committee with a detailed report with  recommendations so the latter can criticize the committee over  this issue in accordance with the party's principles and statute.    The criticism of Comrade Nguyen Van and the disciplinary  actions taken against him as well as efforts to criticize and  revamp the union's board of directors must be completed within  the first quarter of 1994 if we are to promptly stabilize the  union's production and business activities.    The comrade minister of agriculture and food industry must  criticize himself in view of his responsibility of providing  managerial guidance for the union in the past.    Responsible sectors, especially specialized commercial banks  which have provided capital loans to the union, must also show a  sense of responsbility by helping the union resolve its present  difficulties. The state bank governor must also criticize  himself given his responsibility to provide state management.  He must also criticize specialized commercial banks for having  as a result of their lack of control and auditing failed to  detect the mistake of loaning a large sum of money to the union  to use for inappropriate purposes as noted above.    Presently, the financial situation of the union is very  difficult. As the union is an important union of the state  whose survival has an effect, both directly and indirectly, on  the employment and welfare of hundreds of thousands of  sericultural workers, we must, on the one hand, point out the  shortcomings of the union so it can correct them while, on the  other, seek ways to consolidate the union, trying to bring the  union's activities onto the right track, effectively reorganize  the union's production and business activities, secure and  recover the amount of capital already invested by the state in  the union, make full use of the source of agricultural labor and  the latent potential in land and climate of various areas in the  country for sericultural production, and increase the  competitive power of our sericultural products in the world  market.    The prime minister decided on a number of specific  corrective  measures aimed at rectifying the operations of the Vietnam Union  of Sericultural Enterprises. These measures include those  designed to clear up debts; to rectify those tasks involving  finance, capital, assets, equipment management, and renovating  the union organizationally; and so forth in order to continue to  maintain and develop the sericultural sector at a time when we  are shifting to a market economy amid increasingly tough world  competition in this field of activity.</p>

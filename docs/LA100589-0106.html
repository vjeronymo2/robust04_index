			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FISHING;  </P> <P> GAME FISH CATCHES ARE PUTTING ROCK COD SEASON ON HOLD  </P> <P> Early season rock cod fishing trips have been put on hold. Traditionally in  October, most anglers bring out their deep-water fishing gear. It's hard to  believe they are keeping busy with so many late-season catches of game fish in  all areas.  </P> <P> The one-to-three-day trips have been heralded as the best exotics fishing in  four years, as the yellowtail and tuna continue to move closer to the South Bay  fishing fleets.  </P> <P> The Shogun from L.A. Harbor Sportfishing returned from a trip to Cedros Island  off Mexico and came upon a wide open yellowtail bite, plus tuna and some  albacore that hit anything thrown at them.  </P> <P> Each day of fishing resulted in large catches. Bill Lawson of Manhattan Beach  was the first-day jackpot winner with his 35-pound yellowtail.  </P> <P> Bob Denton's 34 1/2-pound yellowtail gave the Redondo Beach angler the  second-day jackpot.  </P> <P> Mike Bontragen of Hermosa Beach, using 40-pound test line and after fighting  his fish off the bottom, brought up the third-day jackpot winner and the  largest fish of the trip when his sea bass weighed in at 77 pounds.  </P> <P> Walt Forman of Torrance caught 24 yellowtail and five tuna using 20-pound test  line and every one of his fish weighed more than 25 pounds.  </P> <P> Gardena angler Mike Larose also used light tackle and decked 20 yellowtail,  seven tuna and two albacore.  </P> <P> A record was set at last week's Catalina Island Marlin Gold Tournament as 67  marlin were weighed in during the two-day event. Four of the marlin went more  than 200 pounds.  </P> <P> The winner was Mark Mitchell of Orange County, who weighed in a 230-pounder.  </P> <P> Second place went to San Pedro fishermen Gary Norby and Jim Stein aboard  Norby's boat the Outerlimits. It weighed 228 pounds.  </P> <P> Marlin anglers fishing the 277 Spot report that tuna have been picked up while  trolling for marlin. This has alerted South Bay sportfishing boats, which can  make the trip in one day.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 22 May (MENA)--AL-AKHBAR newspaper denounces  the acts which the Sudanese regime is eager to commit every now  and then to harm the Egyptian people and Government, describing  these acts as weird, provocative, foolish, and deliberate, which  any normal Egyptian citizen will call provocative.    In today's editorial, the paper notes that this is not the  first time the al-Bashir-al-Turabi regime has resorted to such  cheap acts, which may be designed to test Egypt's reaction and  exploit it domestically and abroad should our reaction be  violent and firm. But, it adds, Egypt has been patient more than  once with the fabricated battles into which the Sudanese regime  seeks to drag Egypt.    The paper says that Egypt, with its international standing  and sincere people, rejects all the schemes of the Sudanese  regime, which imposes control over its people by force.    The paper adds that if those who unexpectedly assumed power  in Sudan believe that Egypt's patience is limitless, they are  fooling themselves and should realize this fact very well.    The paper asserts that Egypt alone is the one who will  decide  how to answer these failed attempts to provoke it; and if the  response takes some time, it is because of Egypt's deep concern  for the Sudanese people. AL-AKHBAR concludes its editorial with  the Arab adage: "Avoid the patient man's anger."</p>

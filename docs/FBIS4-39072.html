			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau BASAPRESS, 2/6/1994 -- "I am absolutely  sure that we will rapidly develop cooperation and friendship  between Moldova and Turkey by adding to current possibilities  our wish to cooperate in advantageous areas in the near future.  We believe that the opportunity to use successfully the  region's potential both with countries within the Black Sea  basin and through other bilateral relations," said the Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel in his yesterday' speech in the  Moldovan Parliament. He emphasized that Turkey is in favor of  "an independent and free Moldova within the international  community" and that "it will make efforts to assure partnership  relations founded on mutual respect, that will contribute to the  development of the Moldovan national economy with the help of  Turkish businessmen who have the necessary expertise and means.  In order to consolidate Moldova's independence, Turkey  guarantees its support and makes public its friendly  intentions." President Demirel pointed out that in the current  situation "it is very useful to establish tight relations  between the Turkish Great Assembly and Moldovan Parliament. The  Turkish legislators are accompanying me to achieve these  objectives." Demirel also said: "Representatives of a branch of  Turkish peoples, whose ancestors were among the first dwellers  in this region, live in Moldova. I want to stress that we are  sure that the Gagauz people will be a strong link of friendship  between Moldova and Turkey. The Gagauz people are a reason for  Turks' attachment to Moldova make them sympathized with it and  want tighter relations with your country for which Turkey has  the most sincere feelings. Turkey's interests in the Gagauzians  should be understood as an expression of the importance Turkey  gives to Moldova's territorial integrity, peace, economic,  social and cultural development. Gagauzians, in their  motherland are citizens who respect Moldova's territorial  integrity and who are aware of their citizenship. We support  from the bottom of our hearts the prospects for granting a  special juridical status that will assure the preservation of  Gagauzians' national identity." Previously during a meeting with  parliamentary leadership and leaders of the four parliamentary  factions Demirel said that "the Parliament should be the place  where controversies occur and where finally adequate solutions  to any problems can be found. A democracy cannot be built  without opposition, but if it negates the state's existence,  than this country should condemn it or even sanction it."</p>

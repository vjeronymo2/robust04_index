			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Survey of Information Technology in Europe (7): A healthy appetite - Europe's consumers THE European market for consumer electronics is often slow to pick up new trends, compared with the markets in US and Japan. The Japanese are avid consumers of electronics products, their enthusiasm unhampered by the monstrous presence of 30-inch TV sets in their already cramped living rooms. The Americans may not have an indigenous consumer electronics industry, but the situation apparently has not dulled their appetite for new products. In contrast, Europeans are slower to embrace new developments in consumer products. At the same time, European manufacturers of consumer electronics products have seen their profits slump and their home markets penetrated increasingly by foreign competitors. However, the enlarged European region, including eastern Europe and the Efta states, is expected to become the world's largest market within the next five to 10 years. As such, it is of tremendous strategic importance to all the major consumer electronics manufacturers, regardless of their national origin. Europe's indigenous manufacturers hope that the creation of a single market from next year will provide them with the strong home base necessary to remain competitive and from which they might launch their global ambitions. Their efforts to achieve those aims have been two-pronged - they have stepped up their individual efforts at the corporate level to improve competitiveness and profitability, and they have attempted through the European Commission to formulate a European industrial policy in electronics, aimed at strengthening the European manufacturer. Philips, for example, has re-emerged from a loss-making year in 1990 as a slimmed-down and more profitable organisation. The company has launched a series of new products, stepped up its marketing efforts and outlined a forward-looking strategy for moving into software as a means of supporting its hardware developments. But as the vision of a single market takes shape, the route which is increasingly being explored to help the revitalisation process passes through the Commission. To outsiders, this has often seemed like an attempt to keep Europe closed to external competition. Thomson CSF, the French electronics company, and a leading champion of the European cause, said recently: 'The European consumer electronics market is the largest in the world and has the highest growth potential. This market must be conserved.' Over the next few years, this strategy of the manufacturers, in cooperation with the Commission, will be tested on both fronts, with the final test taking place in the marketplace. So far, the road ahead is far from smooth. On the corporate front, the recession, and particularly the cyclical downturn of the consumer electronics industry, has undermined European manufacturers' efforts to regain profitability. As for a European industrial policy for electronics, the EC's latest directive on high definition television (HDTV) provides important lessons for the future. The directive calls for the adoption by manufacturers, television broadcasters, satellite operators and other interested parties of a Europe-wide standard for HDTV. It was important to reach a consensus on a standard to create the single, harmonised market needed for manufacturers to benefit from a large home base. 'We don't want to start with a new fragmentation based on standards,' commented Dr Joan Majo Cruzate, adviser to the directorate of the EC Commission responsible for telecommunications, information industries and innovation. In practice, however, the conflicting interests of the various EC member states, and the different industries concerned, have resulted in a compromise solution that may be flexible but is fraught with difficulties, not to mention hopelessly confusing from the consumer's point of view. European HDTV is already being audience-tested with the broadcasting of the Winter Olympics at Albertville. While this effort has been hailed by a Commission officer as an example of 'European technology made in Europe and managed by European broadcasters,' the move towards full HDTV still faces several hurdles. The Commission's decision after lengthy negotiations that only satellite services launched after 1995 would be required to be broadcast in D2-MAC, an intermediate high definition format, could mean that the first step towards HDTV - the adoption of D2-MAC  - could be sidestepped. Since it is up to the broadcaster to decide whether or not to transmit in D2-MAC, the costs and the lack of hardware penetration mean that not many broadcasters are likely to do so. Meanwhile, without a sufficient choice of programs broadcast in D2-MAC, consumers are not likely to invest in the costly hardware needed to appreciate the benefits of the new format. According to Mr Joseph Flaherty, senior vice president of technology at CBS, the US media group, 'D2-MAC has been in intensive care for several years, and the new EC directive has probably disconnected its last life support system'. The EC is proposing funding for broadcasters and other software producers to encourage broadcasters to sign up for D2-MAC. Consumers, meanwhile, are likely to be more concerned about how many TV sets they will need to buy to enjoy full HDTV in Europe and when that day will come. There is a real danger that the European compromise on HDTV will put consumers off buying a new set until the last moment when they can be more certain of broadcasts in a particular standard. Nevertheless, regardless of the relative merits of the directive, it has certainly taken Europe's experiment in industrial policy-making a step forward. 'The most important point is that it exists,' Dr Cruzate says. But will the directive, as a concrete expression of European industrial policy, help to revitalise the region's consumer electronics industry? Will European manufacturers regain their competitiveness in time to seize this opportunity and take the initiative in bringing sufficiently attractive new products to the market? Will consumers support the strategy by choosing European products over foreign ones? The next few years will provide clearer answers to those questions and will therefore be critical for the industry.</p>

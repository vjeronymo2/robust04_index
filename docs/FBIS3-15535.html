			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Mar 07, BNS -- Russian troops must leave  Estonia and Latvia "as quickly as possible," German Foreign  Minister Klaus Kinkel says in an article published in Saturday's  [5 March] edition of the DIE WELT newspaper.    The article, titled "The Future of the Baltic States is in  Europe", notes that with the Baltic states regaining their  independence in 1991, "the injustice, which began with the  Hitler-Stalin pact of 1939, was corrected."    "The sphere-of-influence-guided thinking of those days must  not come up again. The Baltic region has been and will remain  one of the regions in Europe that are particularly sensitive in  recording the big tectonic shifts of our time."    Kinkel says it is now one of the most urgent tasks to see to  it that the Russian Army units still remaining in Estonia and  Latvia were pulled out. There is no reason to delay this or  make the process dependent on conditions not directly related to  it, the German foreign minister says, adding that there can be  no justification to keeping one's troops on the soil of an  independent country without that the latter so wishes.    The German foreign minister also states that his country is  putting its full support behind the Baltic countries progressing  toward a full member's status in the European Union.    As an intercessor for, and protector of the the Baltic  states, Germany wants the European Agreement to be signed with  these countries still this year. The European Union would be  imperfect without the Baltics, Kinkel says.    "Europe is not only a geographical but also a cultural  concept. The future of the Baltic states is in Europe," the  minister concludes.</p>

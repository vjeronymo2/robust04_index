			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / Australian miners on strike More than 20,000 Australian coalminers went on strike at the weekend, after mining companies refused to pay workers who attend a protest rally in Canberra tomorrow, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The protest centres on the outcome of the annual negotiations between the nation's mining companies and the Japanese steel mills, which resulted in larger-than-expected price cuts. Mr John Maitland, national president of the United Mineworkers Federation, said the protest could continue despite threats of retribution against any employee who participated. The strike action is expected to last for about three days.</p>

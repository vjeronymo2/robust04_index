			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Exports boost Whatman to Pounds 10.7m Whatman, the manufacturer of filtration and purification products, yesterday reported 10 per cent growth in 1993 pre-tax profits, boosted by sales to Europe and Asia Pacific. Profits were Pounds 10.7m, against Pounds 9.71m, restated for FRS 3. Earnings per share were 30.76p, against 27.79p and the directors are recommending a final dividend of 6.9p, making 10.2p (9.5p) for the year. Whatman said the improving economic environment had been off-set by tougher competition, but steady growth was forecast. Turnover increased 15 per cent to Pounds 72m (Pounds 62.6m). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and exchange rate changes, however, the underlying growth was a more modest 5 per cent. Profit margins, excluding currency movements, were stable, during the year. Sales in 1993 were below initial forecasts, due to weaker demand from the US pharmaceuticals industry, and a reduction of inventory by UK distributors. There were stronger performances from new areas such as laboratory gas generators, and bioprocessing media. Sales outside the UK and US increased from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of group turnover, and accounted for Pounds 21.9m of sales in 1993. The US, however, accounted for about 57 per cent of sales. Whatman estimates that a 10 per cent movement from a dollar/sterling exchange rate of 1.6, has an estimated Pounds 1.5m impact on translated pre-tax profits. Last year, Whatman acquired a 60 per cent stake in Biometra, a German company specialising in molecular biology, for Pounds 3.5m, and the company contributed Pounds 234,000 to profits. Whatman also increased expenditure on research and development to 4.5 per cent (4.1 per cent) of sales revenue, reflecting its emphasis on technology. COMMENT Whatman's management has succeeded in deflecting a slow-down in several core areas, through its expansion into new products. Further acquisitions are desirable, given low gearing and Whatman's emphasis on higher technology, but short-term growth will remain steady. On forecast 1993 earnings of Pounds 12.5m, the shares are trading on a p/e of 15.5. Given the current business outlook, this represents fair value.</p>

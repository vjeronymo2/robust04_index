			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Paolo Franchi: "The Knight's Shield"] </F>   [Text] Not so much an earthquake: At the 27 and 28 March  elections, at the first exit polls, something fairly similar to  a revolution took shape. For the person who, during the past  two years, has made poked fun at the Left with the fire of this  grand and terrible word, it looks like a bitter awakening. But  also those people who were more attentive to this country's  history, more concerned about the extreme difficultly of  governing a convulsive transition phase in a democratic fashion,  had become intuitively aware of the danger, and indeed had  little reason to express satisfaction.    There is no getting round the fact that this is not the way  we thought we should move from the night of the First Republic  to the dawn of the new one. With a disordered and crazily  ferocious election campaign. With a vote which makes the  conflict even more radical.    In the coming hours we will see the dimensions of the pole  for freedom's success, in particular in terms of parliamentary  seats. The new electoral system can play brutal tricks, even on  the best opinion pollsters, and a relative majority, however  large, is something totally different from an absolute majority.  We shall also see whether, and to what extent, and if necessary  how, [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi, who had stated his  readiness to renounce the soccer title for Milan for the sake of  this victory, will be able to hold together his highly litigious  allies: the League which, according to the forecasts, is in  difficulty, and the MSI [Italian Social Movement]/National  Alliance, which on the other hand is getting ready to enjoy the  pleasures of a triumph which is probably above anything they had  expected.    But in the meantime that victory of the Right, or rather of  three different and potentially complementary rights, is there.  Revealing in part deep and ancient tendencies in the country,  which have been kept under control for almost 50 years during  which Italy was governed by a center which, whilst looking  leftward, took good care not to lose its ability to represent  the majority of the moderate and conservative electorate, and to  keep it as far away as possible from the reactionary camp.    But an excess of history is of little use in helping us  understand. Because Forza Italia is not interpreted by the  majority of Italians, nor even less by those voting for it, by  the yardstick of a recycled repetition of the five-party system,  as the adversary propaganda noisily and ineffectively pretended.  Because Bossi's League was not only a striking sign of the  collapse of the ancien regime, but also a highly active and  original political player in the process. Because Gianfranco  Fini's MSI-National Alliance, with all the concerns which its  major step forward arouses, is something different from Giorgio  Almirante's at times squad-like and at times smart-suited MSI.    In other words, Italy's three rights have roots which are  more or less old and deep, but which represent, each on its own,  and all together, a new phenomenon. As if public opinion, and  finally [philosopher] Norberto Bobbio, have perceived the  recipes which these parties have formulated, more or less  completely, for overcoming the Italian crisis by paths opposed  to the traditional consensus approach as being new, and in any  event newer than those suggested by the Left. It would be  surprising if such a large number of novice rhetoricians were to  evince surprise and indignation at the revolution which has come  out of the vote.    Right now, in any event, the first job of the pole for  freedom's heterogeneous components and of Berlusconi, before  even getting down to proving in practice the efficacy of the  therapy in question, is to demonstrate that they are able,  together, to reap the benefit of their joint victory. In brief,  to give the country a government, individually and in  conjunction with the other parties. And the task, judging from  the virulent polemics of the past weeks and the first "hot"  reactions of Bossi and Fini, is not an easy matter.    If the numbers of the new parliament prove them right, and  if  they succeed in this enterprise, everyone of the Right which has  become a governing force and who is looking for a democratic way  out of the crisis must renounce every temptation to crush, and  must fully respect the rules of the game and the rights and the  reasons of the defeated. And at the end of an election  campaign, one of the most poisonous fruits of which has been the  rampant tendency to transform the figure of the adversary into  that of a mortal enemy, divested ultimately of his legitimacy  not only to govern, but even to exist, and into an incarnation  of evil, and in a situation of serious political and social  tensions, the same applies identically to the Left.    What is at stake, naturally, is the fate of Italian  democracy, which has become fragile. But, looking at the  situation closely, what is at stake is the very future of the  Left, which is guilty as much, if not more than the Right, of  the mortal sin described above, and which will probably pay a  very high price for this. Just last December, on the day after  the second round of the local elections in Rome and Naples,  [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Achille Occhetto  and his allies considered themselves, and were almost  universally considered to be, the certain victors of the general  elections, being confirmed in this position first of all the  incommunicability between the League and the National Alliance  and the desertification of the center. Against any recomposition  of which, forgetful of the less antiquated part of the same  [former communist leader] Togliatti tradition, they then took  steps to fire point-blank. From this unjustified euphoria the  progressives were entirely unable to free themselves after the  direct entry onto the stage of Berlusconi, even though clearly  destined to radically change the situation. Gradually the  quasi-certainty of victory receded, a situation which, however,  they translated into virulence, extremism, and denunciation of  mortal risks for democracy, for the ability to live together,  and for the fight against criminality in the case of a victory  by the opposition.    With at least the first indications of how the voting went,  the outcome appears to be that they have convinced fairly few  electors outside their own traditional field of influence: a  result certainly made no less disappointing by the success of  the PDS list. It would be the worst thing possible for the same  Left if, rather than to withdraw and seek to understand the  reasons for the defeat, it were to persevere in error. Shouting  about plots and the bogeymen.    It would be wrong for them to seek a way out of the awkward  situation by seeking to radicalize social combat, or by  exchanging judicial initiatives for the continuation of the  political battle by other means. In preparing a responsible  approach, the Italian Left could draw inspiration from the  French left. Certainly, Silvio Berlusconi has nothing of a  Charles de Gaulle about him. But it was precisely in the years  of the government of the right that, in France, a left, finally  emancipated from the consensus vices of the Fourth Republic  succeeded in building, not a gay and therefore useless war  machine, but a leader, a program and a winning line-up.</p>

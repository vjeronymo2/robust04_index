			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-Lap Lam] </F>   [Text] Deng Xiaoping is no longer in full control. The  patriarch's grip on affairs of state is weakening by the day.  Sources close to his family said that while the patriarch  suffers from no life-threatening diseases his prostate cancer  was brought under control a few years ago -- what they referred  to as his "old man's ailment" had deteriorated.    They said on the "better days", Mr Deng was fit enough to  hear briefings for periods of 30 minutes or so. These days of  lucidity, however, have become rarer.    The helmsman of 1.15 billion people can no longer attend to  the details of governance. His energy level only allows him to  be apprised of the most essential matters such as the inflation  rate and China's Most Favoured Nation status in America. His  "briefers" are daughter Deng Rong and members of the Deng  Office, including its director, General Wang Ruilin. However,  since Mr Deng mumbles so badly he can hardly make himself  understood, not even the "imperial lip readers" can be really  sure of his reactions to whatever information he has taken in.    To dispel speculation about Mr Deng's impending rendezvous  with Karl Marx, the Politburo decided last year that his  offspring and relatives should keep to their regular overseas  travels. Diplomats said the protestation by the Foreign  Ministry spokesman last Thursday that Mr Deng was "in very good  health" was an indirect confirmation of the severity of his  physical condition. The same spokesman's claims in April 1993  that Premier Li Peng "only had flu" was newspeak for him having  suffered a major heart attack.    Insiders said a ferocious power struggle could break out  along the following lines. Holders of vested interests --  mainly the Deng family and Mr Deng's anointed successors such as  President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji -- would take  advantage of their position as palace guards to maintain the  status quo.    Ms Deng, who is believed to have formed a power pact with Mr  Jiang, has repeatedly stressed that her father favours  "stability" and that he has full confidence in the President as  the "core of the third-generation leadership. Mr Jiang, whose  ability to jockey for position is as brilliant as his track  record for market reform is lacklustre, has stepped up his  campaign to woo two principal power blocs: the People's  Liberation Army (PLA) and the so-called Shanghai Faction.    Since becoming Chairman of the Central Military Commission  (CMC) in late 1989, Mr Jiang has visited more than 100 army  units in all the seven military regions. Since late last year,  the President is believed to have cemented his ties with key PLA  players including CMC Vice-Chairman Zhang Zhen, Defence Minister  Chi Haotian, and General Wang. Sources said Mr Jiang had  recently given the generals carte blanche in areas including  arms purchase and the expansion of the military business empire.    The President, a former party boss of Shanghai, has elevated  a large number of the affiliates of the Shanghai Faction to  crucial positions in the party apparatus since 1992. Last  month, Mr Jiang paid a visit to Shanghai in an apparent effort  to consolidate his power base before the showdown. Upon Mr  Deng's total departure, Mr Jiang will likely follow in the  footsteps of former party chairman Hua Guofeng and brandish the  New Helmsman's will, which is expected to be along the lines of  "With you (Jiang) in charge, my heart is at ease".    It will not, however, be plain-sailing. Forces at both ends  of the political spectrum -- the dissidents and the remnant  Maoists - have mapped out plans to challenge the succession.  Both the rightists and leftists will try to win popular support  by exposing Mr Deng's responsibility for the massacre -- and Mr  Jiang's complicity as one of the patriarch's advisers in the  military crackdown.    Even assuming that Mr Jiang and such members of the  Mainstream Faction as Vice-Premier Zhu could ride out the storm  that ensues upon Mr Deng's death -- which will include vicious  street demonstrations -- their strengths may be sapped. Should  the heirs apparent falter, the men to watch will be leaders of  the party's "non-mainstream" faction: former president and  retired general Yang Shangkun; former National People's Congress  (NPC) chairman Wan Li; Mr Wan's successor as parliament chief,  Qiao Shi and Mr Qiao's deputy, Tian Jiyun.    Relatively speaking, all four are liberals. Since the  Tiananmen Square bloodbath, they have at one time or another  been shoved aside by Mr Deng for reasons such as failure to back  the armed suppression and readiness to overturn the verdict on  the anti-party "turmoil".    Last winter, Mr Deng made possibly his last major political  decision by appointing Mr Wan a senior spokesman of the council  of elders. Analysts said while Mr Wan had accepted the slot, it  was doubtful whether he would repay Mr Deng by funnelling  support to Mr Jiang. Since falling out with Mr Deng in late  1992, Mr Yang has been plotting a comeback. Early this year,  the head of the disgraced Yang Clan toured Guangdong, one of his  power bases, with the apparent aim of securing the backing of  the nation's most forward-looking province.    Since becoming respectively NPC Chairman and  Vice-Chairman in April 1993, Mr Qiao and Mr Tian have buttressed  their positions by forging links with regional congresses and  promoting the heretical idea of the "supervision of the party  and government by the legislature". Observers say much depends  on whether Messrs Yang, Wan, Qiao and Tian can pool their  resources and win the blessings of such "progressive forces" as  the party's old liberal wing, the regional "warlords" and the  entrepreneurs.    A number of luminaries among the party's  "bourgeois-liberals", including ousted party chief Zhao Ziyang  and former propaganda chief Zhu Houze, have displayed signs of  restiveness. In the past year, Mr Zhao and Mr Zhu have toured  several provinces -- and been received like heroes by local  chieftains.    Then there is the attitude of the top brass. On the surface  Mr Jiang should feel confident because as CMC Chairman, he had a  hand in the appointment of several hundred mid-to top-echelon  officers in the past 18 months. The 21st century, however is  not on the side of the president. Mr Jiang is a product of the  ancient regime rather than a prophet of the emerging economic  superpower.    The PLA -- and the party -- is increasingly being run by  cadres who are hooked to those types of satellite-television  programmes that Mr Jiang helped to ban. In the world without a  helmsman, the army, like other sectors of society, will cast  their vote for whoever could nudge them closer to the  Asia-Pacific century.</p>

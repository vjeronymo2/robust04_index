			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / Handbagged by grey power: Can Major rebound after the humiliation of Christchurch A bloody nose in Newbury. A kick in the teeth in Christchurch. Mr John Major cannot take much more of it before he crashes to the canvas. After the loss of Newbury in May, the prime minister sacked his chancellor. The ghost of Mr Norman Lamont lives on. If there was a single factor which ensured the government would be humiliated in Christchurch, it was the decision in his last Budget to impose VAT on domestic fuel. But the Christchurch result said much more about Mr Major's administration - and his premiership. The government and its leader have fallen out with their own people. The footsoldiers of Toryism in southern England are seething. Unless he wins them back, the prime minister is doomed. The by-election result was as awful as the government's worst fears. By the final days of the campaign, ministers had given up any hope of holding what only a year ago was their 15th safest seat. In the event, the 16,427 majority secured by Mrs Diana Maddock, the less-than-inspiring Liberal Democrat candidate, broke all postwar records. No Conservative government since 1945 has seen a 35 per cent swing against it. Nor has any previous administration witnessed such a dramatic fall in its own vote. The traditional refuge after Tory by-election disasters - blaming the local activists' dud candidate - is not on offer this week. Mr Rob Hayward, an experienced former MP, made his mistakes. But those on the ground judged that, on balance, he won rather than lost votes. Mr Major's reaction was predictable. Christchurch marked the end of a wretched year for his government. But it was backward- not forward-looking. The electors were responding to the economic recession and to the disarray caused by the Tory civil war over Europe. He could draw comfort from Labour's dismal performance. Mr John Smith may claim that his party's lost deposit in Christchurch was the inevitable result of tactical voting. But the outcome - coupled with a similar humiliation in Newbury - can hardly enhance Labour's pretension to be a party which can again win seats across the south of England. Mr Smith, embroiled in his own, damaging, internal dispute with the trade unions, cannot rely on the government's mistakes to deliver votes to his party. The long summer parliamentary recess offers Mr Major a respite. The Conservative party at Westminster has been denied its opportunity to panic. The turmoil in European currency markets has raised a question mark over prospects for the economy, but the odds are that the British upturn will continue to take hold. Another interest rate cut might sweeten the October party conference. Maastricht is history. Wise souls on the Tory backbenches believe time will prove the commentators wrong: those who follow events at Westminster have made the classic mistake of projecting into the future the mood of the recent past. Mr John Biffen, the eloquent elder statesman of the liberal Tory right, left for his summer break this week predicting the 'black misery' of Christchurch would be followed by much calmer autumn waters. As economic recovery began to be felt by the voters, Mr Major would have another chance to get to grips with his domestic policy agenda. But drawing lines under past disasters has become quite a habit for this government - under its forced exit from the exchange rate mechanism, under coal industry closures, under turmoil in the schools, under Norman Lamont. The lines rarely seem to last. For all the brave ministerial speeches yesterday, the cabinet looks tired and purposeless. Mr Major does not look prime ministerial; the voters judge him weak. He has still to articulate a convincing political agenda. Mr Michael Heseltine's energy is sorely missed. Mr John Patten has been sidelined by a stress-related stomach illness. Others around the cabinet table are preoccupied with survival, not buzzing with ideas. Mr Kenneth Clarke is an exception. But Christchurch has narrowed greatly the options for what must be a tough November Budget. Senior Whitehall officials predict he will resist the pressure from the Tory backbenches to delay the introduction of VAT on fuel. It was not his policy but he has defended it vigorously. But the voters have delivered a warning that they will not tolerate further tax or spending changes which fall heavily on the government's supporters. Grey power has come of age in suburban England. The chancellor might as well rule out now any further extension of VAT beyond, perhaps, to newspapers. There will have to be generous compensation to offset the pain of higher fuel costs. Every proposed saving in welfare benefits and health service provision will now have to be weighed against the reaction of the once-loyal battalions of home counties pensioners now marching under Mr Paddy Ashdown's banner. The Liberal Democrat leader was wise yesterday not to draw extravagant conclusions from the party's recent undoubted successes. There was too much talk in the 1980s of 'breaking the mould'. Mr Ashdown's troops remain preoccupied with local rather than national politics. The team which Mrs Maddock will join at Westminster is hardly full of sparkling talent. Mr Ashdown has yet to establish a coherent national strategy for his party but he is capitalising - like Mr Ross Perot in the US last year - on the mood of anti-politics which has swept through the west. Taken together, Newbury, the county council elections on the same day, and Christchurch, have seen the Liberal Democrats advance steadily eastwards from their West Country strongholds. The party is beginning to entrench in areas which the Conservatives have long taken for granted. Up to two dozen Tory MPs are now looking anxiously over their shoulders at the threat to their seats come the general election. They are warning the prime minister that it will take more than a gentle economic recovery to erase the bitterness cause by the 'betrayals' of the past year. They are reminding him that they represent the difference between Conservative and Labour government. If he does not pay heed, they will join the disenchanted and dispossessed on the Tory backbenches who have already given up on Mr Major's leadership.</p>

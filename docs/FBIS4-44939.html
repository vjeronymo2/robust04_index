			<p>CSO     [Text] Thiruvananthapuram, April 23--The CPI(M) [Communist  Party of India-Marxist] leader, Mr E.M.S. Namboodiripad, said  today that the opposition to India's signing of the GATT  [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] was likely to develop  into a major political crisis for the Narasimha Rao Government,  which is in a minority in the Rajya Sabha, report PTI and UNI.    The GATT would cause amendments to several existing laws in  India, and with the Congress(I) in a minority in Rajya Sabha  there was no guarantee that the ruling party would emerge a  victor in its legislative efforts in the Upper House, Mr  Namboodiripad said.    He was inaugurating a series of seminars, programmed by the  Thiruvananthapuram Press Club. The opening seminar was on "GATT  and Kerala."    Mr Namboodiripad said apart from the fact that all the  non-Congress(I) Opposition parties were against India signing  the GATT, even within the Congress(I), leaders like Mr Arjun  Singh were of the view that the Congress(I) should have  attempted to evolve a consensus on the question of signing of  the GATT.    By signing the GATT which jeopardized the country's economic  sovereignty, the Narasimha Rao Government had in one stroke  jettisoned the positive aspects of the Nehruvian policies being  pursued by the country, Mr Namboodiripad said.    The signing of GATT had aggravated the negative aspects of  these policies which the Communist Party had been opposing since  the second Five-Year Plan, he said.    The foreign investment in India was now more in the share  market than in setting up new industries, he pointed out. Mr  Namboodiripad added that even industrialists had expressed  apprehension about the policies pursued by the Narasimha Rao  Government.    He said the Left parties had planned to launch in August a  civil disobedience movement in which some 10 lakh people were  expected to participate.    The Bharatiya Janata Party [BJP] is chalking out a programme  of action to mobilize public opinion against the GATT, the party  spokesman, Mr K.L. Sharma, said here today.    He said the BJP plans to have Jan Adalats, where  the GATT issue would be taken up and its implications to the  Nation's economic sovereignty would be publicized.    The party workers would also court arrest, Mr Sharma told  reporters. He said the programme to oppose the GATT outside  Parliament would be drawn up by a three-member committee set up  by the party.    Mr Sharma reiterated the party's demand that the Government  should hold a referendum on the issue instead of merely taking  it up for discussion in Parliament.    He said the GATT was one issue on which all the Opposition  parties had a similar stand, but felt that the initiative for  joint action should come from other political parties as well.</p>

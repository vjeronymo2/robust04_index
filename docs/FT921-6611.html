			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Way paved for free-for-all air market MR KEATING'S statement has paved the way for a free-for-all market for Australian and New Zealand domestic and international airlines. It removes curbs on equity investment among Australian airlines, letting Qantas, the international carrier, buy into Australian Airlines and other domestic carriers, and the domestic airlines buy into Qantas. Qantas will be allowed to carry domestic passengers while the established domestic airlines will be allowed to fly international routes. Domestic airline deregulation began in late 1990, when the government revoked the two-airline policy confining the market to Australian Airlines and Ansett. It now aims at a single aviation market between Australia and New Zealand by 1994, with each country's airlines having full access to the other's market. Mr Keating said Wellington had assured Canberra that full integration in aviation would be a priority. It was recognised both markets were relatively small, with scope for the industry to reorganise.</p>

			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Maastricht, a vital matter of yes or no - The implications of the vital referendum in France THE MAIN effects of the French referendum vote are likely to be in the short term. But the poll could still have a substantial impact on currencies, share prices, bond prices and interest rates. NON] If the French vote against the treaty, it could mean very bad news. The immediate effect is certain to be pressure on the weak currencies within the Exchange Rate Mechanism - sterling in particular. Mark Henderson, chief investment officer of Touche Remnant, thinks that 'the UK would certainly have to raise base rates, immediately and decisively, on September 21.' He suggests that either 1.75 or 2 percentage points might be needed. And as Bob Semple, of County Nat West, puts it: 'We need an interest rate rise like we need a hole in the head.' Given the recent pressure on building society margins, a base rate rise would mean higher mortgage rates. The societies are aware of the damage this might do to the housing market and the Halifax Building Society, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, has said it would strive to keep any rise to a minimum. Much would depend on whether some societies raise savers' rates to attract funds. That would force others to follow suit, and then to increase mortgage rates in line. There is a silver lining. TR does not believe that high interest rates would remain in place long enough to harm the economy, with lower German interest rates eventually coming to the rescue. As to the effect of a No vote on bond and share prices, Semple says much depends on whether the UK decides to devalue or to raise rates. 'One school of thought is that a devaluation would be good news for equities', he says, 'but it would be very bad news for bonds and there would be enormous market turmoil as a result. Things might settle down more quickly with an interest rate rise, through the Swedish situation shows you have to be tough. If things get really bad the FT-SE 100 Index could fall to 2200.' According to Derek Scott, of BZW: 'With earnings estimates being reviewed downwards, little hope of a German rate cut before the end of the year, the dollar at over-competitive levels, economic growth stagnating and valuations hit by higher bond yields, there is little chance of equity markets shrugging off a 'No' vote.' But Dick Barfield, investment director of Standard Life, down-played the significance of a 'No', suggesting that on a three-month view it would, like the UK general election, have little lasting impact. 'The most important things are German interest rates and the level of the Deutschemark against the dollar. This vote isn't going to affect that one way or the other. The markets have been far too preoccupied by this.' Stephen Pearson, of GT Management, also believes that the importance of the referendum for the long term has been over-estimated, He thinks that the fundamental factor currently moving European markets, the German base rate, is unlikely to be affected. OUI] A Yes vote would be far better news (except for those who believe that European union would be disastrous). Interest rates, and therefore mortgage rates, would be far less likely to rise, and markets would enjoy a boost of confidence. But as Semple points out: 'Even if there is a yes vote, it still has to be ratified by the rest of the community. The Exchange Rate Mechanism is also suffering from the backwash of the falling dollar, and one has to ask whether a Clinton victory is priced into either the dollar or Wall Street.' Derek Scott of BZW feels that if the French vote Yes, 'the threat of rate rises should be avoided in countries where economic fundamentals are sound.' However, he argues that the vote will not bring forward the long-awaited interest rate cuts from the Bundesbank. Nevertheless, Scott feels that a 'yes' would help both French and UK equities, where real long rates are very high and would benefit from better bond trends. Dick Barfield admits that the UK markets would probably jump after a 'Oui' vote, but this does not affect Standard Life's strategy, which is to view all the European markets, especially the UK, as looking cheap on a 12-month view. Touche Remnant's Henderson believes that the reaction to a 'Oui' could be short-lived. Both equities and bonds would rise, but an equity rally could be short-lived because sterling would also rally, damaging UK export potential. Never the less, if you are worried about your investments or mortgage payments, and you are visiting France over the next week, it might be worth a bit of canvassing . . .</p>

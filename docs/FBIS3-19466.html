			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Francois Scheer, French ambassador to  Bonn, was summoned to the Foreign Ministry on Thursday [17  March]. As Foreign Ministry spokesman Michael Gerdts affirmed,  he will have a discussion with State Secretary Dieter Kastrup.    The summons, which in diplomatic jargon usually means the  presentation of a complaint, is a very unusual event in  connection with the ambassador of the neighboring country, with  which relations are very close and friendly. It is obviously  supposed to express Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel's annoyance  with Scheer's confidential comments to a small circle of  journalists on Tuesday.    Scheer had regretted the lack of frequency in German-French  consultations and cautiously implied shock about Germany's tone  at European Union meetings, also among smaller partners. His  statements were disseminated without citing him by name.    Ambassador Scheer had wanted in any case to discuss with the  Foreign Ministry preparations for Kinkel's visit to Paris in the  near future. On Wednesday evening, a Foreign Ministry official  still emphatically denied that the formal summons was something  completely unusual between friendly states.</p>

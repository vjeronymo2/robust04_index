			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / The Long View: Global growing pains Living on the never-never has become expensive. This week, Britain's government paid an interest rate of 8.9 per cent when it auctioned its latest Pounds 2bn issue of 10-year gilt-edged bonds. At the present inflation rate, the borrowing cost in real terms is 6 1/2 per cent. No wonder share prices have been flagging in the face of such determined and price-insensitive competition for savings; the stock market has just tottered to the end of a grim September in which the FT-SE 100 index has lost 8 per cent. Yet, this is not a specially British problem. The key US long Treasury bond yield has crashed through a resistance point and is nearing 8 per cent. In various parts of the globe, big mistakes are being made by governments and by investors. First, however, the good news. As the latest IMF World Economic Outlook makes clear, the global economy is looking quite vigorous. The industrial countries will grow at 2.7 per cent this year and the developing countries at 6 per cent - with the emphasis on Asia where the pace is around 8 per cent. Next year, with eastern Europe also pulling round, the global economy is set to expand by 3.6 per cent, which would make it the best year since 1988. Such a strong revival is a notable achievement, given the severity of the debt crisis that has affected so many countries. The recent recession was mild in comparison with the depressions which have plagued the global economy periodically in the distant past. Governments have been successful in preventing the kind of financial collapse which led to the slump of the 1930s - but the debt, instead of being wiped out, lives on. Private sector balance sheets often remain stretched; this is the reason why the British housing market is dead in the water. Very often, too, private debts have simply been transformed into public sector liabilities. Saving the Swedish banking system has undermined the Swedish government's own creditworthiness. Too many governments have assumed they can tap an unlimited pool of global savings, permitting them to run deficits which cannot be financed out of domestic savings. They still have no sense of urgency. Last year, speculative buying of bonds by banks and hedge funds, financed by cheap credit created by the US Federal Reserve, concealed the problem. But that game ended abruptly last February and now Japan, the dominant source of global savings, has been exposed as an untrustworthy link in the global financial chain. In 1987, the time of the 'wall of money', the Japanese bought Dollars 137bn of long-term securities, mostly dollar bonds. Up to July this year, the corresponding total was only a net Dollars 8bn. The Japanese government's support of a fundamentally insolvent and notoriously opaque financial system has prevented an economic slump. But this has allowed Japanese industry to go on pumping out goods at a loss, and has generated a huge trade surplus and matching currency bubble. Foreign currency losses incurred by Japanese investors in the recent past have frightened them off investing overseas. But they are now missing a golden opportunity to buy cheap bonds issued by overstretched western governments. Instead, they are sitting on domestic assets while liquidity accumulates in Japan from a trade surplus running at some Dollars 130bn a year. This has to flow out somehow through the capital account; in fact it is largely being recycled through central bank intervention, but into short-term money market-type assets rather than bonds. Hence this year's apparent 'shortage' of long-term capital. The optimistic view would be that higher taxes, falling government deficits and moderate economic growth will allow the imbalances to be corrected over several years. Perhaps the rapid growth in the developing world will, nevertheless, keep the real cost of capital relatively high. But if the Japanese institutions buy foreign bonds again on a large scale, the value of the yen will come tumbling down and the log-jam will have been broken, to everyone's satisfaction. Alternatively, there is the disaster scenario: that bond yields continue to climb and central banks go on misinterpreting this trend as reflecting fears of inflation. Higher interest rates will slow down the western economies, causing budget deficits to widen again. The eventual result will be a global breakdown of financial confidence. To most people, the spectacle of market screens bathed in red while the global economy is growing healthily is simply illustrative of financial hysteria. But the markets reflect accurately the submerged financial pressures. A fundamental message for western governments is that the budget deficits which they assumed would stimulate their economies will have the reverse effect if they cannot be financed out of savings. In the UK, this boils down to the choices facing pension funds, which are the country's largest savings institutions but have very little new cash coming in. If they buy government bonds, they will have to sell equities. Thus will the private sector of the economy be crowded out. Governments should reduce their deficits and bring down interest rates. Higher short-term interest rates may actually make it more difficult for governments to sell their bonds: this has become evident in the US, for instance, where short-term savings deposits are now more attractive and money is no longer flowing into mutual funds that invest in fixed income securities. More radical thinking is required: the issue of yen-denominated bonds, for instance, so that western treasuries accept the currency risk that is being shunned by Japanese institutions. This Black September in the securities markets has resulted from the determination of too many governments to fight the wrong battle while facing in the wrong direction. They still have not looked behind them.</p>

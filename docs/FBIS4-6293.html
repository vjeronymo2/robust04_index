			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video on DPRK President Kim </F> Il-song's written reply to NHK inquiries; and interview with  DPRK Major General Kim Yong-chol by "Western news media" on 18  April -- place not given; Major General Kim speaks in Korean,  with Japanese subtitles; translated from the Japanese; from "NHK  News 7" program]    [Text] Today, North Korean President Kim Il-song provided  written answers to questions from NHK. In the written response,  President Kim said the nuclear issue will be settled if the  United States abides by the agreement between the two countries.  In this way, he called on the United States again to  unconditionally reopen high-level DPRK-U.S. talks. [Begin report  from Pyongyang by Toshiro Kishi] [video shows still photos of  Kim Il-song] President Kim said as follows: The United States  is applying pressure on us by wrongly accusing North Korea, who  has never had nuclear weapons and who even accepted inspections  by the international organization. The United States also  deployed nuclear weapons in the South and is intimidating North  Korea with nuclear threat. It is the United States who has been  fueling suspicion about North Korea developing nuclear weapons.  Therefore, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can only be  settled through direct talks between North Korea and the United  States.    The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can be settled  smoothly if both North Korea and the United States observe and  carry out the principles clearly shown in the joint statement  between the two countries. We only hope that the United States  will sincerely abide by these principles together with us. Of  late, Japan is strengthening its policy of treating the DPRK as  an enemy nation by taking advantage of the anti-DPRK racket  [sawagi], in which the United States claims that North Korea is  developing nuclear weapons. In order to improve and formalize  the relations between the DPRK and Japan, the Japanese  Government should stop considering North Korea as an enemy and  abandon its anti-DPRK stance. Prospects for improving relations  between North Korea and Japan will emerge only when the Japanese  Government actually changes its policies toward the DPRK. [end  recording]    In this connection, Major General Kim Yong-chol of the North  Korean Defense Department held an interview today [18 April]  with Western news media, including NHK, and said as follows:  [Begin Kim Yong-chol recording] [video shows General Kim in  military uniform] The United States has not made it clear  whether or not nuclear weapons are still deployed in South  Korea. This suggests that nuclear arms have not been removed  from South Korea. I believe that nuclear weapons in South Korea  can be used at any moment. A U.S. aircraft carrier armed with  more than 50 nuclear warheads has made a port call at Yokosuka  in Japan. These factors represent a nuclear threat against  North Korea. [end Kim Yong-chol recording]    [Begin Kishi recording] As you have just heard, North Korea  is saying they cannot believe the United States has taken away  nuclear warheads from South Korea. As for the nuclear issue, it  is inevitable that the UNSC will discuss early next month the  possibility of imposing economic sanctions against North Korea  if North Korea does not accept additional inspections by the  IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]. Because of this,  attention is focused on how North Korea will act next. As far  as the written response President Kim Il-song sent to NHK today,  and comments by authorities concerned, it is almost impossible  to imagine that North Korea will unconditionally accept further  nuclear inspection.    As a condition of returning to the nuclear nonproliferation  treaty issue, it has been disclosed that North Korea is calling  for removal of the U.S. nuclear umbrella on Japan and the ROK.  Because of this, we can say it has become difficult for the  United States to seek a compromise on further nuclear  inspections by resuming dialogue with North Korea for the time  being. Therefore, it seems difficult to settle the North Korean  nuclear issue at a stroke before the UNSC holds its meeting  early next month. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 30 May (MENA) -- Interior Minister Hasan  al-Alfi has emphasized that deceased lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith  Madani was a link between terrorist Tal'at Yasin Hammam, who was  killed in a confrontation with the police last month, and the  sources abroad who finance terrorism. He noted that  investigations have provided definite proof that the lawyer was  involved in conveying instructions, receiving funds, and  distributing them to the rest of the group members. Al-Alfi,  who was speaking to members of the American Chamber of Commerce  in Cairo today, said that Madani had been implicated in several  previous cases and committed an act of terrorism in 1991. He  noted that many documents and papers were seized with him and  that he was detained after obtaining a permit from the Public  Prosecution Office.    Al-Alfi said that all the procedures used regarding lawyer  Madani were legal and that not even the emergency law was used  against him or against any other. He said: We were concerned  to detain this man and to keep him alive but his health  condition led to his death and thus we lost much information  that we were supposed to obtain from him.    Al-Alfi said that what the lawyer's colleagues did was  attempt to exploit his death by instigating public opinion  against the Interior Ministry and the police. They made  mendacious claims for purposes of instigation. He pointed out  that the law passed by the People's Assembly--the legislative  power--bans marches, so the security men had to confront any  acts of violence or riots. He said that anyone who wants to  protest must do so inside their association, or a delegation can  submit objections to the Presidency but must not stage marches  or demonstrations.    Responding to a question by a member of the American Chamber  of Commerce about numerous complaints of maltreatment of the  public at police posts, al-Alfi stressed that this issue is a  great source of concern, noting that there is no doubt that  there should be amity and mutual respect between the police and  public, since it is their information that has greatly helped  the security forces to detain terrorists. He noted that the  Interior Ministry will appoint a public relations officer for  every police post to serve as a link between individuals and the  security agency.    Responding to a question on the Muslim Brotherhood's stance,  role, and its relations with the extremists, al-Alfi said that  it is obvious that the incidents that occurred in the Lawyers  Syndicate were perpetrated by people who with records and whose  affiliations are known.    In reply to a question about the security situation in Egypt  and its effect on the volume of investment and businessmen's  activities, al-Alfi said that all news agencies' reports on lack  of security in Egypt are untrue. He said that Egypt is one of  he safest places in the world and that everyone can safely walk  Cairo's streets day or night, which is not common in many  countries of the world.    Answering a question on human rights violations in Egypt,  al-Alfi affirmed that there are no violations, noting that  Egypt, with its ancient civilization will not besmirch its noble  civilization with such acts. He said that best proof that there  are no violations is the group of prisoners who were recently  released from Mazra'at Turrah prison after they declared their  repentance. He said that had any of these detainees suffered  any abuse, it would have become known. He stressed that if the  ministry used violence with prisoners, no one would come to  court alive. He said that human rights is one of the most  important subjects taught at the police academy. He noted that  every security man knows well what human rights are and how to  treat a defendant.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hans Van Den Broek, the European Union [EU]  Commissioner on Foreign Affairs, and Serge Abou, the EU observer  at the Cyprus talks, accused the Turkish Cypriot side of making  it difficult for Abou to carry out his mission properly by  refusing to meet with him. Van Den Broek and Abou made their  accusations while briefing the EU Council of Ministers in  Luxembourg.    According to Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC]  correspondent Dhespina Kaloyeropoulou, most ministers agreed  that the Turkish Cypriot side is causing the most difficulties  in negotiations for a Cyprus solution. In an interjection,  Greek Deputy Foreign Minister Yeoryios Papandreou stressed that  the Cyprus issue has lasted for a long time and is causing  instability in the region. He suggested that the facts  presented by the observer at the briefing be put on the record.    The Greek deputy foreign minister asked that the procedure  for beginning negotiations for Cyprus' accession to the EU be  speeded up. According to CyBC's information, some ministers  objected vehemently at this point, saying that it is not the  right time to mention a new expansion when the Council of Europe  has not yet ratified the upcoming EU expansion by another four  countries and since the Maastricht Treaty will be reconsidered  in 1996.</p>

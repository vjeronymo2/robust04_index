			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> DOMINGUEZ HILLS WINS IN TWO OVERTIMES  </P> <P> What is it about National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletic schools that brings  out the best and the worst in the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball  team?  </P> <P> Despite shooting 33% from the field Saturday night, the Toros used 10  three-point shots to come from behind and take an 81-74 double-overtime victory  over host Azusa Pacific.  </P> <P> It was the sixth consecutive victory for Dominguez Hills (8-4), but only the  second in five games against NAIA opponents. It was also the first overtime  victory for Dominguez Hills this season. The Toros have played five.  Ironically, four of those have been against NAIA opponents.  </P> <P> "It's about time we got one of these," said Toro Coach Dave Yanai, who guided  Dominguez Hills back from a 16-point second-half deficit. After an 0-3 start,  Dominguez Hills has won eight of nine games.  </P> <P> "It's important for these players to understand that they can go into a road  situation and step up under pressure and go home with a game like this," Yanai  said.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills made only 28 of 84 field goals, but connected on 15 of 20 free  throws. It opened the game by missing 12 of 13 field goals and trailed, 10-0.  </P> <P> Ray Bennett's three-point shot with 8:06 to go gave the Toros a brief 22-21  lead, but then the Cougars opened the second half with a 19-4 run. Azusa  Pacific led, 53-36, with 12:34 to play in regulation.  </P> <P> But Azusa got careless with the ball, committing five turnovers in the closing  minutes of regulation. That was enough for Dominguez Hills, which played a  patient game, to rally despite its poor shooting.  </P> <P> Junior center Mike Moore played his finest game as a Toro. Moore, a 6-foot-7  walk-on and one of three Toros to transfer from a Division I school, made five  three-point shots. He scored 30 points.  </P> <P> Moore was even more effective in key situations when he didn't score. He took a  charge from Mike Bateman with 4:20 left. That was in the middle of a 22-6 Toro  run that would eventually cut that 16-point Cougar lead to 59-58.  </P> <P> Trailing by three points with 22 seconds left, Moore passed to John Brown, who  tied the game with a three-point shot.  </P> <P> And when Azusa thought it had rebounded to win the game, Moore got offensive  again, tipping in a missed three-point attempt by Keith Billingslea at the  buzzer to send the game into the first overtime.  </P> <P> The first overtime ended at 70-all, but in the second overtime, Dominguez Hills  took control, 73-72, on Moore's fifth three-point basket.  </P> <P> "The last two or three games Mike has played very well for us," Yanai said.  </P> <P> Moore, who did not start, has led the Toros in scoring five times this season.  </P> <P> Dominguez Hills has shot only 40.8% from the field this season, but has made  34% of its three-point shots.  </P> <P> As for playing so many NAIA schools in the preseason, Athletic Director Dan  Guerrero felt it will actually help the team's character.  </P> <P> "Many of the NAIA schools have more scholarship money than we do and they  provide some excellent competition," he said.  </P> <P> The Toros are finding that out.  </P></p>

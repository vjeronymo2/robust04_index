			<p>921211 FT  11 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: US President-elect Clinton looking forward to meeting with British Premier Major US President-elect Mr Bill Clinton is 'looking forward very much' to meeting the prime minister after his inauguration next month, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said yesterday. He spoke at question time of 'friendly exchanges' between Mr Clinton and Britain's ambassador to the US, Sir Robin Renwick. Labour MP Mr Tony Banks raised concerns for relations between the governments in light of the co-operation between the Conservative party and President George Bush's campaign team, together with the checking of Home Office files relating to Mr Clinton. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, later denied any 'improper use' of his department. Mr Clinton will not meet Mr Major on his visit to Washington this month, but both sides have insisted the President-elect would not be seeing any foreign leaders at this stage.</p>

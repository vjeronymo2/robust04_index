			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Major General Amnon Shahaq, head of the Israeli  delegation to the Taba talks, said a short while ago that the  negotiations on the border crossings were stuck. Shahaq  asserted that the disagreements between the parties centered on  security arrangements at the crossings. Our correspondent  Netan'el Semrik reports from Taba:    [Begin recording] [Semrik] Major General Amnon Shahaq, in  his first public announcement this week, made it clear that the  issue of the border crossings remained stuck. This, after an  initial round of talks at Taba, the subsequent understandings  reached at Oslo, Paris, and Cairo, and even after two days of  negotiations at Taba this week.    [Shahaq] As for the security issues, we are still stuck on  the issue of the border crossings. We are currently still  trying to find ways to achieve maximum understanding and  agreement; however, there are several matters of principle on  which we disagree with the Palestinian delegation. We regard  these issues as crucial to maintain the level of security we  desire. There are several issues pertaining to the border  crossings themselves which are tied to security arrangements.  The disagreements between the two parties focus on these issues.    [Semrik] Do you think that the intervention of the prime  minister and Yasir 'Arafat will be necessary on these issues?    [Shahaq] In my opinion, both parties are familiar with each  other's position on the issue of the border crossings. We know  what the Palestinians want and they know what we want. We have  to find a way to agree or else there can be no accord. [end  recording]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 19 January  adds that "Major General Shahaq told our correspondent Moti Amir  that the document detailing the points of agreement and  disagreement between the two parties will be passed up to higher  echelons. In the committee on civilian affairs, agreement was  reached on transferring 25 out of the 35 Civil Administration  offices to Palestinian control."]</p>

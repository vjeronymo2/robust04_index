			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.75&blank;Landing Distance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposal would revise the heading, reorganize &sect;23.75 for harmonization with the JAR, add the landing reference speed, V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> REF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and move the portion on brake pressures to &sect;23.735, Brakes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The introductory paragraph of this section would be revised to delete the reference to the AFM because part 23, subpart B, is generally used to specify what must be determined during flight test and part 23, subpart G, is generally used to specify what must be placed in the AFM. The introductory paragraph would also be revised to require landing distances to be determined at standard temperature for each weight and altitude. Service experience has shown that landing distances are not sensitive to temperatures. The use of standard temperature is consistent with WAT requirements and the increased level of safety introduced in this NPRM. The revised introductory paragraph deletes the reference to ``approximately 3 knots'' for seaplanes and amphibians because this information will be moved to advisory material on acceptable methods of compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revised &sect;23.75(a) adds V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> REF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and requires its use. (See proposal for &sect;23.73.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The text of the current &sect;23.75(b) is deleted because proposed &sect;23.45 would specify these general requirements. Proposed new &sect;23.75(b) clarifies that a constant configuration must be maintained throughout the maneuver. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Revised &sect;23.75(d) would continue the current requirement for showing that a safe transition to the balked landing conditions can be made and specify the weight that must be considered for the transition to the balked landing conditions. This proposed new requirement reflects current industry practice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new &sect;23.75(e) is a general requirement to ensure the reliability of the brakes and tires. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed &sect;23.75(f) is revised by changing the first use of the word ``means'' to ``retardation means,'' and by deleting paragraph (f)(3). Paragraph (f)(3) requires that no more than average skill shall be required to control the airplane. This topic is covered in proposed &sect;23.45(f). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section &sect;23.75(h) is deleted because the introductory paragraph of proposed &sect;23.75 would contain commuter category requirements and proposed &sect;23.1587 would require landing distance correction factors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.77&blank;Balked Landing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section would be revised to include additional WAT requirements and to make editorial changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed revisions to &sect;23.77 (a) and (b) would differentiate between WAT and non-WAT; and, in paragraph (b), would include the more stringent WAT limited airplane requirements. (See proposal for &sect;23.45.) Section 23.77(a)(4) adds a new climb speed requirement to ensure that acceleration is not required during the transition from landing to balked landing. The climb gradient of &sect;23.77(b) was selected to be slightly less than the non-WAT airplane sea level requirement as a tradeoff for a balked landing climb capability at all altitudes and temperatures. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commuter category climb gradient of 3.3 percent specified in &sect;23.77(c) changes to 3.2 percent for consistency with part 25. Additional editorial changes and deletions are proposed for &sect;23.77(c) because the general requirements would be covered in the proposed &sect;23.45. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.143&blank;General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;23.143(a) would be revised to add the phrase ``during all flight phases'' to the lead-in of the paragraph. ``Go-around'' would be added to the list of flight phases. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The JAA/FAA decided, during FAR/JAR Harmonization meetings, that the term ``go-around'' included the all engine balked landings of &sect;23.77, various all engine and one-engine-inoperative aborted landings specified in the AFM, and the commuter category discontinued approach of &sect;23.67(c)(4). In this NPRM, balked landing refers only to the all engine balked landing of &sect;23.77. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The table in paragraph (c) would be changed to show a change in two-hand roll force from 60 to 50 pounds, which is consistent with JAR 25. The table also would be changed to show a one-hand on the rim roll force of 25 pounds. This is a JAA/FAA harmonized value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 23.145&blank;Longitudinal Control <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;23.145 would be revised by changing the speed ranges applicable to the takeoff, enroute, and landing configurations. In proposing paragraph (b)(2) the requirement for ``altering and maintaining, as a minimum, the speed used to show compliance with &sect;23.77'' would be changed ``to allow the airspeed to transition from 1.3 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> S0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to 1.3 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> S1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .'' In proposed paragraph (b)(5) for landing configuration, the speed reference would be changed from 1.4 V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> S0 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> REF <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

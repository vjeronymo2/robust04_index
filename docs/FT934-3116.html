			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / GCHQ union ban may be lifted The government is considering lifting the ban on unions at the GCHQ communications headquarters in Cheltenham. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, said during the second reading of the Intelligence Services Bill that the proposed role for unions would be restricted. Talks had started with civil service unions 'to explore whether there is scope for allowing them a renewed place in staff representation'. Union membership was banned in 1984 after some staff took industrial action on pay.</p>

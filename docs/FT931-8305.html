			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME and Comex in copper wrangle THE LONDON Metal Exchange was willing to stock copper in its US warehouses if that is what the American industry wanted, Mr Raj Bagri, the LME chairman, indicated at a conference in New York. He suggested the industry would benefit if it gave up its present system where US copper producers set prices for their domestic market and instead used LME prices. Mr Bagri pointed out that 55 brands of copper produced in 24 countries were registered for trading on the LME. 'There is international confidence in our base reference prices which are transparently and independently established,' he added. However, Mr Joseph Robertson Jr, first vice chairman of the New York Commodity Exchange, which also offers a copper contract, said that in his many contacts with US copper producers and consumers 'I have yet to find anyone who is interested in pushing or promoting LME pricing for their domestic sales.' The first LME warehouses in the US started operating only a year ago and copper, which is traded in sterling in the LME 'ring', was excluded so as not to challenge the Comex copper contract. This is a dollar contract and occasionally presents arbitrage opportunities to LME traders. However, recent turbulence in currency markets caused a change of heart among London-based traders so the LME copper contract will shortly switch from sterling to dollars. This eliminates the main reason for excluding copper from US warehouses. Mr Bagri said at the conference organised by American Metal Market magazine he did not agree with those who suggested that putting copper into the LME's US warehouses would cause the Comex contract to go into terminal decline. The Comex contract would continue to thrive 'so long as Comex continues to meet the expectations of its users and they want to continue to use it.' He said there could be no carving up of territory between exchanges nor any 'no-go' areas as far as the LME was concerned. 'The LME has a duty and obligation to its users to provide them with the best possible facilities.' Comex's Mr Robertson, who stressed he was speaking personally, made it clear that the New York exchange was in no mood to hand over business to the LME without a fight.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: AMBUSHED?  </P> <P> Michael Stevenson, a cab driver/printer/clerk, is a near-fanatical advocate of  veterans' welfare, by his own account. He's been waging a one-man war against  an East Coast appliance store chain that uses combat footage in its TV spots --  in Stevenson's view denigrating soldiers who died in action. So when Ed Glavin,  an associate producer on "The Morton Downey Jr. Show," called to invite  Stevenson to appear, he was "thrilled to death."  </P> <P> When show time came, however, Stevenson was surprised to find a lawyer on stage  attacking his position, and Downey tossing in his own put-downs. Stevenson felt  humiliated, he told us, and all six of his kids "were very hurt" by his  treatment.  </P> <P> But it was after the taping that Stevenson, from Tiverton, R.I., (pop. 13,526),  really got upset. Backstage, next to a fax machine, he found a copy of a letter  producer Glavin had sent to the combative lawyer. Under a letterhead bearing  Downey's trademark Big Mouth, the letter reads, in part:  </P> <P>  Tonight's guest (on the "Mad as Hell" segment), Michael Stevenson, is an Army  veteran (actually Navy), who is mad as hell at an advertising firm using real  war footage to sell VCR's and TV's.  </P> <P>  I want you to interrupt and say who cares, it's no big deal ... the guy is a  real dimwit ... he shouldn't be too hard to make a fool of....  </P> <P>  After learning that Stevenson had a copy of the letter, senior producer Peter  Goldsmith called and apologized. Nonetheless, Stevenson has consulted an  attorney, claiming that the Downey show "misrepresented" its intentions and  deliberately set him up.  </P> <P> Goldsmith (professional pseudonym Zebra Davis) told us that Glavin -- who's no  longer with the show -- "overstepped his bounds and did a stupid thing. Sure,  it was a mistake. It was bad for the show, which we don't need."  </P> <P> Goldsmith insisted that the Stevenson matter was an isolated incident: "We  don't have to set people up. That's not the nature of our show." John M. Wilson  </P></p>

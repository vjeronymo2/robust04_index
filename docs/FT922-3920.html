			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Heron to meet bond interest payments HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group which is negotiating with its banks and bondholders over the rescheduling of Pounds 1.3bn of debt, said yesterday it did not expect to miss any interest payments on its bonds. Interest on the 11 bonds, with a total principal value of Pounds 450m, is up to date, and payments due later this month will be met, Heron said. No further coupon payments are due until November, and by then the group hopes its refinancing will be complete. An information memorandum is being prepared for bondholders, and is expected to be sent out next week. This will give some details of a report produced by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, at the banks' request. The group is proposing to roll up interest payments on some of its bank debt after its standstill agreement with its 82 banks expires at the end of July. However, it is understood that the amount involved is not large in the scale of the group's loans. Some areas of the group, notably the UK trading operations, are continuing to generate cash and will meet interest payments on their debt. However, the group felt that it was inappropriate for parts of the business which are under greater pressure to make interest payments. The company and its lead bankers believe that the group can be saved through an orderly sale of assets over the next few years, whereas a fire sale now would leave creditors faced with a Pounds 550m loss. This was the essence of a plan put to bankers in April and was repeated by KPMG when presenting its report to a meeting of the banks last Friday. This report is said to have broadly supported the company's own earlier work. The main difference was one of valuations of the properties. At last Friday's meeting, chartered surveyors Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks emphasised that the valuation it provided for the KPMG report, which showed a Pounds 300m lower figure than Heron's valuers had produced for the March 31 year end, was a 'desk-top' review and subject to the limitations inherent in that. Two of Heron's own valuers, which had done a more thorough review of the properties, said at the meeting that they stood by their earlier estimates.</p>

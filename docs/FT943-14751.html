			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Euro-picture restores perspective - Salary comparisons in smaller companies Do many of Britain's executives get a raw deal on pay compared with their European counterparts? A glance at the figures in the table to the right might suggest that they do. While the government, even the Confederation of British Industry, has made pronouncements on the unfairness of certain pay awards to some of the UK's top executives, it looks as if their increases may have been far from representative across managerial grades. Some organisations have been grumbling for a while that the biggest salary awards to individuals do not reflect reality for most executives. The large increases in the pay packets of many of the utility heads and some of the leaving bonuses and profits on share option schemes reaped in those industries have tended to dominate the headlines. According to this year's edition of Remuneration in Europe, a salary report covering 36,000 executive pay packages in 12 countries compiled by a consortium of remuneration consultancies, UK executives still receive almost the lowest pay rises in Europe. In 1993 they received 3.9 per cent on average, virtually in line with inflation, while those in Portugal, for example, received 9 per cent. Looking across the figures supplied for UK executive posts, very few seem to come close to those on offer in other parts of Europe. P-E International, which publishes the report, suggests the picture might not be as gloomy for UK executives as it appears, since the UK has far more large public companies compared to Europe generally. The base salaries in the larger companies, it says, were still ahead of those of their European counterparts. The accompanying table is culled from the full report. Priced at Pounds 525, it is available from The Centre for Management Research, P-E International Group at Park House, Wick Road, Egham, Surrey TW20 0HW. Inquirers should telephone Joanna Woodford, the project manager, on (0)784 476466, fax (0)784 476369. Note that the salaries in the table, quoted in the currencies of the base countries in the report, have been converted to sterling exchange rates at the close of the UK foreign exchange market on Friday July 8. The table is confined to seven countries. It does not quote Germany, for example, because it is difficult to break down the pay figures into the two salary size brackets. Moving story The proportion of companies offering relocation assistance to newly recruited staff is continuing to decline, according to a survey of 500 companies across the UK. The survey, carried out by Robert Half and Accountemps, the financial recruitment consultants, found that just over half of those questioned were offering relocation expenses compared with 90 per cent five years ago. This downward trend, says the report, is likely to have an impact on labour mobility, already affected by a depressed housing market. Four out of five of the companies providing assistance, offered block allowances, varying, on average, somewhere between Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 3,000. Most companies with a relocation policy restrict expenses to reimbursement of estate agent, legal fees and removal costs. Other possible allowances were for temporary housing, offered by 80 per cent of them, stamp duty (73 per cent), and bridging loans (35 per cent). Mortgage subsidies were offered by 8.5 per cent. Jeff Grout, managing director of Robert Half and Accountemps, said the trend could impact on the quality of applicants. 'Candidates who feel they are not going to get relocation expenses might restrict their job search to their locality rather than the whole country,' he said.</p>

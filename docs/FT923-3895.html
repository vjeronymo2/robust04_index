			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Major thinks big despite the doubts DOUBTS about the future of Maastricht need not delay the talks to enable Sweden, Finland and Austria to join the European Community in 1995, Mr John Major said yesterday. At a private meeting with MEPs from the European People's Party (a grouping which includes Christian Democrats and Conservatives in the European parliament) in London, the British prime minister emphasised his hope that some of the informal negotiations for their entry could take place during the UK presidency. In the summer, ministers agreed at the Lisbon summit that formal negotiations should not begin until after Maastricht had been ratified. However, Mr Major insisted yesterday that talks could be started on the assumption that the agreement on European union would be approved by all 12 member states. According to the UK's preferred timetable, the negotiating mandates would be agreed at December's Edinburgh summit, with the negotiations taking place in 1993, and the countries' entry to the Community being ratified in 1994. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, also told the MEPs that in looking forward to a Community of some 20 members, it seemed unlikely that Maastricht would be the final stage of institutional change. Both Mr Major and Mr Hurd highlighted the importance they attached to the forthcoming report from Brussels to clarify the term 'subsidiarity'. Support for a Yes vote slid to a bare 51 per cent in the latest opinion poll carried out by the CSA institute between September 8 and 9, writes Robert Mauthner in Paris. This represents a fall of 1 percentage point since the last poll conducted by the same organisation a day before. Those intending to abstain or to submit blank voting papers still make up 29 per cent of the electorate, though this represents a fall of 4 points since the last survey.</p>

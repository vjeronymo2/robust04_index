			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Rugby tickets reward for business angels - In a Nutshell The chance to buy tickets for December's annual rugby match between Oxford and Cambridge at Twickenham is the inducement being offered to business angels participating in a new survey. The study*, supervised by Hamish Stevenson of Venture Capital Report, previously a research fellow at Templeton College, is being carried out by Oxford University. It aims to capture the views and experiences of individual private investors who have backed, or want to back, small unquoted businesses in the UK. 'There is an important debate going on at the moment about what sort of people business angels are and how much money they are willing to invest,' Stevenson said yesterday. 'Our results should have important implications for industry practice and government policy.' *Business Angels project, Freepost (OF928), Templeton College, Oxford 0X1 4BR. Tel 0491-579999.</p>

The Israeli people and government do not believe in  peace. Israel speaks of peace negotiations but thinks only of  its security and trade agreements with the Arab countries.  Fatah's stance is shameful, because they use guns only at  festivities and weddings; it would be illogical for 'Arafat to  agree to go to Washington for the negotiations. 'Arafat is a  strange and crazy individual," Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, the  current leader of Hamas -- the most feared Palestinian  fundamentalist group -- told LA VANGUARDIA in an exclusive  interview in Gaza city.    "Hamas has a right to defend itself from Israel's existence.  Thus it says frankly in its pamphlets, slogans, and graffiti,  and on the streets, that it will seek out the Israelis and  attack them," al-Zahhar asserted. Almost at the same time, the  Israeli official radio station -- Kol Israel -- was announcing a  lethal attack in Hebron by 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam, Hamas'  military wing.    [Cymerman] Is it true that the prophet Muhammad chose the  fasting month of Ramadan for his holy wars -- more than any  other month in the year?    [Al-Zahhar] The most outstanding battles of the Islamic  world took place during Ramadan. Following these battles, the  spread of Islam was very rapid. It can be seen that most of  Islam's victorious battles against the infidel were in the month  of Ramadan.    [Cymerman] A few days ago the PLO leader and the Israeli  foreign minister signed an agreement in Cairo. How do you view  this, in your capacity as leader of an Islamic movement?    [Al-Zahhar] We said from the start that we would gain  nothing from this peace process, which is just the achievement  of security for the Israeli side and of the Palestinian side's  capitulation. Now it means the presence of Israeli troops in 40  percent of the area of Gaza. According to the agreement, they  are fully entitled to pursue those whom they call "wanted  persons." They can come at any time to our homes and seek their  "wanted persons." The Israelis will also be the only force on  the approaches to Gaza and Jericho. Thus there is no difference  between the current occupation and the implementation of the  latest agreement. The Israelis will never carry out a  withdrawal, since this interferes with anybody's daily life  under the heading "security requirements." It can be seen that  there is simply a justification of the occupation. That means  settling the Israelis in the most comfortable areas of Gaza,  while the occupation still exists in reality.    [Cymerman] One of the results of the agreements will be the  coming of Yasir 'Arafat and the establishment of a strong  Palestinian police force....    [Al-Zahhar] If this police force is here to serve the  community, we will receive it willingly, but if it becomes the  hands of Israel to establish a tyrannical regime in this area, I  believe that they will do what Israel wishes. The people will  endure no more tyrannies. They have resisted the occupation  since 1967 and paid a high price -- thousands of years of  imprisonment, thousands of martyrs. We seek the elimination of  any kind of occupation.    [Cymerman] Do you believe that 'Arafat is a traitor? Do you  believe that he has sold out Palestine?    [Al-Zahhar] In the first place, I would like to remind you  of 'Atnan Yasin, the traitor responsible for the events of June  and July 1992 -- the conflict between Hamas and Fatah. He was  the person most responsible for those clashes. We fear such  people. Palestine does not belong to one man's organization or  even to a state. Palestine does not belong to a generation.  Palestine was and will be part of the Islamic world.    [Cymerman] Will Hamas take part in the general elections for  the autonomous entity?    [Al-Zahhar] Hamas believes that the new situation will be  more dangerous for the Palestinians than the occupation. The  international attitude is opposed to the occupation, but through  justification of the occupation through these agreements this  will create many problems for the Palestinians. What will  become of the millions of Palestinians abroad and of the  hundreds of thousands of deportees? What will become of  Jerusalem, with the rest of the West Bank? What will become of  our rights over Palestine? 'Arafat and his colleagues must  answer all these questions. Hamas will not take part in the  elections and will not assume the role of opposition in the  Palestinian autonomous entity. Hamas will continue to resist  the Israelis' presence by all means.    [Cymerman] That is, you see no future for the peace process  between Israel and the Palestinians....    [Al-Zahhar] This is no peace process. It is an agreement  between the PLO and Israel. The occupation will be more legal  from the international viewpoint. Israel will be the dominant  force and the center of authority in Tel Aviv, and will give us  Palestinians the right to self-control. That is what autonomy  means; the same as the Kurds in Iraq. The central government --  the master of the land -- will give self-determination to a  minority national group. With the signing of this agreement  'Arafat is saying that Israel is the master of all Palestine and  that it is giving us the opportunity to set up an autonomous  entity. This is the most dangerous point in the the agreement  signed in the so-called peace talks.</p>

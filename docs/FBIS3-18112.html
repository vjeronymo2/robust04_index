The magazine quotes planning papers by the  German Chancellery, according to which a German administrator  commissioned by the European Union is to rebuild the  administration in the Croat-besieged Muslim stronghold of  Mostar. German policemen and administrative officials could  help the "emergency mayor." Under Bonn's plans, Bundeswehr  medical officers are to operate the city's hospital and  Bundeswehr engineers are to repair bridges and roads.</p>

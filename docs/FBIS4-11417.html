			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, on the third day of his visit to Cuba,  Zambian President Frederick Chiluba continues a series of visits  aimed at assessing the prospects for bilateral cooperation in  the economic, and other, spheres. Chiluba and the delegation  accompanying him will today tour an agricultural cooperative and  the Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Hospital.    Chiluba's tight agenda is evidence of his government's  interest in exploring the possibilities for expanding bilateral  exchanges in spheres such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture,  public health, and sports. Cuban Foreign Ministry sources say  that there are plans for Cuban technicians to build a sugar mill  in Zambia, with Lusaka financing the operations.    During its stay in Cuba, the Zambian delegation will also  meet with Zambian youths studying in Santiago de Cuba, and will  hold a meeting with African diplomats accredited here.  Yesterday, Chiluba had official talks with President Fidel  Castro and visited science centers in Havana.</p>

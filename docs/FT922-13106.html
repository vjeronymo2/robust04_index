			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / International Capital Markets: Morgan Grenfell to set up unit in Milan MORGAN Grenfell, the UK merchant bank controlled by Deutsche Bank, is stepping up its continental European activities with a new operation in Milan. It will complement existing offices in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Madrid. The new unit, to be headed by Mr Dante Razzano, formerly head of Citibank's Italian corporate finance unit, will concentrate on mergers and acquisitions. It is expected to co-operate closely with Deutsche Bank and Banca d'America e d'Italia, the German bank's big Italian subsidiary. The arrival of Morgan Grenfell represents a further increase in the UK merchant banking presence in Milan, following the establishment of offices by Warburg, Rothschild, Schroder and Baring in the past three years. Like its counterparts, Morgan Grenfell expects growing mergers and acquisitions business in Italy, particularly cross-border deals. It may also hope to win business from the country's so far cautious privatisation programme. Mr Guy Dawson, Morgan Grenfell's head of corporate finance, said Italy represented an area of 'considerable opportunity' for M&amp;A. 'We have now plugged a final and very important gap.' The departure of Mr Razzano and three other executives will mark a blow to Citibank, which, following retrenchment elsewhere, had concentrated its M&amp;A activities in Milan, along with much smaller operations in Germany and France. Those operations, and the remaining members of its Milan-based M&amp;A team, are now expected to be integrated more closely into its advisory and financing activities. Morgan Grenfell, which had a 5 per cent stake in Sviluppo, a Milanese merchant bank, already has a small Italian office, specialising in trade finance. That will now be expanded to accommodate the new team.</p>

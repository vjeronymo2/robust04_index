			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Fishing wars highlight EU policy strains Fish wars raged across European waters yesterday as the dispute between Spanish and British tuna fishermen continued in the Bay of Biscay and Norway accused the crew of an Icelandic trawler of shooting at Norwegian coastguards. The disputes centre on access to jealously-guarded fish stocks and highlight the problems faced by the European Union in running a common fishing policy. Spanish fishermen have been attacking British boats which they claim are using drift nets longer than the EU limit of 2.5km to catch tuna. Yesterday the Royal Navy boarded a Cornish trawler which was suspected of breaking the rules and confiscated its nets. Spain will call for an outright ban on drift nets by trawlers when EU agriculture and fisheries ministers meet in council on September 28. 'We will ask for an immediate and total prohibition,' Mr Rafael Conde, director general for fishing resources, said yesterday. 'This is something we have always pressed for and we are backed by a Commission report which says drift nets should be phased out over the next four years.' In Norway, officials said the shooting incident occurred in a long-running row over cod-fishing rights in arctic waters, when coastguards attempted to cut the nets of the Icelandic trawler Havganur 2 from Svalbard. Icelandic fishermen, forced to seek new fishing grounds by diminishing stocks in home waters, want cod quotas in areas around the Norwegian-controlled Svalbard islands and in the so-called 'loophole', a 62,400 sq km protected zone managed by Norway and Russia where arctic cod spawn. Norway believes tight control over cod stocks in the Barents sea is necessary to protect stocks in waters further south. The European Commission says emotional disputes over fishing rights are inevitable because fish respect no borders and the need to conserve stocks means that quotas must be imposed. The Spanish fishermen who use traditional rods and lines to land their tuna are angry that the British, French and Irish trawlers are able to scoop up much bigger catches with drift nets. Spanish fishing authorities say that drift nets of any size constitute an ecological disaster as they are beginning to pose a serious threat to the tuna population. But British fishermen suspect their motives. 'This is not a dispute over net size, but about access to those waters,' said Mr Richard Banks, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermens' Organisations. The atmosphere in the Bay of Biscay was tense yesterday with at least five British and Irish trawlers opting to return to their home ports to escape the skirmishes. Last month the Spanish fleet clashed with French trawlers and blocked Spain's northern ports to force Madrid to take firm action against drift nets. Fishing disputes are likely to increase as Spain is fully integrated into EU fishing policy at the end of next year and Norway joins the EU, which aims to guarantee access for all member countries to all waters subject to conservation measures. Since drift nets came into use at the end of the 1980s the volume of tuna caught in the Bay of Biscay has doubled. Drifting into a tangled net, Page 9</p>

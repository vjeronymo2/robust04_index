			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Reorganisation at HQ of ICI drugs offshoot ZENECA Pharmaceuticals, the drugs arm of Imperial Chemical Industries, is reorganising its international research headquarters at Alderley Park, Cheshire. The site employs some 700 researchers, representing about 70 cent of Zeneca's research effort. The group last year spent Pounds 257m on research and development and expects to spend up to Pounds 300m this year. The change is aimed at increasing the group's impact in its chosen therapeutic areas, according to Dr Tom McKillop, deputy chief executive. The reorganisation involves setting up four new departments dealing with cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal and vascular inflammatory illnesses, infection and cancer. Each department will have a new manager. Cardiovascular is headed by Dr Mike Turnbull; Cancer by Dr David Julian; Vascular Inflammatory and Musculoskeletal by Dr Barry Furr; and Infection by Dr Graham Boulnois. They report to Dr David U'Prichard, research general manager. Meanwhile, ICI has appointed Mr John Coleman, group environmental affairs manager, as its group personnel manager. Dr Jim Whiston, presently group safety manager, moves to the new post of group safety, health and environment manager. He currently chairs the UK's Chemical Industry Association responsible care advisory group.</p>

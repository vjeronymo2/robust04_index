			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. GOALIE CAN'T KICK AS COLOMBIA WINS, 2-1;  </P> <P> SOCCER: AFTER TEAMS PLAY TO TIE, COLOMBIANS PREVAIL ON PENALTY KICKS.  </P> <P> More accustomed to preventing goals than scoring them, goalkeeper Kasey Keller  missed a penalty kick that enabled Colombia to beat the United States, 2-1,  Sunday for third place in the Marlboro Cup of soccer.  </P> <P> Uruguay won the championship, 2-0, over Costa Rica in the second game at the  Orange Bowl before a crowd of 15,231.  </P> <P> U.S. Coach Bob Gansler, who criticized his players for their lack of intensity  in Friday's 2-0 loss to Costa Rica, called the game against Colombia  "progress." Continuing to experiment, he started six new players and used two  others in different positions.  </P> <P> The United States and Colombia, each a qualifier for the World Cup this summer  in Italy, were tied, 1-1, at the end of regulation, sending the game into a  tiebreaker.  </P> <P> Both teams made eight of their first 10 penalty kicks. But when Colombia's 11th  player, Gildardo Gomez, sent his shot into the net over Keller's outstretched  hands, the goalkeeper, the only U.S. player who had not taken a shot, turned  offensive in an attempt to keep the score even. He failed when his shot hit the  crossbar.  </P> <P> Keller, a University of Portland junior who was making his first appearance for  the national team, was more disappointed afterward because he was penalized in  the first half for delay of game, a rarely made call. That gave Colombia's  Alfonso Fajardo an indirect free kick from inside the penalty area, which he  converted into a goal at 24:26.  </P> <P> The United States scored 3:48 into the game on a shot by forward Eric Wynalda  from 18 yards out after he beat an offside trap and fielded a pass from  midfielder John Harkes. Wynalda, a University of San Diego junior from Westlake  Village, also was making his first national team appearance.  </P></p>

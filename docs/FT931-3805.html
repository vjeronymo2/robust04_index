			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Sport: Off-piste with the fat boys - Skiing / Arnold Wilson tries helicopter skiing in the deserted wilderness of Canada IT COULD almost be a Vietnam war film clip with snow. Every morning at 8.30, five helicopters with headlights blazing come clattering into Blue River. Without fail the adrenalin starts pumping. Helicopter skiing is addictive and these days anyone with sufficient money can do it. Forget virtuoso technique. Forget leaping off cliffs. Thanks to a newoff-piste ski, the Atomic Powder Plus - nicknamed 'fat boys' or 'fat sticks' - money, or lack of it, is the only barrier to those who dream of heli-skiing. Mike Weigele certainly has a lot of wealthy customers at his Blue River resort in the mountain wilderness of British Columbia. One pony-tailed client, who skis there eight weeks a year and takes lobster up to the lodge for his private party, is worth Dollars 50m (Pounds 35.2m). The Powder Plus skis, developed by Atomic, are being copied by other manufacturers. The wide-bodied ski is revolutionising off-piste skiing, in all types of conditions. The big heli-skiing companies in Canada - Canadian Mountain Holidays and Weigele - have switched to them. It is a little like having a mono-ski or even a water-ski on each foot. In a sense, the skis enable you to cheat. They can make skiing off-piste so easy that any reasonable intermediate can do it. All week, while Blue River remained lost in fog, we rose above the clouds in our Bell 212 to enjoy a feast of skiing with our new rental Powder Plus skis. Safety is paramount in helicopter skiing. The first evening and following morning were taken up with safety drill. 'There are three Number One rules of heli-skiing,' says our amiable guide, Bob Sayer. 'The most important is: 'don't break the helicopter'.' Guests have been known to accidentally snap off the long proboscis that provides the helicopter with radio communications with the guide and other pilots. Next comes: 'Never ski past the guide.' Crevasses, avalanche slopes or both could be lurking ahead. The third rule is more positive: 'Don't forget we are here to have fun. We do not need to move fast around the helicopter. Just be careful and we'll all stay happy and have fun.' There are other rules. 'Don't ski too close together,' says Sayer. 'We're almost alone in more than 4,000 square miles of mountain wilderness, so what's the point of skiing into each other? 'Keep an eye on the helicopter at all times when it is coming in to land or taking off. And when you jump out of the helicopter, don't bury your head in the snow.' Soon we were skiing our first run, Cedar, an easy warm-up. *something in here (HP) * Then we skied a longer, more difficult run called Mousetrap before turning our attention to Paradise, the first with real glacier terrain. Our guide prefaced every run with instructions varying from: 'Ski in my tracks' if there was a danger of crevasses, to 'you can ski five turns apart, either side of my tracks' if the coast was clear. The best snow conditions of the week were in feather-light surface hoar-frost - formed when moisture evaporates from the snow and freezes  - on a run off Augerhorn. The skis performed brilliantly, flattering our turns and enabling us to leave almost effortless 'S' tracks in gunbarrel gullies, couloirs and all kinds of snowfields as we swooped down one roller-coaster run after another. The 'fat boys' were pioneered by Georg Ehrschwender, a former train driver from Salzburg, who was with us that week. He is a brilliant skier, and his inventions include goggles with a chimney arrangement which allows hot air to rise and thus prevents them steaming up; powder poles with bright orange trumpet-shaped baskets; a metallic hat that snow simply slides off; and a silver-foil loo for women caught short while heli-skiing - which he thoughtfully set up for us during lunch on a frozen lake at the bottom of a run called, appropriately, Nancy's Relief. When Georg discovered that his fibre-glass prototypes worked, he burst into tears - but he cried only half-way to the bank. So far, he says, the skis have not made him rich. As the week progressed, we switched between the Monashees and the more rugged and adventurous Cariboo slopes, depending on snow conditions and visibility. Our pilot, Greg Kennedy, was always there at the bottom, waiting to clatter off to yet another run. An Everest a day - almost 30,000 vertical feet - is not uncommon, especially on 'fat boys.' Weigele operates helicopters along a 4,000 square mile area of the Monashee and Cariboo Mountains from his base at Blue River Lodge, a remote spot on the shores of Lake Eleanor 370 miles from Vancouver. CMH, Weigele's rivals, also operates in the area, but they are such big ranges that the nearest the two operations get to each other is 20 miles. 'There's a ton of skiing out here,' says Sayer, over an excellent dinner in the cosy chalet-style lodge. 'We have 300 named runs and another thousand we haven't named yet.' Arnold Wilson was a guest at Mike Weigele Helicopter Skiing Holidays (0101-403-762-5548), marketed in Britain through Ski Scott Dunn (081-767-0202) and Fresh Tracks (081-335-3003). He travelled to Kamloops, British Columbia, with Air Canada, 7-8 Conduit St, London W1R 9TG (081-759 2636). The two-and-a-half hour journey to Blue River was by a Mike Weigele Greyhound bus. A seven-day package, excluding flights from Britain, varies from CDollars 2,900 (Pounds 1,630) to CDollars 4,670 (Pounds 2,623) for double occupancy accommodation in individual spruce-log chalets, some with self-catering facilities. The package includes 100,000 vertical feet of helicopter lift, with 80,000 vertical feet guaranteed. Extra skiing is charged at CDollars 14 per 1,000 vertical feet. Three-day packages start at CDollars 1,570 and five days at CDollars 2,370.</p>

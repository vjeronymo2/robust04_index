			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Councils to suffer squeeze on spending THE government's limits on local authority spending for next year will be even more tightly drawn than the 'capping' regime operating this year. The criteria for limiting council budgets will be set out in a statement by Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, towards the end of the month, and will intensify the squeeze on local spending, as part of the government's determination to keep council tax bills from rising too steeply. For spending in 1992-93, the regime put in place by the Department of the Environment is based on both what had been spent in 1991-92 and the standard spending assessment (SSA) - what the government thought the councils should be spending in 1992-93. That system will remain, but the percentage increases allowed will be reduced. The government's argument is that with a lower inflation rate expected for 1993-94 than for 1992-93, councils have less need to increase spending. There is also ministerial concern that in the current year, even with the strictness of the existing capping regime, actual local spending looks likely to exceed the government limits of Pounds 41.8bn for England by just over Pounds 1bn. The transfer of further education spending away from local authorities to a new funding council will make the capping arrangements particularly difficult this year. Councils who were spending less on further education than the government estimate of what they needed to spend will find their budgets adjusted to take account of what the government had assumed they should be spending rather than what they actually spent. This could mean that they have to make cuts in other services. Local authorities are already insisting that they will need a government grant to take account of the impact on their 1993-94 spending of pay deals for groups such as the police which have already been agreed. The local authority associations estimate that such pay deals will cost them Pounds 228m in 1993-94, regardless of the public sector pay squeeze to be announced tomorrow in the Autumn Statement.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Call for pension funds to back IT research A joint technology, transport and telecommunications infrastructure is urgently needed for European recovery, a report by the Federal Trust, the pro-European integration British think-tank, claimed yesterday. The report, issued on the back of the recent white paper on European economic renewal by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, argues that Europe's fragmented infrastructure, with 12 different transport and telecommunications networks, is undermining the single market, and Europe's competitiveness with more unified regions like the US. Though Europe has more than a quarter of world gross domestic product, it has only only a tenth of the world's information technology production, the report says. Since individual nation states are unable to provide the necessary investment on their own, joint action is imperative. The trust proposes that private pension funds become a key source of the necessary investment. According to Mr Graham Bishop, vice-president of Saloman Brothers International, these are expanding rapidly and could create a pool of financial assets in excess of Ecu6,000bn (Dollars 6,840bn) in the foreseeable future - 15 times member states' current foreign exchange reserves. But as Mr Jonathon Hoffman, economics director at Credit Suisse First Boston, points out, a new EC pension funds directive is urgently needed to allow this type of cross-border investment. Meanwhile, soaring levels of national debt, twice as high as current published figures if unfunded liabilities are taken into consideration, threaten to be a key problem hampering growth, Mr Hoffman says.</p>

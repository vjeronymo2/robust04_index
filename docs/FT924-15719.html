			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (4): Fog in channel, Europe cut off - Business in a wider market  Whether this famous old headline is apocryphal or not, it sums up an isolationist attitude that has sidelined too many British companies when operating in Europe THE hot topic in this issue of Software at Work is also a hot potato. In less than four months' time, from the start of 1993, new European value added tax (VAT) regulations will come into force, (see next page). Few companies are prepared for the change, which will effectively abolish import and export paperwork for intra-EC trade, but instead bring them within the scope of additional reporting requirements. But accounts and paperwork are only a part of a much broader subject which includes national regulations, language, and culture. All of these factors have an impact on software, not only for the developers of software packages, but for the international operators who have to integrate systems across different national borders. Software At Work has already touched on this topic in previous issues, when interviewing companies such as Unilever (Spring 1992 issue). There are a few truly global companies who have blazed trails in 'global software': they tend to be those whose goods have to be researched, marketed, and distributed globally, for whom economies of scale are vital. For them, every piece of software acquired, whether developed in-house or bought in as a package, is an investment which has to be maximised by integration across national borders. (See Citibank report, page six). It is difficult enough to select the 'right solution' for one country, let alone a dozen. A constant theme of Software At Work stories is the 'ownership' of systems and the wooing and consultation of users in their implementation. Add national considerations and regulations, and the problem escalates. Even if the package supplier has built in multi-currency and multi-lingual features, there are still such problems as price negotiations and support. Pricing can be a constant headache, with currency changes and complications of distribution. ECsoft, a multinational supplier of software tools and consultancy, claims to be the only supplier to have cracked this problem with a single price list in ECUs, and a single licence agreement for all its products. International co-ordination Dr Peter Maier is the managing director of Sony Europa, with headquarters in Germany. In previous jobs he had grappled with worldwide management issues, and for Sony he is now responsible for pan-European corporate planning and control, as well as for information systems serving a company with 13,500 employees and a DM15bn turnover. 'Sony started to think about pan-European management as an issue about four years ago,' he explains. 'The business concept of harmonising information technology in Europe means that we have to look at issues both as a user and a supplier of software.' He uses the term 'local globalisation' to describe the process by which standard software is adapted. The responsibility for this lies with Sony European Computer Services, based in Dusseldorf, and made up of 100 IT staff of different European nationalities. Co-ordination of software purchasing rests in the Dusseldorf HQ, which effectively becomes an assessor of various European packages. A pan-European conference dedicated to accounting gives staff the chance to 'audit' strong and weak features, including multi-currency, and VAT. For accounting (usually the first multi-national system to be considered), Sony chose D&amp;B software, formerly the McCormack and Dodge accounting package, largely because all the groundwork on national features was already there. Some aspects simply cannot be managed by the package route, partly because they rely on interpreting or linking existing systems. Sony, for instance, has built its own Executive Information System (EIS). 'Whatever we do, it must pay respect to the national culture,' comments Dr Maier. 'We have to tailor, modify, change colour and flavour. For instance, we standardise only as necessary: we have to know the price of something but don't care how it appears.' Good management means help, not control, to Dr Maier - 'the headquarters which can't provide a professional software service will die. It is two-thirds help, and one-third control. That ultimately enables the organisation to develop.' Languages As an increasing number of companies take an international view of software procurement, most major software developers have had to stay one step ahead, providing different language versions as well as catering for 'national' features. Nearly all software developments in the last few years have taken this into account, by separating the text that appears on screen from the actual code. This enables vendors in each country to translate most of the essentials (such as screen prompts and error messages), although quirks of language and keyboards still have to be overcome. Computer translation is becoming more practical, although companies such as Berlitz offer a more conventional route to translation. (UK consultancy Ovum has recently surveyed the tools available for 'natural translation' of products, and looked at the use of different languages in pan-European offices.) US companies have had a 'level playing field' at home on which to promote their products and find a user base. But in entering Europe, they have had to translate and adapt. Electronic mail supplier Verimation, for example, now supplies its Memo software in 12 languages, and provides pan-European support. DEC's All-in-One integrated office system was translated into 12 different Local Language Versions, but since 1988 has relied on a single international code base, from which all country or language versions derive. Microcom, a supplier of PC remote-control utilities, unable to set up individual offices for marketing and support, relies on local translation and distribution services. But these can hold snags, particularly where high-tech translators are thin on the ground: 'remote control' was once translated as a TV flip-channel gadget rather than as a remote access function. This highlights the need, stressed by Ovum and others, to use native speakers for translation. Regulations and culture UK software suppliers can no longer be insular, particularly in the area of accounting. They are likely to find their packages assessed alongside offerings which originated in Germany (such as SAP) or Scala, from Sweden, which supports 30 different currencies and supports up to 20 languages simultaneously. Coda, Tetra, Financial Solutions, Kewill, Edwards and Systems Union are among the UK companies who have risen to the challenge, and an increasing number of their installations cross national boundaries. Although it is comforting to know that steps are being taken to promote harmonisation, there is a limited amount of practical help available from European 'self-help groups' such as the EC's European Software and Systems Initiative, (ESSI) or the Eureka Software Factory Forum (a group dedicated to creating European software tools). For the most part, developers have to explore the rules and regulations for themselves, and be alert to every new change of regulation. This makes it all the more essential to have a flexible base to the package, allowing tailoring, parameterisation, and extensions. Without this, the cost of maintenance, borne by suppliers and passed on to users, becomes intolerable. Suppliers of accounting packages are in the front line in Europeanisation. Having grappled with the rules themselves to incorporate various required features in their packages, they are in a good position to guide and educate their user-base. D&amp;B Software, for instance, is alerting its users to the new VAT regulations with a folder of information which brings together all the new requirements, including new fields and codes. Yorkshire-based Coda sells its multi-lingual, multi-company accounting systems, based on IBM's AS400 minicomputer, to national and multi-national companies. Increasingly, it looks to Europe for new sales, and has tailored its software accordingly. 'Firstly, there are cosmetic differences in the way we record even the most basic data,' says Coda's managing director, Rodney Potts. 'Everybody knows that Belgian francs and Italian lire are recorded without decimals. 'Lire require larger value fields, and - outside the UK - the decimal separator is a comma. VAT is handled differently, too: for instance, Belgian VAT reports require a special modulus 11 check built into the account coding, while VAT accounting in Italy and Spain have substantially different implications to other EC countries.' But, he points out, there are also deep-seated cultural differences in European nations, rooted in historical factors. These explain, for example, the German emphasis on cost-accounting and the French habit of settling by cheque. Over the years, Coda has been building such national characteristics into its IAS suite. Another UK accounting house, Tetra, has essentially made a fresh start with its new Chameleon 2000 system. Julian Blomfield, who has waded through yards of paperwork to make Chameleon European, picks up on the cultural point made by Mr Potts. 'You can write software to do anything if you pay enough, but it's a matter of convincing people to make the change. No matter how much legislation there is, you've still got to get people to work together.' Tetra uses the Informix database as its flexible base, the aim being to incorporate into the core all the 'customised' national functions. The company recognises that the resellers will have an important role in guiding users through the complexities of an all-embracing package. 'A lot of end users may be looking to their local reseller,' predicts Mr Blomfield. 'They may well take on the role of consultants in helping users organise the way they use the software.'

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Arts: Today's Television What do you feel about grasping your stubbie in one hand while using your other to dangle your lamb chop in a billabong? We are promised that Keith Floyd will explain all this when he shows how to fish for yabbies in South Australia during today's episode of Floyd On Oz (8.00 BBC2). This Week tells us about cartels in the building materials business which supply public works projects, with Pounds 60m a year of excess profits going to concrete companies alone, all from your pocket and mine of course. Also of the connections between these companies and former government ministers, and the way governments have, for more than 10 years, delayed legislation to protect taxpayers and end cartels (8.30 ITV). True Stories (9.30 C4) unfolds the sad tale of teenage runaway Elaine Foley whose body was found in the Thames last year; she had been murdered. Three months earlier police had warned her against sleeping rough and, by chance, had been filmed doing so by another programme. That film, plus diaries, letters and the memories of parents and friends contribute to an account of her life and clues to her death.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed editorial: "Gorazde With Variations"] </F>   [Text] We cannot yet know whether the NATO bombing on  Monday [11 April], a repetition of the bombing on Sunday, at  Gorazde is the start of regular aerial activity against the  attacking Serbs or whether it was, once again, an isolated  punitive action. Experience from wars indicates that a military  situation cannot be decided solely by air power. Especially not  when the military operation is limited to one or two bombs that  happen to be dropped a day.    We also know from Hungarian history that a bit of bombing  like this only helps the bombed side find an excuse to do  something that it had not dared do before; however, it is not  suitable for changing the existing intentions. The still  unclear bombing [in 1942] of Kassa [Kosice, now in Slovakia] was  an excellent opportunity for the Hungarian Government to declare  war on the Soviet Union. One year later, when the British  destroyed the Zilahy house on the Rose Hill [district in  Budapest] with bombs, one thought that Budapest would quit the  war -- perhaps this was not the goal of the Brits anyway. In  addition to this, precisely at this time, the Germans were  marching an apparent irresistible force across the Russian  steppe. However, the English bombing was very good for creating  an Anglo-Saxon enemy image in Hungary.    When the United Nations, in the shape of NATO, began the  aerial attacks on the Serbian artillery and tanks besieging the  Bosnian towns, it was exactly two years late. A spectacular and  shocking aerial attack would only have made sense, perhaps, at  the very beginning of the Bosnian war. At that time, it might  have been able to deter those who were eager to fight from the  accidental unleashing of a war that many people had expected  with absolute certainty. However, at that time, no UN  resolutions or NATO preparations existed.    It is also questionable whether the current aerial attacks  have any military purpose. The liberation of Gorazde and the  other "protected areas," and that the Serbs suspend the military  maneuvers aimed at occupying these areas, could be such a goal.  This has little chance. If this is known in Budapest, it is  obviously known in Brussels, New York, Aviano, and in the field.  In that case, why are they bombing? We can risk saying that  there are many reasons, but that none of them have much to do  with establishing peace in Bosnia.    Teaching Karadzic and his followers a lesson may be a goal,  because they have become far too "insolent." They had the  audacity to launch an all-out attack on Gorazde when, after the  decision on the Bosnian-Croatian federation in Bosnia and the  confederation in Zagreb, it seemed that a prescription might be  found for a peace system in the whole former Yugoslavia.  Retaliation was needed for the disappointment. Perhaps it was  also among the assumed that an effect would be that that the  Serbs in Belgrade would give up their solidarity with their  brethren in Bosnia. This did not happen.    It is also possible that they also wanted to roast Moscow a  little bit. Although its unrequested involvement in the  ultimatum situation in Sarajevo indeed helped progress, since  then, Kozyrev and Co. have been saying a trifle too often that  Russia continues to be a superpower, a major power, that it  cannot be excluded, and so on. Perhaps, it had to be shown that  the earth can continue to move without it.    Finally, the fact that the bombing at Gorazde was again a  CNN  spectacular cannot be ignored. The U.S. public recently again  began to demand, more emphatically, that "we should at last do  something definite" in Bosnia. On the morning of 10 April, the  pictures of the determined action arrived in U.S. homes.</p>

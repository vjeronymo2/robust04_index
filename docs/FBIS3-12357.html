			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri has stated  that the purpose of this abominable crime against worshipers in  Sayyidat al-Najat Church was to sabotage general stability in  Lebanon. He said this crime, which coincided with an Israeli  escalation in southern Lebanon, is an attempt to divert world  attention from the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. He noted that  Israel is behind all this.    Speaker Birri called on the Lebanese to be vigilant and  responsible so that we will all emerge from this test with more  faith in Lebanon.</p>

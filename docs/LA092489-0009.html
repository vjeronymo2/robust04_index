			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR MY BROTHER  </P> <P> We knelt in the recess of a hollowed rock.  </P> <P> We lit a driftwood pyre with your magnifying glass.  </P> <P> The roasting pinecone opened itself  </P> <P> like a mother's hand. We ate the flesh  </P> <P> of its seeds. Nearby  </P> <P> the Mediterranean ticked without stop  </P> <P> above the angelfish  </P> <P> while behind our cave, in the cliff-side house,  </P> <P> she placed a note in Father's typewriter:  </P> <P> I give up,  </P> <P> since you want me still  </P> <P> and silent.  </P> <P> I believe the ink unfurled, frail as a spider,  </P> <P> when he smoothed out the sheet.  </P> <P> Then he crushed it  </P> <P> in his palm. Yes, I know, you and I had filled  </P> <P> our ears, like conch shells,  </P> <P> with noise. But no matter:  </P> <P> What happened next  </P> <P> we could not have stopped.  </P> <P> </P></p>

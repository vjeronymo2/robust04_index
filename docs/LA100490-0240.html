			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARMY FOOD?  </P> <P> Interested in packing some MREs on your next camping trip? They're available  locally at some military surplus stores, but bear this in mind: MREs are far  from delicious.  </P> <P> A hastily assembled taste panel found the freeze-dried potato particularly  "nauseating" -- especially when consumed "as is"(without rehydrating), as the  package suggests.  </P> <P> Beans in tomato sauce were better, rather like canned vegetarian beans, and the  beef stew was somewhat like Dinty Moore's, only grayer. After just one bite of  turkey and gravy, comments ranged from grudging tolerance to sheer disgust.  </P> <P> The sweets were a little better. A cherry nut cake that looks like something  that has been squashed in a schoolboy's back pocket for a week has a strong  almond flavor and is generally very sweet. The fruit mix, however, once  rehydrated with cool water, is very close to fruit cocktail. Skip the cheese  spread, though.  </P> <P> One taster suggested that the army increase combat pay to compensate the  soldiers for eating the "stuff." TONI TIPTON  </P></p>

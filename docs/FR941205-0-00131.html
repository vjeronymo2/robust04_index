			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorimetric Methods for Arsenic_A commenter requested that EPA not withdraw colorimetric methods for arsenic. Because the detection limits of these methods are very near the MCL for arsenic, colorimetric measurements do not provide a reliable indication of variability of, or trends in, ambient concentrations of arsenic in the water supply when these concentrations are less than the MCL. EPA believes the detection limit deficiency warrants withdrawal of colorimetric methods for arsenic. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, since EPA approves other methods that measure all twelve regulated metals, including arsenic, it is not cost-effective to measure arsenic separately with a colorimetric method. The cost of a complete, broad-spectrum metals analysis by atomic absorption or ICP is not reduced if arsenic is not included. And EPA knows of no situation where arsenic is the only metal to be determined in a compliance sample. EPA believes that there is no scientific reason or economic need for a colorimetric method that only measures arsenic. However, EPA notes that withdrawal of these methods does not preclude their use for other than compliance monitoring samples. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Methods 208.2 and 354.1_A commenter asked EPA to replace EPA Methods 208.2 (barium) and 354.1 (nitrite) with the equivalent methods SM 3113B and SM 4500&hyph;NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;B, which are published in the 18th edition of Standard Methods (APHA, 1992). EPA agrees and will withdraw Methods 208.2 and 354.1, since equivalent methods using the same equipment and procedures are approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA Method 340.2 (fluoride)_Commenters expressed concern that withdrawal of this ion-selective electrode method will require use of EPA Method 300.0, which requires purchase of an ion chromatograph. This is incorrect; only the EPA ion-selective electrode method will be withdrawn. The ASTM and SM methods, which use the same equipment as the EPA method, are approved for fluoride compliance determinations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydrazine Methods for Nitrate and Nitrite_A commenter agreed with EPA's withdrawal of hydrazine method 353.1, stating that the method is obsolete. The commenter, however, wanted EPA to make available at least one hydrazine method for nitrite and nitrate by approving SM 4500&hyph;NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;H. EPA is withdrawing Method 353.1 because hydrazine is carcinogenic and toxic, and creates a significant hazardous waste disposal problem. SM 4500&hyph;NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &hyph;H has the same problems and, therefore, cannot be approved. EPA believes users of hydrazine methods will be able to convert easily to the approved cadmium reduction methods for nitrate and nitrite by changing their reagent from hydrazine to cadmium when their supply of hydrazine is depleted. The cadmium methods, which have been approved for nitrate and nitrite since 1991, use the same equipment as the hydrazine methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flame AA for metals_Three commenters requested that flame atomic absorption (AA) and graphite furnace methods not be withdrawn. EPA has not withdrawn flame AA and graphite furnace methods published by ASTM or Standard Methods; only the obsolete EPA versions of these methods are withdrawn. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct Aspiration Flame AA Methods_Some commenters wanted EPA to expand the scope of these methods to include metals other than barium and nickel. EPA cannot expand the scope, because the methods are not sensitive enough to measure metals other than barium and nickel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Method 515.1_EPA received many comments requesting that this method not be withdrawn, primarily for two reasons. First, neither proposed replacement method, 552.1 or 515.2, covers all of the regulated chemicals that are in Method 515.1. Secondly, the new dalapon method (552.1) requires significantly different equipment, procedures and skills than Method 515.1. Four commenters agreed with EPA's proposal to withdraw Method 515.1, because a combination of Methods 515.2 and 552.1 meets their regulatory needs. EPA agrees with the majority of commenters and will not withdraw Method 515.1.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

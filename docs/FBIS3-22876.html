			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Janis Domburs: "The Black Market in Radioactive </F> Material is Expanding"]    [Excerpts] There is no evidence either to prove or disprove  reports that caesium and rubid purchased by Rimmele and Eichler  [not further identified] were brought to Latvia before being  transported to Cloten airport in Switzerland. Nonetheless,  before this event even occurred, police and special services in  West Europe had begun to pay attention to the fact that  following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the trade in  contraband radioactive material from the East has grown  considerably. Latvia has no choice -- it is situated directly  between the global powers of East and West. Is it inevitable  that it should become a transit corridor for such contraband?    "Last year, even INTERPOL became anxious over the trade in  radioactive metals; principally, Germany. Now reunited with  East Germany, the Germans are evidently aware, better than  anyone else, that these materials were available to the special  services which were linked throughout East Europe. And these  relations are still vivid...," this is how Juris Jasinkevics,  head of Latvia's national bureau of the international police  organization INTERPOL, sums up the situation. Thus far, his  bureau has not been tasked by his colleagues in other countries  to investigate possible trade in radioactive metals here in  Latvia. Over the last half a year, only one concrete case has  been uncovered. The inquiry, which came from Germany, was  connected with a car which was stopped at the German-Polish  border while trying to return after delivering a load of so-  called colored metals to Germany; border police detected  radioactive traces in the car. In this case, the only link to  Latvia was the fact that the car turned out to be the property  of a Latvian company. In the export of these so-called colored  metals, Latvia had been the transit country -- the load was  delivered from Russia through Belarus. The reason for the  radioactive traces remains unexplained, because German police  had not been able to find where the load had been delivered.    The fact that a special working group on trade in  radioactive  metals was established by the Ministry of Home Affairs in  January, is evidence that the significance of the problem is  actually growing. INTERPOL has organized two international  conferences on criminal activity linked with environmental  pollution and illegal trade in radioactive material. Copies of  the reports are in the possession of the Latvian bureau and they  reveal that at the last such meeting held in Lyons in September,  it was the German representative who expressed extreme anxiety  over the sharp increase in the number of such crimes in Germany.  At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that in cases  where the presence of radioactive elements was suspected,  radioactivity was actually detected in relatively few instances  (in 1992 -- 18 out of 158 inspections). He stated that material  often toted as radioactive, is in being sold by taking advantage  of prospect buyer's credulity. Among every case when  radioactivity was actually detected, there has not been a single  case of material being discovered which could be used in the  production of nuclear weapons, which is the most dreaded  scenario. In reports delivered at INTERPOL conferences, "Red  Mercury," as an example, is most often mentioned. As DIENA has  already reported, citing German press reports, this was the  material Johann Rimmele supposedly had been planning to buy in  China. There are different opinions concerning its usage.  INTERPOL experts are of the opinion that "Red Mercury" is a  material which can be used as an element in making detonators  for plutonium-based bombs. The German and Dutch representatives  at INTERPOL directed attention toward Russia as a source of the  trade in dangerous materials. The Dutch representative  emphasized the participation of former Red Army officers -- it  is understood that they are cheating, by selling relatively  useless goods as strategic material. [passage omitted]    Dzintars Kalnins is the head engineer of the Center for  Nuclear Research at the Latvian Academy of Science in Salaspils  -- an institution where Latvia's most highly qualified  specialists in this field are working. Therefore, the  explanations and comments of Dz. Kalnins can evidently be  treated as the opinion of a Latvian expert.    First of all, it should be stated precisely that the  valuable  materials involved in the famous Lake Constance episode were not  simply rare metals, but enriched isotopes. They are made by  growing them in a crystal reticle. Isotopes are applied in  precise technologies, in radio electronics, computer techniques,  etc., where the respective isotopes -- perfect, precise atom  crystals -- are necessary. In Latvia, such isotopes are not  being manufactured, due to lack of necessary equipment. As Mr.  Kalnins told us, the institutes which possess the special  equipment needed to enrich these elements are situated near  Moscow. "These institutes are practically under military  management -- so it was during the time of the Soviet Union, and  so it is now, that in the field of exact sciences, at least in  this branch, the military line is being developed in the first  order" -- he said. [passage omitted]    To the question of what amount of rare metal contraband  there  is in Latvia and if there are inspection facilities to detect  radioactive material at the border, the answer of the expert was  skeptical -- he allows for the fact that customs officers, for  the sake of financial benefit or due to a lack of knowledge,  often "turn a blind eye." Also, they do not have adequate  equipment to detect radioactive shipments. Naturally, at the  airport any isotope -- radioactive or otherwise -- would be  discovered by a common detector, since it is a metal...  Nevertheless, the situation in radioactive control is hopeful  -- at the Center for Nuclear Research there is a laboratory  being established, where the certification and attestation of  radioactivity detecting devices will be possible. There are also  plans to organize training for customs officers and border  guards in this laboratory. Judging by what Dz. Kalnins said,  customs officers and border guards are not the only ones having  problems: Recently, some kind of "mafiosi" called me and, not  revealing their names, offered me a great amount of money to  check the radioactivity of some metal in their possession. I  replied that I do not make deals with anonymous people...    A rhetorical question could be put as to whether it would  not be in Russia's interests if there were strict controls over  the export of isotopes?    "Of course, and I am sure they would do it gladly, but I  suppose that the Mafia has grabbed it in her hands" -- answered  Dzintars Kalnins.    To be continued...</p>

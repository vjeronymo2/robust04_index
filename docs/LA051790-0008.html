			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: PORT HUENEME;  </P> <P> STUDY CITES DEMAND FOR RV PARK IN CITY  </P> <P> The Port Hueneme City Council was told Wednesday that research shows there is a  demand for a recreational vehicle park in the city, but about 150 residents  showed up to oppose the idea.  </P> <P> The City Council is considering construction of a 10-acre RV park on the east  end of Port Hueneme beach on the city's border with Oxnard. The park would  serve 144 vehicles and offer a pool and shower facilities.  </P> <P> The study showed that "there is a market for the park. It appears building  something like this would have a very good chance of making a go of it in this  area," said Jim Hanks, the city's financial director, after reviewing a report  from a private contractor hired to study the feasibility of the project.  </P> <P> No action was taken by the council. The City Council will await completion of  the report by Williams-Kuebelbeck and Associates of Irvine, which will analyze  the financial feasibility of the project, at a cost of $20,000.  </P> <P> About 150 residents living near the project showed up to urge the council to  scrap the idea because of traffic and noise concerns. The council refused to  open the meeting for public comment and deferred the issue to an undetermined  later date. One resident had to be removed by police for disturbing the meeting  despite admonishments from Mayor Dorill Wright.  </P> <P> Also at the meeting, the council took the first step toward approving an  ordinance requiring that all new development employ water conservation devices,  such as low-flow shower heads.  </P> <P> All cities will be required to pass such an ordinance by Jan. 1, 1992. "We are  just getting the jump a little bit on what the state is requiring," said Tom  Figg, the Port Hueneme community development director.  </P> <P> "We felt it was important, at least for all new construction coming on line,  that they install ultra-low consumption plumbing fixtures," Figg said.  </P> <P> The council's move comes in response to imminent water cutbacks for the city  and "a general consciousness of the need to conserve what traditionally has  been a wasted resource," Figg said.  </P> <P> The ordinance will become effective July 1.

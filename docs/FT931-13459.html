			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Bank of England Governor: Surprise choice of editor as Bank deputy RUPERT PENNANT-REA, named the next deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been described as 'a billiard ball inside a velvet glove,' a phrase reflecting both his informal friendly manner and his inner reserves of toughness. Although the move from editor of The Economist to central banker might seem an un-expected one, Mr Pennant-Rea has worked at the Bank, from 1973 to 1977, on secondment from the research department of the GMWU municipal workers' union. He left the Bank to join Mrs Sarah Hogg, then economics editor of The Economist, now head of the prime minister's policy unit. Although he had no background in journalism, Mr Pennant-Rea quickly displayed an ability to write lucid, stylish articles at great speed with no revisions or second thoughts - and the ability to go home promptly, his work done, avoiding the profession's vice of procrastination. He became the magazine's economics editor on Mrs Hogg's departure in 1981, and became editor in 1986, after Mr Andrew Knight, now chairman of News International. There were several other candidates for the job, including Mr Simon Jenkins, later editor of the Times and a journalist with a considerably wider public reputation. But there was little doubt among the magazine's staff that Mr Pennant-Rea would get the job. His period as editor has seen a sharp increase in the magazine's circulation, which now stands at more than 500,000, four fifths of it outside the UK. It has also seen a fierce editorial commitment to policies of monetary stringency for the UK and to sterling's parity inside the ERM - an approach that will have endeared Mr Pennant-Rea to Mr Eddie George, the new governor. When sterling was forced to leave the ERM in September last year, The Economist's first reaction was to call for an immediate move to full monetary union. By coincidence, he spent much of the past week negotiating with lawyers a lengthy apology to - among others - the Bank of England over the magazine's allegations that the Bank had obstructed or impeded investigation of the Blue Arrow affair. The apology took up a full page of yesterday's issue. He was not approached about the Bank job until yesterday morning, after the article appeared. Mr Pennant-Rea grew up in what was then Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, and went to Trinity College, Dublin and Manchester University - a background that has occasionally set him at odds with the conventional assumptions of the establishment. He is young by the standards of the deputy-governorship - today is his 45th birthday. One journalist who knows him and the Bank well said yesterday: 'I'd describe him as highly motivated, and an exceedingly imaginative choice for the job. He'll bring vision and vigour to the musty corridors, and he won't be afraid to upset people. He'll undoubtedly have his sights on the governorship itself.' Whatever his future role, his place in history is secure. He is almost certainly the only deputy governor of the Bank of England to write a thriller. Gold Foil, published in 1978, contains a few mildly erotic love scenes. The book reflects Mr Pennant-Rea's character in a rather different way, however - it is the result of disciplined months of getting up early to write a batch of words every day before breakfast.</p>

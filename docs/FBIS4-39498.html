			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 108 (598)] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk opposed the idea of  forming unions based on ethnic or religious principles in the  space of the former USSR. Addressing voters in Kharkov Region  Monday evening, the Ukrainian president criticized the  Belarusian Premier, Vyacheslav Kebich, for his call for forming  a union between three Slav countries -- Ukraine, Russia and  Belarus.    In Kravchuk's view, the forming of such alliance will lead  to  the emergence of "Asian, Muslim and other unions, to mass  migrations and to war."    In answer to voters' questions the president said that he  had  no right to sign the treaty on Ukraine's full membership in the  economic union of CIS countries, since the parliament had not  authorized him accordingly.    IF Note: At the CIS summit held in Moscow on 15 April  Kravchuk signed a document on Ukraine's joining the treaty as an  associated member. He sees no fundamental difference between  being a full-fledged and an associated member, he told Interfax.  "The status of associated member does not prevent us from taking  an active part in the economic union," Kravchuk said. He  referred to the circumstance that Ukraine's parliament ratified  the founding documents with reservations. "The reservations are  still in force, and I cannot ignore them when signing  documents," Kravchuk pointed out.    As Kravchuk said, Ukraine's activity on the world scene must  not be confined to interaction with the former Soviet republics.  Next Tuesday in Laxembourg he will sign an agreement on  partnership and cooperation with the European Union, the  president told voters.    IF Note: So Ukraine will be the first CIS country to sign  the agreement, which was initialled by its Foreign Minister,  Anatoliy Zlenko, during his visit to Brussels last February. A  number of European Union members link their ratification of the  agreement to Ukraine's joining the Nuclear Nonproliferation  Treaty. The Ukrainian leadership is against such linkage.</p>

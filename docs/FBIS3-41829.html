			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pristina, January 24 (ATA) -- There was a boom of  typhus in Kosova last week. Thirty Albanian patients infected  by typhus were sent to the infective clinic of Pristina. The  physicians warned there are other patients infected by typhus,  but this number is not yet made evident. As a result of this  serious epidemiological situation in Kosova, there are several  patients infected by hepatitis and rubella who are being treated  at home because of there is no room in the Pristina clinics.    Physicians think that the virus of salmonella must have been  in the water. Before the boom of the epidemic in Shtimje, in  which typhus cases have been in a greater number than in other  zones of Kosova, the violent Serbian organs forced the only  Albanian epidemiologist to live his job under the pretext that  "there was no need for him".    The violent Serbian organs in Kosova have expelled some 2000  Albanian physicians and other medical workers from the medical  institutions of the region.    Five hundred Albanian medical workers have been warned to  leave their jobs recently in Mitrovica and in the communes near  the president of Kosova Republic, Mr. Ibrahim Rugova, appealed  in his recent press conference to international medical  institutions to give aid to Kosova in order to face the grave  situation there.</p>

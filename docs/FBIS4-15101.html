			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Omar Uzarashvili: "Lvov Mayoralty Will Cooperate </F> With U.S. Government"]    [Text] Vasyl Shpitser, chairman of the Lvov City  Administration, and Emmy Osborn, first secretary of the U.S.  International Development Agency [IDA], have signed a memorandum  on mutual understanding between the agency and the Lvov City  Administration. As Vasyl Shpitser noted, the mayoralty has  reached a new level of cooperation and assistance to the city.  Since IDA is subordinated directly to the U.S. Government, it  can be said that the Lvov Administration has begun cooperation  with the U.S. Administration.    Cooperation with the Lvov Administration will proceed  according to a drafted program. The project "Municipal Finances  and Management" is to be implemented first. As project director  Eric Chatwind stated, the project includes several programs.  The agency's permanent adviser is to arrive in Lvov, and will  assist the Lvov Administration for two years. Moreover, also  expected are advisers on specific issues who will arrive during  the implementation of the project. Lvov specialists will attend  special courses in the United States, and scientific seminars  will be held in Lvov. In the near future, the U.S. side will  grant to the Lvov Administration $2 million to purchase  computers and other equipment necessary to ensure regular  operation of the mayoralty. Additionally, the agency will help  the Lvov Mayoralty to receive a considerable 17-year loan from  the World Bank, which will be used for municipal needs. I  promise the mayor that we will bring with us all the knowledge  in municipal management that exists in the United States, and  that we will share this knowledge with you, Eric Chatwind  pledged.    Lvov has won the right to implement the U.S. project in a  tough competition among such cities as Kiev, Odessa, Mykolayiv,  or Ternopil.</p>

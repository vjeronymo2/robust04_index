			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Letter: Realism needed for UK leisure training Sir, The leisure industry employs 2.4m people and the tourism industry alone earned Pounds 7.1bn in foreign exchange in 1991. Its ability to provide a top-class service and a quality product is important to the economic health of the country. The survey on progress towards the UK training targets for national vocational qualifications (NQV) in the leisure industry, showed that the training target of 50 per cent of the workforce to be working towards NVQ level 3 by 1996 is optimistic, based on the present progress. The Confederation of British Industry and the government should consider setting more realistic and achievable targets. The structure for the provision of NVQs is complex and overlapping and consideration should be given to reducing the number of awarding bodies and industry lead bodies. Total quality management and national vocational qualifications are 'synergistic' approaches which need to fall under one, rather than two government departments. National vocational qualifications must be implemented in a streamlined and cost effective manner, if Britain's leisure industry is to compete with Europe.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Survey of Portugal (6): Premier faces hard choice - Politics / A look at the prospects of parties in next year's election Anibal Cavaco Silva, Portugal's prime minister since 1985, is facing one of the most difficult decisions of his career. Before next summer he will have to determine whether to stand again as prime minister in the October 1995 election or choose the easier but less-appealing option of running for the presidency in 1996. Mr Cavaco Silva readily acknowledges a taste for executive power and would prefer the premiership to the president's limited role as political arbiter and constitutional guardian. But he has a weak appetite for the constraints of minority or coalition government. He is likely to run as prime minister again only if convinced that his centre-right Social Democrats (PSD) can win another overall majority. Most analysts believe that a third consecutive majority will be within the PSD's reach by mid-1995 enabling Mr Cavaco Silva to take the gamble. Given the lack of a successor to match his electoral appeal or dominance of the PSD, Mr Cavaco Silva will have to take into account that his own withdrawal as a candidate for the premiership could mean the difference between absolute victory, relative victory or defeat for his party. After nine years in office, much of the original popularity of Mr Cavaco Silva's government has been eroded. The pro-market reform drive of the early years has lost momentum. The government is accused by left and right of bestowing patronage and favouring political supporters. What the British would call sleaze is undermining confidence in the public administration as officials investigate several cases of alleged corruption. But the root of the government's waning popularity is recession. Real wages have fallen by more than three percentage points over the past two years after three years of strong expansion and unemployment has increased by more than two points to 6.8 per cent. Recent eruptions of anti-government discontent, from attacks on trucks of imported Spanish fish to protests against a bridge toll increase, are symptoms of underlying concerns about jobs and living standards. However, the economic cycle is evolving in Mr Cavaco Silva's favour, as it has throughout his tenure as prime minister. Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialist Party (PS), believes Portugal's economic recovery, which began in mid-1994, will be too slow to have a strong impact on disposable income before the election. But the government will undoubtedly do everything possible to shape the pattern of growth. Some businesses say public works and the application of European Union funds are being delayed to maximise their influence on voters. The PS is largely fighting the PSD on its own ground, promoting itself as being more efficient at running a market economy. The party Socialists have long left behind commitments to nationalisation and a high level of state intervention. Mr Guterres has no complexes about not offering a radical alternative. 'In a modern society, political ruptures generally lead to disaster,' he says. 'Policy differences are today a question of degree.' In fact, Portuguese parties tend to be more to the right than their names indicate. Mr Guterres says his party represents a synthesis of traditional European social democracy and a left-wing liberalism originating in the US. The PSD has been described as 'liberal with an inclination towards social solidarity'. Both parties are strongly committed to Europe and, with different nuances, liberalisation of the economy. Education is the priority issue for the PS. Portugal's education system is, in the words of an independent foreign consultant, a 'national disgrace'. Mr Guterres believes the government has wasted extensive EU funds in professional training because no overall strategy or articulation with the traditional education system was devised. More prosaically, the PSD asks how the Socialists will fund their education plans. On economic issues, the PS accuses Mr Cavaco Silva of engineering an excessive appreciation of the escudo by imposing high interest rates. Mr Guterres believes Portugal had the possibility of fostering higher growth through lower interest rates without compromising nominal convergence with the rest of the EU. He says that despite a tough exchange-rate policy, the government has undermined convergence by allowing a large budgetary overrun in 1993 and that the prime minister may now be prepared to let inflation and public deficit targets slip in the approach to next year's election. Dissatisfaction with the government is widespread and a recent opinion poll put the PS ahead of the PSD. But the PS lacks unity and Mr Guterres's hold over the party is not comparable with the prime minister's dominance of the PSD. The Socialist leader is in a difficult position. For some voters he lacks the proven technocratic prowess of Mr Cavaco Silva. For others, he lacks the heart and emotion traditionally associated with the left in Portugal. Several analysts believe he may be able to prevent Mr Cavaco Silva from winning another overall majority but will fall short of his objective of winning a clear majority for the PS. One man who may not be sorry if no party gains an absolute majority is Mario Soares, the president and a former Socialist leader. He has questioned whether single-party majority governments are the most favourable for Portugal. It was one of the provocative statements he appears to relish and which are often interpreted as thinly-veiled attacks on the government. Mr Soares is prevented by the constitution from standing for a third consecutive term in 1996. General Antonio Ramalho Eanes also served two consecutive terms as president from 1976 to 1986. But he is now eligible to stand again and looks increasingly likely to do so. He was a cornerstone of democracy in the turbulent period that followed the 1974 revolution.</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARREOLA FINDS A DISTANCE SHE LIKES;  </P> <P> CSUN JUNIOR PROMISES TO STAY WITH 1,500 AFTER THIRD AT MT. SAC  </P> <P> Ever since Darcy Arreola was eliminated in the semifinals of the 1,500 meters  of last summer's Olympic Trials, friends -- including Cal State Northridge  track Coach Don Strametz -- have been telling the Northridge runner that the  3,000 meters is the race best suited to her talents.  </P> <P> She lacks the required finishing speed to be a great 1,500 runner, the theory  goes. But Arreola, a 20-year-old junior, doesn't give much credence to that  theory. Especially after finishing third in the invitational 1,500 meters at  the Mt. San Antonio College Relays in Walnut on Sunday.  </P> <P> "I'm not sure if it's because everyone keeps telling me that I should run the  3,000 or what," Arreola said. "But I feel like I can still accomplish a lot  more in the 1,500. I at least want to run under 4:15 before I give up on that  event."  </P> <P> Arreola -- who placed fourth in the 3,000 (9 minutes, 18.24 seconds) on  Saturday night -- appears capable of reaching her goal after running a  season-best 4:17.35 on Sunday.  </P> <P> Traditionally a front-runner, Arreola stayed in the middle of the pack for the  first 1,000 meters. Fifth at the 400-meter mark in 66.4 seconds and seventh at  the 800 mark (2:16), Arreola moved into fourth with a lap left.  </P> <P> "I felt very strong with a 400 to go," said Arreola, the defending NCAA  Division II champion in the 1,500 and 3,000. "Usually I'm dead at that point,  but today I wasn't tired."  </P> <P> Arreola moved into third with 300 meters left and eased into second 50 meters  later. She caught leader Leah Pells of Canada with 150 meters left, but was  outkicked by Pells (4:16.50) and Bridget Smyth (4:16.92) in the final straight.  </P> <P> "I should have kept going past her -- just kept my same rhythm -- but for some  reason I slowed down when I caught her," Arreola said. "It was like, I did a  good job to catch up to her, now what?"  </P> <P> Arreola's talent has Strametz pondering a distance triple at this year's  Division II championships in Hampton, Va., May 24-27.  </P> <P> "The 5,000 is three hours after the 1,500 final and the 3,000 is the day  before," Strametz explained. "So it is possible."  </P> <P> Arreola -- who has qualified for the national meet in the 800, 1,500, 3,000 and  5,000 -- is against the idea, however.  </P> <P> "I don't think so," she said. "The 3,000 seems too long as it is."  </P> <P> Having run a personal best of 4:15.35 to place 10th in The Athletics Congress  championships two years ago, Arreola's top priority at the moment is the 1,500.  </P> <P> "I think I'm ready for a big improvement in that race. I think I'll run much  faster before the season's done."  </P> <P> Like Arreola, Tyrone Jeffries of Northridge has also qualified for the Division  II championships in four events, and he'll definitely triple in the national  meet.  </P> <P> "Right now we're looking at him running in both hurdles and the sprint relay,"  Northridge assistant Tony Veney said.  </P> <P> Having posted Division II qualifying marks in the 110-meter high hurdles and as  a member of the 400 relay, Jeffries met qualifying standards in the 400-meter  intermediate hurdles and the 200 meters at Mt. SAC.  </P> <P> Jeffries finished first in the open 400 hurdles with a season-best of 51.83  seconds and placed fifth in the open 200 with a wind-aided time of 21.03.  </P></p>

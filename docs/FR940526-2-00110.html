			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Transportation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.1&blank;Component Overview <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Transportation component consisted of expenses related to private and public transportation. The private transportation category contained expenses related to owning and operating a vehicle in each area. The public transportation category focused on the cost of air fares from each location to a common point within the contiguous 48 states. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As in previous surveys, Runzheimer used national average expenditure data to combine the private and public transportation relative cost differences between each allowance area and the Washington, D.C., area to arrive at a total Transportation component index. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2&blank;Private Transportation Methodology <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer determined that an accurate and reasonable approach to measure transportation costs was to select and analyze three commonly driven vehicles (a domestic auto, an import auto and a utility vehicle) in all areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New vehicles were the basis for developing the transportation-cost calculations. Although Runzheimer could have developed costs from the premise that ``identical'' used vehicle would be purchased from auto dealers in each location, Runzheimer believed that costing new vehicles reduced the potential for inconsistencies due to value judgments concerning used vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2.1&blank;Vehicle Selection and Pricing <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As mentioned above, Runzheimer selected and priced a domestic auto, an import auto, and a utility vehicle as the basic vehicle types to cost in all locations. We based our selection of these vehicle types on their popularity in the United States as demonstrated by owner registration data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To select a specific make and model within each vehicle type, Runzheimer identified the top-selling models in each car class. For these models, Runzheimer's research associates collected new vehicle prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At each auto dealership in the sample, Runzheimer recorded the suggested retail prices of the three vehicles plus any additional charges, such as shipping, excise tax, dealer prep, and additional dealer markup. Runzheimer used the suggested retail prices (not negotiated prices) in the analysis. Runzheimer also included documentation fees as part of the new-vehicle costs in Hawaii. Contacted dealerships explain that a documentation fee is charged on a new-car purchase to cover paperwork costs. Runzheimer did not include a fee for the Washington, D.C., area and other tropical areas because dealers in those areas do not typically charge a documentation fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The three vehicles selected for analysis were: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Domestic Vehicle_Ford Taurus GL 4-door sedan 3.0L 6cyl <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Utility Vehicle_Chevrolet S10 Blazer 4X4 2 door 4.3L 6 cyl <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Import Vehicle_Honda Civic DX 4-door sedan 1.5L 4 cyl <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Runzheimer priced 1993 models in this survey. All vehicles were equipped with standard options, such as automatic transmission, AM/FM stereo radio and air conditioning. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Car dealers in the Washington, D.C., area do not recommend vehicle rustproofing. However, it is suggested or recommended in allowance areas. Therefore, we include rustproofing as an add-on in all allowance areas, but not in the Washington, D.C., area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.2.2&blank;Vehicle Trade Cycle <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Calculating the cost to own and operate a vehicle requires that two important factors be determined: miles driven and time period of ownership. In the automobile industry, these two factors are known collectively as a vehicle's ``trade cycle.'' The trade cycle is stated as a length of time either in months or years, and the total number of miles driven in that time period (e.g., four-year, 60,000-mile trade cycle). This information is required to compute annual costs related to fuel, oil, tires, maintenance and depreciation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming with previous living-cost reports, Runzheimer used a four-year 60,000-mile trade cycle in all areas based upon the following information: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The Internal Revenue Service has used this trade cycle for many years to compute the allowable cents-per-mile reimbursement rate for persons who drive their personal vehicle for business purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The four-year time period coincides with the typical length of a vehicle loan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;U.S. Department of Energy statistics for 1988 show that the U.S. average for number of vehicles miles driven was: 18,595 per household and 10,246 miles per vehicle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer has been unable to find conclusive statistics on average annual miles driven per vehicle in any allowance area. In the past, Runzheimer contacted car dealers to obtain their observations on average odometer mileage on trade-in vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

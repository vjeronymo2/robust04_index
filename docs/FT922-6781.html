			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Fed decides not to ease rates THE DOLLAR regained some ground against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday after the Federal Reserve decided once again not to ease interest rates, writes James Blitz. The Fed's decision not to signal a cut in the Fed Funds rate on the second day of its Federal Open Market Committee meeting took many dealers by surprise, leading to good dollar buying in late trading in Europe. The US unit rose  1/4 pfennig on the day to DM1.6020 in London. It also rallied against the Japanese yen, closing in London at Y129.65 after a previous finish of Y129.10. In New York the dollar eased back to end at DM1.6005 and Y129.55. The vast differential between American and European short-term rates is certain to cause worries in the market again. But some analysts said the dollar's rise yesterday was an indication that it will have a floor in D-Mark trad-ing at DM1.58 for some time. There were several signs that the market was taking a more bullish view of the US currency. One was a reduction in the rates of dollar volatility quoted in options trading against the D-Mark. This sank below 10 per cent in early New York trading for the first time in a week. Some dealers expect further slippage ahead of the US Memorial Day extended weekend. One-month dollar/D-Mark volatility was offered at 10 per cent and bid at 9.8, compared to Tuesday's 10.4/10.6 per cent. Dollar/yen volatility dropped even more drastically to 8.2/8.3 per cent for one-month options from Tuesday's 9.0 per cent. Another indication was that markets reacted calmly to poor figures for the US trade deficit, which showed a rise to Dollars 5.82bn in March from a revised Dollars 3.29bn for the month before. Analysts suggested that higher imports spelled rising demand and economic recovery. Economists also suggested that US rates might not be reduced after all. An analyst at Swiss Bank Corp in London said: 'The decision to cut rates is a closer-run thing for the Fed than the market realises.' He claimed that the authorities in the US are particularly concerned that a cut might prove to be counter-productive, as this would lead to higher inflation and an adverse reaction from the bond market. Long-term US rates are much higher than short-term ones. Even higher yields for long-term borrowing will damage recovery hopes since the majority of mortgage rates are linked to them. On the European crosses, there was little movement. The D-Mark mostly consolidated its gains this week against other European currencies, although the pound rose 75 basis points to DM2.9325. The German currency also declined against the yen, ending at DM1.2350 per 100 yen from DM1.2325.</p>

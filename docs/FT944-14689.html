			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / International Company News: Kaufhof and Horten propose store merger Kaufhof Holding, the German retailer, and Horten, Germany's fourth-biggest department store group, are proposing to merge their retail operations within the Kaufhof group, a joint statement said yesterday, agencies report. The proposal reflects Kaufhof's determination to push through rationalisation in the depressed department store sector. Kaufhof took a majority stake in Horten this summer and is offering to buy out the 41 per cent of Horten's shares it does not already own. Horten shareholders are being offered DM200 a share, which values the company at about DM1bn (Dollars 666m). Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Elchzhi Suleyman and Farid Arifoglu: "Crisis </F> Overcome"]    [Text] The National Assembly got down to business on 23  May. The sitting was brief--approximately two hours. The main  topic was the absence of a quorum and the search for a way out  of the parliamentary crisis. We recall that 15 deputies had  walked out of the last sitting of the National Assembly,  protesting the exclusion from the agenda of the question of the  Bishkek Protocol, and that it has not been possible to muster a  quorum since--34 votes (theoretically they could have been  mustered--were the hajji faithful to have returned from Mecca,  were the sick to have gotten up from their hospital beds...).    As moved by R. Guliyev, three options of a way out of the  parliamentary crisis were discussed. The first presupposes, in  the speaker's words, "recognition of their responsibility by  some of the deputies who walked out and their return to perform  their duty." An appeal to the president that the latter, by  edict, lower the quorum to 26 votes was the second option, which  the deputies found more attractive than the others. The last  option was the dissolution of parliament by edict of the head of  state.    According to the information presented by S. Mirzoyev,  Supreme Council Secretariat general secretary, there are in the  constitution lacunae in this sphere: It does not contain  mechanisms for a way out of such situations. In similar  instances in world practice the president avails himself of his  right to dissolve parliament. S. Mirzoyev himself considers the  second the optimum option. "It is not entirely legitimate, it is  true, but it is the most acceptable way," he observed.    Some 28 deputies of the 30 present voted for the second  option--an appeal to the president. Two members of the National  Assembly--Suret Guseynov and Mirgamza Efendiyev--did not take  part in the vote. S. Guseynov had earlier moved that the speaker  enter into negotiations with the opposition deputies in order to  bring them back to the meeting hall.    On 25 May the National Assembly once again acquired a  quorum.  The 15 deputies who had walked out in the past week returned. T.  Gasymov delivered a statement on their behalf. He described the  walkout of the group of deputies as an entirely normal  occurrence in parliamentary practice in keeping with  constitutional provisions, the Status of the Deputy Act, and the  National Assembly standing orders.    "But a campaign of slander was mounted against us in the  news  media: The opposition is allegedly opposed to an end to the war,  is sabotaging the work of parliament, and is preventing a pay  raise for the working people," T. Gasymov continued. "We  emphatically reject these attacks and, not wishing the needy  strata of the populace to suffer from an exacerbation of  relations between the authorities and the opposition, we are  returning to parliament. We will continue to struggle against  the commitment of Russian troops to Azerbaijan under the aegis  of the CIS peacekeeping force. We are opposed to `peace for  land.' We believe that the Bishkek Protocol is contrary to the  interests of the Azerbaijani people and demand its discussion in  parliament," T. Gasymov said.    Rasul Guliyev, the head of parliament, viewed T. Gasymov's  statement as "unobjective."    He was followed to the rostrum by Etibar Mamedov. He noted  the connection between the approach of the deadline for the  signing of the oil contracts and the exacerbation of the  domestic political situation and criticized the policy of  holdups in privatization: "A dangerous trend toward the  concentration of control over economic potential in the hands of  three or four persons has emerged." According to E. Mamedov,  this trend is fraught with negative repercussions.    Deputy E. Mamedov then announced his withdrawal from the  National Assembly until he obtains explanations concerning the  campaign of persecution on the part of the law enforcement  authorities and the news media that has been mounted against him  and members of his party.    At an impromptu news conference in the lobby of the Supreme  Council, Etibar Mamedov declared he had never recognized the  "irreconcilable opposition" concept. In the opinion of the  leader of the National Independence Party, the opposition should  be constructive and open to cooperation. He is, as before,  opposed to the commitment of Russian troops in any capacity.    After this, parliament finally got down to legislative  activity. The Commodity Exchanges Act was adopted without major  criticism.    After the break, the members of parliament embarked on a  discussion of the draft budget of the Azerbaijani Republic for  1994. As Dzhumshud Nuriyev, chairman of the Commission of the  National Assembly for Control of the Budget, announced, revenue  in the current year will constitute 138.5 billion manat,  expenditure, 181.4 billion; a deficit, therefore, of 42.9  billion, which should constitute approximately 7 percent of the  gross national product. Dzh. Nuriyev sharply criticized the  unduly high, in his opinion, appropriations for maintenance of  the organs of state power and administration, which amount to  almost 10 percent of budget expenditure.    The head of the parliamentary commission sees as the way to  reduce the budget deficit the adoption and realization of an  official program of privatization, stabilization of the exchange  rate of the manat, a flexible monetary policy, and the sale to  the public of government bonds.    Dzh. Nuriyev observed that capital investments would be  allocated mainly for the development of the oil industry and  agriculture--sectors in which investments are recouped and  profits are produced most rapidly.    As ascertained in the course of the debate, members of the  National Assembly were worried particularly by how far measures  of the social protection of the population had been taken into  consideration in the draft. Fikret Yusifov, first deputy  minister of finance, emphasized that the government would not go  the route of an increase in the minimum wage since this would  merely signify a further increase in the gap in income between  the high- and low- income categories of the population, not, in  fact, improving the position of the latter. According to F.  Yusifov, work is under way at this time on the formulation of a  mechanism of a rise in salaries according to grade in order to  alleviate the position of the strata that are socially the most  vulnerable.    Summing up the sitting, the speaker briefly analyzed the  country's economic situation and charted ways out of the crisis.    The fall in production, the high spending on defense, tax  evasion on the part of a multitude of commercial and industrial  facilities, the delay in the reforms--such are the causes of the  Republic's serious situation. It is essential for overcoming the  crisis, in R. Guliyev's opinion, to halt the decline and achieve  a growth of production and find markets for the sale of the  manufactured product. Only high-quality merchandise, for whose  production investments are needed, can compete successfully on  these markets.    Internal credit resources and external capital investments  are the sources of the latter. Internal credit resources are at  this time down to nothing. Moreover, 200 billion manat of loans  not backed by real resources have been granted. For the  formation of internal credit resources it is essential to  undertake privatization and the formation of stock companies and  to channel the funds thus obtained into the financing of the  enterprises. But the results will show through only in 6-12  months. Until then it is necessary to liberalize export-import  transactions in order to have earned approximately $500-$600  million by the year's end.    It is necessary to avail ourselves of credit from foreign  governments and international financial organizations. Credit of  $1 billion would be sufficient to stabilize the economy and  create reserves for its continued normal operation. The  conditions of the allocation of foreign credit are a peaceful  solution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the signing of  the oil contracts. Certain progress has been made in both areas.  Combat operations have been terminated, and a search for ways to  achieve a big peace agreement is under way. The oil negotiations  have entered their final phase; the signing of the actual  document is expected very shortly.    The speaker supported the introduction of a progressive tax  system. Concerning wages, R. Guliyev declared that it was  expedient to raise them for doctors and teachers and increase  student grants and retiree benefits. These strata of society (2  million persons approximately) are among the most vulnerable  socially. The corresponding presidential edict will appear soon.    Terming the proposed draft budget the "optimum version," the  head of parliament called for its approval. But the deputies, of  a mind not to hurry, postponed this procedure until the  following day.    On 26 May the National Assembly passed the 1994 Azerbaijan  Republic Budget Act and the corresponding decree. Parliament  instructed the Ministry of Economics to present a specific  program of economic reforms, and the National Bank, guidelines  of monetary policy for 1994. Two weeks were allotted for both.</p>

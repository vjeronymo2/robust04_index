			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Devaluation effect seen in prices MANUFACTURERS may be increasing prices in reaction to the higher costs sparked by sterling's devaluation, government figures indicated yesterday. They proovided a warning of strong inflationary pressures. There was a big rise last month in the prices of materials and food purchased by manufacturers. This was accompanied by indications that companies were passing on more of these costs to UK customers, possibly in an effort to rebuild profit margins on hopes of a recovery. Factory-gate prices last month of manufactured goods excluding food, drink and tobacco - prices of which fluctuate due to tax changes - rose 2.7 per cent compared with February last year. That is the same year-on-year rate as in January and above the 2.4 per cent year on year increase recorded for each of the last two months of last year. The prices of materials and fuel purchased by manufacturers rose 0.5 per cent in February compared with the previous month, the same rise as between December last year and January. The rises are partly a result of the higher import prices that resulted from the 15 per cent fall in sterling since last September, when Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism. The year-on-year increase in materials and fuel prices last month was 6.9 per cent, unadjusted for seasonal variations. This is up from a revised increase of 6.3 per cent in the year to January and is the highest year-on-year rise since May 1989. The figures from the Central Statistical Office support theories that inflation, as measured by wholesale prices of factory goods, may start to climb later this year in response to higher import costs. More positive news on inflation for many companies is that labour costs are rising slowly. Many workers have agreed low wage settlements, due partly to continuing recessionary conditions and fears about unemployment. Prices at the factory gate of manufactured goods for UK sale, including food, drink and tobacco, increased by 3.7 per cent in February compared with the previous February - up from a year-on-year 3.6 per cent in January and the highest yearly rise since last April. Between September and February prices paid by manufacturers for materials and fuel increased by 9.2 per cent. The increases have particularly affected companies in the metals, food and chemicals businesses which import large amounts of raw materials. Allowing for seasonal variations, prices of materials and fuel rose 1.4 per cent in February compared with January.</p>

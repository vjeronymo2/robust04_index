			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: Italy rallies on hopes of cut in interest rates Italian government bonds rallied strongly on hopes of an interest rate cut following the approval of the 1994 budget by the Chamber of Deputies over the weekend. With the budget expected to be passed by the senate, market participants believe that the Bank of Italy may cut its discount rate soon, adding that such a move would be more likely if the next set of CPI figures showed that inflation was holding steady. Among the other high-yielding European government bond markets, Spain rallied on the back of strong foreign interest rather than any particular domestic factors. UK government bonds kicked off on a strong note, but profit-taking dragged the gilts down and the market closed generally lower on the day. Much of the economic data released yesterday was in line with market expectations, according to Mr Jonathan Davies, economist at UBS. However, he added that the fall in the savings ratio was taken to mean that the chance of an imminent interest rate cut had diminished. Dealers said the moves were exaggerated given the thin pre-Christmas volume. Japanese government bonds continued to climb to new highs on the combination of stock market weakness, political uncertainty, and strong hopes of a big cut in interest rates, dealers said. The futures contract, which opened at 116.16 in Tokyo, reached a new all-time high of 117.05 in the London trading session yesterday, having closed at 116.90 in Japan. Market hopes of a cut in interest rates were refuelled after a news report at the weekend suggested that one of the coalition parties had proposed lowering the discount rate - currently at 1.75 per cent - to between zero and 0.5 per cent. The Nikkei stock index tumbled 647.67 points, the largest one-day drop this year, to end at 17,404.24, adding to market expectations of an easing. The Ministry of Finance postponed its auction of 10-year bonds which had been expected today until early next year and said it was considering offering 20-year government bonds today. The MOF is expected to offer Y300bn-Y400bn of 20-year bonds instead of the Y1,000bn 10-year bonds that were expected. The US bond prices softened yesterday in light activity ahead of today's Federal Reserve policy-making session and the Treasury's auction of two-year and five-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  1/4 lower at 99 5/16 , with the yield rising to 6.294 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  3/32 at 100 1/16 , to yield 4.198 per cent. With no fresh macroeconomic guidance and conflicting trends in commodity prices, the market quickly moved lower in thin trading and held steady for the remainder of the day. Traders were concerned about the prospects of the Federal Open Market Committee taking the first step towards raising short-term interest rates. It is widely expected the FOMC, which meets today in Washington, will shift from its stance of neutrality and adopt a bias towards tighter money. At the short end, the market faces an influx of notes at a time when most large institutional investors have locked up their positions for the year. The Treasury will auction a Dollars 17bn auction of two-year notes today and Dollars 11bn in five-year notes on Wednesday.</p>

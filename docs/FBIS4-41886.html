			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Velichko] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 28 TASS -- First Russian Vice-Premier  Oleg Soskovets suggested today to conclude a Russian-IAEA  agreement on the regime of nuclear energy uses at a meeting with  IAEA Director-General Hans Blix.    Russian Minister for Nuclear Power Engineering Viktor  Mikhailov told ITAR-TASS that the agreement will aim to  establish partner relations in peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  He hopes that the former Soviet republics that have nuclear  power plants will join the IAEA and sign a similar agreement.  Russia will help this process, he said.    In 1994 Russia plans to pay part of its debt to the IAEA at  a  sum of 11 million U.S. dollars. The overall Russian debt to the  international organization is estimated at 40 million U.S.  dollars.    In his turn, the IAEA director-general called on the Russian  side for the soonest completion of the construction of nuclear  energy- producing facilities. He said that delays are simply  not economical. He is also concerned over Russian non-joining  of the Paris and Vienna conventions under which specialists from  the state guilty of a nuclear accident carry full responsibility  for it. In the words of Soskovets, not a single state was  affected more than Russia by the Chernobyl nuclear accident.</p>

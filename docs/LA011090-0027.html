			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> I feel battered by my government. Five senators have time to plead for a  savings and loan tycoon, and trauma centers close; we invade Panama, killing  our own and Panamanians, spending millions and the President tells a Texas drug  rehabilitation center that there are no federal funds to assist; we debate  whether we should execute drug dealers, and close libraries and deny funds to  our schools.  </P> <P> Is this the government American people want?  </P> <P> JANE EGLY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GLAD WEATHER TIDINGS SEND THOUSANDS TO BEACH  </P> <P> Thousands of beach-goers, propelled by unseasonably warm weather and heavy  ocean swells, flocked to the Orange County shore Sunday, taking an early-winter  reprieve from holiday shopping and busying area lifeguards with a number of  battered surfers and bicyclists.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of people who took a break from the lines in the stores and  decided to work on their tan lines instead," said Brent Ranek, a lifeguard at  Newport Beach, where as many as 10,000 beach-goers staked out places in the  sand rather than the malls.  </P> <P> Newport Beach lifeguards made two rescues of swimmers caught in riptides and  treated some cuts and bruises, Ranek said, but that did little to dampen the  spirit of a springlike afternoon just a few weeks before winter's official  debut.  </P> <P> Similar reports came from lifeguards and park officials throughout Orange  County. Surf of four to six feet -- with some county beaches reporting waves as  big as eight feet -- made the day ideal for surfers, and though water  temperatures in the low 60s held down the number of swimmers, sunny skies and  gentle, warm breezes made the beach a popular afternoon spot.  </P> <P> "There's lots of surfers and sunbathers, many more than we'd usually have this  time of year," said Gus Avila, a lifeguard at Bolsa Chica State Beach. On a  normal, early December weekend day, the park would be lucky to draw 1,000  visitors, Avila added, but Sunday's crowd was estimated at 25,000.  </P> <P> Scott Diederich, a seasonal lifeguard at Laguna Beach. Diederich estimated that  about 8,000 people had ventured to the beach by mid-afternoon, busy for a  December day but far below the 35,000 to 40,000 who flock to the beach on a hot  summer weekend afternoon.  </P> <P> "It's been a busy day for the kind of staff we have out there," said Lt. Steve  Davidson of the Huntington Beach lifeguard office. "We've had a shoulder  dislocation and a couple of lacerations."  </P> <P> "It's hit this beach pretty hard," said Lon Graham, a lifeguard at Huntington  State Beach. "We've been pretty busy, with quite a few surfers losing their  boards and things like that." Most of the state beach accidents occurred far  from the break. Bicyclists racked up the biggest collection of battle scars.  </P> <P> Huntington State Beach reported some of the day's biggest waves, with surf  breaking at six to eight feet.  </P></p>

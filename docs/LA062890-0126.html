			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CODE CRACKDOWN;  </P> <P> BELL GARDENS FILES 34 HEALTH, SAFETY COMPLAINTS ON LANDLORDS  </P> <P> This city has filed 34 criminal complaints against owners of deteriorating  buildings in one of its most sweeping crackdowns on health and safety code  violations in the past 10 years.  </P> <P> Complaints were issued to the bishop of a local evangelical church, to a La  Mirada man who converted a dilapidated garage into a bedroom and to a factory  that makes pillows.  </P> <P> City Atty. Cary Reisman said that in addition to the charges he has already  filed at Huntington Park Municipal Court, he plans to file about 30 more  criminal complaints against property owners who have consistently refused to  correct health and safety violations.  </P> <P> He plans to prosecute at least 100 cases this year, more than twice the number  he has prosecuted each year for the last 10 years.  </P> <P> "We have been getting the feeling from the community that people don't think we  mean business," City Manager Claude Booker said. "We do."  </P> <P> Assistant City Manager Michael Martinet said that about 24 property owners were  named in the recent complaints. All of them had failed to correct health and  safety violations including faulty electrical wiring, excessive trash, and  illegal garage conversions. At least two-thirds of the property owners are  absentee landlords, most of whom do not live in the city, he said.  </P> <P> "A lot of them think that because this is Bell Gardens that they can get away  with it," Martinet said. "They get real upset when we file charges. The fact of  the matter is that they don't think they've done anything wrong. They drive up  in their gold-toned Mercedes convertibles and say they don't have the money to  fix the place up. We don't buy it."  </P> <P> The Soldiers of the Cross of Christ Evangelical Church, a worldwide group of  Christian missionaries with headquarters in Florida, was charged with a total  of 95 counts of violating several dozen health and safety codes at nine of the  homes it owns in the city.  </P> <P> The church, located at 6466 Foster Bridge Road, is surrounded by small homes  that are owned and occupied by about 150 of its missionaries, a church  spokesman said. Booker said that many of the homes have been divided to allow  multiple families to share facilities. City officials charged that Bishop  Rolando Gonzalez and church member Luis Zepeda are responsible for failing to  fix deteriorating roofs, dangerous wiring and inadequate ventilation, among  other faults.  </P> <P> Zepeda said that the Soldiers, who wear all-white uniforms and are frequently  seen in airport lobbies soliciting donations for the needy, have been harassed  by city officials for most of the eight years that they have held church  services in the city.  </P> <P> "We are missionaries, we believe in keeping property up to standard," Zepeda  said.  </P> <P> He said he has proof that the city has been harassing the church, but declined  to discuss the case until it goes to court later this month.  </P> <P> City officials, who are accustomed to charges of harassment from recalcitrant  landlords, said that neighbors have complained about the church, and that  church officials have had at least two years to correct the problems.  </P> <P> The city also filed two complaints against Emilio and Maribel Leon, a La Mirada  couple who own apartments in Bell Gardens, Bell and Los Angeles. On recent  inspections, city inspectors Lourdes Rodriguez and Megan Wineman found that the  Leons had allowed trash and debris to accumulate in piles around the  apartments. A child rode his bike in a yard where an old refrigerator had been  abandoned. Inside a garage, they found stuffing for pillows piled in one  corner, and two industrial sewing machines, a motorcycle, weightlifting  equipment, a twin bed and religious candles piled on a makeshift shelf.  </P> <P> "This is very dangerous," Rodriguez said, pointing to the piles of fabric.  </P> <P> Rodriguez and Wineman blame the Leons. The Leons also rent two homes on the  property, and the tenants keep their homes tidy, they said.  </P> <P> Emilio Leon said that things are "not that bad." Tenants said he never visits  the property.  </P> <P> "The junk belongs to my tenants," he said. "I rent the house. Those who rent  don't take care of it."  </P> <P> He said he first received a notice from the city about the property one week  ago. However, city records show that the first letter asking the Leons to  comply went out in March, 1988.  </P> <P> City Manager Booker said complaints have increased recently because the city's  dense population has caused a spate of illegal building, homes are aging, and  the absentee ownership in the city "has gone up at an alarming rate."  </P> <P> He said that the city will prosecute in all cases where the property owner does  not follow the order of the Rehabilitation Appeals Board, a board of residents  who offer the property owner one of the last chances to correct a violation.  </P> <P> Booker said building inspectors usually begin a case when a neighbor or tenant  calls to complain or inspectors see something questionable while on routine  patrol. If a property owner does not comply with the written requests of  building inspectors to correct the violations, he is asked to appear before the  Rehabilitation Appeals Board.  </P> <P> After hearing the property owner's case, the board typically gives the owner a  certain amount of time to comply with the building code. If the owner still  does nothing, the city attorney arranges a conference in which property owners  are told that unless the problems are corrected, they will be prosecuted.  </P> <P> The city has never lost a case, and several property owners have been jailed,  Reisman said. Those who are not jailed face a maximum penalty of $1,000 or six  months in jail for each count. Most property owners correct the problems after  the conference rather than risk prosecution, Reisman said. Only about 11% of  the violators wind up in court, Assistant City Manager Martinet said.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Rick Holguin contributed to this story.  </P></p>

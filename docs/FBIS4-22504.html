			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lyudmila Stepanovna Vartazarova, chairman of </F> the Socialist Workers' Party, and A. Tikhonov, general director  of the Interural Joint Stock Company and chairman of the  Consolidation Party, by Nataliya Kuzina: "Is the Director Now  Lord to the Worker? Or What Is He?"]    [Text] Call them whatever you wish -- managers, owners,  enterprise directors -- but Russia already has representatives  of both capital and hired labor. Many are irritated by this.  Some are already calling for expropriation. It is just those who  are willing to built social partnerships that remain fairly few  in number.    We propose at least dialogue as a start, with participants  expressing the interests of these new classes. Thus, we have L.  Vartazarova, chairman of the Socialist Workers' Party, and A.  Tikhonov, general director of the Interural Joint Stock Company  and chairman of the Consolidation Party.    [Kuzina] More and more often people are demanding not  corrections of government policy but change. And the question  that everyone has avoided keeps coming up nonetheless: Was it  possible for us, without socialist traditions, to force our way  into the market?    L. Vartazarova:    "We should not force our way anywhere at all. But changes  were necessary. We cannot deny that in recent years much that is  positive has appeared. Thus, enterprising, active people have  had the opportunity to realize their capabilities more fully.  Government divestment and the appearance of enterprises with  various forms of ownership -- the country needs all of this. But  current privatization rules and tax and credit policies have  provided prospects for development only for speculation capital,  and the redistribution of property is taking place to the  advantage of a new nomenclature.    "The Socialist Workers' Party supports market reform,  economic effectiveness and social justice. Today we can and must  find a synthesis of socialist and liberal values.    "If liberal values such as freedom and democracy were to be  combined with justice, solidarity and equal opportunity, a  completely new alloy would be produced which would not be  characterized by traditional socialist and capitalist concepts.  This is the foundation that will enable us to move toward a new  model of civilization."    [Kuzina] Unfortunately, we cannot retrieve opportunities  that  we have let pass. We are at the frightening stage of initial  accumulation of capital. Is there a place here for theory?    L. Vartazarova:    "The question is really this: I am looking for justification  for doing nothing or I am looking for opportunities to do  something. If politicians think about the people they will  search for opportunities to realize this synthesis."    A. Tikhonov:    "There will be no positive changes in reform here as long as  one strata of people is involved. After all, it is not the basic  mass of the population that has become the experimental field.  Entrepreneurs are removed from influencing the economy in the  same way. We have something to propose for the country's normal  development.    "I emphasize the word normal because we cannot ignore the  interests of ordinary people. As a practician, I know very well  that we could have avoided the barbaric capitalism of the first  years. All forms of property could have been activated. The  positive qualities of socialism, that collective feeling, could  have been relied on for support."    [Kuzina] Why do you speak of the feeling of the collective?  After all, we are facing the problem of creating a market  psychology.    A. Tikhonov:    "Our reformers decided how this was to be done: turn people  out onto the street and then all market mechanisms would  immediately become operational. They would not. In the West one  could actually fire some of the workers, thereby tightening up  the enterprise, and it would begin to function better. But we  lived under socialism.    "Or, for example, previously I also thought that money could  solve all problems. One must add money and like a machine the  NTR [Scientific Technical Revolution] would be activated  immediately. And what happened...In my enterprise I have the  opportunity to sharply increase wages if people demonstrate  initiative. But they do not. New people come in. The result is  the same.    "This is difficult to discuss. But this is the essence of  the  tragedy -- we come from a socialist society in which initiative  was punishable. Our other problem is that we like extremes. No  matter how our money experts masquerade as Westerns, our real  national character is to cut the raw wound and to keep cutting  to the end. And now we really have the forcible detachment of a  significant portion of the people from market reform. The  alternative would have been the path that Lyudmila Stepanovna  speaks of -- creating a moderate program and, supporting each  other, moving forward in measured steps. You would find that the  psychology would then also change gradually."    [Kuzina] Lyudmila Stepanovna, are there tendencies that  alarm  you in the behavior of our entrepreneurs?    L. Vartazarova:    "Yes, there are. For example, directors allocate millions  for  their salaries. They also `dump' responsibility for `social  services' on municipalities. As a result there are no vacation  tickets for workers, no summer camps for schoolchildren and no  nursery schools. However, I must say that in many cases  enterprises are forced to act this way because of our  government's radical tax policy.    "Enterprises do not have adequate assets to support  production, let alone to maintain the social sphere.  Fortunately, until recently directors and entrepreneurs managed  as they could so as not to put people out onto the street. After  all, most of them were raised in the `old school' of having  responsibility for people. But what will happen next?    "Right now I am more concerned about the tendencies in  government policies. With all the talk about coming unemployment  why are no preparations being made? Where are the new jobs?  Where is the system of retraining and requalification?"    [Kuzina] An interesting situation is developing: the  socialist understands the problems of the entrepreneur and  criticizes the government. What should the worker, who one day  may be thrown out onto the street, do?    L. Vartazarova:    "He must learn to defend his rights. Previously, in a  socialist state this was not required. In addition, the plant  director was under strict controls. Today the gap between the  labor collective and the corps of directors keeps growing. If a  mass stoppage of enterprises begins it will result in a social  explosion. Its first `victims' will probably be the directors of  these enterprises as well as the owners of commercial bureaus.  The latter have naturally been the `enemy' for a long time.    "Trade unions also have no real experience in protecting the  interests of workers since during the entire Soviet period their  main task was to distribute social benefits. Workers themselves  must immediately learn the entire arsenal of methods to protect  their own rights. Right now people are more badly off each year  and they cannot seem to organize themselves and combine their  efforts. While people are unorganized they are easily  manipulated. There is one solution - to unify along social  groups, according to professional interests. Representatives of  labor collectives and trade unions must sit down at the  negotiating table with entrepreneurs and directors. They must  develop joint demands and present them to the government."    A. Tikhonov:    "Incidentally, the party of which I am head is not called  the  `consolidation' party without reason. Its membership includes  both entrepreneurs and workers. No one interferes with the other  because the main idea of the party is to consider the interests  of all levels of society."    [Kuzina] "To consider the interests" -- this is not at all  an  altruistic concept. It will demand some financial sacrifices  from you as a property owner.    A. Tikhonov:    "Your question reminds me of a historical example. We all  know that Morozov and Mamoyatov helped the revolution and after  its victory were left emptyhanded. Gorkiy explained to them that  that is the people's truth.    "Personally I would not like a repetition of this. But the  main problem is not who must sacrifice how much, but the precise  delimitation of who does what, who is responsible for what, what  he is paid and what he pays others. Laws determine all of this.  It is the duty of the citizen to carry them out.    "As for entrepreneurs, despite taxes and the complexities of  production the majority of directors of private and state  enterprises are not abandoning the problem of the workers. They  sympathize with workers completely."    L. Vartazarova:    "It seems to me that the further success of relations  between  workers and entrepreneurs will depend on adhering to tradition.  Russia followed the philosophy of indifference to profits.  Property was always looked upon as a privilege. The entrepreneur  had to pay society for this privilege by showing concern for the  poor."    [Kuzina] No matter how you look at it, the entrepreneur will  have to open his purse strings. But there is another path, along  which an attempt is made to "tame" the main spokesmen for the  interests of workers. Incidentally, the idea that we need  "leftist" leaders was clearly heard immediately after the events  of 3-4 October.    A. Tikhonov:    "Personally, I do not share such ideas. But let us examine  them in principle...Our society is `leftist' as a whole. It is  no accident that many communists were elected to the state duma.  But besides them there are many leftists in parliament. For  example, there is a large contingent of independent deputies. I  studied their composition. They are also basically `leftists'.    "So it will not be possible to `tame' everyone. And why do  this; if they are leftists this is not so bad. I am familiar  with the program of the Socialist Workers' Party. It is not  opposed to a multi-level economy with various forms of property.  If the government shifts slightly to the left I am sure that the  entrepreneur will not be strangled.    "At the same time I know very well what communists are and  what they are capable of if they are organized. But the extreme  `right' is also capable of extremes. This is why we do not need  extremes. Society is multifaceted. Let everything exist. But we  need a `center' as a civilized solution to the country's crisis.  A. Volskiy and A. Vladislavlev worked very hard on this. Despite  political competition, they were always centrists and expressed  moderate and reasonable views."    [Kuzina] The voting block that elected these people did not  accumulate the necessary number of votes. Incidentally, your  party and the party that is represented by Lyudmila Stepanovna  also did not win in the elections. Don't you think that the time  for compromise is running out? And that a pre-revolutionary  situation is developing in the country?    A. Tikhonov:    "The failures of centrist forces in the elections resulted  from organizational problems to a large degree. Of course, it is  necessary to take them into consideration and to analyze them.  But this does not mean that centrists do not have a future. I  also do not agree that there is a pre-revolutionary condition in  the country. The reverse is probably more true - one senses that  the population is tired of all conflict. The people have a great  need for harmony. This is what they expect from politicians."    L. Vartazarova:    "Whether there is revolution or not, right now many experts  feel that in April a social explosion is possible. It is our  common task not to allow this to happen. Right now, when the  country is disintegrating, I do not at all care who sits next to  me at the negotiating table - the entrepreneur or the Marxist.  We must all make haste. It is not the time to look for the ways  in which we differ. National harmony is not rhetoric. It is a  condition for the survival of Russia as a country."</p>

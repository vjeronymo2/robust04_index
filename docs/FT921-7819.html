			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Algeria's new rulers turn to Gulf states for aid THIS week's visit to the Gulf by Mr Lakhdar Brahimi, Algeria's foreign minister, to seek financial help represented a painful admission of weakness for a country with a proud tradition of robust independence, nurtured in a bloody revolutionary struggle against the French. Algeria's rulers have always tended to look rather disdainfully upon the Gulf sheikhs and it is a measure of their deep unease over the threat of continuing Islamic-inspired unrest that they feel obliged to join others among their destitute Arab brothers in seeking Gulf financial support. The question in Arab capitals is whether Algeria's desperate need for assistance to cure the economic causes of disaffection will produce shifts in its regional stance, perhaps toward a closer identification with the Egypt-Syria-Saudi Arabia axis that dominates Arab councils. Algiers once prided itself on being the national liberation movement capital of the world ' at one stage no fewer than 75 such movements were represented ' but western officials have no doubt penury will bring about changes. 'None of these things comes free,' said one official. 'Their actions are likely to be more circumscribed. They are joining the real world.' Algerian officials resist this assessment. They prefer instead to emphasise the risks for the region of a destabilised Algeria in place of one that has traditionally performed a balancing role between militants and moderates. 'Because of our internal problems, maybe we cannot have the same stabilising role,' said an official. 'If Arab countries want us to keep playing the same role we need assistance.' Such pronouncements, casting Algeria in the unaccustomed role of supplicant would have been unthinkable during the era of President Houari Boumediene in the 1970s when Algeria was a Third World leader. Among the fruits of this activism was Algeria's election in 1974 to the presidency of the United Nations General Assembly's eventful 29th session during which Mr Yasser Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation leader, was given the floor to deliver his 'gun and olive branch' speech, the resolution equating Zionism with racism was passed and South Africa was suspended. These heady 'achievements'', tended, however, to obscure Algeria's real problems of high population growth, an economy almost totally dependent on hydrocarbons, growing disaffection among the young, a crumbling education system, inadequate housing; all of which coincided with the growth of an Islamic movement, part-funded abroad. It is not the smallest of ironies that Mr Brahimi's first port of call in the Gulf this week was Saudi Arabia. It was the Saudis who discreetly but effectively helped the Islamic Salvation Front get established until FIS support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis led to a suspension of assistance. Algeria itself adopted a fairly ambivalent position in the crisis, neither supporting Iraq, nor giving overt backing to the moderate Arab axis. It sporadically sought to use its influence behind the scenes. Severe tension between Algeria and Iran ' scarcely a day passes without bitter criticism of Tehran in the Algerian press ' is another sign of the distance the regime has travelled from its militant roots. With the exception of Syria, Algeria, among Arab states, had maintained a relatively cordial relationship with the Ayatollahs. However, one of the points Mr Brahimi seems likely to make to his Gulf hosts is that Iran poses a renewed threat to all Arab states. Algeria's economic crisis must also be troubling Polisario guerrillas, engaged in a test of wills with Morocco for control of the Western Sahara, and the PLO which has always been able to rely on Algeria. Another prop is perhaps in the process of being removed from the tenuous base of Mr Arafat.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / International Company News: Wagons-Lits trebles net profits WAGONS-LITS, the Franco-Belgian travel group which last year became the butt of a controversial bid by Accor of France, trebled its net profits to BFr1.83bn in 1991,from BFr526m (Dollars 15.3m) in 1990. Mr Jean-Marc Simon, chairman, said that the increase in profits was due to a rise in extraordinary earnings. The group, which had an exceptional debit of BFr493m in 1990, made an exceptional credit of BFr1.49bn last year mainly from its French property interests. Wagons-Lits was affected by the disruption caused by the Gulf war last year. The economic slowdown in Europe and the impact of the US recession on tourism also affected the result. However, the group's operating profits rose by 23 per cent during the year, according to Mr Simon, on turnover which increased by 8.8 per cent to BFr91.03bn from BFr83.67bn. He said that the performance of the restaurant and travel agency divisions had improved and the losses from Europcar had been reduced. Mr Simon forecast that Europcar would return to profit during the course of 1992. This forms part of Wagons-Lits' plan to double its profitability over the next three years and to produce annual profits of BFr3bn.</p>

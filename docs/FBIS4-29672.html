			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Problem loans at all banks in the  country declined from Rp [rupiah] 20 trillion (US$9.2 billion)  last November to Rp 18.8 trillion ($8.7 billion), 10.2 percent  of the total credits outstanding as of March, Governor of Bank  Indonesia [Central Bank] Sudrajad Jiwandono says.    "Of the problem loans, some Rp 12.2 trillion were classified  as doubtful credits and Rp 6.6 trillion as bad loans," Sudrajad  said.    He said compared to the situation last November, the  doubtful  loans as of March reflected a 13.1 percent decrease but the bad  credits posted a Rp 1 trillion or 6.5 percent increase.    The Central Bank chief told the House members that state  banks accounted for Rp 8.6 trillion of the doubtful loans and Rp  4.4 trillion of the bad credits.    "The doubtful loans at the state banks represented 8.9  percent of their total lending and the bad credits 4.6 percent,"  he noted.    He noted that the total banking credits outstanding as of  March were Rp 183.6 trillion, of which Rp 95.2 trillion belonged  to the seven state banks and some Rp 88.4 trillion to private  banks.    Private national banks, however, recorded a better  performance because their doubtful loans amounted only to Rp 2.9  trillion or 4.9 percent of their total lending and their bad  credits Rp 1.5 trillion or 0.8 percent of their total credits.    According to Sudrajad, foreign and joint-venture banks  incurred only Rp 300 billion in doubtful loans and bad credits,  which together represented 1.9 percent of their total lending.    "Bank Indonesia in cooperation with the World Bank is now  studying the possibility of setting up a special institution to  take over the problem loans," he added.    Sudrajad said investigations made jointly by a special team  of Bank Indonesia and experts from the World Bank since 1992  concluded that the major cause of problem loans was poor  management and inadequate credit assessment.    "The inadequate credit assessment seems to have been caused  by the fierce competition since 1990 that forced many banks to  resort to "go go lending" to maintain market shares," the  governor pointed out.    He said the central bank had discussed the findings of the  team with the directors of the banks concerned and firm measures  had been taken to cope with the problem loans and to prevent  recurrence of non-performing assets.    The findings of the team also prompted the Central Bank to  order state banks to closely monitor the performance of their 50  largest borrowers.    "We have also instructed state banks to strengthen their  boards of commissioners (supervisors) with experts, Sudrajad  added.    According to the governor many banks seemed to fail to  require high professional standards from their commissioners  (supervisors).    "Therefore, we have tightened the requirements for bank  commissioners and have instructed the board of commissioners of  every bank to submit a twice yearly report on their supervision  activities," he said.    Bank internal auditors also have been ordered to send the  findings of their audits to the board of commissioners, Sudrajad  added.    The Central Bank, he said, is also improving procedures for  prohibiting bad debtors from becoming shareholders or executives  of banks.    "Bank Indonesia has ordered banks to submit periodical  policy  statements on big loans extended to individual or corporate  borrowers who are related to bank owners or executives."  Sudrajad said the Central Bank also would eventually oblige  banks to write off their problem loans from their balance sheets  and if this measure resulted in adequate capital these banks  would have to increase their capital.    "If they fail to increase their capital, these banks will be  required to merge with other banks," he added.    Meanwhile, State Minister for Development Planning Ginanjar  Kartasasmita told a separate hearing with the House yesterday  that Indonesia's official foreign debts (based on disbursement)  as of March totaled $55.03 billion.    "Around $38.16 billion of the total were given by  Indonesia's  creditors affiliated with the Consultative Group on Indonesia  and the other $16.87 billion were derived from other sources,"  he said.</p>

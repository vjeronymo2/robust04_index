			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / No one with a gun is approachable: Michael Skapinker argues that increased arming of the police could make matters worse Do not despair. We can still defeat those who are intent on bringing mayhem and bloodshed to our streets. We know who they are: the roaming gangs of self-appointed experts, the ravenous packs of sensation-seeking hacks, and the receivers of second-hand prejudices who are determined to arm the British police - thereby encouraging criminals not only to carry guns, but to shoot first. I understand that there are no concrete plans to arm all police officers. What Paul Condon, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, announced last week was an increase in the number of London armed response vehicles from five to 12, with their occupants openly wearing handguns. Mr Condon said the further carrying of guns by police would be 'event-driven'. All around us, however, are people determined that routine arming of police should be headline-driven, letter to the editor-driven, and unattributable quote-driven. Criminologists believe the standard issue of guns to be 'inevitable', a report in one newspaper told us. 'Our proud boast to have an unarmed police force is now history,' said a letter in another newspaper. 'There is no turning back.' I know a bit about guns. As a South African, I grew up surrounded by them. The police all had guns, of course. Many civilians did too. Some wore them on their belts when they went to the shops. I recently saw an African National Congress spokesman on Newsnight making the bold suggestion that no person should own more than one gun. Do all these guns preserve people's lives? Of course not. Despite its blessedly peaceful recent election, South Africa is one of the most murderous societies on earth. True, South Africa has tensions that the UK does not: for many decades, most of the population regarded the police as a hostile force. But guns exacerbate whatever tensions exist in any country and in any confrontation. To be an effective deterrent against attack, the carrier of a gun has to be prepared to use it. If criminals believe police will not use their guns, they will feel free to attack them, perhaps stealing their weapons in the process. If criminals believe the guns will be used, they are faced with two choices: either they give up crime or they arm themselves. Advocates of an armed police force, might wish for the former to happen; the experience of heavily armed countries suggests it will be the latter. Ah, say the advocates, but what you forget is that British criminals are using guns in increasing numbers anyway. Violent crimes have rocketed and attacks on officers have soared. There are several flaws in these arguments, the most important being that they are not supported by the facts. Attacks on police officers have not soared. The number of assaults on London police using guns, knives or other weapons rose in the early 1980s, but has dropped since 1987. In 1992, there were fewer assaults on London police than in 1982. In 1992, one London police officer was injured by a gun being fired at him. In 1977, the figure was five. As to the safety of the streets, violent crimes reported to the police in England and Wales have risen sharply, to 284,200 in 1992 from 151,300 in 1982. The difficulty with these figures is they depend on changes in people's willingness to report assaults. For this reason, the British Crime Survey interviews people to provide an alternative measure. The 1992 survey concluded that there had been a significant increase in domestic assaults and attacks in or around work between 1981 and 1991. It then said, and you will not believe me, but it is there, on page 96: 'Other types of assaults have shown less change, or in the case of street assaults and pub brawls, a slight decrease.' It is true that the number of firearms used in reported crimes in England and Wales has increased, from 8,400 in 1982 to 13,305 in 1992. Note: used, not fired. In 85 per cent of cases in which the weapon was more lethal than an air gun, it was used as a threat. The number of cases in which the victim of a crime was injured by a firearm was lower in 1992 than in 1982. That violent crime is reasonably stable is no comfort to the victims or the police who have to protect them. But arming police officers is unlikely to make their task easier and could make it worse. The majority of the police appear to recognise this: a poll this week showed 56 per cent are opposed to further arming. The public seemed more amenable to the idea, although most remain against the police carrying guns at all times. More than two-thirds thought they would find an armed police officer as approachable as an unarmed one. Let us hope they never get the chance to test this. No one with a gun is approachable. That is what guns are for.</p>

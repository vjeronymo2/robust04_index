			<p>BFN     [Text] The forces of Jalal Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani  continued to exchange fire yesterday in Chamchamal, Singaw,  Khurmal, Tawilah, and Banjwin. Elements from the so-called  Islamic Movement supported the Mas'ud Barzani elements to  control the offices of the Jalal Talabani clique. In response,  the Talabani clique attacked a number of men of religion in the  region, killing five of them.    In Irbil Governorate, clashes flared up on the outskirts of  Salah al-Din summer resort, where Mas'ud Barzani's headquarters  are located. Other clashes took place in Kuysanjaq and the  (Katlajan) complex.    Elements from the Mas'ud Barzani group opened fire with  machine guns and rocket launchers on Jalal Talabani's house in  Shaqlawah.    Reports from Irbil say that a state of fear and panic is  prevailing among the leaders of the saboteurs. They fear that  the situation in Irbil might explode because the situation there  is difficult to control due to the existence of most of the  forces and offices of Mas'ud Barzani and Jalal Talabi there.  Thousands of the residents of districts and cities there fled  their homes to the mountains and valleys in fear for their  lives. Elements from the cliques of saboteurs are taking  advantage of the situation there to loot homes and shops.</p>

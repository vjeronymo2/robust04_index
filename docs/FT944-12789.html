			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Slimmer banks Who would be a retail banker these days? According to Sir Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, the UK's financial services industry is heading for a rough ride, comparable with the upheaval experienced by manufacturing industry in the past two decades. He is right, but the conclusions he draws, far from being melodramatic, may prove insufficiently radical. The new pressure on retail banking, as Sir Brian points out, comes from the nature of the current economic recovery: in particular, from low inflation and from growing competition. High inflation used to bail out banks from the consequences of sloppy lending. No longer. At the same time, competition is intensifying: with margins tightening both in the already ferocious international wholesale markets and in domestic retail banking. Retail banking margins were fattened during recession, when customers paid charges demanded for fear of having facilities withdrawn. Even during recovery, banks have chosen to rebuild margins rather than drive for market share, despite protests about banking costs from small businesses and personal customers. But now, the squeeze is back on - and the longer-term picture is of further margin erosion. Mainstream retail banks' best skill is the bread-and-butter of deposit-taking and lending. These days, that is a commodity business. Unless they can show that they are better at asset management, life assurance and pensions than long-established specialists, or that they can derive a cost advantage from their base of millions of customers when selling such products, they have no competitive advantage in these areas. Banks have, in fact, shown no particular skill in the provision of the newer services. Moreover, only a small number of customers wants the full range. Most use their banks only for the payments system, and go elsewhere when they want loans, or other 'value-added' services. This is why Coutts, the 302-year-old private bank, may be misguided in trying to move 'upmarket' as it announced last week. In trying to weed out customers with less than Pounds 500,000 under management by the bank in order to focus on asset management, it threatens to alienate its already-select customer base for little return. The implication of the pressures on retail banking, as Sir Brian Pitman warned, is that job cuts are necessary. As a mature, low-growth business, retail banks should expect numbers of employees to fall steadily as new information and payments-handling systems are introduced. Furthermore, the loosening of rules on building societies' lending will probably lead to fewer banks and building societies. While navigating this restructuring, retail banks need to ask themselves whether they should attempt to provide a wide range of services. To survive, they may need, instead, to cut back the 'extra' services offered to customers and to trim further the personal service which accompanies mainstream banking. But the banks' traditional advantage has been customer loyalty. Somehow, they must retain that advantage, while increasing efficiency. The risk, as they shed staff, is that standards of service will decline and customers will go elsewhere. The successful banks of the future will focus on core areas of advantage. They will also become more efficient, while continuing to provide the quality of service that sustains - even enhances - their customers' loyalty. The rest may well decline steadily, under remorseless competition.</p>

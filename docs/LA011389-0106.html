			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Ogilvy Group has adopted a "poison pill" anti-takeover plan, which would make a  takeover prohibitively expensive. The move caused shares of Ogilvy, the  sixth-largest U.S. advertising agency, to drop $1.25 to $31.25 on the NASDAQ  market after it announced that its board passed the plan at a special meeting.  Ogilvy stock had risen sharply in recent days on takeover talk. But the New  York company, whose main subsidiary is Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, said it  knew of no suitors.  </P></p>

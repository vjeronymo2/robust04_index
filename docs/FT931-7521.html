			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Business and the Environment: Travelling down a cleaner track - Plans for a high-speed rail service between Boston and New York are under way Compared with the sleek bullet trains of Japan and the high-speed railways of Europe, the plodding US system sometimes seems hopelessly outdated. Environmentalists have complained that the lack of sophisticated public transportation in the country has increased the number of cars on the road and contributed to the smog which plagues many US cities. New plans for a high-speed rail system between Boston and New York could, though, soon make a difference for the north-east region of the country. Amtrak, the privately-owned rail group, has announced plans to run a high-speed train along this route, pledging an investment of some Dollars 300m (Pounds 210m) for new equipment. The concept of high-speed train travel has become fashionable in the US. President Bill Clinton mentioned high-speed rail during his campaign as a way of improving the economy and alleviating highway pollution. Funding for high-speed rail travel is part of the administration's new economic stimulus plan. Installation of the system would require Dollars 200m in federally-funded track and signal improvements, but Amtrak has already garnered plenty of political support. The Coalition of North-east Governors (Coneg), which represents the governors of all the New England states, is behind the proposal, and several members of Congress are working on legislation to allocate funding to the system. A study prepared by engineering consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade &amp; Douglas for Coneg said the new system would cut pollution in the north-east by reducing air and highway travel between Boston and New York. According to the study, high-speed rail in the region would eliminate an annual 2,522 tonnes of carbon monoxide, 329 tonnes of hydrocarbons and 265 tonnes of nitrogen oxides. These benefits would be partially offset by a 385-tonne surge in sulphur dioxide and a 48-tonne increase in particulates annually through emissions generated by the new, electrified rail system. Still, PBQD says the environmental impact would be overwhelmingly positive, with an estimated 2,683-tonne reduction in pollutants every year. The north-east rail corridor has long been a problem for Amtrak. The tracks are among the oldest in the country, and were laid out to service the sea ports of New England. The Amtrak service winds along the coast from Boston to New York, providing travellers with some breathtaking views, but making for an unusually long journey - four and a half to five hours. A car can cover the distance in four hours, and an aircraft in just one. Amtrak claims that a high-speed train system would make the same trip in just three hours, stealing nearly 3m passengers a year from airline and highway traffic between the two cities. 'About 80 per cent of that will come from air, 20 per cent from cars,' says David Carol, director of the high-speed rail project for Amtrak. Until now, the rail tracks in the north-east have been unsuitable for high-speed service. The rail line makes the equivalent of 12 full circles between Boston and New York, meaning that bullet trains, which travel along a straight line at very high speeds, are unusable. The straightening of the lines would be expensive, particularly since the federal government allocates less money than countries such as Germany and France to the upkeep of the railroads. A new system inaugurated in Sweden in 1990, though, has made high-speed service a possibility for New England. The X2000 model, built by ABB Traction of Sweden, part of Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish group, uses a special tilting system which allows it to take curves at high speeds. An X2000 can round a curve at 125 miles per hour, compared with 80 miles per hour for a regular train. The new high-speed system requires the electrification of the entire north-east route, which is now suitable only for diesel trains. The diesel cars have caused environmental havoc along the New England tracks, where Amtrak is often out of compliance with provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. According to the Environmental Protection Agency in Washington DC, the electric system would be kinder to air quality. Advocates hope the system will also eliminate the need for highway and airport expansion around Boston and other urban centres in the north-east. But the high-speed rail system would not be good news for everyone. The airlines, for instance, stand to lose a great deal of business on the popular New York to Boston route. And critics say Amtrak's estimates of 3m extra passengers a year may be exaggerated, considering Americans' penchant for travel by car. Still, the project has garnered much support and could be in operation within a few years. Amtrak says if the north-east route is as successful as it hopes, the group will install high-speed services along other corridors, including between San Francisco and Los Angeles, Los Angeles and San Diego and Chicago and Detroit. 'We are convinced that the regional benefits of this project would be a big boost to the north-eastern states, both on the economic side and the environmental side,' says Thomas Bolle, head of the department of transportation at Coneg. 'That's why we've given full support to the idea of high-speed rail in New England.'</p>

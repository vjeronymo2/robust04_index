			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / UK Company News: St Modwen pays maiden interim ST MODWEN Properties, the Birmingham-based investment and development group, is paying a maiden interim dividend, acknowledging the steady rise of secure rental income from its properties. The group yesterday announced slightly higher pre-tax profits for the half year to May 31 of Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 1.04m, on turnover sharply reduced from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 4.06m reflecting the absence of development property sales. This meant that the group's sole source of income was from rents. Its rent roll is presently running at Pounds 7.9m a year and, according to Mr Stan Clarke, chairman, should be Pounds 9m by the financial year end. Debt charges arising from gearing, which remains constant at about 100 per cent, are amply covered. Mr Clarke said that contracts had been exchanged for two development sales, and there was another in the pipeline. The income from the sales will be spread over the current half and the first half of next year. These funds, combined with the growing rent roll, underpin what looks like the start of a more liberal dividend policy. The first interim is 0.3p from earnings per share of 0.6p. The dividend for 1992 was 0.6p from earnings per share of 1.1p.</p>

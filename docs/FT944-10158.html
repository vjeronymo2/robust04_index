			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Survey of Hungary (9): Colossus from Boston - The top investment bank CS First Boston, still recovering from wrenching internal reorganisation, may stand in the shadow of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley in New York and London. But in Budapest and other east European financial centres, CSFB is a colossus. No other international investment bank has been so active. Even rivals concede that CSFB is the pre-eminent investment bank in Budapest. Yet Mr Janos Bartha, managing director of CSFB Budapest, says: 'It's not a one-man show, far from that.' Creditanstalt Securities, a subsidiary of the Austrian bank, competes on smaller deals. CSFB backed the wrong horse in the bidding for Matav, the telecoms company, so Goldman Sachs won the success fee in Hungary's biggest single privatisation. Merrill Lynch, which handled tobacco industry privatisation, and NM Rothschild, which has advised on telecoms and gas privatisation, also won lucrative mandates without setting up costly local offices. So although investment banking in Budapest may not be a one-man show, one player - CSFB - has got most of the parts. CSFB helped the Hungarian authorities privatise national airline Malev, refrigerator maker Lehel, the commercial banks and now Hungarhotels, the hotel chain. Until 1992 the firm estimated that it had advised on a third to a half of M&amp;A activity. Now CSFB does not bother counting. 'Here we just don't have the top-notch investment bank competitors with us in domestic markets,' says Mr Bartha. Aside from advisory work, CSFB has introduced corporate bonds and commercial paper issues to the Budapest market, helping borrowers bypass the large margins charged by Hungary's commercial banks. The fees have been modest but the service has given CSFB access to such companies as McDonald's Corporation with which it never had a relationship. M&amp;A work and fixed income issues have helped meet running costs. But the real rewards have come on the equity transactions that have proliferated in the last 12 months. CSFB has acted as the prime conduit for the flow of western institutional money into eastern Europe. In Hungary's case, CSFB has managed the international equity issues of Egis, Pannonplast and Fotex, and sold over Dollars 200m worth of shares. CSFB, alone of the international investment banks, possesses a broker's licence in Budapest. The firm has bought up shares on the secondary market, helped western funds secure shareholdings in companies such as telecommunications utility Matav - and profited handsomely. Not all the deals have been well-judged, say rivals. 'I have a lot of investors complaining about CSFB, both in terms of the assets they have been sold and the fees they have been charged,' says one Budapest investment banker. Fotex shares have slumped below their issue price despite CSFB's stamp of approval. 'If I had bought Fotex I would be screaming,' the critic says. While New York and London may have suffered from the downturn in world bond markets, Budapest is set for a record year. It is believed that CSFB's Budapest office passed its targets for the year several months ago. 'Eastern Europe is going to be paying the salaries of investment bankers in New York this year,' says a CSFB executive. Those who had distanced themselves from CSFB's east European adventure now fight for their share of the credit for revenues from Budapest, Prague and Moscow. JP Morgan and Salomon Brothers are looking to set up Budapest offices. Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff, CSFB's former European head, who is now independent, may build up his own investment banking business. Mr Bartha accepts that CSFB will give up market share, if not market leadership. Nevertheless, in its 15 professionals in the Budapest office, CSFB has a lock on much of Hungary's investment banking expertise. Salomon Brothers has been looking for months for someone to head its operation - without success. 'The barriers to entry are high,' says Mr Peter Kadas of CSFB.</p>

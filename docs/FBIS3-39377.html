			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Right: Single Symbol in the South"] </F>   [Text] Rome -- A twofold agreement has been reached on the  right, with separate pacts for the north and the center and  south. [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi is "entering the arena"  in Rome, while [League Secretary] Bossi "presides" in Milan.    From Tuscany northward the League will control 70 percent of  the single-candidate constituencies of the north (which total  360 between the lower house and the Senate) and is offering  Berlusconi and the other allies 30 percent. An exception is  being made for Lombardy (including Milan), where Forza Italia  will have 40 percent, taking on the Christian Democratic Center  (Mastella and Casini), the former Liberals, the former Pact  members, and the Pannella group.    From Tuscany southward, Forza Italia, [National Alliance  leader] Fini and the alliance that is joining the north agreed  and signed a parallel and similar accord last night (Berlusconi  was absent and was represented by the loyal Marcello Dell'Utri).  It included the fielding of a single symbol in the  constituencies of central and southern Italy. As expected,  matters of form have been "salvaged": Berlusconi is represented  (together with the centrist vestiges of the former five-party  alliance) throughout Italy. He is strengthened separately in  the north by Bossi's League and in the south by Fini's National  Alliance. Silvio Berlusconi run for a single-candidate  constituency in central Rome and in three proportional  constituencies in Rome, Naples, and Palermo.    The distribution of candidates is gradually taking shape,  amid disputes and minor agreements. Here are the latest  developments in detail.    Progressive forces -- There have been periods of conflict  and  pacifications. Negotiations are resuming in Sicily following  the dispute between the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] and  Rete. The battle over the distribution of candidates seems to  have ended, and now "each party at the negotiating table will  have made some small or major sacrifice on behalf of this  extraordinary project, without jeopardizing the radicalism we so  cherish," Rete's Pippo Russo explained. The negotiations  continued Sunday [13 February]. The issue remains entirely  unresolved in Tuscany. "Unfortunately we are proceeding with a  system very similar to the old cronyism, with no renewal and no  consideration for the quality of the candidates," according to  the Democratic Alliance's Willer Bordon. "There are too many  bureaucrats around. If we are not satisfied we will not  conclude the negotiations regardless of the cost." Amid the  flurry of ultimatums, there is strong competition for the safest  constituencies -- often those of the PDS. This is nothing new.  The Greens' Stefano Apuzzo took issue with the "antireformers"  who draw up "losing lists of apparatchiks, disreputable faces  and gray phantom officials, party bureaucrats." The progressive  forces' negotiations "are carefully planning the defeat of the  left-wing forces." Enzo Mattina (Socialist Renewal) issued this  protest after abandoning the Lazio progressive forces grouping,  and did not rule out "autonomous lists." He described it as a  matter of "pride and dignity." He challenged the PDS'  "excessive hegemony, which gives preference to the Social  Christian group, whose strength and support are still entirely  unproven," to the detriment of the socialist component. In  Umbria the negotiations ended with no candidates for the Greens  and Rete (which failed to secure acceptance for Mario Capanna).  The following are running under the progressive banner: Walter  Veltroni, Mauro Agostini, Maria Rita Lorenzetti, Guido De Guidi,  Carlo Carpinelli, journalists Ferdinando Adornato, Paolo  Raffaelli, and Giuseppe Giulietti (RAI [state broadcasting  service] staff union members), Carlo Gubbini, Leonardo Caponi,  Fabrizio Bracco, and Antonietta Modolo. Representing the  entertainment industry, director Giuseppe Tornatore (Palermo)  declined (because of work commitments), while disc jockey  Jovanotti (Milan) passed up the offer of "an alignment toward  which I feel well disposed."    Center -- [Italian Popular Party, PPI, Secretary]  Martinazzoli and [Pact for Italy leader] Segni asked two  television news reporters to run in Florentine constituencies:  Federico Scoiano agreed, while Vittorio Citterich remains  undecided. Producer Vittorio Cecchi Gori is standing as a PPI  candidate in Florence. The former Liberal attorney Piero Milio  is running for the Senate in Palermo with the Pact group; he has  defended not only Bruno Contrada (Sisde [Intelligence and  Democratic Security Service]) but also Tano Grasso and Boris  Giuliano's family.    Right -- The League will again filed almost all its outgoing  members of the lower house and the Senate, with a couple of  exceptions. Bossi is running in Milan (single-candidate  constituency) and in Lombardy 2 (proportional); [league lower  house floor leader] Maroni in Varese and Lombardy; and Fassino  in Turin. Bossi's doctor, Binaghi, is also standing in the same  city. Forza Italia is fielding Fininvest attorney Vittorio  Dotti in Milan; criminal lawyer Della Valle in Monza; Ombretta  Colli (Gaber's wife) in Saronno. Among the Liberals, Minister  Costa is running in Mondovi, Alfredo Biondi in Genoa, and  economist Scognamiglio in Milan 3.</p>

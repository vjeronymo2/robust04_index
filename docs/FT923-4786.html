			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charges behind Ladbroke's 5% rise A NEAR Pounds 14m reduction in interest costs helped Ladbroke Group, the leisure concern, increase pre-tax profit by 5 per cent, from Pounds 98.2m to Pounds 103.2m, in the six months to June 30. The lessening of the interest bill followed a Pounds 464m rights issue in August last year, which cut net debt from just over Pounds 1.6bn. By the period end borrowings stood at Pounds 1.05bn, giving gearing of 35 per cent. Operating profit declined to Pounds 147.8m (Pounds 156.5m) on turnover of Pounds 1.99bn (Pounds 1.96bn). Interest costs of Pounds 44.6m (Pounds 58.3m) were covered 3.3 times. The hotels division, mainly the Hilton International chain, saw operating profit fall by Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 68m on flat turnover of Pounds 383.2m. Hotel sales accounted for Pounds 23.6m (Pounds 25.6m). Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, said: 'The big change is that Japan was roaring away in the first half of last year, but it has gone the other way because of cuts in corporate spending on entertainment.' It was the only country where normally the revenue from food and drink outweighed that from rooms. Hotel occupancy levels slipped to an average of 65 per cent worldwide. However, the second half was traditionally better. The dollar-related profits of the hotel division were mainly responsible for the Pounds 2.5m sliced off profits by currency movements. While the UK betting shops and Vernons football pools operation held up well, recession hit credit betting. This was the main factor behind a fall in the racing division's profit to Pounds 36.1m (Pounds 45m). Loss-making shops in Belgium had been closed. Texas Homecare lifted profit to Pounds 26.8m (Pounds 23.7m) on sales of Pounds 366.6m (Pounds 318.9m) from 229 stores. Losses from the property division deepened to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.6m). Mr Stein said interest that had previously been capitalised was now charged. Overall, the amount of interest capitalised was cut from Pounds 28.1m to Pounds 3.1m. The underlying performance was better. Rents would be worth Pounds 60m this year. By mid-1994, when rent-free periods ran out and with the tail-end of the buildings let, the annual rental would be Pounds 80m - a yield of about 8 per cent on a portfolio currently valued at nearly Pounds 1bn. About a third of the portfolio was due for revaluation. If values were written down, it was only 'a book entry', he said. It would not affect the final dividend, which the board was planning to at least hold at last year's level of 6.23p. The interim dividend is maintained at 4.92p. Earnings per share, affected by a higher tax charge and extra equity, slipped to 6.47p (7.82p). See Lex</p>

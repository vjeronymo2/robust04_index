			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with LDDP Deputy Chairman Viktoras Kovsovas by </F> Gintautas Kniuksta in Vilnius; date not given: "Government --  Not Only the Prime Minister and Ministers..."]    [Excerpts] [Kniuksta] [Passage omitted] Late March  marks the first anniversary of A. Slezevicius' government. How  do you assess your colleagues' work? In your opinion, what did  they manage or fail to accomplish? It is easier for you as a  person who does not hold any office in the executive sector to  notice what should be corrected immediately.    [Kovsovas] A year is a short period of time, but social  hostility has decreased and political tensions have subsided. A  community of citizens is being created, even though with  difficulty and contradictions, and quite often with mistakes and  scandals. I suppose that this is a large contribution of A.  Slezevicius' government.    Let us not forget that this government curbed inflation,  introduced the litas, hit a blow to organized crime, and had the  Russian Army withdrawn. I think that many people notice other  smaller or greater deeds. However, I also see things that, in  my opinion, are being done improperly.    First of all, the government is not only the prime minister  and ministers. I have heard repeated reprimands that good deeds  or plans often stall and "die" in the middle level of  ministries. It is the government's task to ensure that each  employee values his or her job and strives after results, and  that good and unselfish work is properly rewarded.    [Kniuksta] You often tour regions. How do people in  the province assess the activities of the Lithuanian Democratic  Labor Party [LDDP]? Do you write a diary or like to make  predictions, for example, concerning the elections to local  councils, after such trips? By the way, what results do you  expect from these elections?    [Kovsovas] LDDP activities are assessed in different ways --  from categorical negation and politicized appraisals to moderate  approval. I have the impression that most people are well aware  of the difficult economic situation and possibilities, they  advise us to be more courageous and resolute. [passage omitted]    [Kniuksta]Regarding economic stability, some people say  that the LDDP should overcome the crisis in Lithuania over 1994  and 1995. At the same time, there are people who shout that the  LDDP is incapable of ruling the state and demand new elections  to the Seimas [parliament].    [Kovsovas] Economic stability can be assessed from different  aspects, depending on the criteria we choose. I think that the  rate of economic decline is falling, which means that positive  changes are inevitable. There will be many reasons responsible  for the nature of the latter and the time of their emergence.  One of them is stability in the political situation and  government activities. Talk about LDDP's incompetence in  governing the country or even its damaging rule only  demonstrates the reluctance or inability of political opponents  to see the real situation.    The LDDP and its leaders have not discussed early elections  to the Seimas. I suppose that the constant propaganda of this  idea is one of the methods for trying to disseminate  uncertainty, indefiniteness, and doubt. This implies that one  should not communicate, help, or show effort, but must condemn  and hate. Such principles are not beneficial for our small  country.    [Kniuksta] [Passage omitted]Currently, many political  parties are inclined to accuse the LDDP for not adhering to its  electoral promises. For example, Social Democrat A. Sakalas  remembers in one of his interviews that after learning the  results of the elections, your colleague G. Kirkilas [LDDP first  deputy chairman] held his head in the hands saying: "What are  we going to do now?" Are not such explanations similar to the  desire to cool one's tea, although it will cool off by itself  over time.    [Kovsovas] I will not hide the fact that the results of the  Seimas elections partly exceeded our predictions. We can only  advise that those who accuse us of failing to implement the  program take and read it. The program does not contain many  items of which we are often accused. However, it reads that we  will put an end to social opposition and instigation, and seek  to stabilize the economic decline.    Unfortunately, politics is not a class or a school  [reference  to Kovsovas' former occupation as a school teacher]. The  student and sometimes also the teacher must think about the  possibility of correcting the committed mistake. Political  mistakes often affect thousands of people. Constituents at  least authorize other people to correct mistakes committed by  separate politicians and political forces.    [Kniuksta]As for a coalition with other parties, the  same man A. Sakalas has stated that the Social Democrats cannot  form a coalition with the LDDP because the latter is not a  homogeneous party today. According to Mr. Sakalas, it is a  compilation of people with three or four views: Nomeklatura,  the prosocial democratic university group, old functionaries,  and quite a large group representing big capital. What would be  your reply?    [Kovsovas] One could really not reprimand the Social  Democrats for a lack of attention to the LDDP. We are grateful  for this. I do not know a single homogeneous party in  Lithuania. Each political organization, and the press has also  reported on the Social Democrats, is based on different people.    Reflections about the composition of other parties only show  that one assumes to know more about the party in question. The  use of such words as "functionaries" and "nomenklatura" reflects  the desire to belittle and humiliate someone. [passage omitted]</p>

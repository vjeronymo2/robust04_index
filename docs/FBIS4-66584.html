			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Madihah 'Azab] </F>   [Text] AL-AKHBAR sought to determine what producers,  investors, financiers, and economists think of the new Customs  Tariff in an effort to clarify the issue.    'Ali Nijm, former governor of the Central Bank of Egypt,  believes that the new customs tariff is not protectionist, which  was a foregone conclusion once Egypt signed the GATT agreement  whose implementation is overseen by the World Trade Organizaiton.    He said that it is common knowledge that the Organization  seeks to fully liberalize the foreign trade of member states and  that all countries are therefore proscribed from any  protectionism (against imports), subsidies (of exports), or  dumping (of their products in other markets).    In fact, liberalizing foreign trade carries with it several  advantages that the richer big countries may enjoy ahead of the  poorer ones. Those advantages provide wider opportunities for  investment, for workers, and for profit.    "Despite the reservations we have about the new tariff, it  is  only fair to say that it was necessary in order to avoid  isolating us from the rest of the 95 other countries of the  world that signed the GATT agreement and allowed the exchange of  foreign trade among them.    "On the other hand, since we are a developing nation, the  government should have carefully and thoroughly scrutinized the  tariff to preclude those distortions that gave less  consideration to economic impact than to levies and boosting  revenues.    "Before it directs Egyptian investors and producers to  improve and boost production, the state must first use certain  laws, and whatever strategies it deems suitable, to address  businessmen's and investors' complaints about the new tariff's  negatives, such as raising the levy on production requirements.  Such a step would maximize positives and alleviate the impact of  negatives."  <H5>  Wanted: Egyptian ISO [International Standardization </H5> Organization]    Dr. Ibrahim al-Siba'i, vice chancellor of Cairo University's  College of Commerce, emphasizes that protection is lacking and  says that "it is a mistake to believe that reducing customs  tariffs does not remove the umbrella of protection from domestic  industries. Whatever protection officials envisage is in the new  tariff is passive and not positive. The government has reduced  the fees on foreign competition at the same time it has imposed  a levy on the production requirements of domestic industries. As  if that wasn't enough, it levied other fees under different  names in order to boost revenue returns and make up for lowering  the customs duties.    "The government has forgotten, or has chosen to forget, that  this would inevitably increase the cost of Egyptian products and  consequently raise their price vis-a-vis foreign products in  competition that is not at all fair, especially since most of  our industries are in the infant stage and still need government  support in the form of incentives that would help them improve  quality. That is why Egyptian goods will not be able to  persevere against their imported counterparts and will not be  able to penetrate world markets by passing ISO's international  standards of quality.    "The least the Egyptian government can do, in turn, is to  insist on strict application of ISO standards for its imports  and on not opening its markets to any product that does not meet  those standards. Some of the Gulf countries have already done  so."  <H5>  A National Role, Absent </H5>   Dr. Hasan Abu-Zayd, chairman of the Accounting Department at  Cairo University's College of Commerce, says: "We lack a  distinct course and a defined target. If there is a consensus  that the objective is to improve the quality of Egyptian  products and boost exports, where then is the national role  performed by the government in order to realize that objective  which, in itself, represents our salvation from all economic  woes?    "The government has not made production requirements  available at economic prices. Consequently, the new customs  tariff did not remove production impediments. Recent customs  modifications considered [treated] our national industries, most  of which are still in their infancy, as if they were strong  industries in no need for production requirements, and therefore  considered them as finished products subject to duty in full.  Only a few such requirements have been excepted, and the duty on  them has actually been cut. But those reductions, unfortunately,  are in form only and not in actuality since those few items have  been made subject to additional fees under different tax  categories.    "Most countries of the world protect their vital industries.  Even America insisted that the GATT agreement cover its movie  industry in order to ensure full protection for that industry.  We are no less than those countries.    "The state must endeavor to supply production requirements  at  economic prices, to remove impediments to production, and to  improve the investment climate in Egypt. Very briefly, it must  provide for the Egyptian investor in our country the same  conditions under which foreign investors operate in their own  countries."    Investor Rida-Allah Hilmi (from Tenth of Ramadan City) also  calls for comprehensive studies of each individual producer in  order to identify its means of production. Lacking that, grave  mixups would occur, as proved by the new tariff, and many  production requirements would be treated as finished products  subject to maximum duty.    He added: "We are not asking the impossible but we call for  fairness...as most countries of the world do."  <H5>  Between a Rock and a Hard Place </H5>   General Salim Zaki (from Tenth of Ramadan City) said: "I was  surprised to find the new tariff totally different from what  officials, including the prime minister and the minister of  finance, led us to expect. They said it would provide great  reductions for all means of production, but we see no reductions  at all. What we see is a bizarre approach to the means of  production, which the tariff treats as finished products, rather  than semi-manufactured raw materials.    "How, then, can officials expect us, as investors, to  produce  output of higher quality and lower price? The situation is very  thorny, and we find ourselves between a rock and a hard place.  Either we change our profession and activities from producers to  merchants, or we close our factories in the face of the  frightening losses that will accrue as a result of the latest  customs modifications and seek another location that provides a  better climate for investment."    Gen. Salim Zaki emphasizes that the situation is in urgent  need of review and cannot tolerate a long wait, as officials are  wont to do. "We must reduce the duty on the means of production  in a real way that will enable investors to produce Egyptian  products of high quality at a cheap price in order to enable us  to compete with foreign products in a marketplace that has no  mercy."    Chemist Lewis Bisharah says: "It is illogical for the new  tariff to impose a 60-percent duty on the means of production  required by local industries." (He was referring to the  ready-made garment industry where the new tariff imposed duties  of 60 percent on shoulder pads for mens and ladies suits,  blouses, and mens belts, and of 40 percent on chest padding  [hashawa al-sadr], and other items.    He emphasizes that this can only mean that prices of  Egyptian  products will be double those of their foreign counterparts and  sometimes even more. He said: "How could the officials have  overlooked that? If they consider the new tariff to be an  inevitable step along the road, then we as investors see a need  to follow this step with other urgent steps that take domestic  industry into consideration and provide it with the means of  protection...exactly as do other countries keen on providing  better climates for investment until we reach the international  level of customs duties that are paid by our investor  counterparts in foreign countries."    Chemist Lewis Bisharah demands that spare parts be treated  as  machinery and equipment are treated and not as finished  electrical products, because spare parts are as important as  machinery and not less so. "How, then, can the new tariff  subject them to higher duty than that imposed on tools and  equipment? We are in urgent and pressing need for a reassessment  and for solutions to all the problems generated by the new  tariff."</p>

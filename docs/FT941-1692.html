			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Tax dodge measures slammed Leading tax and accountancy professionals yesterday criticised proposed legislation intended to stop tax avoidance through offshore companies. The Institute of Taxation said measures in the finance bill were over-complex, would impose large compliance costs on firms and give undefined powers to the Inland Revenue. Mr Malcolm Gammie, president of the Institute of Taxation, said: 'The cost of complying with these new rules will hit everyone, not merely those companies engaged in tax avoidance.' Mr Tony Hughes, of accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said: 'The government has not listened to our concerns, which is very disappointing. But we note that the Treasury will be setting up a working party into how the legislation will operate.' The criticism comes after MPs voted through clause 123 of the finance bill on Tuesday. The clause closes a loophole in existing legislation which protects against avoidance of UK tax by companies diverting income to subsidiaries in low tax areas overseas. Profits - which a foreign non-trading subsidiary must distribute to the UK if it wishes to avoid charges under foreign company legislation - must now be calculated on a tax rather than on an accounts basis. The government says companies use accounting tricks to disguise profits, costing the exchequer at least Pounds 50m each year. But leading companies and accounting bodies complain that the new rules impose a heavy burden on companies and they apply retrospectively. Inland Revenue officials yesterday denied that clause 123 would be retrospective and said that they were prepared to discuss new legislation with tax practitioners and publish guidelines. Last Thursday the government was forced to withdraw clause 241 of the finance bill after pressure from politicians and tax and accounting bodies. The clause would have increased the power of the Inland Revenue to seize books and records. Mr Gammie said: 'Both clauses are badly drafted and provide inadequate safeguards against their exercise. If the Revenue needs extra powers it should have them, but it is unclear and uncertain as to how far the Revenue's powers extend. We are having to rely on the Revenue fulfilling assurances made in private rather than on the record.'</p>

			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1420 GMT on 26 January in the "Panorama" program carries a  report on reactions to the resignation of Russian Federation  Finance Minister Boris Fedorov.    Petr Filipov, head of the Russian Federation president's  social policy analysis center, says that irrespective of various  reform pledges made by Viktor Chernomyrdin and his deputy  Soskovets, what counts is their financial policy. He believes  that they will abandon Fedorov's strict controls over credits  and reintroduce subsidies to unprofitable industry to appease  voters. In his words, "the resignation of Finance Minister  Boris Fedorov from the Russian Government will undoubtedly  complicate our advancement along the path of economic reforms."    Economist Pavel Bunich believes that the government decided  to change the course of reforms even before Fedorov's  resignation and thinks that some degree of adjustment is indeed  necessary. However, he voices concern that the government's  determination to change the course of reforms may go too far.  He believes that too many old-timers who were in positions of  authority during Ryzhkov's and Pavlov's time are surrounding the  government and there is a danger that they could try to reverse  the reforms.</p>

			<p><P> December 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'NORMAL HEART' STIRS UP THE HEARTLAND;  </P> <P> SPRINGFIELD, MO., IS DIVIDED OVER ITS UNIVERSITY'S STAGING OF A PLAY ABOUT AIDS  </P> <P> "I don't think this play is a great play as a play," Richard Dreyfuss said when  he starred in the 1985 Los Angeles premiere of "The Normal Heart," Larry  Kramer's angry depiction of the early days of the AIDS crisis. "I think it is  great as a fire. It's supposed to kindle something in you."  </P> <P> Dreyfuss was referring to the play's call for greater public attention and  education on the AIDS epidemic. But on Nov. 15 in the small Ozark city of  Springfield, Mo., the fire Kramer's play was meant to spark took on an utterly  different, more ghastly meaning.  </P> <P> That night, as the theater department of Southwest Missouri State University  opened its production of "The Normal Heart" in the face of strong local  opposition, a suspicious fire gutted the house of a vocal supporter of the  school's right to stage the play.  </P> <P> The ideological clash followed recent attempts in Congress to limit public  funding, through the National Endowment for the Arts, of material deemed  offensive or pornographic. The "Normal Heart" controversy has raised, as well,  issues of artistic and academic freedom, the limits of censorship and  expression, and the role of the arts and education in the public sphere. A  number of film and theater celebrities have joined in the debate on behalf of  the university.  </P> <P> The home, rented by SMS theater performance major Brad Evans, was targeted by  an arsonist, Springfield fire investigators have confirmed. The investigation,  conducted by local and state authorities, is ongoing but no suspects have been  identified. Springfield fire officials said they have not linked the arson with  the events surrounding the campus production.  </P> <P> The fire marked the culmination of weeks of heated debate over the rights of  the university to stage a play that itself explores the debate that gripped the  New York gay community during the onset of the AIDS epidemic in the early  1980s. The Springfield-based Citizens Demanding Standards, organizing a rally  attended by 1,200 people and collecting a reported 5,000 petition signatures in  a community of 133,000, protested that a school financed with taxpayers' money  should not present material that, in the words of CDS president Paul Summers,  "promoted a homosexual political agenda many in the community find offensive."  </P> <P> (The community is one in which some films, such as Martin Scorsese's "The Last  Temptation of Christ," have never been theatrically released. Springfield,  located in the heart of the so-called Bible Belt, is home to the national  headquarters of Assemblies of God -- the church for which Jim Bakker and Jimmy  Swaggart were ministers.)  </P> <P> In the days that followed the arson, many in Springfield echoed the feelings of  Evans, who said that the incident "slapped Springfield in the face, and made  people think more fully about what all the fuss was about. Even on the night of  the fire, I thought that good things would come out of this. And they have."  </P> <P> "The fuss" began in September, when, according to Summers and CDS supporter  Rev. Kenneth Gillming, a university drama student provided state Rep. Jean  Dixon (R-Springfield) with a copy of "The Normal Heart." Dixon met with Bethany  Oberst, dean of the College of Arts and Letters, requesting that portions of  the play be censored for the college production. If not, she asked that the  show be canceled.  </P> <P> Dixon did not return phone calls from The Times regarding this story, after  repeated attempts to contact her.  </P> <P> Dixon then met with SMS president Marshall Gordon, who had already received a  legal opinion from university counsel that her request amounted to a violation  of the First Amendment. Dick Kurtenbach of the American Civil Liberties Union's  Kansas City office seconded this opinion and forwarded his response to  university officials. "We did this," Kurtenbach explained, "since this kind of  notification tends to strengthen the resolve of a university to follow through  on their actions."  </P> <P> That resolve was tested to the limit by what happened next. Joined by several  Springfield church leaders and citizens who formed Citizens Demanding  Standards, Dixon and her supporters introduced new complaints, which echoed  those of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) in his attacks on NEA funding for the  exhibiting of controversial artwork -- that state funds should not be used to  promote homosexuality.  </P> <P> The university board of regents made no decision on Dixon's new demands, which  she presented during their Oct. 20 meeting. That meant her request to shut down  the production was denied.  </P> <P> CDS took out an advertisement in the Oct. 29 issue of the Springfield  News-Leader protesting the use of tax money to mount the play.  </P> <P> Two days later, Brad Evans and his fellow theater students were concerned that  their department, the production and its director, John McElhaney, weren't  receiving much visible support. They came up with an idea: Cut some red felt in  the shape of hearts and pass them out to anyone willing to wear this symbol of  support. That day, 400 were distributed, 1,400 more were cut out, and People  Acting With Compassion and Tolerance (PACT) formed.  </P> <P> In the days before the play opened, debates involving critics and advocates of  the university raged on television, radio and in speakers halls. According to  News-Leader reports, Gene Antonio, author of "The AIDS Cover-Up?" and a guest  speaker at a CDS rally, declared that "homosexuality is about as normal as  trying to eat a carrot by sticking it in your ear. The ear was not designed for  the carrot, and the carrot was not designed for the ear." He added that  homosexuals raising their voice in protest is "warfare."  </P> <P> At an SMS campus meeting, Dr. Mervyn F. Silverman, president of the American  Foundation for AIDS Research, responded that "just when the Berlin Wall is  coming down, just when people have been fighting . . . for the chance to hear  everything they might want to hear and make their own decisions, we see almost  an attempt to put a Berlin Wall around this theater on this campus."  </P> <P> It so happens that some major Hollywood stars were trained at the SMS theater  department. As word spread of the Springfield fracas, former SMS students Tess  Harper, Kathleen Turner and John Goodman came back to town. They spoke at a  PACT rally held just before the play opened its nine-day run at the campus'  Coger Theatre.  </P> <P> "Trying to tell people that you can't teach plays like this is like telling  biology professors that they can't teach Darwin," said Harper. It was a deeply  personal effort for Harper, since five friends from her college days in  Springfield have died from the effects of AIDS. "Watching the play again," she  recalled, "brought back memories of my friends, and made me impress on these  kids how crucial it is for them to know about this disease. That's what the  play is all about."  </P> <P> Playwright Lanford Wilson ("Tally's Folly," "The Fifth of July"), who grew up  40 miles from Springfield in Lebanon and attended SMS for a semester, wrote an  impassioned essay for the News-Leader that stated in part: "Don't even think  about protesting the theater for carrying out its job. Don't expect to come to  the theater expecting us to conform to the community standards of morality.  That's not our job. We would rather die first."  </P> <P> CDS president Summers recounted numerous incidents in which members of his  group were labeled "fascists, Nazis and hate-mongers. But we didn't call anyone  names."  </P> <P> Outspoken advocates on both sides reportedly received veiled phone threats.  University security was significantly beefed up; most of the cast and crew of  "The Normal Heart" accepted the university's offer for secure housing during  the course of the show's run. "I didn't recognize my town for all that was  going on," said one observer.  </P> <P> Finally, just when the sight of a packed opening night and a sold-out  engagement appeared to end the debate, news spread through town that Brad  Evans' home had been burned. (On the night of the fire, "Heart" director  McElhaney received an anonymous phone call. The voice said, "You're next," then  hung up.)  </P> <P> "I lost both of my cats," Evans said, "and I was able to retrieve a basket's  worth of clothes. That was it." CDS expressed its outrage at the act by  sweetening the reward for arrest and conviction of the arsonist; the reward has  now reached $11,000. Evans received an unexpected visit of consolation from  Dixon, and an even more unexpected call from New York tycoon Donald Trump,  whose secretary told Evans that Trump wanted to help. As of press time, Evans  did not know what form Trump's support would take.  </P> <P> Rather than having a chilling effect on artistic and academic expression,  however, the events in Springfield appear to have stiffened the resolve of the  theater department. "Will it make us shy away (from controversial plays)? No,  it will make us firmer in our choices," stated department head Robert Bradley.  "One of the things that has come out of this is that each year, we need to do  at least one play dealing honestly and artistically with social problems, as  'The Normal Heart' did."  </P> <P> "Theater is supposed to shock you out of your complacency," remarked actress  Harper in a telephone interview last week. "It can't help it. I had to laugh  when I learned that the Springfield community playhouse is next staging 'The  Best Little Whorehouse in Texas'!"  </P> <P> Playwright Wilson expressed concern about "terrorism in my own back yard, a  place where folks always argued, but always listened to each other. I hope this  isn't the start of an anti-gay or anti-rights movement. But I don't think they  realize what kind of response they'll get from the people they're attacking,  especially from artists."  </P> <P> Part of the fallout on the SMS campus has been a raft of discussions, not only  on AIDS awareness, but on First Amendment and creative expression issues. "Our  country," said Dixon critic and fellow state Rep. Doug Harpool (D-Springfield),  "would be in deep jeopardy if politicians had the power to deny discussion of  ideas which offended their personal morality."  </P> <P> But Rev. Gillming retorted that "we have to come back to morals, or the country  is in deep trouble."  </P> <P> Reached by phone in New York, "Normal Heart" playwright Larry Kramer expressed  puzzlement over the extent of the controversy, which he said his play had not  raised before.  </P> <P> However, he looked beyond the country's heartland with his concerns. "I think  that what went wrong in Springfield," said Larry Kramer, "is another example of  the kind of bigotry Hollywood studios practice when they won't make movies  about AIDS, or when our government refuses to put anyone in charge of the  epidemic. It's all part of the same homophobia."  </P></p>

			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Liberty Life improves 26% LIBERTY LIFE, South Africa's largest listed insurance company, overcame a difficult operating environment to record a 26 per cent increase in earnings in the year to December. Total income rose by 15.4 per cent to R4bn (Dollars 1.4bn). This consisted of R2.27bn net premium income, up by 17.9 per cent from 1990, and R1.73bn investment income, up by 12.2 per cent from 1990. Net taxed surplus attributable to shareholders was 26.1 per cent higher at R275m. Mr Donald Gordon, chairman, said 1991 was probably the most significant in Liberty's 34-year history. Domestically, Liberty strengthened its position in the local financial services industry by lifting its holding in Standard Bank Investment Corporation, one of the country's premier banking groups, to 40 per cent. The most significant events took place on the international front where a series of deals did much to enhance the stature of Liberty and Mr Gordon. Liberty became the first South African company in many years to complete successfully an equity issue abroad when it raised Dollars 143m through a share placement. There was also the tie-up between Transatlantic Holdings, the main holding company for the Liberty Group's offshore interests, and UAP, France's largest insurer. The two pooled their interests in Sun Life, the UK assurer, in a new company, Rockleigh, which is on the point of gaining control of 100 per cent of Sun Life's equity. The strategic alliance with UAP should reap considerable benefits for the Liberty group, with Sun Life an obvious first focus for their joint attention. Total new business of Liberty Life for 1991 increased by 18 per cent to R1.1bn. Highlights of this performance included an 18 per cent increase to R482m in new annualised recurring premiums, and the successful launch of the new Medical Lifestyle policies. Total earnings per share rose by 24.4 per cent to 127 cents, with the dividend being lifted by 25.6 per cent to 108 cents. The amount allocated to policyholders by way of bonus distributions for 1991 rose to R2.87bn, 2.6 times the level of 1990.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Software directive approved by MEPs EC LEGISLATION to end piracy of computer software leapt its final hurdle last night in the European Parliament, writes Andrew Hill in Strasbourg. The European Commission feared MEPs would amend the heavily-lobbied measure, upsetting the compromise agreed by ministers four months ago. But the amendments failed to muster the necessary votes, despite the backing of the Socialists, the largest political grouping. The proposed directive will extend copyright laws to computer software, but allow a limited amount of 'reverse engineering' - the unpicking of programs to create software compatible with the large computer companies' most popular products. The unamended directive will now be put before the next meeting of internal market ministers in May for formal adoption.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Letter from top leaders of the Royal Government of </F> Cambodia to His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk" issued in Phnom  Penh on 22 May -- read by announcer]    [Text] To His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk Varaman, king of  the Kingdom of Cambodia:    Your Majesty, we have received your message dated 22 May  1994  concerning the roundtable to be held next week in your  Chhanghsu-on Palace.    Concerning the second and third points in your message, we  would like to beg permission to inform Your Majesty as follows:    A. Concerning the second point, we would like to voice our  support for your lofty idea on an unconditional, immediate,  complete, lasting, and irreversible cease-fire over all  Cambodia. We also support your lofty idea on the monitoring of  this cease-fire by an inter-Cambodian commission to be made up  of general and high- ranking military officers from the Khmer  Royal Armed Forces and the Khmer Rouge group and led by two  neutral generals representing His Majesty the King of Cambodia.    Moreover, we are of the opinion that as a more concrete and  realistic move, we propose that 13 June 1994 be observed as the  beginning of the cease-fire.    B. Concerning the third point, we would like to voice  support for your lofty initiative in solemnly declaring our  eternal allegiance to and support for a unified Cambodia without  territorial secession [words indistinct] for national peace,  unity, harmony, and prosperity within the framework of a joint  endeavor to build the Cambodian nation.    We would like also to energetically support your noble idea  on continuing to make enormous efforts to (?achieve a solution  to the Cambodian problem). We will arrive in Beijing on 25 May  to accompany Your Majesty to Chhanghsu-on Palace on 26 May. We  would like to beg Your Majesty to grant us an audience at your  residence in Beijing any time at your convenience.    May Your Majesty and the Queen enjoy Lord Buddha's blessings  for longevity, social prestige, happiness, strength, and  enlightenment. Please forgive any inappropriateness.    [Dated] Phnom Penh, 22 May 1994    [Signed] Chea Sim, acting head of state and chairman of the  National Assembly; Norodom Ranariddh, first prime  minister; Hun Sen, second prime minister</p>

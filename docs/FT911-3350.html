			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Letter: Water meters - a fair but costly option Sir, Mr D. A. Fagandini is quite right (Letters, April 20) to point out that substantial cost savings are possible with a water meter, though much depends on the size of the property concerned and the customer's consumption. Thames Water has regularly told its customers about the meter option. We give details every year with our billing document and our customer service staff will offer advice to anyone who calls. We believe that metering is the fairest option but it would be vastly expensive to meter all private premises in our region. This is especially true in London where installation costs could be as high as Pounds l,000 per property because of the need to separate supply pipes. This should be seen against an average household's annual bill of Pounds 130 - among the lowest in the UK, and Europe. Our price rises - up to 4.5 per cent above inflation for the next five years  -are necessary to correct years of under-investment. Our aim is to give customers one of the best water and sewage services in Europe and meet the highest environmental standards. M R Hoffman, group chief executive, Thames Water, 14 Cavendish Place, W1</p>

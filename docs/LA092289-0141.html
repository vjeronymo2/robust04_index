			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOS AMIGOS HIGH EVACUATED AFTER EXPLOSION IN VAULT  </P> <P> Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley was evacuated Thursday morning after  an explosion in an electrical vault caused a power outage at the school.  </P> <P> The explosion at the rear of the school near the gymnasium caused minor burns  to two adults working on the campus and prompted school officials to dismiss  about 1,500 students and school personnel for the day at 11 a.m.  </P> <P> Fountain Valley Fire Department Battalion Chief Paul Summers said students were  sent out to the athletic field immediately after the 8:05 a.m. explosion in the  vault, which houses the electrical wires for the school. The explosion sparked  a small fire, which was put out "within minutes," Summers said.  </P> <P> An air-conditioning contractor and a building superintendent who were working  nearby suffered minor burns that were treated at the scene, Summers said. Alan  Trudell, spokesman for the Garden Grove Unified School District, which includes  Los Amigos High School, said the vault was to be repaired overnight and  students were to return to class as usual this morning.  </P></p>

			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Pru helped by accruals accounting PRUDENTIAL Corporation, Britain's largest life assurance company, yesterday reported that under the new proposed 'accruals' basis of accounting for profits, its 1992 earnings rose 9 per cent to Pounds 807m. The Pru had earlier reported profits for the same period using the so-called embedded value method of accounting, which is currently the industry standard. That method however has been criticised by securities analysts as flawed because it does not recognise profits or losses from insurance policies until they mature. Under accruals accounting, profits are much more closely related to ongoing activities. So far, the Pru is the only big UK insurer to have reported results on an accruals basis. The Association of British Insurers, after a two-year study, had asked the industry to begin experimenting with the method. Earnings were somewhat lower than analysts had anticipated, reflecting somewhat worse than expected continuous disability business in its M&amp;G reinsurance arm. However, analysts noted that the effects of a reorganisation in Prudential's UK life assurance businesses, which has absorbed Pounds 180m in costs, has produced unexpected cost savings which will be reflected in the 1993 statutory profits. Profits on new business rose 30 per cent to Pounds 226m, largely on sales of single premium products and the so-called prudence bond in particular. But profits on business in force fell sharply from Pounds 52m to Pounds 36m, partly reflecting reduced investment returns in Australia and Canada. Meanwhile, it emerged that a leading shareholders group, Pensions Investment Research Council, has sharply criticised the Pru for failing to follow best practice in corporate governance. The Pru is one of the UK's largest shareholders and its chief executive, Mr Mick Newmarch, has been outspoken on matters of board behaviour.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / International Company News: Allianz targets UK for expansion Allianz Holding, the German insurance group, is seeking further foreign acquisitions, and has a particular interest in the UK life market, according to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, chairman. The group, which last week announced the purchase for more than SFr5bn (Dollars 3.9bn) of most of Swiss Reinsurance's direct insurance interests - its biggest acquisition - also saw possibilities for expansion in Asia and central and eastern Europe. It wanted to become stronger in regions where the scale and breadth of its business were insufficient to ensure competitiveness, growth and stable earnings, Mr Schulte-Noelle said yesterday. The opportunity to buy Swiss Re's 60 per cent stake in Elvia, Switzerland's fifth-largest insurer, had taken Allianz by surprise, but gave it a unique chance to improve its position in the Swiss market, he added. Switzerland had been an especially weak spot in the group's make-up, and before its purchase of 30 per cent in Berner Holding, announced in June, it had a market share of 1 per cent. Mr Schulte-Noelle yesterday reassured shareholders at the annual meeting that Elvia, and Lloyd Adriatico and Vereinte - majority stakes in which will also pass to Allianz - were profitable. Swiss Re's losses on direct insurance stemmed mostly from its Spanish subsidiary, he said. Cornhill, the group's main UK business, had increased its premium income almost 9 per cent to DM1.4bn (Dollars 900m) in the first half, and expected to improve annual earnings. Growth in group-wide premium income had slowed in the period to the end of June, rising 6.3 per cent to DM8.4bn. However, because the number of claims had eased 3.3 per cent, and administration costs had been cut, shareholders could expect an unchanged DM15 dividend for 1994 as long as there were no natural catastrophes or other 'spectacular claims'. Storms in Germany this year had cost the group DM70m. Allianz AG, the parent company, had also paid out DM45m on claims following the California earthquake this year. This cost US subsidiaries DM107m, Mr Schulte-Noelle said. North and South American profits were under pressure from rising interest rates, although premium income had risen more than 9 per cent in local currency terms. This translated to a 2.9 per cent increase on conversion to D-Marks. About half of US turnover came from life insurance operations, which had increased their premium income 15 per cent in the first half. Growth in Europe had been dampened by unfavourable exchange rates. Although non-German premium turnover rose 4.6 per cent in local currencies, it fell marginally on conversion to DM8bn. French operations had suffered a fall in premium income - against the market trend - and they had been hit by unexpectedly high industrial claims, while car theft was still a problem. Cost reductions and restructuring had improved results, but French interests were not expected to return to profit before 1995. Lex, Page 20</p>

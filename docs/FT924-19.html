			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Spain may see short-term debt rise THE PLAN to invest the Bank of Spain with greater autonomy and put an end to the Treasury's ability to borrow from the central bank in order to meet short-term funding needs is likely to encourage the issuance of short-term debt in preference to longer-dated bonds in the immediate future, according to European bond analysts. In the past, the government would borrow from the central bank and then spread its debt issuance over the year. In theory it can still do so in 1993 as the autonomy statute announced on Tuesday - and therefore the ban on borrowing from the Bank of Spain - does not come into effect until January 1 1994. However, the government is likely to start implementing the new rules in 1993. 'The government is going to make every effort not to go to the Bank of Spain, although it is still able to do so, so as to lessen the possible traumatic effects on 1994 when it will no longer be able to do so,' said Mr Juan Cueto, chief executive of Madrid securities house Gestemar. The government plans to invest the Bank of Spain with a 'Bundesbank-style' autonomy just when it is likely to need the type of short-term emergency borrowing from the central bank that it used in the past. Traditionally, Spain has relied heavily on issuing short-term paper, resulting in a large refinancing need in the first months of the year. The need is particularly big at present. Total debt issuance amounted to Pta12,840bn (Dollars 112bn) in 1992, and is expected to be Pta11,534bn in 1993. The government spent heavily - for example on the Barcelona Olympics, and Seville's Expo '92 - but after the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty in June, it became much more expensive for the government to issue debt. Instead, the government stopped issuing paper and borrowed over Pta1,000bn between June and September from the central bank (some estimates put the bank borrowing at Pta1,400bn), which it then repaid by issuing three and six-month paper between September and December. Altogether about Pta3,500bn was raised in the last quarter. This now has to be rolled over and it is estimated that Pta4,000bn has to be refinanced in the first quarter of 1993, of which about Pta2,500bn has to be raised in January alone. While Spanish interest rates remain relatively high, the government is unlikely to want to issue long-term debt, and so is expected to concentrate on issuing short-dated paper. Spanish interest rates are unlikely to fall much until the Bundesbank starts to ease German rates, although dealers point out that lower inflation figures and more reasonable wage settlements in Spain would help to push bond yields down. Longer-term, the decision to give the Bank of Spain more autonomy is likely to result in more regular use of the bond markets. When Spanish yields rose dramatically in the wake of the Danish vote against Maastricht, the Treasury was reluctant to hold auctions of long-dated debt because it did not want to issue new paper at a rate reflecting the high yields in the secondary market.</p>

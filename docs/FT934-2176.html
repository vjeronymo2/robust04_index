			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Observer: Phony test A round of applause, please, for Britain's high street banks. Their branch staff manage to answer the telephone within three rings, 63 per cent of the time. Admittedly, it's not as good as most of their commercial customers, but it's better than their deadly rivals - the building societies. So reports a company called Teleconomy, which rang 615 bank and building society branches. However, when it extended its search for bank staff who could say more than 'what?' and 'don't know', the banks came out less well, particularly in the south east, where only the Royal Bank of Scotland's branch in Station Road, Reading, was rated 'excellent'. But building societies staff need not be too down-hearted at the results. They might be slower to answer, but they were friendlier when they did so. Nationwide came top, while Lloyds Bank, which trains staff to answer calls within four rings, scraped in fifth.</p>

			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTHORS HOPING TO PRESERVE MEMORIES OF FAMILY FARMS;  </P> <P> BOOKS: TWO WRITERS ARE DOCUMENTING, IN STORIES AND PHOTOGRAPHS, THE LIVES OF  NINE DEPRESSION-ERA FARMERS.  </P> <P> Depression-era farmers are the last links with the sweat and joy of life on a  small, diverse family farm, according to two people who plan to preserve those  memories in a book called "Salt of the Earth."  </P> <P> "We wanted to go out -- indeed, we felt compelled to go out -- and talk to  these old guys," said one of the authors, Teresa Norris-Phillips, a free-lance  copywriter.  </P> <P> She and Candis Kelly, a graphic designer, have collected stories and  photographs of nine Illinois farmers ages 79 to 94.  </P> <P> Among them is Eli Meiss, who remembers a generation of farmers who ate the  fruit and vegetables they grew, churned butter from the cows they milked and  carved hams from the pigs they raised.  </P> <P> "We were self-sufficient," Meiss said. "Today, a farmer's just like a poor city  boy."  </P> <P> Peter Ropp recalls kerosene lamps for light, horses for transportation and  stoves for heat.  </P> <P> "When returning from town on a cold night in a horse-drawn vehicle," Ropp said,  "it was heartening to see the glow of the stove from the hill a half-mile south  of home . . . a real joy on a winter night to watch the yellow and blue flames  play after the coal was added."  </P> <P> Norris-Phillips and Kelly set out in January, 1989, with tape recorder and  camera, uncertain of how two city women would be greeted.  </P> <P> "We arrived at the door thinking, 'Why would they want to tell us their life  stories?' " Kelly recalled. "We'd walk out backward three hours later saying,  'We really gotta go now.' "  </P> <P> The women listened and looked.  </P> <P> They stood atop James Yontz's tall grain bins at San Jose; they looked at the  faint traces of stagecoach tracks at Dill Seymour's house near Seymour.  </P> <P> Rather than using set questions, Norris-Phillips let the farmers reminisce and  focus what mattered most to them.  </P> <P> Meiss, born in 1905 at Fairbury, began farming at the height of the Depression  -- in a year when drought and chinch bugs devastated his oats.  </P> <P> "Maybe starting in the '30s was good for us," he said. "I can't say I've ever  lost any sleep if I had a short crop, but I'm always glad if I get more."  </P> <P> During interviews for the book, Kelly watched the farmers carefully "to learn  who they are visually," and always included their hands in her black-and-white  portraits.  </P> <P> Farmers who met with the women said they believe their stories will be  interesting, perhaps even educational.  </P> <P> "We lived in a different age," said Ropp, 84, of Normal. "It always helps to  learn of the trials and tribulations of your ancestors -- helps people to deal  with present-day problems."  </P></p>

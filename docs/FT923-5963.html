			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / News Corp profit soars 65% to ADollars 531m NEWS Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's international media group, yesterday underlined its return to robust financial health by announcing a 65 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 531m (Pounds 196m) for the year to the end of June. The result, in line with market expectations, confirms that News Corp has dramatically improved profitability since completing a USDollars 7.6bn (Pounds 3.8bn) refinancing in February last year. News Corp said revenue fell by 7 per cent to ADollars 10.2bn, reflecting the sale of assets worth ADollars 2.4bn, used to make early repayments of debts scheduled under the group's refinancing agreement. The group said the 'outstanding' result was due to stronger performances from its UK and Australian newspapers, together with its television and free-standing inserts businesses in the US. News Corp also benefited from falling interest rates, which cut the cost of servicing debt by 20 per cent to ADollars 932m. The main disappointments were the Twentieth Century Fox film business, which suffered from three expensive failures, and Ansett Transport Industries, the 50 per cent-owned Australian aviation group suffering from low prices in a recently deregulated market. News Corp said it lost ADollars 56.8m from equity accounted investments, mostly reflecting losses at Ansett and BSkyB, the 50 per cent-owned UK satellite television business. However, the group said BSkyB had moved into profit in March, 16 months after its loss-making Sky service merged with the rival British Satellite Broadcasting. News Corp said operating profits before interest and tax rose by 2 per cent to ADollars 1.6bn, reflecting stronger margins and the effects of group cost-cutting. Net profit fell to ADollars 502m after abnormal losses of ADollars 29m. These losses reflected rationalisation costs and the closure of a German newspaper, offset by a profit on the sale of the group's 55 per cent interest in its Australian magazine and commercial printing operations. The group made a net loss after abnormals of ADollars 393m in the previous year, after taking account of abnormal losses of ADollars 714m caused by refinancing fees and losses on the disposal of assets. At the operating level, US profits fell to ADollars 880m from ADollars 1bn the previous year, mainly reflecting the sale of eight consumer magazines and a newspaper in June 1991. The group said Fox Broadcasting, its television network, achieved 21 per cent growth in ratings. TV Guide performed 'well' in spite of a downturn in consumer advertising. However, HarperCollins, the publishing division, reported flat results, following cuts in public education funding. UK profits increased 93 per cent to ADollars 382m, reflecting the stemming of BSkyB losses and a 28 per cent increase in profits from the group's five national newspapers. In Australia and the Pacific Basin, profits fell from ADollars 332m to ADollars 328m, reflecting the sale of the commercial printing interests. However the group said its metropolitan newspapers performed 'exceptionally well'. The South China Morning Post, in Hong Kong, made a record profit.</p>

Volodko, </F> honored figure of science and engineering of the Russian  Federation and State Prize laureate, under the rubric "Flight  Safety: Investigating Flight Accidents": "Modeling Gives the  Answers"]    [Text] Methods of mathematical modeling associated  with the use of high-speed computers are becoming more and more  widespread in the investigation of flight accidents [LPs],  dangerous failures of aircraft hardware and errors by the flight  personnel. The urgency of their use could seem, at first glance,  not very great for modern aircraft equipped with Tester or  MSRP-64 type flight data recording gear (BUR).    The informativeness of specific types of BUR naturally  differs, but it provides a sufficiently complete representation  of the nature of the development and, in the aggregate with a  host of one-time commands, on the possible cause for the  appearance of an emergency situation in flight. The parameters  recorded, at the same time, frequently prove to be insufficient  to establish the true cause of an LP. In order to make a  judgment regarding the pattern of the airflow around an  airframe, for example, it is essential to know the angles of  attack and slip, which are not on the recording list. Most  importantly, not one kind of BUR can determine the trajectory of  aircraft movement, and it is the last leg of a flight (before an  aircraft hits the ground), after all, that is of the greatest  practical interest in the investigation of a flight accident.    The MSRP-12-93 magnetic flight recording system, installed  on  the An-12, An-26, Tu-95 and Tu-22 aircraft and Mi-6 helicopter  in particular, records only 12 analog parameters of a flight,  including the barometric pressure and indicated airspeed,  vertical G-forces, angles of deflection of the controls, angles  or angular velocities of pitch and roll and two or three  diagnostic parameters of the operation of the power plant. The  SARPP-12 optical recording system employed on the MiG-23  aircraft and Mi-8 and Mi-24 helicopters puts only six analog  parameters onto photographic film. They are insufficient, in  both cases, for an analysis of the development of an emergency  situation and the establishment of the causes for an LP.    It also happens that the information medium is destroyed,  lost or stolen. A representation of the trajectory and nature of  the movement of an aircraft on the last leg of its flight is  formulated in such cases according to indirect indications  (sketch maps, ground objects destroyed, the results of study of  the aircraft hardware, the indications of witnesses and the  like).    Mathematical modeling of the dynamics of a flight thus  proves  to be useful and necessary, both with the availability of  information from flight data recording systems and, the more so,  in the absence of it for any reason. When investigating a flight  accident it allows, by way of example, computation of the  parameters of aircraft movement according to a known initial  flight mode and assumed destabilizing factors.    The legitimacy of versions that are put forth with reference  to the circumstances of the flight accident is analyzed, in that  case, according to the results of mathematical modeling of the  dynamic reaction of the aircraft to the effects of disturbances  caused by the failures of the aircraft hardware or erroneous  controlling actions of the pilot that are being considered.    Tasks of the second type (the reciprocal task of flight  dynamics) are also posed and resolved in those cases when,  according to the objective data (information from the on-board  recording devices, radar plotting of the flight route), the  trajectory of movement and the angular position of the aircraft  are known, with unknown destabilizing factors present. The  forces and moments required for the parameters of such movement,  as well as the necessary settings of the controls to create  them, are determined according to the results of the  mathematical modeling. This provides an opportunity, based on  cause-and-effect links, to single out from among the aggregate  of proposed versions only those that satisfy, or at least do not  contradict, the actual parameters of the aircraft flight in the  emergency situation.    An evaluation of the good working order of the aircraft  hardware is accomplished only for an aircraft equipped with the  Tester or MSRP-64 systems. The flight mass (m), center of  gravity of the aircraft, trim positions of the controls,  stability reserves, moments of extension or retraction of the  flaps or air brakes, changes in the sweep angle of the wings and  some other important data can be singled out therein when  investigating an LP.    The dynamic equations of Euler are the methodological  foundation for modeling the dynamics of aircraft movement, with  the aircraft in most cases considered to be an absolute solid  body of constant mass (1):    m(V[.sup]x[/] + _o_[.sub]y[/]V[.sub]z[/]  -_o_[.sup]z[/]V[.sub]y[/]) = R[.sub]x[/],    m(V[.sup]y[/] + _o_[.sub]z[/]V[.sub]x[/]  -_o_[.sup]x[/]V[.sub]z[/]) = R[.sub]y[/],    m(V[.sup]z[/] + _o_[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]y[/]  -_o_[.sup]y[/]V[.sub]x[/]) = R[.sub]z[/],    I[.sup]x[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] + (I[.sub]z[/]  -I[.sup]y[/])_o_[.sub]y[/]_o_[.sub]z[/]  -I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] = M[.sub]x[/],    I[.sup]y[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] + (I[.sub]x[/]  -I[.sup]z[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]z[/]  -I[.sup]xy[/]_o_[.sub]x[/] = M[.sub]y[/],    I[.sup]z[/]_o_[.sub]z[/] + (I[.sub]y[/]  -I[.sup]x[/])_o_[.sub]x[/]_o_[.sub]y[/] +  I[.sup]xy[/](_o_[.sub]y[/][.sup]2[/]  -_o_[.sup]x[/][.sup]2[/]) = M[.sub]z[/],    where V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], V[.sub]z[/],  _o_[.sup]x[/], _o_[.sub]y[/] and _o_[.sub]z[/] are  projections of the linear and angular velocity of the aircraft  on the right body axis of the system of coordinates;  R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/], R[.sub]z[/], M[.sub]x[/],  M[.sup]y[/] and M[.sub]z[/] are projections on the same  coordinates of the resultant forces and moments acting on the  aircraft; and, I[.sup]x[/], I[.sub]y[/], I[.sub]z[/]  and I[.sup]xy[/] are the moments of inertia of the aircraft  with regard to the corresponding axes of the coordinates.    For a helicopter, the system of equations (1) is usually  supplemented with an equation of the dynamic of rotation of the  main rotor:    I[.sup]r[/]_o_ = M[.sub]eng[/] - M[.sub]t[/],    where _o_ is the angular velocity of the rotation of the  main  rotor; M[.sup]eng[/] is the available rotating moment of the  engines; M[.sup]t[/] is the required torque of the main and  tail rotors; and, I[.sup]r[/] is the polar moment of inertia  of the main rotor and the assemblies kinematically linked with  it.    The angular velocities of pitch _o_[.sup]z[/], roll  _o_[.sup]x[/] and yaw _o_[.sub]y[/] are determined as a  result of integrating the equations for the dynamic of aircraft  rotations with regard to the center of mass, and are used to  compute the corresponding angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_.    The trajectory of movement in the system of ground  coordinates is determined according to the components of the  forward speed of flight V[.sup]x[/], V[.sub]y[/], and  V[.sup]z[/] and the angles _n_, _g_, and _ps_.    The forces R[.sup]x[/], R[.sub]y[/] and R[.sub]z[/]  and the moments M[.sup]x[/], M[.sub]y[/] and  M[.sup]z[/] acting on the aircraft and determining the right  portions of the system of equations (1) are quite complex,  non-linear functions of the design parameters of the aircraft  and the kinematic parameters of its flight (the speed and  barometric altitude, angles of attack and slip, angular  velocities of pitch, roll and yaw, positions of the controls).  These forces and moments are determined by the aerodynamic  design of the aircraft, and are entered into the computer using  interpolation tables, polynomials or rough approximation  formulas.    The law of automatic control of aircraft flight is usually  realized in the form    T[.sup]_D_+_D_[/] = K[.sub]1[/]_D_q +  K[.sup]2[/]_D_q[.sub]i[/],    where D[.sup][/]is the settings of the controls  (elevator, stabilizer, ailerons, cyclic pitch control and the  like); _D_q[.sup]i[/] is the change in the kinematic  parameters being controlled or stabilized (angle of pitch or  roll, heading, speed and altitude of the flight) from the set  trim position; and T[.sup][/]K[.sub]i[/] is a constant  for time and the gear ratio of the SAU [automatic control  system] (autopilot).    The modeling of the operation of the power plant plays an  important role in investigating an LP, the more so as it is  namely its failure in flight that is the cause of most emergency  situations and accidents. The mathematical model of the power  plant, in its most general and simplified form, includes the  known operational characteristics of the engines (throttle,  altitude and speed, climatic), an equation for the dynamics of  the turbocompressor rotor    T[.sup]n[/]_D_n[.sub]tc[/] + _D_n[.sub]tc[/] =  K[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/],    and the law of engine control    T[.sup]G[/]_D_G[.sub]T[/] + _D_G[.sub]T[/] =  K[.sup]_a_[/]_D__a_[.sub]ec[/],    as well as the laws for the automatic regulation and  limitation of the defining parameters of the engines.    Here _D_n[.sup]TK[/] and _D_G[.sub]T[/] are the changes  in the rotational frequency of the turbocompressor rotor and the  hourly consumption of fuel compared to their established values  in the initial flight mode of the aircraft; _D__a_[.sup]ec[/]  is the setting of the engine control level from the set trim  position; and, T[.sup]G[/] and K[.sub]G[/] are a time  constant and a transfer factor defining the characteristics of  the engine (time of pickup and throttling).    The mathematical model for the dynamic of the flight defines  the unstable three-dimensional controlled movement of the  aircraft in special situations, caused by the failure of the  aircraft hardware, erroneous control actions by the pilot or  intensive external influences. The modeling of disturbing  factors is usually accomplished in the form of various time  functions with varying parameters, approximately describing  objective data on the circumstances of the flight accident and  (or) put forward in the course of investigating a version as the  possible cause of an accident.    One may cite as examples of the modeling of typical  disturbing factors:    --the complete, unexpected failure of one of the two  engines,  accompanied by a reduction in its thrust or power according to a  law close to exponential;    --the mechanical jamming of a control channel;    --the break-off of a piece of the main rotor, accompanied by  the effect of cyclical unbalanced centrifugal force  _D_Nsin_o_t;    --the effects on the aircraft of a vertical ascending gust  of  wind with a velocity W and gradient section of velocity build-up  _t_.    The disturbing factors are naturally individual in each  specific case in the investigation of a flight accident, but  their modeling requires a certain experience and skill of the  researcher.    Mathematical modeling is successfully employed, aside from  the global task of flight dynamics considered, to resolve a  broad circle of partial but in practice exceedingly important  tasks, among which could be included:    --the ballistic computation of the trajectory of destroyed  elements of an aircraft that have separated in flight  (stabilizer surfaces, parts of a propeller blade, cockpit canopy  and the like);    --modeling of the non-standard interaction of the SAU with  elements of the piloting and navigational system;    --computation of the intensive flywheel movement of an  elastic main rotor blade accompanying a blow by the end of the  blade against the tail boom of the helicopter in a single-rotor  configuration;    --modeling of the overturning of a helicopter in a  non-design-rated turn in taxiing etc.    Improvements in the mathematical models, for the realization  of which personal computers are beginning to be utilized  successfully, including those using leads coming from on-board  flight data recording gear, are constantly underway.

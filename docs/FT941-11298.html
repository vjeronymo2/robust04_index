			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Wool prices in Australia and South Africa rose to new peak for this season again this week. The WI market indicator finally ended at 546 cents a kg. which compares with 522 a week before and makes an increase of 10% in two weeks. The rise was concentrated in finer Merinos where twice as much is being paid for some categories as applied in April,1993, the lowest point of wool's recession. British wool prices also rose very sharply this week, with increases of 10% to 15% typical. Pressure here exaggerates wool market strength with offerings at Bradford auctions spasmodic and traders liable to get oversold in times of recession, such as applied some months ago. At one or two of the final Australian sales prices did tend to soften a little but even if a quieter period is imminent the wool market's trend has been firmly established.</p>

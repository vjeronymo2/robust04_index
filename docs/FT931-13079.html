			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chemicals sector depresses continental trading THE continent reacted to forecasts of lower earnings by chemical and pharmaceutical groups, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT fell on sharp declines in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors after reports of brokers downgrades and lower than expected January drug sales. Activity was also depressed by the weaker dollar which affected export-sensitive stocks and the breakdown at the weekend in pay talks between the government and public sector union. The DAX index closed 18.4 lower at 1,569.24 after a day's high of 1,582.21 as turnover fell to DM4.3bn from Friday's DM5.7bn. Schering, down DM12.50 at DM703.50, continued to weaken as concern over its agrochemicals division surfaced again, while Basf lost DM2.50 to DM212.20, Bayer fell DM3.00 to DM269.30 and Hoechst shed DM4.00 to DM252.30. Some analysts said that defensive stocks were losing ground as investors turned to cyclicals in anticipation of economic recovery next year. BMW declined DM15.30 to DM501.50 after forecasting lower car sales and warning that earnings would remain weak. Elsewhere in the sector Volkswagen sliped DM4.70 to DM273.00 while Daimler was DM3.80 lower at DM572.70. PARIS was depressed after rumours that a cut in domestic interest rates was imminent proved unfounded. The CAC-40 index, which had earlier seen a day's high of 1,813.86, fell back to close down 40.50 or 2.2 per cent at 1,779.90 in turnover of some FFr2bn. Concern about 1992 earnings from Elf, due to be released today and expected to show up to a 40 per cent decline in net profit, also weighed on the market. Its shares fell FFr16.50 or 4.8 per cent to FFr324.30. St Gobain lost all of Friday's gains, down FFr14.90 to FFr481.00 while Paribas, which reports provisional 1992 figures later in the week was down FFr12.50 at FFr373.50. ZURICH finished a moderately active session easier but above the day's low. The SMI index finished down 17.3 at 2,085.4. Pharmaceuticals were under pressure: Ciba-Geigy registered shares, SFr3 lower at SFr653, topped the active list while Roche certificates, down SFr30 at SFr4,090, were second. The weak dollar put some selling pressure on cement producer Holderbank, SFr6 easier at SFr552 and on Alusuisse, SFr7 lower at SFr453. Nestle bearers and registered shares fell SFr10 and SFr15 to SFr1,080 and SFr1,075 respectively ahead of preliminary information on its 1992 results due today. SMH, SFr80 lower at SFr1,485, weakened after a weekend newspaper said its project to make an ecological car, from which Volkswagen has withdrawn, was unlikely to succeed and this could hamper sales of the Swatch watch. AMSTERDAM saw chemicals weaken in line with the trend elsewhere in the continent and the CBS Tendency index closed down 0.9 at 98.0. Daf was suspended at Fl 7.20 ahead of the announcement by the group later today of restructuring plans. The market is expecting state aid from the Dutch and Belgium government in conjunction with further staff cuts. Among the fallers DSM lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 76.00, Akzo Fl 1.30 to Fl 135.70 and Ahold Fl 1.20 to Fl 87.40. MILAN retreated, with the market taking its lead from falls in Montedison and Credito Italiano. The Comit index shed 9.53 to 472.09. Montedison fell L61 to L1,216, on reports it might have to pay state energy holding ENI L800bn to settle a dispute over a joint venture which ended several years ago. Credito Italiano fell sharply on reports that it would not be privatised, and failed to recover much when the reports were denied by IRI, its parent company, and Merrill Lynch, which has been appointed by IRI to study the sale of IRI's 67 per cent stake. Credito's shares were fixed L97 lower at L2,978 but struggled back to L3,000 in after-hours trading. Pirelli dipped L9 to L1,189 as it agreed to sell its STL Superga clothing and footwear unit to a subsidiary of Sopaf, an Italian financial group, for L103bn, realising a L70bn book profit on the operation. Gemina fell L80 to L1,205 as speculation subsided that the company might be considering the sale of its stake in paper producer Burgo. Fiat tended L45 easier to L4,286 ahead of preliminary figures on Thursday. STOCKHOLM was broadly lower in heavy trading, led down by a decline as foreign investors sold holdings in Astra. The Affarsvarlden index declined 20.5 to 892.4. After reaching an all-time high at the beginning of the year at SKr765 for Astra A shares, the issue closed SKr20 lower at SKr674, while the B counterpart dropped to SKr18 to SKr661. Astra's fall followed reports of analysts' profits downgradings and also reflects a worldwide trend away from pharmaceutical shares due to fears of price regulation, particularly in the US. VIENNA was easier with the ATX index down 2.78 at 728.19. OMV shares fell Sch6 to Sch593 on last week's announcement of a dividend cut.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- January 25                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1081.77    1081.05    1081.15    1079.91 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1151.44    1151.00    1151.44    1151.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Jan 22     Jan 21     Jan 20  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1091.64    1091.44    1091.84 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1156.91    1154.96    1153.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1076.83    1076.12    1076.50    1077.68 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1148.80    1146.90    1146.46    1146.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                Jan 19     Jan 18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           1090.81    1097.15 FT-SE Eurotrack 200           1155.89    1166.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1081.83 ; 200 -  1153.20 Low/day: 100 -  1075.08  200 -  1145.05  .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

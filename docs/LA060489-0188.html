			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING  </P> <P> Paging Satchel Paige: With the formation of the Senior Professional Baseball  Assn., it's a real-life "Field of Dreams," with Graig Nettles at third, Jerry  Grote behind the plate, Bill Lee on the mound. "Sure, you're asking, 'Can these  guys still play baseball?' " said Curt Flood, who will serve as commissioner.  "Sure, they can. Taking a step or two away from them is not like taking a step  or two away from guys you play with on the playground."  </P> <P> The league is the idea of James F. Morley, a commercial real estate specialist  who decided to proceed with the venture after seeing the success of the senior  golf tour and masters tennis.  </P> <P> The league is supposed to be based in Florida -- where else would retirees go?  -- and have eight franchises. Teams will be composed of former major league  players 35 and older -- 32 for catchers -- and will play 72 games from November  through February. More than 500 players have said they're interested.  </P> <P> "I look at it this way," said Nettles, 44. "It's a chance for me to play again,  and not in some beer league on Sundays."  </P> <P> Said former Dodger Steve Yeager: "So what if I've lost a step? I wasn't that  fast to begin with."  </P> <P> But is the world ready for an old-timers' game every day? Are the old-timers  ready for it?  </P> <P> Bashful Bert: While the National Football League continues its search for a new  commissioner, they might consider Bert Rechichar, the former Baltimore Colt.  </P> <P> Rechichar talked tough and played the same way. He conducted a game of  intimidation, and he has his own ideas about how to handle modern players.  </P> <P> "The trouble with NFL players today is they don't know the value of a dollar,"  Rechichar said. "They have too much money. If I could be the NFL commissioner  and a player messed with drugs, he would not get a second chance. I'd send him  down to Skid Row where he belongs."  </P></p>

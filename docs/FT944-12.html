			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Private View: No rest for peace broker on sidelines One of the first politicians of stature to risk his reputation in the graveyard of Bosnia was Lord Carrington, the British Tory grandee, former foreign secretary and head of Nato. For 12 months between 1991 and 1992 he and Jose Cutileiro of Portugal tried on behalf of the European Union to broker a peace in the ruins of Yugoslavia. They failed. With American cries of 'Sell-out]' echoing ever more insistently across the Atlantic, and with the former US president Jimmy Carter now trying his hand as mediator, I went to ask Lord Carrington what lesson we should draw from the Bosnian disaster. 'Oh, I think the lesson I draw is that you should never intervene in a civil war - and this basically was a civil war - unless you are prepared to take sides,' he said. 'You have to say that the Serbs, or the Moslems, or the Croats are right and be prepared to fight for them. But to put yourself in a position in which you are trying to hold the fort, which the UN has been trying to do, is impossible.' Later he said: 'We've really always known whose side we're on.' Whose side are we on? I asked. But the former negotiator did not reply directly. The international community, he concluded, was totally divided. 'People tried to make it black and white - the Americans certainly - and to say that the Serbs are wholly wrong. But the Serbs have got a case. 'I mean, they are awful in the sense that they carry their case to the most ridiculous and cruel limits, but they have a case. And the Croats have a case. And the Bosnians have a case.' But who in your opinion is in the wrong? 'I don't think any of them are particularly in the wrong. They are all in the wrong. And all have some right on their side.' So it is impossible for us to take sides? 'You could easily have taken sides. Whether you would have been right or not and whether you would have carried the international community with you would be a different matter.' I said: many commentators, especially in the US, say Europe is secretly on the side of Serbia. 'Why do they say that?' They say we act as if we are. 'But that's because we're not acting as if we were on the other side. 'You could make out a very good argument - though it would be considered probably very callous - that by intervening at all we have actually caused more casualties, more ethnic cleansing, more misery than if we'd never intervened at all. 'Because if we had not interevened, this thing would have been settled two years ago. There would have been some very unhappy people, but at the end of all this there are going to be very unhappy people whatever happens.' It is the familiar realpolitik line which has upset front-line observers and armchair pundits alike. In the mouth of a man less courteous and affable, less distinguished and civilised than Peter Carrington, it could have sounded merely cynical. The seventh baron received me at the garden gate of his London hideaway, a large cottage in Knightsbridge quite invisible from the street. A team of gardeners was pruning shrubs and stripping ivy from the walls. Lord Carrington has the pedigree of a model English gentleman: Eton, Sandhurst, the Grenadier Guards, a Military Cross won at the end of the second world war, and a string of political appointments dating back to Winston Churchill's post-war government. Because of his rank and wealth, Carrington's appetite for public service and high office - though not, apparently, for the premiership - could never be called vulgar ambition. His was the independent voice of moderation in Margaret Thatcher's radical administration until the Argentines invaded the Falkland Islands and the foreign secretary fell virtuously on to his sword. 'We got it wrong,' he said. 'There are all sorts of explanations but we did get it wrong and therefore somebody had to take responsibility for it. It's not very fashionable perhaps,' he laughed. 'It was very painful.' The worst moment of your career? 'Oh, of course, yes. Very unpleasant. I'd always wanted to be foreign secretary. It's not very nice to have to resign in those sort of circumstances.' Lord Carrington is among those who argue that Europe's fatal mistake in former Yugoslavia was to recognise Croatian and Slovenian independence prematurely. That, he said, torpedoed the constitutional conference and raised the question of Bosnia's status. 'And it was quite clear that if you asked the Bosnians whether they wanted their independence there was going to be a civil war,' he said. Would you agree that Bosnia has been very embarrassing for us west Europeans? 'Yes, very. And it's brought the UN and Nato into disrepute as well as the European Union. And all had good intentions.' Is this impotence not only embarrassing but also dangerous? 'Very.' What sort of consequences could it have? 'The Balkans are the Balkans, as we know from old Bismarck's remark.' (Bismarck said the region was not worth the bones of a Pomeranian grenadier.) 'But there is a danger that people will feel that in other situations the UN is well-meaning but impotent, that it will only hold the ring if there is no fighting.' What upsets people, I said, is not just our collective impotence, but the feeling that we have failed morally. 'I don't go along with that. Partly because of television, which has made an enormous difference to people's perceptions, and partly because of the press and the media which are bringing it daily into your life, we think that all these problems are capable of being solved. I think some are not. 'And it's all very well for people, frankly, to say that they feel morally culpable. Would they actually have advocated British troops going in there and suffering casualties - and really quite a lot of casualties - to stop this? It was quite clear that no western government was prepared to do that. 'So it's all right round the dinner table to say that you feel humiliated and so on. But would you get up on a platform and say you'd send British soldiers in there to get killed?' Lord Carrington conceded that professional soldiers might be prepared to die under a UN flag but their governments were not going to take that responsibility because of the likely public and media reaction. 'I mean, it's no good wringing your hands if you're not prepared to do something about it. And that's what the great British public, the great American public, the great every public is doing.' We don't know that until we've tried, do we? 'We've a pretty good idea.' At another point Lord Carrington asked: 'Can you say there is a British national interest in what happens in Bosnia?' Plainly there isn't, I agreed. 'In that case, can a government send in British soldiers?' If there is no British interest, nor French, then who is going to keep the peace? Nobody's got an interest yet everyone's got an interest. Lord Carrington answered by saying that the European interest probably consisted of making sure that the war was contained within the former Yugoslavia's borders. If it spread outside, we were bound to intervene against the aggressor. 'In a sense,' he said later, 'it's a faraway country of which we know nothing, or whatever Chamberlain's words were. But I don't think that what we have done is 'appeasement'. What I think is extremely unfair is the attack on General Rose (commander of the UN forces). I'm not pro-Serb. I'm not pro-anybody. They all have a case.' Lord Carrington is 75 now, but still a vigorous man. After I had asked him about his resignation he reflected: 'Politics isn't the be-all and end-all of everyone's existence - as Monsieur Delors has said.' Many people would say you were born lucky, I said, in that you could afford to treat politics with some detachment. 'One was more independent,' he agreed, 'in the sense that this wasn't the only thing in my life. It wasn't the career on which I depended for my livelihood. So I was lucky in that sense.' Do you tell yourself that there's nothing more you can do about it - that you won't be around for whatever next horror is in preparation? Lord Carrington laughed. 'You mean, apres moi le deluge? No, I would like very much to see a resolution of Nato's problems. The US must stay involved, and we should get Nato sorted out to our satisfaction. Certainly the Russians ought not to have a veto over what we do, although we should do everything we can to carry them along and accommodate them. But I do feel there is a new uncertainty in the world.' Are you glad to be out of it all? 'Oh no] Of course not. Why would one be glad to be out of it?' The nimble peer sprang to his feet, and escorted me down the front path to the garden gate.</p>

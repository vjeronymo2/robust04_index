			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother President leader Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat]  received the charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo this  afternoon. During the meeting, Brother Abu-'Ammar entrusted the  charge d'affaires with a verbal message for President Bill  Clinton on the talks currently under way on the implementation  of the declaration of principles agreement, signed in  Washington, and the agreements signed in Cairo. The message  also concerns the attempts and obstacles trumped up by the  Israeli Government to enable it to avoid implementing the  agreements, a matter which exposes the peace process to danger.</p>

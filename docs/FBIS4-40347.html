			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze has not  ruled out that the position of the Georgian Parliament may cause  a postponement of the introduction of Russian troops into the  [Georgian-Abkhazian] conflict. Some of the Georgian  parliamentary deputies assert that the Russian paratroops have  been bought by the Abkhazians and, therefore, cannot act as  peacekeepers.    [Unidentified correspondent] The peacekeeping operation in  Abkhazia has been postponed until 26 June. This was stated by  Shevardnadze at a meeting of the parliamentary majority before  parliament started work. The opinion of the opposition deputies  differs markedly from Shevardnadze's point of view about the  introduction of peacekeeping forces into Abkhazia.    In an interview for Georgian television Shevardnadze  condemned the actions of the opposition and described them as an  attempt to wreck the peacekeeping operation. Shevardnadze  expressed confidence in the success of the peace process, the  first stage of which, the return of refugees to Gali Rayon, will  begin in the next few days.</p>

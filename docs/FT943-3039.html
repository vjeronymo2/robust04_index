			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Russia's decline to slow Russia's economic decline will slow significantly next year, although the country still will be in a 'depression phase', according to Mr Victor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank. He predicted that gross domestic product would contract 4.7 per cent next year, much less than the 19 per cent decline expected for 1994, the Interfax news agency reported. Industrial production would fall 15 per cent in 1995, after a decline of about 25 per cent this year. Mr Gerashchenko noted that inflation would continue its gradual decline next year, falling from 5-6 per cent a month early in 1995 to 3-4 per cent by the end of the year. In August, inflation fell to a record low of 4 per cent a month, but the government still is targeting 7-8 per cent for the end of 1994. Mr Gerashchenko, who was speaking at a banking conference in St Petersburg, said that the budget deficit this year would amount to about 8 per cent of gross domestic product. Last year, the deficit was 9.8 per cent of GDP.</p>

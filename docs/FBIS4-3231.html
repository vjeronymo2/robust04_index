			<p>BFN     [Text] Urumqi, 19 April (XINHUA) -- The Karamay oilfield in  northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has increased  its crude oil production at an annual rate of 300,000 tons (2.1  million barrels) since China opened to the outside world in 1979.    An oilfield official said that Karamay, in the northwestern  part of the Jungar basin, pumped 7.6 million tons of oil in 1993  and it has been rated as China's fourth-largest oil producer for  four successive years.    Reform and opening up have made it possible for the oilfield  to put an end to its stagnant production in the 1970s, he said.    Since 1979 Karamay has imported oil drilling and pumping  equipment, computers, instruments, meters and  ethylene-production technology from Belgium, Britain, France,  Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, the official said.    Since 1980 it has co-operated with the General Geophysical  Company of France, which has sent three seismic teams to make  geophysical surveys in the Jungar basin.    Under a contract, technicians from a U.S. company have  provided technical services to the oilfield, the official said.    To date, Karamay has used 800 million U.S. dollars in  foreign  funds to import technology and equipment, he said. These funds  include loans from the World Bank and a Japanese bank.</p>

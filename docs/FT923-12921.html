			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Network SouthEast is target for Sea Containers SEA CONTAINERS, the Bermuda-based shipping group headed by Mr James Sherwood, has put in a bid to operate a large proportion of British Rail's Network SouthEast services as soon as they come up for privatisation. The company revealed yesterday it had approached the government with proposals to take over all services on the network between London and the south coast towns of Weymouth, Portsmouth, Brighton and Eastbourne, including branch line and suburban services in between. If successful, the company plans to introduce double-decker trains to the main routes so that larger numbers of commuters could be carried in more comfort than is now possible. Mr Sherwood is also considering the idea of running 'jam-buster' car shuttle trains that would carry motorists and their vehicles through heavily congested parts of south-east England. His proposals go far beyond those of other companies that have so far expressed an interest in taking advantage of the government's rail privatisation proposals set out in a white paper on Tuesday. Companies such as Virgin Atlantic, the airline, and Stagecoach, the bus operator, have focused on the idea of operating a small number of trains on InterCity routes where BR will continue to be the main operator. Sea Containers, however, aims to be one of the first companies to bid for a franchise to take over an entire tranche of BR services. The group's claim to credibility as a train operator rests on its position as one of Britain's larger transport companies. Its operations include Wightlink, the Isle of Wight ferry operator; Hoverspeed, the cross-Channel hovercraft and catamaran service; and the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company. As proprietor of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express, which runs between London and Folkestone en route to the continent, it is also the only private sector operator of regularly-scheduled trains on BR tracks. Mr Sherwood's plan is to take on BR's rolling stock initially but to replace it gradually with his own. He would be looking for a 60-year franchise, terminable by the government at 10-year intervals. BR staff would also be taken on, but costs would be cut by issuing them with new contracts of employment requiring much greater flexibility. Steep fare increases would be necessary to make the services pay, Mr Sherwood said. Part of the deal would have to be an agreement by the government that commuter fares would be allowable against tax. German transport plan, Page 2 BR's rules for suppliers, Page 9</p>

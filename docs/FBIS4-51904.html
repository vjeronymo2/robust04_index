			<p>BFN     [Text] North Korean President Kim Il-song's lump is  growing as time goes by. It has been confirmed that President  Kim Il-song's lump on the back of his neck is growing bigger and  causes him discomfort.    CHUNGANG ILBO has exclusively obtained photographs taken by  a  Western figure, who recently visited North Korea, using his  video recorder. Compared to a photograph that was made public  in 1988 (black and white), these photographs show that his lump  is growing bigger (top picture) and expanding toward his head  (middle picture) and his lower neck (bottom picture). This lump  is not fatal. President Kim Il-song has been undergoing  acupuncture treatment since the seventies because surgery on  this lump may hurt his brain.</p>

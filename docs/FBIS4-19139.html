			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Hans-Juergen Mahnke report: "Optimist Rexrodt: No Boom, </F> But Upswing"]    [Text] Bonn -- Even though FRG Economics Minister Guenter  Rexrodt does not predict a boom in Germany for this year, he  does predict a moderate upswing. "I am quite sure of it." In  contrast to the pessimistic announcements from the economic  associations upon the presentation of the annual economic report  in January, Rexrodt thinks that a growth of 1 to 1.5 percent  across Germany is likely. The growth in the west will be between  0.5 and 1 percent and in the east between 6 and 8 percent.  "Possibly, this is the lower limit of what can be achieved,"  the minister stresses. As a result of the improved situation in  the international economy, export conditions have improved  considerably. On the inside, improvements in productivity and  cost reductions have taken place. The companies are well on  their way to regain their technological top position.    The minister does ignore that there are still unutilized  capacities in German industry. Therefore, the companies are  restrained with investment. Domestic consumption has been  dampened, among other things, because of the tax increase this  year. In 1995 the solidarity surcharge will be added. Over the  next few years the expected room for maneuver must be used not  to dispense benefits but to reduce taxes.    Before the end of this legislative period the Federal  Government wants to set down the basic values for the corporate  tax reform. It is undisputed that trade tax and taxes that are  not related to profit must be reduced. Something must also be  done for low wage-earners and concerning taxation of the  subsistence level. The main question for Rexrodt is: What  about the top tax rates? As of 1996 these must also be reduced  for nonbusiness revenue, first to 47 percent for the time being.  "In the medium-term, until the end of the next legislative  period, I expect a reduction of the top tax rates to clearly  below 45 percent." Inflation is no longer a topic now. "The  two before the decimal point can be achieved." For the new  laender he expects inflation at 3.5 percent, which is less than  the 4 percent predicted by the annual economic report.    Unemployment remains the sensitive spot. This winter the  4-million threshold was exceeded. This will not be repeated.  However, great success will be achieved only in 1995.    During this legislative period the Law on Simplifying  Planning and the Investment Facilitation and Housing  Construction Land Law were passed. In addition, improvements  were made for work time and the labor exchange monopoly of the  Federal Employment Office was abolished. The discount law is  being discussed by parliament just now.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Europe should follow US on petrol pollution Sir, The debate over the relative healthfulness of unleaded petrol (Letters, July 11 and 13) contains no reference to the example of the US, where the problems of urban motor pollution have been more severe and the attempts to address them more rigorous than in Europe. As of January 1995 the US refining industry will be required to produce a new green gasoline for highly polluted urban areas. Two of the specifications for this green gasoline limit its benzene and overall aromatics content, to combat the proliferation of airborne carcinogens and ground-level ozone. The Bonn proposal to restrict benzene ('Bonn threatens action on petrol pollutant', July 7) has, therefore, a precedent and one which is far more comprehensive. The specifications for US green gasoline are the result of a three-year research programme in which government and the oil and auto industries collaborated. Another example which the EU and European industry may do well to follow. Adam Seymour, Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6FA</p>

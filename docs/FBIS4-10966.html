			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vera Araujo] </F>   [Text] Documents found at the house of Detective Inspector  Nestor Silvio Soares Maganinho, who was assigned to the Robbery  and Cargo Theft Division in Bangu and served as a bodyguard for  numbers game kingpin Castor de Andrade, are proof of the link  existing between the numbers game and the smuggling of arms,  possibly those used by drug traffickers and by robbers of  armored bank vehicles. The documents were picked up by the PM-2  (Military Police Secret Service) squad five days before the raid  of Andrade's main accounting office in Bangu on 30 March. The  documents will be submitted today by the 34th Precinct to the  Civilian Police Internal Affairs Department.    All of the 183 ammunition requisition forms found at the  bodyguard's house are in the name of Castor de Andrade, his  bodyguards, numbers game kingpin Ailton Guimaraes -- who is also  known as Captain Guimaraes -- and even in the name of police  officer Idovan Ferreira, who is the head of the 4th Civilian  Police Regional Division in Araruama. Through the documents  seized, the police reached the conclusion that the arms smuggled  by Andrade's gang were coming by ship through Sepetiba,  Itacuruca, and Angra dos Reis.    Ironically, Captain Guimaraes' name has in the past already  been linked to arms smuggling. Early in the 1970's, Guimaraes  had to answer charges at a military police inquest on charges of  withholding smuggled goods. As a result of the inquest,  Guimaraes had to retire, and thus his life of crime began.    The chief of the 34th Police Precinct (Bangu), Carlos  Alberto  Campagnac, said the smuggled goods are not entering the city  through the international airport or through the port of Rio de  Janeiro. Castor de Andrade may be using remote beaches outside  the area of influence of the Federal Police. Campagnac, who is  also listed as having received bribes from Andrade, said:  "Andrade's ships can navigate on the ocean. We are thus  looking into his fleet of ships."    According to police, because the bribes demanded by federal  agents for the release of the arms "are high," Andrade has been  using his own ships to transport ammunition and arms imported  from the United States and Israel. According to a Federal  Revenue Secretariat [SRF] source, "there is no way to stop  smuggling in the port of Sepetiba and the surrounding area."  The SRF source added that there is not even enough manpower to  discharge its 60 tasks. The Federal Police reported that its  function at the port of Sepetiba is just to check passengers.    In addition to the documents found at Maganinho's house,  which is located at 771 of Doze de Fevereiro St., the police  also seized a sizable amount of ammunition and imported weapons  -- such as a Smith and Wesson revolver -- plates for  identification cards, licenses and CPF's [Individual Tax Payers  Registers], and even Point Blank bulletproof vests manufactured  in the United States.    Judge Marcos Antonio Bakker of the Second Bangu District has  already issued an arrest warrant against Maganinho, who remains  at large. Campagnac reported that the items seized at  Maganinho's house will be examined by experts, along with the  weapons confiscated at Andrade's headquarters -- where his  bodyguards used to stay -- 18 days ago, which included an Uzi  submachine gun. The writing on the requisition forms will be  compared with that of the accounting books seized at the  Andrade's accounting office.</p>

			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Survey of The European Single Market (3): Now comes the hard part - Enforcing the new legislation will provide the real test AFTER pushing dozens of new laws through their national parliaments, EC member states must now live up to their promises and make the European single market work. One word is likely to dominate debate on the single market in 1993: enforcement. Striking the correct balance between the supervisory role of member states and the European Commission will not be easy; but it is vital if cross-border disputes about implementation are to be avoided and confidence in the single market is to be retained. The task is daunting. Rhetoric in Brussels about the irreversible common destiny of EC member states often minimises the deep-rooted diversity. Just as there is an obvious 'top tier' of strong economies in northern Europe built around Germany, so too there will be a 'lower tier' of countries lagging on enforcement standards - particularly in the sensitive area of public procurement where the temptation to protect national companies will be formidable. The signs already point in this direction. Although 95 per cent of the single market programme set out in the original white paper were complete by the end of 1992, less than half of it was expected to be transposed into national law of all 12 member states, according to a report by the committee on economic, monetary and industrial affairs of the European Parliament. Denmark, often accused of being the Community troublemaker after its rejection of the Maastricht treaty, has the best track-record on transposition. Moreover, there are important gaps in implementation in areas such as dual-use technology which can have military application, explosives, works of art and meat goods. Nor are companies likely to be ready to adjust to the new rules covering VAT collection. Mr Ben Patterson, the Conservative MEP who authored the above report, is flush with examples of foot-dragging in common professional standards: Greek engineers trained in Germany whose qualifications are not recognised back home; British airline pilots who, having worked for a private German airline, cannot get permanent jobs; and a failure to reach agreement on general recognition of higher education diplomas. The most serious work to date on enforcement is the report drawn up by Mr Peter Sutherland, the former EC Commissioner responsible for competition policy, who chaired a high-level group on implementation last year. The 60-page study makes numerous practical suggestions aimed at making the single market fairer, more consumer-friendly, more open and more efficient in terms of streamlining its laws. Among its chief recommendations are: A 'deeper partnership' between the European Commission and member states aimed at exchanging information, mainly through officials working on an informal basis; Provision by states and Brussels of informal advice on redress for breaches of EC law to those requesting it. Plus an ombudsman at EC level or in each member state; Systematic consolidation of EC law and creation of a legislative co-ordination unit inside the Commission to prevent overlap; A better understanding and use of EC law, including possible compulsory courses for judges and a new communications campaign to make sure EC citizens are aware of their legal rights. The Sutherland report was influenced heavily by the debate within the Community on 'subsidiarity' - devolving decision-making to the lowest appropriate level - which erupted in the wake of the Danes' rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Some critics have wondered whether Mr Sutherland pulled some of his enforcement punches. His panel's rejection, at this stage, of a central clearing house to collect data on infringement of the single market, for example, may reflect fears of a new Brussels bureaucracy policing cross-border trade; but it raises the threat of unsatisfactory trade-offs between countries. 'Those who have stronger standards of implementation will lose out,' says one EC official. The UK, the driving force behind subsidiarity, is anxious that the Commission does not turn into a shrinking violet. This is not so much a political volte face; more a hard-headed calculation that if cross-border disputes flare up, the Commission is well placed to act as arbiter rather than burdening the European Court with dozens of legal cases. Thus, a recent UK draft proposes permanent Commission inspectorates to monitor selectively member states' performance, and a Commission review which 'where necessary' may go to the relevant Council of Ministers. 'The logic of the internal market demands satisfactory arrangements for its joint management by the Commission and the national administrations,' says the report. As the Commission's response to both the Sutherland and the UK report made clear, much will depend on strengthening the machinery for co-operation between Brussels and member states. Proposals include a new training policy for officials in enforcement, new computer networks to speed up the flow of data on the operation of the internal market, and more efficient management of the customs union. These are the challenges facing those struggling to keep the playing field level in the single market; but it is clear that plenty of voices will be calling for the outstanding gaps to be filled. Mr Patterson is convinced that there are sufficient uncovered areas to warrant production of a new Commission white paper. 'In addition, there will be a need to deal with the new barriers to free movement which changing technology and the ingenuity of protectionist forces will create.' The converse argument is that some forces - such as organised crime - may be so adept at freedom of movement of goods and capital that calls for reimposing some controls may prove irresistible. But for the moment the forces of integration are firmly in the saddle as the race to take advantage of the single market enters the home stretch.</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BORG WON'T GO AGAINST THE GRAIN;  </P> <P> TENNIS: ONE OF THE GAME'S GREATEST PLAYERS IS TRYING TO MAKE A COMEBACK. BUT HE  REFUSES TO GIVE UP HIS OLD-FASHIONED WOODEN RACKETS.  </P> <P> Like an old warrior tempted by the prospect of future battles, Bjorn Borg has  drawn his trusty wooden sword and begun preparing for a return to tennis.  </P> <P> It has been nearly a decade since Borg won the last of his 11 Grand Slam  titles. It has been several years since a professional player used a wooden  racket, still Borg's favorite weapon.  </P> <P> Though most wooden rackets today are consigned to museums or musty closets,  Borg had 10 of the relics restrung and shipped to him as he began serious  training this summer.  </P> <P> Percy Rosberg, the Swede's first coach, said Borg tried modern rackets during  exhibition tours with John McEnroe a few years ago and did not like them. He  occasionally practices with oversize graphite rackets now, without much  success.  </P> <P> "He is having a tough time getting used to the new rackets," Rosberg said.  "Bjorn told me he lost control on the third or fourth stroke in a rally."  </P> <P> Borg has been working out with top British junior players in London. He has  refused to put a timetable on his comeback or predict whether he'll be able to  return to the tour.  </P> <P> But he said he's overcome the malaise that led him to quit at the age of 26 and  that he's enjoying tennis again after a decade of personal and financial  problems.  </P> <P> "When I retired I was not really putting in 100% every match," he said. "Now,  mentally I feel strong for tennis and I want to put my mind back into it."  </P> <P> But even if Borg is able to work his 34-year-old body into top shape, can a man  using a wooden racket compete with players such as Pete Sampras, who hits  serves at 125 m.p.h. with a racket made with space-age technology?  </P> <P> "For sure the game has become more powerful and moved on," Borg said. "That is  why I have to make sure that physically and mentally I am match-ready."  </P> <P> Other athletes have made gallant comebacks in recent years, but the wooden  racket sets Borg apart.  </P> <P> George Foreman uses the same gloves as other boxers. Jockey Lester Piggott, who  rode a winner in the Breeders' Cup last month after a five-year layoff, employs  the same racing tools as his peers.  </P> <P> Rosberg said graphite rackets increase ball speed by up to 12 m.p.h., which  means Borg would be using a cannon against a ballistic missile.  </P> <P> Borg, who has denied reports he is seeking a comeback because he needs the  money, said he is most comfortable with wood.  </P> <P> "I tested other rackets, but I feel at ease with my old one," he said. "Many  claim that it's impossible to play tennis with a wooden racket nowadays. I know  it's possible."  </P></p>

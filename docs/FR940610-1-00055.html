			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of food service workers and directors cautioned that increasing portion sizes of certain foods and serving more expensive fresh produce to meet a 30 percent limit on calories from fat may result in higher costs. Some commenters also expressed concern that lowering fat may result in decreased calories critical for growing children. Several commenters advised that low fat meals need to be appealing so children will consume them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several industry representatives indicated that industry is responsive to the need to lower fat and is already making a number of changes to provide more low fat products. A number of commenters, including food service staff, parents and members of the general public made specific recommendations on how to lower fat in school meals, such as trimming or draining fat from meat, eliminating added fats from vegetables, and serving soups more often.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, many commenters, primarily students and the general public, suggested that the fat content in school meals could be reduced by offering more vegetarian meals, eliminating the whole milk requirement, revising the commodity system to encourage more purchases of low fat items such as fruits and vegetables, and reducing the amount of fast food items and processed foods in school meals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Meat and Meat Related Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received over 200 comments related to meat products, with most comments coming from students, parents and the general public. Many commenters indicated that the current serving size for the meat/meat alternate component is too large and recommended that schools cut down on the amount of meat served. Commenters also indicated that more poultry and fish should be offered. Some commenters recommended that tofu and isolated soy proteins, as well as yogurt, be added to the list of allowable meat alternatives. (The Department wishes to call attention to the fact that isolated soy proteins are currently permitted with some limitations.) On the other hand, several industry representatives cautioned against reducing the amount of meat too much due to its nutritional contributions, specifically, essential amino acids, iron, zinc, and vitamin B6. They also observed that children are familiar with meat and will consume it more readily than some alternative protein sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Menu Selection and Variety Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department received over 250 comments in support of offering more vegetarian meals. Commenters supported the low fat nature of vegetarian meals and their contribution to a healthful diet. Others addressed the need to expose children to more vegetarian foods and foods from diverse cultures at an early age. Some commenters provided specific examples of non-meat items, such as tofu and other plant-based sources, that could be used in school meals, while others simply indicated a general need for more meat-free alternatives. Students as well as school food service personnel indicated the need to offer vegetarian choices as students are requesting them more.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department received over 800 comments in support of the use of more fruits, vegetables, or grain products. Commenters gave specific recommendations regarding preparation methods and serving ideas, including offering salad bars more frequently, increasing the variety of fruits and vegetables, and serving more whole grain items. Others recommended the use of more grain and bean products, citing their nutritional benefit as well as low cost. Many school food service commenters expressed concern over serving more and a wider variety of fruits and vegetables as children may not be familiar with them and, therefore, may not consume them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Breakfast Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> About 200 commenters, primarily from the medical, school food service, and education communities, addressed breakfast meal issues with a number of these commenters supporting the importance of breakfast to the health of children. A number of food service personnel indicated their success with the SBP and desire to increase participation. Others, while supporting the SBP, expressed concern with the nutritional quality of breakfasts currently offered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Financial, Paperwork, and Other Operational Obstacles Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Over 250 commenters addressed financial and paperwork obstacles, with many of these comments coming from food service (local and State) professionals, the general public, and the nutrition community. A number of commenters indicated that the need to avoid operating at a deficit has prevented food service staff from providing more nutritious meals. Commenters also complained that the amount of paperwork required to administer the feeding programs is excessive and that the review system is cumbersome and inflexible. Specifically, commenters stressed the need to focus more on nutrition and less on meal-by-meal accountability, income verification, and review requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters expressed concern over the cost of producing meals under the current meal pattern system. Commenters indicated that schools already find it difficult to provide meals within current resources and maintained that any further nutritional requirements placed on schools would result in additional financial hardship. Commenters specifically noted obstacles such as the increased cost of providing more foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, low fat and low sodium ingredients, and the increased portion sizes needed to meet the nutrition standards without exceeding the 30% fat limitation. On the other hand, some parents and students indicated that they would be willing to pay extra for more nutritious meals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters indicated that the school meal periods are not adequate, thereby forcing students to throw food away, consume it too quickly, or bring meals from home to prevent waiting in the lunch line. Others expressed concern that more nutritious meals would require larger portions or extra food items that children may not be able to consume during short lunch periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

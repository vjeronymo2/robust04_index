			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dzhaba Ioseliani, head of the Georgian </F> delegation at the Geneva talks on the settlement of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, by Inga Abgarova and Tinatin  Gviniashvili; place and date not given: "Maintaining Georgia's  Territorial Integrity -- This Is the Most Important Thing...."]    [Text] [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Batono [Georgian polite form  of address] Dzhaba, what is your assessment of the talks that  were recently held in Geneva? Was any progress made?    [Ioseliani] I did not see that any particular progress was  made. There was too much beating around the bush. I would say  that the Abkhazian side does not hold a specific position.  However, we presented a number of constructive proposals. The  demands presented by the Abkhazians are unrealistic and not  viable. The one thing that can be viewed as a positive result  is that the Abkhazians have finally become convinced that there  cannot be a so-called independent Abkhazia. Even the most  reactionary-minded separatist leaders have finally realized this  and come to terms with it. They are now dashing about, trying  to find a way out of the situation and think up some form or  another so that they can run with the hare and hunt with the  hounds, as they say. Our aim is to activate the peacekeeping  forces so that they move into the conflict zone.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Peacekeeping forces from which state  would be the most welcome for the peacekeeping operation in  Abkhazia?    [Ioseliani] We have several options at our disposal today.  The United Nations, the CSCE, and so forth have become involved  in this matter. I believe the ideal option would be to bring in  Russian peacekeeping troops under UN command. I have in mind  high command, UN jurisdiction. This option is good for us, good  for Russia, and good for the whole world. All this is  realistic, provided that there is no clash of interests between  the UN and Russian sides.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Can one say that the most important  thing at the negotiations was the question of the return of the  refugees?    [Ioseliani] All questions were decided on an equal level, as  should be. As for the question of the status of Abkhazia, all  is clear on this score. We agree to all the conditions and do  not intend to restrict the Abkhazians in any way, something  that, incidentally, we have never done. However, there is one  condition: Maintaining the territorial integrity of Georgia --  this is the most important thing. One should not forget that  the Georgian people have never been vindictive. Georgia has  always been famous for its amazing ability to get along with  people of different nationalities. This is a brilliant quality  that our people have.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] You will, of course, agree that, in  today's conditions and specifically regarding the question of  settlement in Abkhazia, it is very important for Georgia how  world opinion and, in particular, Russia views us. Nonetheless,  as we have learned, it is precisely in Russia that there has  recently developed a negative attitude toward Georgia. Many, in  particular member of Parliament Tengiz Kitovani [former defense  minister], explain this as enmity toward the head of state.    [Ioseliani] This is not the case. Some people like someone,  others do not. This is a superficial judgment. Perhaps there  are those within Kitovani's circle who, being aware of his  strained relations with the head of state, deliberately state  things in this way. Such a view can be explained by the fact  that many shortsighted politicians in Russia blame Shevardnadze  for destroying the empire. They do not understand that the  empire could have met with a far more terrible fate.    Having returned to the track of normal development, Russia  has embarked upon the path of democracy. Intelligent people in  Russia have a fairly good view of Georgia.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] We cannot fail to ask you about your  brainchild, the "Mkhedrioni" [former legally sanctioned  paramilitary group that was incorporated into the Rescue Corps].  What fate has befallen it?    [Ioseliani] The "Mkhedrioni" as such does not exist. There  is the Rescue Corps, whose members have become assimilated into  the structures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD]. In my  view, this should lead to some constructive changes in the work  of this staid department. Our MVD is the real Soviet Union. It  reminds me of a prehistoric machine that is useless. Work there  is conducted according to the old traditional principles. Some  of our lads were not taken on, having been rejected as  unsuitable. You see, some people's fathers had in the past been  put on trial. One can imagine that those who are sitting there  and taking bribes have more right to work in these structures.  In short, you should remember that new wine cannot be kept in  old bottles. These have to be changed.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] As we have learned, members of the  Rescue Corps are now involved in the exchange of prisoners and  the bodies of the dead on the Inguri Bridge. Who is controlling  their activities?    [Ioseliani] Yes, our lads who fought in Abkhazia are well in  control of the situation. Therefore, they were included in the  Commission for the Exchange of Prisoners that is headed by Paata  Zakareishvili. I control their activities.    [SVOBODNAYA GRUZIYA] Do you have any information on the  results, if there are any, of the investigation into the series  of murders of "Mkhedrioni" members?    [Ioseliani] As yet, I know nothing. There exist many  versions. Although both the security services and MVD and the  Procurator's Office are dealing with these matters, I do not see  any results. Some of these murders were carried out in such a  professional manner that I suspect the involvement of state  structures or the international mafia in them. However, the  knot will eventually be unraveled....</p>

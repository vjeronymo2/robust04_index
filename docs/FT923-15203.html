			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Interest downturn leaves Gold Greenlees at Pounds 4.1m GOLD GREENLEES Trott, the advertising and marketing services group, reported pre-tax profits down by 19 per cent, from Pounds 5.02m to Pounds 4.09m, on turnover off 12 per cent at Pounds 234.1m for the year to April 30. The outcome included net exceptionals of Pounds 482,000 resulting from the sale of subsidiaries, including Pavilion and 70 per cent of Media Solutions. Investment income, however, was badly hit, falling from Pounds 1.73m to Pounds 826,000, largely due to a final pay-out on an earlier acquisition and lower interest rates, particularly in the US. Operational costs were reduced to Pounds 36.5m (Pounds 38.2m). Earnings per share were 17.28p (19.16p). A final dividend of 5p maintains the total at 8.3p. Mr Michael Greenlees, chairman, said yesterday: 'In many ways we believe that we have never been in better shape with only the poor economic conditions spoiling an otherwise encouraging picture.' The company has three offices in the US - in Texas, Minnesota and Georgia - and 'all three offices are performing outstandingly' said Mr Greenlees. He said that US pre-tax profits were up 64 per cent to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m). 'We have really moved against the trend in North America,' he added.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> LEERY OWNERS REOPEN SHOPS AFTER KILLING  </P> <P> Merchants nervously resumed business Sunday at a small shopping center in  Oxnard where a man buying a soda was killed in a drive-by shooting that  authorities said was Ventura County's first homicide this year.  </P> <P> Rufino Ducler, 45, of Camarillo was shot once in the back Saturday in the  parking lot of the busy shopping center near First Street and Rose Avenue, said  Sgt. Denny Phillips of the Oxnard Police Department.  </P> <P> Ducler was pronounced dead at St. John's Regional Medical Center less than an  hour after the 5 p.m. shooting in the Latino barrio, La Colonia. He was the  first person in the county to be murdered this year, Deputy Coroner Jim Wingate  said.  </P> <P> Phillips said that Ducler was not a gang member, but police have not ruled out  the possibility that the gunmen may have been connected to a gang. Witnesses  could not provide descriptions of the car or how many people were in it,  Phillips said.  </P> <P> Ducler, who worked at a paper recycling company in Oxnard, "seems to be an  innocent victim of circumstance, kind of the wrong place at the wrong time,"  Phillips said.  </P> <P> In recent years, the small parking lot where Ducler was shot has been the scene  of drinking and brawling, Phillips said.  </P> <P> Only three hours after Ducler was shot, store clerks watched in fear as a fight  erupted in the same lot. A window at the Ortiz Bakery was shot out, said bakery  worker Juan Ortiz as he served customers Sunday.  </P> <P> Police may assign another patrol unit to the area if the violence continues,  Phillips said. One unit patrols the area at present, he said.  </P> <P> A clerk at one of the stores said Ducler was a frequent customer who stopped by  Saturday to buy a soda. The clerk, who asked to be identified only as Virgie,  said she is worried about the escalation of crime at the small stores in the  center that cater primarily to neighborhood shoppers.  </P> <P> "I'm telling you, it's scary, scary!" Virgie said.  </P> <P> Ventura County law enforcement officials have said they are concerned about  increased gang activity in the county, particularly in Oxnard. However, Oxnard  police have repeatedly downplayed the city's gang problem, saying youth gangs  that roam the city are different from the hard-core urban gangs that rule Los  Angeles neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "Oxnard hasn't really been gang-involved," Phillips said. "We have been very  fortunate that we haven't had the gang problems that L.A. has."  </P> <P> Shootings in Oxnard average about 10 a year and are down compared to last year,  said Phillips, although he could not provide statistics.  </P> <P> Saturday, stores bordering the parking lot were closed for two hours while  police questioned witnesses after the shooting. As retailers resumed business  Sunday, shops were abuzz with news of the shooting.  </P> <P> "When they shot at that guy, I didn't think it was serious," said Rodrigo de la  Paz, owner of Rodrigo's Market. De la Paz said he was serving customers when he  heard four shots ring out and "saw the guy fall down right there in the corner  outside."  </P> <P> Another sales clerk said Sunday that the drive-by shooting and subsequent fight  disrupted the shopping center and alarmed customers, but it was business as  usual afterward. "I just continued with my job," he said. "It's all you can  do."  </P></p>

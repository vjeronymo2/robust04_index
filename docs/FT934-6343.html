			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bombardier settles dispute with TML A row between Bombardier, a Canadian supplier of trains for the Channel tunnel, and Transmanche Link, the main contractor, over a CDollars 746m (Pounds 379m) claim to cover cost overruns has been settled, the two sides announced yesterday. Details will not be announced until the settlement has been approved by the boards of the two companies and Eurotunnel - operator of the cross-Channel link - on December 3, but Canadian analysts estimated the agreement would be worth CDollars 350m to Bombardier. Bombardier lodged its claim against TML last summer to cover extra manufacturing costs incurred due to late design changes ordered by TML. The original contract, awarded in July 1989, was for the supply of 254 shuttle rail cars costing CDollars 650m. The agreement removes the threat of further delays to the start of cross-Channel services next spring. The rail cars being built by Bombardier will carry cars, coaches and their passengers between the terminals at Folkestone and Calais. More details will be released after formal approval has been given, Bombardier said. It has already made special provisions totalling CDollars 225m to cover possible losses on the shuttle car contract. If the agreement is approved early next month it will avoid the possibility of the dispute going to court. Mr Laurent Beaudoin, Bombardier chairman, had warned that legal action might become necessary if the dispute was not settled by the year end. Bombardier halted production of the rail cars being built by its Eurorail subsidiary at its plant at Bruges, Belgium, in March, but resumed deliveries in June. Eurotunnel said yesterday that it had not been affected by the delays in shipments of the rail cars, but it was concerned that problems could arise if the dispute had continued. 'It was important for us to have something done about it,' Eurotunnel commented. Nearly 100 of the rail cars have been delivered to TML and are being prepared for commissioning. Shuttle services carrying trucks and cars under the Channel are due to start next May, while passenger-only trains are due to start running between London Waterloo, Brussels Midi and Paris Gare du Nord in June or July.</p>

			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Parking duty passes to councils A parking system which removes responsibility for enforcement from the police and hands it to local authorities comes into effect throughout London today. Parking infringements will no longer be treated as criminal offences but will be dealt with as an administrative issue by the local authorities and, if necessary, as a civil matter in the county courts. The system has been introduced in the 33 London boroughs but three-quarters of local authorities around the country have expressed an interest in adopting it. The Parking Committee for London said the idea was borrowed from US cities such as Chicago and Philadelphia, but was its first example in Europe. The government believes parking regulations will be enforced more effectively while a burden is removed from the police. Local authorities can spend any surplus from fines on improving parking facilities, upgrading roads or public transport. Traffic wardens will be replaced by local-authority parking attendants who will enforce parking laws with the help of hand-held computers. They will issue penalty-charge notices for Pounds 30, Pounds 40 or Pounds 60. One feature of the system is that prompt settlement is encouraged by discounts of 50 per cent if a ticket is paid within 14 days. Under the Road Traffic Act of 1991 councils also have the power to tow away or clamp vehicles. Under the previous rules police in London issued up to 2m parking tickets a year, but at one stage fewer than half were paid. Motorists who feel they have been unjustly treated may take their case to an independent tribunal known as the Parking Appeals Service. Instead of being summoned to a magistrates court motorists will be able to make an appointment at a time which suits them. The 1,500 traffic wardens employed by the police in London will be redeployed to enforce no-stopping rules on the 'red routes' which are being introduced to speed traffic throughout London.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / Markets Report: Dollar rises above Y100 Conciliatory statements from Japanese officials yesterday helped the market overcome fears about a trade war between the US and Japan, driving the dollar above Y100, writes Philip Gawith. The markets took a benign view of the breakdown in talks, buoyed by comments from a Japanese Foreign Ministry official that talks might resume in early September. The dollar finished in London more than 1 1/2 yen firmer at Y100.415 from Y98.85. It was also higher against the D-Mark, ending at DM1.5814 from DM1.5743. The US currency showed little further change at the New York close at Y100.34 and DM1.5824. In the UK, interest rate sentiment was improved by the Bank of England's latest inflation report and a further calming of worries about an imminent interest rate rise. Three-month sterling LIBOR traded at 5 9/16 per cent, down from 5 3/4 per cent on Monday. Short sterling futures also recovered, with the September contract closing four basis points up at 94.21. Prices firmed further to 94.28 after the release of the inflation report. The trade weighted sterling index finished firmer at 79.3 from 79, but the pound weakened after the release of the Bank of England's monetary report, which was more bullish than expected on inflation. The UK currency closed in London at DM2.4346 from DM2.4221. It was little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.5396. Trade in Europe was thin as holiday spirit took hold. The Italian lira remained weak, finishing unchanged at L1,003 against the D-Mark. Analysts were split as to whether the dollar's breach of Y100 marked a change in sentiment, or simply a temporary recovery before the downward trend was resumed. Two factors seemed to underpin the dollar's firmness: the belief in some quarters that the Clinton administration is pursuing a strong dollar, rather than a benign, neglect policy; and the view that the trade row will be resolved. The market is clearly of the view that both parties want a deal badly, and hence will achieve one before the end-September deadline. Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at Industrial Bank of Japan in London, cited a further factor: a change in US - Japan capital flows. 'We have noted some quite important switching out of yen assets into US assets by international investors. There may be a tide turning here on the yen. People are showing much more of a preparedness to risk a few per cent loss on the currency. Increasingly, people are getting attracted to the higher yields in the US.' Mr Hannah added that the dollar had the potential to rise to Y102-3 before the September deadline. In contrast, Mr Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London, said that although the market was taking the view that a compromise trade deal would be reached, he would not rule out a further bout of yen strength. The Bank of England, in its daily monetary operations, underlined the message that interest rates remained unchanged. After forecasting a shortage of Pounds 1.1bn, it offered early assistance to the market of Pounds 850m. The Bank later provided a further Pounds 475m after revising the shortage to Pounds 1.3bn. Overnight money traded between 2 and 5 per cent. The Bank's accommodating stance helped douse fears of a rise in interest rates, reflected in the better performance of short sterling and cash rates in the money market. The fall in the level of three-month money should assist the Bank in handling this Friday's Treasury bill tender. Markets continued to be much occupied with last week's treasury bill auction which fuelled speculation of higher interest rates. Following earlier near blanket condemnation of the Bank, some revisionist voices have started to appear. One money market source was scathing about the reaction of the City and much press comment, saying it had been at best mischievous, at worst manipulative. 'I think it was downright irresponsible,' he said. Noting that the Bank's inflation bulletin suggested that they did not believe there were large inflation pressures in the economy, he continued: 'You get the impression that the market is much more concerned about inflation than the Bank is.' Mr Hannah of IBJ said Friday's events were just an 'unsubtle' way of preparing the market for higher rates. 'The Bank is experienced enough to know exactly how the market would react.' He said they were part of a pattern of events, including Mr Eddie George's Mansion House speech, where he said rate rises were inevitable, and his comments in the most recent monetary minutes, that there was an advantage in raising rates before inflation rose. Mr Hannah said the Bank's activities had had the desired impact of putting the market on interest rate alert. This meant the UK would probably avoid the ructions that followed the first policy tight-ening in the US earlier this year. 'It has to be regarded as successful monetary management,' he added.</p>

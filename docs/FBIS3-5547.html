			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] After attending a training course for the district  chapter chairmen of the Democratic Liberal Party, Vice Foreign  Minister Hong Sun-yong said today that the inspection of North  Korea by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] had not  reached a point that would be acceptable to us, and that the  North-South dialogue had not proceeded smoothly. It is therefore  not clear whether the third round of U.S.-North Korean  high-level talks will be held on 21 March as scheduled.    Vice Foreign Minister Hong said: If the talks are not held  as scheduled, the North Korean nuclear issue cannot but return  to the starting point. Considering this, the government has  continued to discuss the presentation of the nuclear issue to  the UN Security Council with friendly countries, such as the  United States.</p>

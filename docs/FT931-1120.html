			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / The Property Market: No clear trend emerged from IPD results for February NO CLEAR trend emerged from the February results of the Investment Property Databank (IPD) Monthly Index. Total returns fell slightly from January to 0.1 per cent. Both capital and rental values continued to decline, falling by 0.6 per cent and 1.0 per cent respectively. The year-on-year measurements showed negligible change in all three sectors. The 12-month total return figure for All Properties remained negative for the year to February. Industrial property succumbed to declining rental values and fell into second place behind the retail sector, with returns of 0.3 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively. Office yields shifted outwards in February to 10.5 per cent; the total monthly return for the sector fell back to -0.3 per cent. Despite a slight improvement in the rate of rental value growth for February, an outward shift in the equivalent yield had an adverse impact on capital growth, leading to a fall in the total return index of half a point. However, in the longer term all three measures point to a modest improvement in the office sector, with total return reaching its highest year-on-year level since August last year at -5.8 per cent. Returns for the industrial sector remained positive, improving by 0.3 per cent for the month.</p>

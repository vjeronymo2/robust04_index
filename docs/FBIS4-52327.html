			<p>BFN     [Text] The Government is considering drafting an  anti-money laundering law as part of stepped-up measures against  the lucrative drug trade.    The disclosure, made by an anti-narcotics agency chief  yesterday, follows the United States accusation last week that  prominent Thai businessman and Opposition Chat Thai MP Thanong  Siriprichapong is involved in exporting marijuana to the US.    Pol Gen [Police General] Chawalit Yotmani, secretary-general  of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board [ONCB], said his  agency was in the process of coordinating with government  organizations to draw up the law.    The legislation would empower government officials to check  into the financial records of individuals suspected of  involvement in the narcotics trade and to confiscate any money  found to have been derived from drug sales.    The ONCB earlier successfully pushed for the law empowering  the Government to confiscate the assets of people convicted of  narcotics offenses.    "The planned legislation is expected to help effectively  deal  with the lucrative narcotics business," said Pol Gen Chawalit.    The ONCB chief said he believed government agencies  responsible for financial matters such as the Finance Ministry  had the capability and methods to trace the financial records of  suspected drug traders.    Pol Gen Chawalit, emphasizing the urgency of the  legislation,  said he had discussed the matter with government leaders and  many had supported its early implementation.    Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan, while confirming  the proposed law was in the making, said the Government would  have to be careful in enacting such legislation as it could  contradict the principle of basic human rights.    The Government will have to study past problems in solving  the narcotics problem before deciding what measures should be  incorporated to enhance efficiency.    Finance Deputy Minister Trairong Suwannakhiri said he fully  supported Pol Gen Chawalit's proposal as the measure would  enable officials to fight the narcotics trade more effectively.    "We must help eradicate dirty money from the drug business,"  said the outspoken politician.    He said the proposed legislation, if implemented carefully,  would not violate individuals' rights.    The checking of financial records could be limited to people  on official blacklists only or to those suspected of involvement  in the narcotics trade about whom the ONCB lacks evidence to  press charges.    The Finance Ministry is ready to support the ONCB's  proposal,  he said.    Pol Gen Chawalit, when asked to comment on Mr Thanong's case  yesterday, refused to offer any statement.    He said on Mr Thanong's claim that he had not been contacted  by the US Drug Enforcement Agency concerning the accusation that  the MP could say anything he wanted.    "I personally have no comment on that," he said.    There have been reports more politicians have been  blacklisted for narcotics involvement, but Pol Gen Chawalit said  only:    "I cannot make any comment even if I know anything about it.  We just don't have enough evidence."    Mr Thanong is due to appear before the House Parliamentary  Affairs Committee to answer the US allegations.    Committee member Pricha Suwannathat said the panel would ask  the US Embassy in Bangkok to supply all documents related to the  allegation.    House Speaker Marut Bunnak yesterday dismissed as groundless  an unpublished paper alleging that there were eight other MPs  from the Northeast involved in drug trafficking.    "I can not give this thesis any credence," said Mr Marut.    The media has publicized a so-called "secret" Chulalongkon  University paper by Chumphon Phongsuwan which states there are  eight other MPs involved in the drug trade. The paper, entitled  "Marijuana Politics: a Power Structure Case Study of Local  Politics" earned the special agent with the Office of Narcotics  Control Board the best thesis award of 1987.    "There are both good and bad people in every organization  including the House. But no rumor should sling groundless mud  to dirty the House," said Mr Marut.    He said the paper did not specify when the MPs allegedly  involved in the drug trade sat in Parliament and the lack of  detail led him to disbelieve the allegation.    He also praised the Chat Thai Party for setting up a  five-man  committee to investigate the allegations against Mr Thanong.    "I believe the Chat Thai probe committee will be thorough in  their investigation. The members are all competent statesmen  and lawyers."    Chat Phatthana Party secretary-general Prachuap Chaiyasan  said about the paper:    "We have to be openminded. The thesis did not mention any  name in particular. The official has to investigate and show  proof so that our country can clear this drug trafficking image."    Mr Prachuap said he did not believe the Chat Thai Party  would  protect Mr Thanong. Any member which brings notoriety to the  party should act responsibly.    He said the House has the burden of proving the allegation  and must make the information public.    "Every MP should be aware of the importance of his own  reputation and history, and that is why Mr Thanong's case should  be investigated," he said.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Doubt cast on methane estimates The UK emitted around 5m tonnes of methane in 1990 as a result of human activity, but estimates remain highly uncertain, a government report said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. Methane is the second most important gas - after carbon dioxide - which is emitted by human activity and which could contribute to global warming. It is generated by rotting or burning organic matter including fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal. The UK programme for limiting emissions of gases which could cause climate change, published in January, set out plans to cut methane emissions resulting from people's activities by 5 per cent on 1990 levels by the year 2000.

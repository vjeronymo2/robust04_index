			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Recovery signalled by new companies: Incorporations at highest level for four years The number of companies created last year was the highest in four years, indicating economic recovery, official figures showed yesterday. Incorporations rose to 115,000 in the 12 months to April from 109,000 in the previous year. It was last at this level in 1990-91. The number of companies removed from the register in the past 12 months fell to 129,000 from 153,000 in the previous year. The total number of companies registered in England, Wales and Scotland was 959,000. All limited-liability companies are required to make annual filings with Companies House, so the details provide an indication of the health of the business sector. The statistics appear in the latest annual report from Companies House, the depository of corporate information, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry. The annual report shows that the agency failed to meet its target of making all documents filed by companies available to the public within five working days of their receipt. The average processing time was 5.9 days, with 56.7 per cent of documents processed within the five-day target. The agency stressed, however, that it had met all its other targets for the year. These included ensuring that 86 per cent of companies filed their accounts and returns in the timescale permitted. The actual performance was 88.1 per cent. The increased compliance came in spite of a sharp increase in the total of fines levied on companies for late filing - Pounds 15.5m in the year to March 31, compared with Pounds 8m to March 31 1993 from July 1 1992, when the fining regime was first introduced. The proportion of searches for all customers completed within two hours was 99.7 per cent. It also met its target of reducing real unit costs by an average of 2 per cent a year. The agency has set itself a new target for this year of responding to all telephone calls within 20 seconds and ensuring a minimum of 90 per cent of microfiches provided to customers are free of errors. Companies House reported almost static income of Pounds 32m in the year to the end of March after a Pounds 17m contribution to the DTI, which was earmarked for running company regulation and developing company law.

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Books: Caught up in family sagas - Fiction SPIRIT WEDDINGS by Gillian Tindall Hutchinson Pounds 13.99, 215 pages PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST'S WIFE by Barbara Anderson Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 13.99, 309 pages HOME RULE by Clare Boylan Hamish Hamilton Pounds 14.99, 220 pages GILLIAN TINDALL, a reliably intelligent writer, offers an unusual novel that combines the effortful suspense of a good detective story with a shrewdly observed family saga and some outstanding travel writing. The Great City and the Great Land are imaginary places a long-haul flight east of Bombay. Thither goes Stephen, a widowed, middle-aged country doctor, persuaded to return by his son, Christopher, a pretentious travel writer. Nowadays the Great City is, in Christopher's words, 'an archetype of late 20th century urbanisation, the equal of New York, Tokyo and Hong Kong, yet itself, and only itself . . .' Stephen knew the place before the war, when it was an undeveloped colonial outpost smelling of 'salt swamp water and old cooking oil'. The reason for his return is Christopher's excitement about the existence of a peasant doppelganger, Bhat Way, who may be his first cousin, the son of his dead aunt Tessa. This is only the beginning of a drama which also involves Stephen's elder sister, Pauline, a hectoring vicar's wife, who reacts in a violent and apparently uncharacteristic way when her husband runs off with another woman. In the telling it becomes clear that narrator Stephen is not the sympathetic and reliable chap that he first appears. As the true story of Bhat Way's origin emerges we see the damage that even well-meant interference can inflict on innocent lives. In the end it is only the peasant, Bhat Way, uniting the ill-fated lovers that he considers were his parents in a 'spirit wedding' who finds any consolation. It is all ineffably sad, though I would argue with Tindall's insinuation that the custom of sending colonial children 'home' to boarding school led to entire generations of emotional cripples. Barbara Anderson is a New Zealander, born in 1926, and Portrait of the Artist's Wife follows the activities of a group of friends from pre-war childhood to a distinguished middle age. Sarah Tandy, the wife of the title, is one of New Zealand's leading painters, while her husband, Jack Macalister, is a prize-winning novelist. In the opening pages she is accepting an award for her husband's posthumous novel at a ceremony which encapsulates all that is awful about the provincial arts scene anywhere - the platitudinous Minister's speech, the bitchy gossip of the guests, and the scant supply of warm white wine. We then return to their childhood on Hawkes Bay where Jacks's father had a sheep station and Sarah's was a doctor, and nobody even imagined that 'the arts' would ever be a part of their everyday lives. Anderson has a sharp eye and ready wit, but also, alas, a tendency to become over-fond of her characters and to sentimentalise them accordingly. What promised to be a challenging look at 20th century New Zealand turns into a touching love story about a marriage which survived against the odds. The early days in Hawke's Bay and the lives of Jack and Sarah's parents' generation are of much more interest than the progress of the protagonists and their contemporaries, who say things like :'Any conversation that is not about literature bores me.' Home Rule is described as a 'prequel' to Clare Boylan's first novel, Holy Pictures. The latter was inspired by her mother's upbringing; the 'prequel' takes off from the life of Boylan's grandmother, Daisy Devlin, who grew up in working class Dublin at the turn of the century. Daisy's mother was an English Protestant who was warned that if she married an Irish man he would give her 10 children and leave her destitute, and this is exactly what happens. Until her husband's death, this unfortunate woman took refuge from the hard realities of her life in a front parlour decked out with trinkets salvaged from her Kensington home. As the parlour disappears into the pawnbroker's Mrs Devlin's frail sanity starts to disintegrate too. At her best, Clare Boylan combines a wicked sense of humour with a talent for deadly accurate imagery. Here her strengths are overwhelmed by the relentless demands of the massive family saga with its sentimental set pieces and melodramatic climaxes. The hard facts of history (25,000 men locked out in Jim Larkin's 1930 strike, 49,000 Irishmen dead in the First World War, 1,198 drowned in the sinking of the Lusitania) pale against the string of violent deaths, seductions, betrayals and reversals of fortune endured by the Devlin family. The result is an uneven sort of book, where scenes that belong in a more down market novel are suddenly lit up by a flash (a cat's 'painted trap of fangs'. 'lawns small and neat as crustless sandwiches') that reminds us how very good the real Clare Boylan can be.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo took people by  surprise by making a categorical remark conditioning the  approval of the new patents law to a greater opening of the U.S.  market or to Argentina joining NAFTA.    Only four days before crucial elections for the government,  Cavallo harshly reacted to the pressure being exerted by  Washington for the approval of this controversial draft bill.    Cavallo said: "Since it is so important to them, let us use  the patents law as a negotiating tool to obtain better terms for  our exports."    Among other things, the current patents law allows  pharmaceutical laboratories to freely use formulas that do not  belong to them, which has generated serious criticism and  pressure by the U.S. Government.    For more than a year now the official intellectual property  draft bill has been blocked in Congress by government and  opposition legislators who are against it.    This is not the first time Cavallo has voiced doubts about  the simple approval of the draft bill. What is more, during a  recent economic team meeting, Cavallo and Economic Programming  Secretary Juan Jose Llach agreed on the disproportionate U.S.  interest in the draft bill's approval and what they are willing  to grant in exchange.    Cavallo now has asserted: "We will approve the patents law  when we, in exchange, can join NAFTA or obtain greater  facilities for the entry of our exports."</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A man who astonished doctors by reviving 40 minutes after he was declared dead  from a jolt of electricity was in critical condition, hospital officials in  Joplin, Mo., said. Jerry Middleswart was breathing with the aid of a respirator  at St. John's Regional Medical Center. He had been declared dead a day earlier  after the antenna he and six other men were attempting to put up at his Oswego,  Kan., veterinary clinic came in contact with a 7,600-volt power line. Tests  indicated Middleswart had suffered brain damage. "He was a friend of mine,"  said Dr. Phillip Bortmes, who worked for 45 minutes to revive Middleswart. "I  made damn sure I tried everything before I stopped working on him."  </P></p>

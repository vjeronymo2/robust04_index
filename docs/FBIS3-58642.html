			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["ub."-signed report: "Extremely Inhumane Deportation </F> Practice"]    [Text] Bonn -- The Free Democratic Party [FDP] has sounded  the alarm regarding the treatment of war and civil war refugees.  Interior Affairs spokesman Burkhard Hirsch said in Bonn it was  an "unworthy situation" that, because of financial differences  between the Federal Government and the land governments, these  people are not given the status promised to them by law and thus  the right of temporary residence. The respective provision in  the Foreigners' Law was not applied, because granting residence  permission required agreement between the Federal Government and  the land governments. The "miserable" fate of many refugees  hardly appeared to play a role. This led to civil war refugees  such as the Kosovo Albanians being deported back to be doomed.    The parliamentary initiative Hirsch announced to solve the  problem is backed by Federal Commissioner for Foreigners  Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen (FDP). Deputy Ulrich Irmer and  Federal Executive Board member Guido Westerwelle also joined the  initiative. Irmer said the treatment of civil war refugees in  Germany also caused foreign-political harm, because words did  not match deeds, and this burdened Germany's credibility.    Hirsch said that according to the German law, civil war  refugees are not entitled to asylum. However, since these  people were not given the special status promised, they often  applied for an asylum procedure without any chance of success.  Therefore, they could also be deported. In addition, it also  meant that people who worked and had a place to stay burdened  the public welfare system against their will. According to the  FDP politician, the conflict between the Federal Government and  the land governments over the distribution of costs and quotas  prevents the granting of special status under Section 32a of the  Foreigners' Law. Hirsch demanded that Federal Chancellor Helmut  Kohl now meet with the minister presidents.    For example, the untenable situation led to the deportation  of young Kosovo Albanians who had escaped military service in  the Serbian Army, said Hirsch, Irmer, and Westerwelle. It was  known that in the Serbian Army, they were mistreated, often  tortured, and picked for extremely dangerous missions. The  German deportation practice was not only profoundly inhuman, but  also contradicted the spirit of the arms embargo against Serbia,  because Germany even supplied the Serbian aggressors with  soldiers.    Hirsch said the federal interior minister had failed to  renew  a halt to extradition, with the argument that there was no  agreement among the federal laender. This was intolerable,  since no information had been given as to which countries  pursued the extradition of refugees. The interpretation of the  legal provisions contradicted their spirit, said Hirsch.</p>

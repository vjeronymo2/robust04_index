			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Finns try to stem outflow of capital FINLAND yesterday moved to stop a sudden outflow of capital from the country by raising interest rates on commercial bank lending from 14.6 per cent to 16 per cent. Last week Finland's reserves fell by nearly FM1bn (Dollars 247m) to FM30.4bn. But over the past few days the outward flow of capital has turned into a flood. The central bank blamed the the lack of international confidence in the economic policy of the Finnish centre-conservative coalition government, which has suffered from serious differences of opinion between ministers. After an emergency meeting yesterday the cabinet insisted the government would stick to its policy of spending cuts and did not intend to devalue the currency further. Ministers said there was no alternative to the present economic course or the continuation of the government in office. This is the third time since last November's devaluation of the markka that the central bank has had to raise interest rates to stabilise the markets. There was further bad economic news yesterday: unemployment rose to 12.7 per cent in June. It was also revealed that the budget deficit for the year is expected to rise by FM60bn, to FM152bn, about 20 per cent of GDP. Capital Markets, Page 21</p>

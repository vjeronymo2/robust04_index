			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava April 21 (CTK) -- Support for the  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) has risen by eight  percent since March, meaning that if elections were held today  they would win, with 32 percent of the vote, according to a poll  taken in the first ten days of April by the Slovak Statistical  Office.    Until the middle of March, when the government of HZDS  Chairman Vladimir Meciar was dismissed, the HZDS was the  governing party in Slovakia, in coalition with the Slovak  National Party (SNS). The coalition has now gone into  opposition.    Second would come the Democratic Left Party (SDL) with 13  percent (14 percent in March) and third the Christian Democratic  Movement (KDH) with eight percent, as in March.    The Egyutteles-Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH)  would gain seven percent (nine percent in March) as would  Premier Jozef Moravcik's Alternative of Political Realism (APR).    Parties need five percent of the vote to enter parliament.  The SNS has gone down from five to four percent, the Democratic  Party (DS) from four to three percent, and the Green Party of  Slovakia (SZS) from three to two percent as have the Alliance of  Democrats (due to merge with the APR this weekend.)    Two new parties, Ludovit Cernak's National Democratic  Party-New Alternative (NDS-NOA) and the Association of Workers  of Slovakia (SDS) would also win two votes [as received] each.    Other parties would only win three percent of the vote  together, a fairly large fall from last month when they would  have received 15 percent. The number who do not know what they  would vote stands at 12 percent, one down from March. 76  percent say they would definitely or probably take part in  elections if they were to be held this month, four percent more  than in March.    The results mean that the HZDS-SNS coalition would receive  36  percent, the parties of the left-wing, SDL-SDSS-SZS, 18 percent  and the right-of-centre parties 22 percent. The Hungarian  minority parties would receive seven percent of the vote.    Elections will be held on September 30-October 1.</p>

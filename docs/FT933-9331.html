			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Company News: Banesto share issues raise Pta95bn BANESTO, Spain's fourth-largest commercial bank in terms of assets, has completed the first part of its plan to boost its capital and reserves, raising Pta94.9bn (Dollars 676m) via two share issues. This 37 per cent equity increase so far boosts its Bank of International Settlements (BIS) equity ratio to 11.3 per cent of assets. With an issue of convertible bonds still planned to round off the capital increases in the autumn, Banesto has already raised more money than any Spanish financial or commercial institution. The success of the issues could help counter long-standing criticism of the bank's ability to finance further growth. Mr Mario Conde, Banesto's president, said yesterday that the Pta94.9bn was the third-largest capital increase by any bank in the world and that it would be the biggest when at least Dollars 400m in dollar-denominated convertible bonds was issued in late September. He said that the two share issues, the first part of the overall capital increase, had proved popular with Banesto shareholders and that the first tranche of the money raised so far - Pta52.65bn - was oversubscribed by 20 per cent. A second tranche of Pta42.25bn was then used to attract a series of private European and US investors. The most prominent of these was the Corsair banking fund launched by JP Morgan earlier this year, which invested Dollars 150m and, after the share issues, holds a stake of around 6.4 per cent in Banesto. At least two members of the Corsair funds, the GE pension fund and Northwestern Mutual, a big Milwaukee-based insurer, also made individual investments. Mr Conde invested Dollars 50m, and said the money had come from his personal funds. His own stake in the bank is close to 3 per cent. Other Banesto board members invested Dollars 20m. With net profits of more than Pta20bn from the sale earlier this year of its Banco Madrid affiliate to Deutsche Bank, the capital increase removes any doubts about Banesto's ability to finance its growth. Mr Conde made clear he will continue disposing of assets in Banesto's industrial holdings but that in the current business climate prices were not good. He said, though, that the implementation of the capital increase so far had also made it very clear that Banesto's banking business was rapidly improving. Acting in the first tranche of the increase, its Spanish branch network raised Pta18.2bn from existing shareholders and Pta19.7bn from more than 37,000 customers who had become shareholders through the exercise.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Estonia citizenship laws do not discriminate against minorities Sir, Your leader ('Russia's backyard', March 2) seems to have fallen victim to the still powerful Russian propaganda machine. The latter's regular allegations about the so-called 'discrimination against Russian minorities in Latvia and Estonia' (a case being Mr Malakhov's letter to you, 'Allegation contradicts reality', March 19) have been misleading many political analysts in the world. What some Russian hard-line politicians call discrimination in these republics is nothing but denial of voting franchise to non-citizens and denial of automatic citizenship to former occupants and colonists, and to other illegal immigrants. If those people apply for citizenship in Estonia and pledge to be loyal to the country - also manifesting their loyalty by learning the country's language - they will be admitted to citizenship after a short naturalisation period of two years before, and one year after, submitting the application. Our citizenship law has been described as one of the mildest of its kind. All human rights are granted to all residents of Estonia and respected to the full. This has been confirmed by several international inspecting missions, including ones from the Council of Europe and the CSCE. I happened to be in England on your election day last April 9, and I did not in the least feel discriminated against when I was not offered the vote. Had I had such an interest, would your country have acknowledged it? Perhaps, for one person, you would. But could you imagine this situation: the UK was occupied by another power in the second world war and remained occupied for over 50 years, during which period 36m people were sent by that power to colonise and rule Britain (this figure roughly corresponds to the proportion of illegal aliens in Estonia); last April you were able to hold your first free election since the war, although the troops of the occupying power were still stationed in your country. Would you still have been eager to acknowledge the interest of those millions of aliens, backed by the occupying power, to go to the polls with you? What you describe as a flashpoint is actually wishful thinking on the part of Russia's hardliners whose propaganda aims at preparing the world in case an opportunity opens to re-annex the Baltic states. Otherwise, there is no national strife in Estonia. Of course, there are Russian-speaking people here who rage against the loss of their former privileges as a ruling nation. They, however, would not yet even dream of becoming citizens of Estonia, as long as they are encouraged to dream of the restoration of the Soviet Union. The acknowledgement of discrimination against them is one kind of such encouragement. Kullo Vende, Sutiste tee 16-36, Tallinn, Estonia EE0034</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Ford puts UK plants on short-time working FORD, the leading vehicle maker in the UK, is cutting production at its three British assembly plants in response to disappointing sales in the UK and weakening demand from export markets. It warned yesterday that there was no sign of any improvement in UK new car demand and said that it saw 'no indication of any real recovery before mid-1993'. The effect of depressed UK new car sales is being exacerbated by an accelerating rate of decline elsewhere in Europe led by a sharp drop in demand in Germany, the single biggest new car market in Europe. According to industry estimates disclosed today, German new car sales fell by about 37 per cent in July from the record of a year ago, in the wake of reunification. As a result, overall west European new car sales dropped last month by 15.3 per cent. Sales have been lower than a year ago in four of the past five months. Ford said its Dagenham, Essex, car assembly plant would work two three-day and two four-day weeks next month. Output of its Fiesta small car would be reduced by some 5,000 units. Six production days will also be cut at Ford's Transit van plant at Southampton with one three-day week and four four-day weeks up to the end of next month. Output will be reduced by about 1,245 units. Ford's Halewood, Merseyside, plant which produces the Escort/Orion range, has already been reduced to single-shift working for the last two weeks of August, cutting output by around 2,750 cars and small vans. Rover, the second-placed UK vehicle maker, announced earlier this week that it was introducing a three-day week for five weeks on its Metro and Mini assembly line at its Longbridge, Birmingham, assembly plant. The production cuts come as UK motor industry hopes of a recovery in demand in August, the main car sales month of the year, are fading fast. New car registrations so far this month are almost unchanged from last year's depressed level of 368,000 in the whole of August, and carmakers are having to cut production to reduce bloated stock levels. Ford has again been forced to revise downwards its forecast for UK new car sales for the whole of 1992. It fears that sales may be even lower than last year's very depressed level of 1.59m, the lowest total since 1982. Overall UK new car sales have fallen by more than a third from the peak year of 1989, and sales in the first seven months of the year were still 4.3 per cent lower than a year ago. The other volume car makers in the UK - Vauxhall, Nissan and Peugeot - said they had no plans to reduce output. Ford, the UK new car market leader, has continued to lose share this year in Britain and the west European new car market, with only the Fiat group of Italy suffering a bigger fall among the big six volume carmakers. Elsewhere Ford will have cut 38 production days (by end August) on its Sierra line at Genk, Belgium and 20 days on the Genk Transit van line. Some 51 production days have been cut at the small Azambuja, Portugal van and pick-up plant. LWest European car sales, Page 2 Table, Page 2</p>

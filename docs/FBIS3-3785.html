			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, March 19 (CNA) -- The Ministry of Finance  decided Saturday [19 March] to levy anti-dumping taxes on some  petrochemical imports from Japan and South Korea as part of its  effort to protect local manufacturers from unfair trade  competition following Taiwan's trade liberalization.    After investigating a complaint filed by Taiwan  Polypropylene  Corp., the ministry's Tariff Commission found that 10 Japanese  and eight South Korean polypropylene makers had sold their  products to Taiwan at prices lower than fair market value.    The commission decided to impose anti-dumping taxes ranging  between 5.16 percent and 68.71 percent on polypropylene imports  from those companies. The tax rates vary with import quantities  and prices.    The commission will also levy anti-dumping taxes on  high-density and low-density polyethylene imports from five  South Korean companies, including Daewoo, Samsung and Hyundai.  The tax rates will range between 6.05 percent and 9.45 percent,  retroactive to Feb. 25.    A Finance Ministry official said the government has levied  6.77 to 29.16 percent temporary anti-dumping taxes on the five  Korean firms since Feb. 25. As investigations showed the tax  rates should not have been so high, the official said, the  government will refund the excess tax revenues.    The Tariff Commission is also investigating a dumping charge  filed by Li Chang Yung Chemical Industry Corp. against some  Japanese Penta Manufacturers and will decide whether to impose  anti-dumping taxes on those makers next month, the official said.    Taiwan has become more aggressive in handling dumping  charges  in response to mounting complaints by local manufacturers that  many foreign companies have cashed in on Taiwan's trade  liberalization policy by dumping their goods here. Finance  Ministry sources said many dumping charges involve South Korean  petrochemical and steel makers.</p>

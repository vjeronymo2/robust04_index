			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / Letter: Shades of economic development (2) Sir, In his exposition of a policy for economic development Mr Katz's inclusion of Hong Kong among countries that exert a degree ofcontrol over their economies is misleading. In fact, Hong Kong is an example of a different policy for economic development. Specifically, the Hong Kong government provides neither protection from import competition, nor export incentives, tax or other financial help; nor are key prices adjusted through tax rebates, tariffs, duties and subsidies. It is not for us to take sides as to which is the better policy for whatever circumstances others find themselves in, but our policy has served us remarkably well. P. Williamson, special representative, Hong Kong and Economic Trade Office, Avenue Louise 228, Brussels</p>

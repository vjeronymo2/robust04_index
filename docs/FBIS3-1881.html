Aldrich Ames, 52, who was in charge of Russian affairs in  the  antiespionage organization of the CIA, and his wife, 41, have  been prosecuted for committing espionage activities.    On 21 February, the FBI arrested Ames on his way to the  office and his wife at home. Ames was employed by the CIA for  31 years. He engaged in espionage activities for the former  Soviet Union and Russia for a long time.    This high-ranking U.S. intelligence official was revealed to  be a double spy who sold out U.S. secrets to the former Soviet  Union, and after it was dissolved, to Russia from 1985.    Maria, Ames' wife who was studying at a college until she  was  arrested, was born in Colombia and worked as an agent for the  CIA until she moved to the United States.    The U.S. Department of Justice noted that this is one of the  largest spy incidents in history, and the volume and sensitivity  of intelligence gathered by this spy couple are very rare.    U.S. social circles were surprised by the announcement of  the  Ames spy incident. President Clinton stated that this is a very  serious incident and that the United States will immediately  lodge a protest with the Russian Government.    According to Justice Department officials, the FBI began  investigation of Ames based on material from an intelligence  official of the State Security Bureau of the former Soviet Union  who defected to the United States two years ago.    The FBI tapped a telephone, collected typewriter ribbons  used  by the Ames, examined trash and copying materials they threw  away and documents saved in their computers. The FBI also  conducted investigation of their income and expenditures. As a  result, the FBI finally obtained sufficient evidence and  indicted the Ames couple on suspicion of espionage activities.  The FBI then arrested them and is now investigating the case.    According to the document of indictment, which consisted of  39 pages filed, the FBI has seized a large number of material  proving that Ames engaged in spy activities.    The FBI announced that over the past 10 years, the Ames  couple offered top secret material to the former Soviet Union  and Russia pertaining to activities of intelligence officials  and agents of the former Soviet Union and Russia who cooperated  with the United States and the CIA. They received at least $1.5  million in return.    The revelation of the spy incident involving the Ames couple  gravely embarrassed the Clinton government. The press report  noted that Clinton has already offered $4.1 billion in  assistance to Moscow in order to help Yeltsin establish  democratic systems and push ahead with economic reform.  Nevertheless, Russian spies are still maneuvering to steal  secret intelligence from the United States and even skillfully  infiltrated the CIA. The press urged Washington to reexamine  relations with Moscow.</p>

			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Arts: Tales from Tasso - The Birmingham Poussin exhibition If the Prime Minister and his colleagues sought balm for their troubled souls this week in Birmingham, they did not have far to go. Just as the EEC cavalcade arrived at Birmingham, an exhibition opened at the city's art gallery which includes no less than 15 works by the 17th-century master, Poussin. Dangerous Liaison: Poussin's 'Tancred and Erminia' in Context brings together some of the best-known and most beautiful masterpieces of Poussin's early career. The exhibition's creator is Richard Verdi, director of the Barber Institute which houses Birmingham University's magnificent art collection, now re-emerging after many years of obscurity. Verdi was the moving force behind the remarkable Poussin and Cezanne exhibition some years ago in Edinburgh. This further homage to Poussin is a great achievement - not least because paintings from France, Russia, and Canada have been brought to Birmingham without a penny being found from sponsors. The starting-point is simple, a reminder of the prominent place that now-forgotten tales of Tasso occupied among the repertoire of sacred and secular themes in 17th-century history painting. The first room is something of a hotchpotch of history painters selected from the two Birmingham collections. It ranges from a neurotically vibrant 'Execution of John the Baptist' by Schiavone to 'St Andrew Praying Before His Execution' by Carlo Dolci and Jan Steen's convivial scene of Esther denouncing Hamon at King Ahasuerus's dinner-table. The second room is what really matters. Here we find the two astoundingly beautiful 'Tancred and Erminias', one from the Barber and the other from the Hermitage in St Petersburg. They hang next to the first theme Poussin took from Tasso, the famous Dulwich 'Rinaldo and Armida'. What a heavenly trio of paintings they make] Here, at a glance, are the paintings which will dispel the common view that Poussin is a chillingly cerebral artist whose appeal is strictly to intellectuals. Underlining this point, to their left hangs an earlier masterpiece of the late 1620s, the Caen 'Venus and Adonis'. In this painting of melancholy suffused with warm sensuality, a naked goddess kneels in tender solicitude by the beautiful body of her dead lover. Beside this, showing just what a mastery of dramatic effect Poussin had achieved, is the 'Deposition of Christ from the Cross' from the Hermitage. It counts as one of the most heart-rending realisations ever painted of this subject, and for it alone, the trip to Birmingham is a must. Here again, albeit pitched in an infinitely more intense and sombre key, is a woman lamenting over the body of a man as the Virgin wrings her hands over Christ as the Evangelist struggles to support his body. A crouching putto leans its cheek against Christ's shin. Grief, charity, love; these three emotions are evoked once again in the Tancred and Erminia scenes. We may see in them at first sight a mildly erotic but hardly profound scene, just the sort of thing one would expect from Italian opera. But Poussin, for all his roaring, wenching first decade in Rome, was anything but frivolous when it came to themes of his paintings. The Tancred and Erminia story appeared in two brief, tender interludes in Gerusalemme Liberata, Torquato Tasso's epic about the First Crusade. The poem appeared in 1581 and became a best-seller. Poets, painters and musicians took inspiration from it, readers borrowed the names of its heroes and heroines for their children. Opposite Poussin's two versions hang further Tancreds and Erminias as visualised by Poussin's contemporaries in Rome; Guercino, Pietro da Cortina, and by his admirer, Pier Francesco Mola, the last a ravishingly pretty painting from the Louvre. Mola, imitating Poussin, chose the most dramatic moment of the story. The noble warrior Tancred is grievously wounded in single combat with the giant Argantes. Enter his squire and the Saracen princess Erminia, his fair captive who loves him but has not a chance because he is pining after her best friend, Clorinda. Erminia renders first aid to her lover but runs out of bandages once she has used her veil. 'But love could other bands, though strange, provide, And pity wept for joy to see that deed . . .' Erminia sacrifices her crowning joy, her 'amber locks'; As read, this comes across a strongly sexual motif, given the ancient symbolism of hair. But Tasso's poem was an explicitly Christian allegory on the triumph of the Church. Erminia's gesture echoes the Magdalene who dried Christ's feet with her hair - Mola brings this out in his version with the little box on the rock, a reminder of the Magdalene's jar of ointment. Pagan Erminia, like the prostitute Magdalene, is a sinner and she, too, will surely be redeemed. The exhibition shows how in formal terms, Poussin's grouping of the figures in his Tancred and Erminias echoes a Lamentation over the dead Christ. Erminia is the Magdalene, and she is also the Virgin in her traditional blue robe. In the Birmingham picture Erminia in her bare shouldered dress is something of a maenad. She saws frenziedly at her hair with Tancred's sword, whereas in the earlier, more tender and beautiful Hermitage version (a point on which Verdi insists) we have no doubt the amber locks will yield to the blade as easily as silk threads. Tasso never actually says what happens to the pair, once Tancred is safely back in camp with his rescuer. Poussin uses his putti in the Birmingham picture to hint at the eventual happy outcome. They float aloft, one garlanded with presumably nuptial flowers, both armed with the burning arrows of love. Erminia will convert to Christianity and they will be happy together. Charity and self-sacrifice bring their own reward. That, surely, is the deeper reading Poussin intended for his tales from Tasso.</p>

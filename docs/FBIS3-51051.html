Cardoso has reported that the implementation of the URV not  only depends on the approval of the fiscal adjustment by  Congress, but also on the passing of the budget.    "It was the market that, prompted by speculative motives,  was  speculating that the URV would come into force in January," said  the finance minister.</p>

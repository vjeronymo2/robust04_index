			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DWP CHIEF'S $2,800 CHARTER FLIGHT ATTACKED  </P> <P> City Controller Rick Tuttle said Wednesday that he is preparing to blast  Department of Water and Power General Manager Norm Nichols for spending $2,800  in city funds on a charter flight to Sacramento when less expensive commercial  flights were available.  </P> <P> Tuttle, who has previously squared off with the DWP chief over expense account  charges, has scheduled a press conference for this morning at which he said he  will "criticize" Nichols' expenditure for the trip he made last month.  </P> <P> In the past, Tuttle has refused to pay for high-priced lunches and other  expenditures by Nichols and other DWP officials, leaving them to pick up the  tabs themselves.  </P> <P> Nichols could not be reached for comment. But in a statement, the DWP said, "On  April 24, 1990, DWP General Manager Norm Nichols utilized charter air services  to Sacramento in order to meet with the chairman of the California Energy  Commission. . . . Due to the press of business in both Sacramento and Los  Angeles on that day, it was necessary for (Nichols) to utilize charter air  services to meet the department's business commitments."  </P> <P> Officials in Tuttle's office, however, said routine flight arrangements could  have been made at a much cheaper price. U.S. Air, for instance, charges from  $156 to $456 round trip between Los Angeles and Sacramento.  </P> <P> It was unclear whether Nichols was joined by any other DWP officials on the  flight. And it was not clear what type of aircraft was chartered.  </P> <P> The city controller, one of only three officials elected citywide, has  historically overseen an office concerned more with ledgers and balance sheets  than with public sparring with other city officials.  </P> <P> But in recent years, former City Controller Ira Reiner turned the obscure  office into a high-visibility position by rejecting expense accounts and other  excessive charges submitted for payment by the Harbor Department. Reiner and  his successor, James K. Hahn, both used their position as city controller as a  steppingstone to higher office. Reiner is now district attorney running for  state attorney general. Hahn is city attorney.  </P></p>

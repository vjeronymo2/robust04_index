			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Tokyo to ease rules on lawyers JAPAN has offered its main trading partners partial satisfaction on long-standing demands to open the heavily regulated Japanese legal profession to foreign practitioners. The US and the European Community have pressed Japan to ease curbs on foreign lawyers' freedom to work in one of the world's largest and most lucrative legal markets. The issue is on the agenda of Mr John Major, UK prime minister, now on an official visit to Japan. Government officials in Tokyo have announced that foreign lawyers will be allowed to run legal firms with Japanese partners, under a plan which is to be be presented to parliament next January. At present, foreign lawyers in Japan are only allowed to work out of court, based on their own countries' laws. They cannot practice in court work related to Japanese law. The US and EC claim this is an unfair infringement of free competition. A mere 76 foreign lawyers are registered with the Japanese bar.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Daniyel Ben-Simon: "A General More Than a </F> Leader"]    [Text] Slowly and consistently, Yitzhaq Rabin has been  losing supporters. Soon he will be marking his second  anniversary in office, and we will be facing the same man we  knew before: hesitant, suspicious, devoid of assertive  leadership, loathe to delegate responsibility to the point of  obsession, and a military man through and through. These  problematic qualities are amply reflected in the arrangement  emerging between Israel and the Palestinians. This is a  military agreement more than a political one, because it is  being formulated by generals and not by politicians.  Supposedly, the imminent withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will  be the climax of the breathtaking drama on the White House lawn  on 13 September. Six months have gone by and it turns out that  people are not happy, neither on our side nor on theirs. Some  people have been trying hard to spoil the fun.    Rabin's reelection as prime minister was one of the most  mind- boggling manifestations of political recycling in  contemporary times, and not just in Israel. His first year in  service only strengthened the impression that here we had a new  and fresh politician, very different from the prime minister we  knew almost 20 years ago. Everything was going his way. He  personally ran the country without neglecting any details. He  demanded to know everything his cabinet ministers were doing --  and justifiably so, considering that he chose them based on  their qualifications. He closely followed the progress in  building roads and overpasses, the state of poverty, the  allocation of resources, the absorption of aliyah, and what not.  The people liked his style. After years during which Yitzhaq  Shamir evinced indifference, if not disregard, toward anything  remotely reeking of socioeconomic issues, Yitzhaq Rabin was  perceived as a refreshing change. This was reflected in public  opinion polls, which indicated vast support for his performance.    His popularity soared sky high after the signing of the  agreement between Israel and the PLO in Washington. People  walked down the streets with a smile in their heart. Except for  the settlers who continued to mortify themselves and grieve in  their ghettos, everybody felt elated. The world at large, tired  of disappointments about peace initiatives gone sour, stared in  bewilderment at Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's daring and  determination. Even Menahem Begin, who signed the peace treaty  with Egypt, did not evince such lavish praise.    In the eyes of the world and of many Israelis who saw  themselves represented by this government, the signing of the  Declaration of Principles symbolized the first act en route to  the end of the occupation. What happened, however, is that  instead of striving for this goal with kid gloves, in good faith  and with awe, Rabin took peace by storm, as if it was a military  operation. He shoved politicians and diplomats aside and placed  the Army's top brass at the most sensitive junctions of the  peace negotiations. As is known, it is hard for soldiers to  change their spots overnight. Suddenly they found themselves  sitting opposite people who until the night before they had laid  in ambush for. They had a hard time making the change.    Rabin even had a harder time of it. He was the man who  over the last 10 years, except for a brief two-year interval,  formulated Israel's security policy in the territories. The  intifadah broke out during his term in office and set the  territories on fire. Instead of "taking his time to ponder  over" the dramatic flare-up, he sent thousands of soldiers to  the territories to quash it at gunpoint. Hundreds had to die,  thousands had to be wounded and arrested before Rabin realized  the limitations of force.    In his capacity as defense minister, Rabin drew the  distinction between the PLO inside and outside the territories  and devised peace initiatives aimed at driving them apart, as if  they were pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. Only when he became prime  minister did he realize that this was an imaginary distinction.  He turned to 'Arafat, as if imbibing in some bitter medicine,  and only after he came to the conclusion that the PLO was one  single entity. Even after he signed the agreement, he conveyed  the impression that he was not really thrilled about the whole  business. At times he even seemed to regret having signed the  deal.    Israelis who sided with him through thick and thin were  suddenly confronted with a prime minister who was of two minds,  who agonized and dragged his feet, was unenthusiastic, hesitant,  and unassertive. Instead of overseeing the negotiations from the  comfort of his position, Rabin chose to get involved with the  minute details, which ranged from the ridiculous to the  pathetic. At his instructions, his aides spent whole days on  questions such as the type of security personnel that would be  stationed at the border terminals in Gaza and Jericho and how  many meters would separate the Israeli guard from the  Palestinian one. Not to mention the glass partition at the  terminal, its thickness, location, and transparency. Not to  mention the type of electronic gadgetry that would replace  bodily frisking of people crossing through the terminals.    The insistence on details in faraway capitals around the  globe, coupled with the use of unprecedented firepower in the  territories, did their bit. The public began losing its  confidence in peace and in the negotiators. Day in and day out  the prime minister could be seen grumbling, furious,  threatening, and bickering about the Palestinian partner.  Menahem Begin gave back the entire Sinai Peninsula, four times  the size of Israel, without grumbling or bickering as frequently  as Rabin. That same Begin was not scared by the right wing's  threats or of sending his deputy to grovel before the Jewish  ayatollahs to tone down their halakic edict. That same Begin  evacuated settlements and was not deterred by allegations of a  Jewish population transfer.    It is at these critical times that an eminent leader is  needed. Begin was one such leader, inasmuch as the peace with  Egypt was concerned. He adopted big decisions, and the public  respected his determination and followed him. Rabin, on the  other hand, projects the restlessness of a man who is not at  peace with himself or with his actions. Frustration is the  antithesis of leadership. His bleak mood radiates to the people  who despair in the possibility of peace with the Palestinians.  That is why there are no happy people these days.</p>

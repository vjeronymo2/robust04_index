			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> HERSHISER, 4 OTHER DODGERS FILE FOR SALARY ARBITRATION  </P> <P> Orel Hershiser, whose picture-perfect pitching earned him the World Series MVP  award, was one of five Dodgers to file for salary arbitration today, the final  day players were allowed to file.  </P> <P> Hershiser, 30, signed a one-year contract for $1.1 million last winter, then  compiled a 23-8 record with a 2.26 earned run average. The Cy Young Award  winner set a record by finishing the season with 59 consecutive scoreless  innings.  </P> <P> After that, the right-hander was honored as the most valuable player in the  National League playoffs and World Series as the Dodgers beat the New York Mets  and Oakland Athletics.  </P> <P> Hershiser lost in salary arbitration in 1987, earning $800,000 instead of the  $1.1 million he sought. He won in 1986, earning $1 million rather than the  $600,000 the Dodgers offered.  </P> <P> It has been reported that Hershiser is seeking a contract to cover more than  three years. He is eligible to become a free agent after the 1989 season.  </P> <P> Other members of the Dodgers to file for arbitration were reserve infielder  Dave Anderson, backup catcher Rick Dempsey, starting pitcher Tim Leary and  left-handed reliever Ray Searage.  </P> <P> Three players eligible for arbitration -- infielder Mariano Duncan, first  baseman-outfielder Franklin Stubbs and left-handed reliever Ricky Horton --  signed contracts late last week.  </P> <P> Horton, acquired late last season from the Chicago White Sox, signed a one-year  contract for $580,000, a raise of $47,500.  </P></p>

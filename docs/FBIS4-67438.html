			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Mikhail Lashch report: "New `Greenpeace' Action. Finnish </F> Police Break Up Antinuclear Action"]    [Excerpts] The international ecological organization  "Greenpeace" held a protest action yesterday in the Finnish town  of Loviza (110 km from Helsinki) in connection with the  impending transporting to Russia of nuclear waste. The same day  the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" circulated a statement on the  illegal nature of transporting nuclear waste from Finland to  Russia. [passage omitted]    Talking to your KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, Dmitriy  Tolmatskiy of the Moscow branch of "Greenpeace" clarified some  of the questions on bringing nuclear fuel to Russia. "The  agreement on cooperation in the area of nuclear power  engineering of 14 May 1965 between Russia and Finland contains  not one word to the effect that the radioactive waste of  processed fuel is supposed to be buried in Russia. The thing is  that nuclear fuel becomes totally Finland's property the moment  it crosses the border, and Russia bears no responsibility  whatever for it. More, commitments on the return of fuel are  not stipulated in the agreement." Mr. Tolmatskiy also  underlined that literally every page in the agreement says that  nuclear materials may only be used for peaceful means whereas  the "Mayak" combine (the biggest nuclear waste processing  enterprise) is a military facility which, up to now, has been  producing weapons-grade plutonium from used nuclear fuel.</p>

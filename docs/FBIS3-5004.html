			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 2 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said Wednesday that Koreans should start forming a vision for a  unified Korea in the 21st century while striving to maintain  collective security in the Asia-Pacific region. In an address  at the commencement ceremony of the Korea Military Academy's  50th class, Kim said a unified Korea would not be a burden to  the peace and prosperity of the Asia and Pacific region.  Rather, it would be a promoter of such ideals, he said. Kim is  the first civilian president to give a commencement address at  the military academy in more than three decades.    "Responding to the demands of the times, our military has to  develop into an efficient, scientific, future-oriented and  internationalized Armed Force," Kim said.    "We have to build an Armed Force of quality rather than  quantity," the president said. The military must undertake  reform and change not because of demands from the outside, but  in its own best interests, he said.    "As the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of this  country," Kim said, "I will try to do my best not to betray the  love and trust of our officers and men."    "I'll take a deep interest in building up an elite force and  improving conditions for professional soldiers," Kim said.    The president noted that North Korea is now standing at an  important crossroads and the world community is gravely  concerned about its actions.    "North Korea will have to guarantee transparency of its  nuclear safeguards and make sincere efforts to solve the nuclear  problem peacefully," Kim said.    Unless South Korea maintains a strong security setup, it  cannot expect to attain true independence, Kim said. "We have to  maintain a defense system that can meet any change in security  and be alert at all times in this transitory period."</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Overseas boost for Bodycote BODYCOTE International, the metal technology, packaging and textiles group, reported an 18 per cent increase in pre-tax profits on the back of increased overseas earnings for the year to December 31. Profits rose from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 13.6m on sales of Pounds 80.3m (Pounds 66.5m). Mr Joe Dwek, chairman and joint managing director, said: 'Given the difficult trading conditions in the UK the growing level of overseas profits has been particularly valuable.' The shares rose 20p to 584p. Overseas profits increased more than 70 per cent to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 3m) while UK profits sliped to Pounds 8.4m (Pounds 8.5m). Overall operating profit rose to Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.5m). The overseas increase partly reflected last year's acquisition of Industrial Materials Technology, which has two plants in the US, and IMT Europe, based in Belgium, from National Forge Company of Delaware. The metal technology division, which accounts for 65 per cent of group profits, increased its contribution from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 9.2m. It is expected to continue to be the main source of future growth with further acquisitions. Over the last five years Pounds 42m has been invested in capital equipment, of which Pounds 9.5m was incurred last year. Earnings rose to 31.7p (27.8p). A final dividend of 6.25p makes a 10p (9.25p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed.</p>

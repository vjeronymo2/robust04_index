			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / Dozens killed in Kabul as 'three-way civil war' rages Fighters loyal to the president of Afghanistan, besieged by a broad new anti-government alliance, yesterday attacked rivals in several parts of the country, including the capital, Kabul, Steve LeVine writes from Tashkent. President Berhanuddin Rabbani appeared increasingly isolated and powerless to end the fighting that has consumed the country for almost 15 years. Last night Iran called for a truce so that the injured could be evacuated from Kabul. Dozens were reported killed and more than 800 wounded in the city from rocketing and machine-gun fire in the past three days. About 70 were said to be injured in the northern capital of Mazar-i-Sharif, where the UN responded yesterday by evacuating half its international staff of about 15 people. One western diplomat called the new round of fighting a 'three-way civil war', pitting Mr Rabbani against forces loyal to the prime minister, Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, and the powerful northern Uzbek warlord, Mr Rashid Dostum. Combatants line up along ethnic lines, with Mr Rabbani's tribal Tajiks opposed by nearly every other Afghan nationality. The three-way battle stems from the chaos that enveloped Afghanistan following the fall in April 1992 of Moscow-backed President Najibullah. Fighters loyal to Mr Rabbani took control of the capital, but Mr Dostum also demanded power, since his defection as Mr Najibullah's general triggered the government's demise. But Mr Hekmatyar, with huge caches of US-made weaponry, has insisted on a share of power.</p>

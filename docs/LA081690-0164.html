			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ALATORRE RECALL DRIVE ANNOUNCED BY CRITICS  </P> <P> A group of East Los Angeles residents have begun a petition drive to recall  Councilman Richard Alatorre, claiming that he has brought too much development  to the community -- especially an overabundance of low- and moderate-cost  housing projects.  </P> <P> The Committee to Recall Richard Alatorre has 120 days to collect 9,484  signatures of registered voters living in Alatorre's 14th District in order to  force a recall election, according to the city clerk's office.  </P> <P> Alatorre suggested that those leading the recall attempt may have political  aspirations. "Look, you're always going to have people who are not going to be  happy, who have their own political agenda," Alatorre said.  </P> <P> If the recall drive qualifies for the ballot, the timetable would require a  special election between Feb. 26 and March 28, 1991, shortly before the regular  April city election in which seven council seats -- including Alatorre's --  will be contested.  </P></p>

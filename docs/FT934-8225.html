			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Czechs attract lower investment DIRECT foreign investment in the Czech Republic has slowed this year with only Dollars 455m (Pounds 305m) invested in the first nine months, compared with Dollars 600m in the same period last year, according to the Czech National Bank, Patrick Blum writes from Vienna. The results confirm fears in Prague that the level of investment could fall as a consequence of recession in the west and rising production costs in the Czech Republic. The government is concerned that rapidly rising wages are undermining the competitiveness of local companies and deterring investment. Direct foreign investment since 1990 is estimated at between Dollars 1.6bn and Dollars 2bn. Mr Karel Dyba, economy minister, said yesterday he expected the gross national product to grow by between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent this year, in spite of a decline in industrial production.</p>

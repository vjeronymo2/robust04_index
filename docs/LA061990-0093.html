			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VICTORY ISN'T SUDDEN FOR IRWIN;  </P> <P> BIRDIE ON 91ST HOLE WINS OPEN IN PLAYOFF  </P> <P> Hale Irwin said he had a dream a few weeks ago that he had won the U.S. Open.  </P> <P> "My wife can verify it," Irwin said Monday. "So dreams do come true."  </P> <P> It took a while, though, for his dream to become a reality as Irwin and Mike  Donald were still tied after an 18-hole playoff.  </P> <P> Then, on the first sudden-death hole, the par-four, 385-yard No. 1, Irwin sank  a 10-foot birdie putt to win.  </P> <P> At age 45, he became the oldest player to win the U.S. Open. He also won the  Open in 1974 and 1979.  </P> <P> This victory did not come easily.  </P> <P> Irwin was two shots behind Donald after 15 holes and didn't narrow the gap  until he birdied the par-four, 424-yard 16th hole, regarded as the most  difficult on the course.  </P> <P> Donald, 34, still had a one-stroke lead going to the 18th hole, but he hooked  his tee shot into the trees. His second shot found a greenside bunker and he  was 15 feet short of the cup on his sand shot.  </P> <P> He two-putted from there for a bogey, and Irwin two-putted from 25 feet for a  par.  </P> <P> So, for the first time since the U.S. Open adopted an 18-hole playoff formula,  there was sudden death.  </P> <P> Other tour events, including the Masters, have a sudden-death format after the  regulation 72 holes.  </P> <P> "I must admit that you never know that you'll have the opportunity again,"  Irwin said of his victory. "You hope to, and down inside I thought I would have  the opportunity, but having it and doing it are two separate events.  </P> <P> "And, for a while, it looked like it would just be an opportunity. I was  quickly digging myself into a deep hole, and Mike was playing the kind of golf  that I would have tried to play had I been one or two strokes up.  </P> <P> "It was not a great round of golf for either one of us. I think both of us felt  that it would go right down to the wire."  </P> <P> Irwin and Donald, playing in only his fourth U.S. Open after missing the cut in  two of them, each shot two-over-par 74s for 18 holes.  </P> <P> It wasn't a memorable round in that respect, but a grinding, intense one with  the swirling winds at Medinah making club selection difficult, especially on  the par-three holes over Lake Kadijah.  </P> <P> Donald had birdied the playoff hole three consecutive times: Saturday, Sunday  and then earlier Monday.  </P> <P> "I had a suspicion that someone would birdie that hole," Donald said when they  began the playoff.  </P> <P> However, it wasn't him. He said he didn't quite catch a sand wedge from 118  yards on the fairway and his shot stopped 30 feet from the cup. He then putted  to within three feet, opening the door for Irwin to end the match with his  birdie putt.  </P> <P> "I don't remember even hitting the putt," Irwin said, "but just saw it go into  the hole."  </P> <P> Irwin was, of course, elated, but he didn't charge around the green,  high-fiving spectators and blowing kisses as he did when he made a 45-foot putt  Sunday on the 18th green to get into the playoff.  </P> <P> He did, however, hug his wife, Sally, and daughter, Becky.  </P> <P> Obviously, the birdie putt on the playoff hole was the clincher. But his most  important shot probably came on the 16th hole.  </P> <P> He said he was 207 yards from the pin and he hit a two-iron, hooking it around  trees with the ball landing eight feet from the cup.  </P> <P> Irwin made his birdie putt, Donald got his par, but his lead was cut to one  shot.  </P> <P> Each player parred the par-three 17th hole, and then Donald bogeyed the 18th  hole, setting up a playoff.  </P> <P> Irwin was in the Open on a special exemption. Open winners have a 10-year  exemption and his had expired.  </P> <P> Others who have had special exemptions have never won the Open. Ben Hogan made  the best showing in 1966 by finishing 12th.  </P> <P> Irwin said he had trouble sleeping Sunday night, but didn't knock the 18-hole  playoff format, saying that it suits a major championship.  </P> <P> He also had some kind words for his less-experienced opponent. Donald has won  one tour event in 11 years.  </P> <P> "I always thought that Mike Donald could play, but more important, he has  proved it to himself," Irwin said. "I don't generally feel sorry for an  opponent, but my heart goes out to him because I know how important it was to  him.  </P> <P> "If there was a way to share in this championship, I would always hope that  Mike would be known as one who was very game and gave it a good effort.  </P> <P> "But he'll be back. He has got some good experience now and that bogey at the  last hole, as shattering as it may be, if construed correctly, will be a very  positive learning experience."  </P> <P> Donald shot a 64 in the opening round of the Masters in April and then had an  82 the second day to shoot himself out of the tournament.  </P> <P> He said that his game really wasn't good enough to compete on that level, but  he has worked to improve on it.  </P> <P> "I believe I have moved to another level," Donald said. "I hope to go on  playing good golf. However, nobody remembers who finished second."  </P> <P> Donald said that Irwin's experience of playing in 21 Opens helped him.  </P> <P> "After the 11th hole, he was getting pretty frustrated, but he held himself  together," Donald said.  </P> <P> Then, on the par-four, 462-yard 12th hole, Irwin pulled his drive into the deep  rough. He had a narrow opening through the trees to the green and he pitched up  short. But he scrambled for a bogey when the outcome could have been much  worse.  </P> <P> Irwin was still two strokes behind at the 14th hole, where they both got  birdies.  </P> <P> "There was pressure on Hale," Donald said. "If he doesn't make that birdie putt  (from six feet), I would be up by three strokes."  </P> <P> "Up to that time, I wasn't concentrating," Irwin said. "I was concerned with  other things, like what Mike is going to hit. But then I began to focus on what  I had to do."  </P> <P> Irwin said he never believed that his age was detrimental to his ability as a  player.  </P> <P> "I've always felt about myself that tenacity was something I had, that  never-give-up attitude," Irwin said. "That would apply to most things I try to  do. You can call it guts, you can call it experience, you can call it a number  of things.  </P> <P> "I've never abandoned my beliefs. They may have been set aside, or temporarily  misplaced, but they've always been there."  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Winner Hale Irwin earned $220,000. He has earned $391,694 this year, the best  earnings year of his career. He improved his playoff record to 4-4. . . .  Irwin's last previous tour victory came in the the Memorial Tournament in 1985.  . . . Mike Donald was 11 years old when Irwin played in his first U.S. Open in  1966. . . . There have been 28 previous playoffs in the U.S. Open starting in  1901.  </P> <P> TOP SEVEN U.S. OPEN FINISHERS  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.77IN:2.00IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.45IN:1.67IN:1.67IN" WDM="ABS"

			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris up 1.7% on interest rate hopes, Frankfurt falls IN MOST cases, bourses approached the weekend with equanimity. Frankfurt's worries about what could happen in Russia may have reflected the precariousness of trading positions taken on Monday and Tuesday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS rose in expectation of an imminent cut in interest rates after the authorities eased the overnight rate. On the first day of the new account the CAC-40 index added 35.07 or 1.7 per cent to 2,092.60, slightly lower on the week. Turnover was strong at FFr4.5bn. Lafarge Coppee rose steadily in early trading to an intraday high of FFr411.90 on overnight news that a German group had emerged as bidder for CBR, the Belgian cement manufacturer. However, the shares later came off to close FFr1.70 higher at FFr407.70. Credit Lyonnais CI's rose FFr60, or 9.2 per cent, to FFr715 on better than expected first-half results and the forecast of an improvement in the second half. The bank also said that it would not be in a position to consider privatisation for at least two years. St Gobain slipped FFr5 to FFr546 after reporting that VW, the German vehicle manufacturer, had asked for price cuts of up to 15 per cent for supplies of car windows. FRANKFURT fell as traders squared positions ahead of the weekend, the DAX index falling 30.65, or 1.6 per cent on the day to 1,885.86, but closing a fraction higher on the week. Turnover fell from DM6.4bn to DM5.2bn. Causes of uncertainty included a higher than expected inflation rate from the state of Baden-Wurttemberg, and the position of the Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin. However, later in the day there were contra-indications on inflation from North Rhine-Westphalia which showed a year-on-year rise of 3.8 per cent, down from August's 4.0 per cent. After hours, the Ibis indicated DAX index improved a little to close at 1,890.42. Cyclicals hit particularly hard yesterday included Daimler, Metallgesellschaft, and Preussag, down DM18.00 to DM732.00, DM11.00 to DM345.00 and DM13.50 to DM395.00. Among the few winners, Heidelberger Zement celebrated its bid for CBR of Belgium, coming back from suspension DM55 higher at DM1,145; and Lufthansa lost just 40 pfg to DM152.50 on reports from Washington that the US and Germany had reached a tentative air traffic pact. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index finished off 0.3 at 123.8, little changed on the week. Akzo dipped Fl 1.20 to Fl 168.70 on local press reports that its textiles division might announce a loss when the group announces third-quarter results next month. Merrill Lynch this week noted that Akzo's longer-term prospects remain good helped by aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring measures adopted by the management. The brokers concluded that the share price should respond well to economic recovery when it comes and forecast earnings of Fl 35 per share 'near the peak of the recovery cycle'. ZURICH saw strong foreign demand for chemicals issues as the SMI index rose 20.1 to 2,445.9 for a 2.6 per cent gain on the week. Roche certificates, continuing to benefit from analysts' buy recommendations, rose SFr155 or 3 per cent to SFr3,505. Sandoz followed the lead, rising SFr20 to SFr3,455. MILAN was worried about forthcoming results and the Comit index shed 6.29 to 586.51 in quiet trading, a weekly fall of 1.6 per cent. Olivetti, expected to announce a big loss after the market closed, shed L16 to L1,930. With half-yearly figures due in the coming week, Fiat fell L85 to L5,850 and Benetton L35 to L23,582. Bucking the trend, BCI put on L67 at L4,895. Generali, the insurer, gave up an early gain to finish L180 lower at L39,420 in response to Thursday's announcement of a fall in first-half pre-tax profits but a 14 per cent increase in premium income. However, Mr Simon Rudolph of Morgan Stanley in London described the results as encouraging, noting that last year's pre-tax figures had been inflated by net realised capital gains. ISTANBUL finally broke through the 15,000 barrier with the composite index rising 160.1 to 15,046.7, a 4 per cent gain on the week. Turnover was TL1,400bn after Thursday's record TL1,800bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- September 24                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open       10.30       11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1276.43     1275.13     1275.70     1275.96 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1347.89     1348.44     1348.01     1346.76  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1274.08     1274.09     1274.43     1274.95 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1345.98     1343.72     1344.34     1346.86  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Sep 23    Sep 22    Sep 21    Sep 20    Sep 17  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1273.84   1271.99   1279.55   1278.06   1265.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1347.03   1346.05   1351.37   1351.78   1343.60  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1277.20; 200 - 1348.43 Low/day: 100 - 1271.89  200 - 1342.50.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

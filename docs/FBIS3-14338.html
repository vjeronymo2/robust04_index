The formula explains the task of the Palestinians  police force and the international observers in the city of  Hebron.    In a statement to MENA today, the Palestinian source pointed  out that differences persist on certain sensitive points related  to the security authority in Hebron and the role of  international observers in establishing and maintaining security  in the city.    The source added that these disputed points, the number of  Palestinian policemen and international observers, have been  referred to the Palestinian and Israeli leadership for  consideration and consultation.    The Palestinian source noted that if an agreement is reached  on these disputed issues, negotiations will resume in Cairo on  Tuesday.    The Palestinian side is requesting that the Palestinian  police force and international observers include 1,000 men each.  The Israeli side is absolutely opposed to this number.</p>

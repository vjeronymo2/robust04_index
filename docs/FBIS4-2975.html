			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, April 14 (XINHUA) -- The Government of  Hong Kong sent 117 Vietnamese boat people back home today, under  the voluntary repatriation program of the United Nations High  Commissioner for Refugees, despite a series of riots being  continued at local detention centers.    The Vietnamese sent back home today included 51 men, 29  women, 22 boys and 15 girls.    This brought to 3,425 the total number of Vietnamese  migrants  who had returned voluntarily this year, and to 42,038 the total  number of returnees since the program started in March 1989.    Vietnamese boat people in the detention centers on the  territory staged one after another rounds of demonstrations and  hunger strikes since the multi-national meeting held in Geneva  in February this year passed a proposal on the Vietnamese  repatriation.    In a conflict at Whitehead Detention Center between Hong  Kong  police and camp prisoners last week, over 200 Vietnamese were  hurt. A total of 557 canisters of tear-gas were reportedly fired  at the detention center.</p>

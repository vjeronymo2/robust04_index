			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANDATORY STATE QUAKE INSURANCE  </P> <P> So, Gov. George Deukmejian and the gang have decided that earthquake insurance  is such a good idea that they have the right to force every homeowner to buy  some whether he wants it or not.  </P> <P> I have a few questions, though.  </P> <P> Where does the government get the power to force people to insure their private  property? Why does the government think it is proper to engage in a business  that is best handled by private enterprise? Why is it proper for the government  to seize a person's property because he refuses to insure it? When did we, the  people, decide that government should do our thinking for us?  </P> <P> Thanks, Gov. Deukmejian. You have convinced me to vote Libertarian.  </P> <P> BROCK BACKLUND  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

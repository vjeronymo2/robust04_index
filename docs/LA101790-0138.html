			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> PARKS PROPOSITION ENDORSED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> The city is supporting a statewide bond measure on the Nov. 6 ballot that aims  to improve parks, wildlife areas and recreation facilities.  </P> <P> The City Council this week voted to endorse Proposition 149, which would  provide $437 million in bond financing to acquire and develop parkland and  rehabilitate recreational facilities.  </P> <P> City officials last year heavily lobbied legislators to qualify the ballot  measure, which is "tailor-made for our city," Deputy City Administrator Richard  Barnard said.  </P> <P> The measure, if approved, would make the city a likely candidate to obtain  millions of dollars in grants to help fund an array of projects, including  reconstruction of the Huntington Beach pier, Barnard said.  </P> <P> The measure would distribute $70 million among cities based on population, of  which Huntington Beach would receive about $284,000. That money, however, would  likely be "a drop in the bucket" compared to grants the city might receive from  a separate slice of the bond proceeds set aside for projects based on merit,  Barnard said.  </P> <P> In addition to the pier project, the bond may help the city pay for a plaza and  expanded International Surfing Museum proposed at the foot of the new pier, the  Linear Park planned to encircle the Bolsa Chica wetlands and two seaside bluff  restoration projects, Barnard said.  </P> <P> Additionally, the measure would earmark money specifically for ecological  educational facilities, which the city is considering establishing at various  wetlands sites, the Linear Park and the new pier, he said.  </P> <P> The city may also be eligible for grants to help improve the Shipley Nature  Center and hiking and equestrian trails in Huntington Central Park, Barnard  said.
